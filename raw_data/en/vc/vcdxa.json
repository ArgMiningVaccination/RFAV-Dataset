The matter draws in the field of mental health ca re and is the subject of regular mass media cover- age, with enormous public interest in high-prof ile cases (as the Anna Lindh case in Sweden has recently shown). The handling of mentally ill offender s by a criminal justice systems is an indicator of the ability of a society to balance public safety interests with the achievements of modern psy- chiatry and of its ability to incorporate basic hum an rights principles into penal and mental health practice. Central societal or human values are involved in judicial and detention procedures concerning per- sons who have committed a crime and been found to suffe r from a mental disorder. Many of these values are to a certain degree contradictory, rather than complementary. In order to address and regulate these complex problems on a legal level, a detailed body of rules and regulations is re- quired. To provide such legal frameworks for regulating the numerous aspects of detaining and treating mentally ill offenders is a major and c onstant challenge for all European Union Member States, as it is for any other country. Mor eover, acts and codes need to be updated regularly to take account of new achievements in forensic ps ychiatry and the constant evolution of mental health care systems. Although this field is almost permanently on the public and political agenda, there is a surprising shortage of basic information and evidence about t he major characteristics of the legal approaches and their effectiveness. Most national health or j udicial reporting systems provide only rudimentary estimates (e.g., on the number of court trials of m entally ill offenders, forensic service bed provision or major characteristics of the clientele). Cross-border comparisons and the identification of good models of provision or practice are greatly hindered in consequence. Internationally agreed or standardised indicators are non-existent. The exact costs of judicial procedures or of fo rensic care are generally unknown, but there is no doubt that the size of the probl em imposes a heavy burden on modern societies, affecting to vary- ing degrees the criminal justice system, as well as the mental health care system and the prison system. Without even the most basic inform ation it is impossible to quantif y the financial losses arising out of ineffective judicial or care concepts, or to start a debate on models of best practice. Moreover, even among experts, there is no common agreement as to the nature and role of foren- sic psychiatry, nor how appropriately to integrate the care of mentally ill offenders into general men- tal health care provision. There are debates as to whether community-based mental health care, which is a widely accepted approach in general psychiatry in Europe, might incorporate as an undercurrent a tendency to ne- glect the difficult to treat, i.e., violent or aggr essive patients, who then consume the resources of forensic psychiatry, which has to face increasing numbers of referrals of non-compliant and violent severely mentally ill patients (Schanda, 1999). Some experts point out in general mental health care providers a limited knowledge of risk assessm ent and an underestimation of the future violent or criminal behaviour of schizophrenic patient s ( M\u00fcller-Isberner & Hodgins, 2000), although the proportion of violent or non-compliant patients wi th severe mental disorders and co-morbid sub- stance abuse is constantly rising (R\u00f6der Wanner & Priebe, 1998; Kovasznay, 1991). As a result, a growth in the number of forensic patients is reported in some European countries (Kramp, 2003), and overcrowded forensic hospita ls are a common phenomenon (M\u00fcller-Isberner & Hodgins, 2000). Introd uction 7 The limited integration and unclear position of for ensic psychiatry may be due to its specific two- headed role to do justice to the individual needs of mentally disordered offenders on the one hand and to meet the expectations of the soci ety and guarantee public safety on the other. It is obvious that providing adequat e treatment and reintegration into society of patients who are doubly stigmatised (as being offenders and being ment ally ill) requires good services, sophisticated treatments, appropriate training and high quality standar ds, which is a long way from the reality of the position in many European Union Member States. In the past, there has been only limited internati onal research conducted on the various complex and interdependent issues and systems for the plac ement and treatment of mentally disordered offenders (Blaauw et al., 2002). An internationally standardised description and systematic analysis of legal instruments regulating the disposal of mentally diso rdered offenders and the different pathways into the various penal and heal th care systems is overdue. In recognising this gap, the European Commission has recently increased its efforts to provide a basic overview of the current situation in the European Union Member States. This study which has been funded by the Health and Consumer Protecti on Directorate General of the European Com- mission is part of this effort. Scope of this Study In the complex field sketched above, this study tr ies to provide a structured description and cross- boundary comparison of legal frameworks underlying key concepts assessment, court and discharge procedures routine practices in placing and treating mentally ill offenders human rights and patients' rights forensic service provision outcome of legal procedures and forensic care (epidemiology) in the fifteen Member States of the European Un ion before the extension in May 2004 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Nether- lands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom). All background information was gathered in a survey of experts from all included Member States. It relies to a large extent on administrative data as prov ided by national Ministries of Health or Justice or various other national authorities, to keep a nationwide focus. Research data was only used when no other sources were available. This report starts with a general overview of the field. This is followed by a structured comparison of the above mentioned issues (result s of the survey), which makes extensive use of flow charts, tables and figures. Any inevitable simplification in t he comparative section is compens ated for by a section providing a separate chapter for each Member State, detailing and describing the specific situation and specific circumstances for each country separately. The balance between public safety interests and t he protection of individual rights is such a sensitive matter that can only be outlined in very general terms. In English-speaking, German and Scandinavian countries, it is broadly perceived as a formal process which requires a very detailed legal framework under the supervision of the judicial authority. In Latin countries health care pro- fessionals tend to be given more discretionary powers, according to the parens patriae principle, by establishing some general principles of guarant orship and assessing retrospectively how these powers were used. Introd uction 8 The report concludes with a section summarisi ng the major findings and drawing conclusions relevant to a future European harmonisation in this field. This section may also be used as an ex- ecutive summary. The approach of this study and the choice of t opics may be considered selective, but this is inevitable, given the complexity of the issues and problems concerned. Limited time and resources determi ned that the study rely complete ly on contributions from the Member States and the collaborating experts. As such, the results reflect the quality of data as currently provided by official s ources throughout the European Union. Although trying to harmonise items and data as well as possible, it must be acknowledged that all tables, figures and overviews in this study are at risk of comparing data that is not entirely equiva- lent. This reflects the general problem of the abs ence of European definitions or standardisations in the field and is the main reason why such over views have rarely been attempted in the past. Nevertheless, the authors believe that any inconsist encies in the results are more than offset by the comprehensiveness of the information provided here and the chance to draw conclusions as to the current state of judicial procedures and forensic care for mentally disordered offenders in fifteen European Union Member States.

Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health 9, 199-204 Introd uction - Fore nsic Psychiatry 9 Forensic Psy chiatry In some, but not all western industrialised count ries, forensic psychiat ry today has been estab- lished as a professional specialty within psychi atry. The philosophical and theoretical foundations of forensic psychiatry can be traced back to the Greek and Roman writings of antiquity, but it was not until the 20th century that the forensic field developed into a specific discipline in itself. However, the idea that a mentally ill offender s hould not be punished because of a lack of criminal responsibility seems to have been a standard doctri ne in European countries for a long time. In early times, it was common practice to acquit m entally disordered or ill persons of having violated the law rather than confining them to mental hospi tals. This resulted in high recidivism rates of mentally ill offenders (Rylander, 1961). During the 18th century, mentally ill offenders often were placed together with the non-criminal men- tally ill in asylums or workhouses, only some of which provided hospital services. Legal reforms during the second half of the 19th century gradually permitted the compulsory admis- sion of mentally ill offenders to psychiatric hospita ls for an indefinite period (Slater, 1954). As a part of the expansion of mental hospitals during the 19th century all over Europe, some places offered early examples of what could be characterised as specialised services for mentally ill or disordered offenders. Developments in the United Kingdom may illustrate this. Early in the 19th century, after a mentally ill person had tried to assassinate King George III, Parliament passed a statute aiming at the safe custody of insane persons charged with offences . In 1815, a hospital opened that provided special- ised wards for \"criminal lunatics\" (Gunn & Taylor, 1999). The Home Secretary was responsible for its supervision and for taking care that the new for ensic facilities were secu re and strictly separated from general psychiatric wards. These ancient forensic wards in the UK quickly suffered from overcrowding and new secure units had to be built, so that services for \"criminal lunatics\" very soon encount ered the side-effects of segregation and specialisation that still challenge m odern forensic psychiat ry (Allderige, 1979). Even today, it is still a matter of debate amongst experts as to whether forensic psychiatric services should be integrated into general psychiatric hospitals or separated into secure facilities of their own. Whereas large secure hospitals may be advant ageous in that they can provide a variety of specialised treatment programmes and in that they probably offer better safety for the public, they also may serve as an example of what Erving Goffm an has labelled the \"total institution\". Accord- ing to this concept, a total institution is c haracterised by a basic split between large managed groups, conveniently known as \"inmat es\", and a small supervisory sta ff. Inmates typically live in the institution and their contacts wi th the world outside the walls ar e severely restricted (Goffman, 1961). While in the first half of the 20th century there was no basic change in psychiatric treatment ap- proaches, new anti-psychotic and antidepressant drugs were developed and became available during the 1950s and '60s. As a consequence of thes e new opportunities for treating the mentally ill, community-based mental health care devel oped and the number of psychiatric hospital beds declined substantially. However, the major psychiatric reforms that have changed the face of mental health care pro- foundly in most industrialised countries during the last few decades by-passed forensic care, where large security hospitals still dominate. A scientific evaluation of forensic hospitals from the 1980s still concluded: \"Today, treatment programmes in se cure psychiatric institutions are noteworthy Introduction - Forensic Psyc hiatry 10 primarily by their absence, poor implementation, unevaluated status , lack of conceptual sophistica- tion and incomplete description and documentation\" (Quinsey, 1988). Nevertheless, forensic psychiatry is able to pr ovide treatment programmes that are effective both for the improvement or recovery of the mental state of the person concerned and his reintegration into society, as well as for the enhancement of pub lic safety. There is no scientific evidence that psychiatric treatment and the require ment for secure conditions are incompatible. On the contrary, effective psychiatric and forensic treatment requi res that both staff and patients feel secure. Nevertheless, many components of psychiatric treatment that hav e been shown to be effective for mentally disordered patients must be modified before being applied to patients who have broken the law. Caring for the latter requires simultaneous consideration of: a) the needs for treatment resulting from s pecific elements of the mental disorder, and b) the needs for treatment with respect to factors promoting criminal behaviour. To this end, treatment programmes developed in the framework of general psychiatry have been adapted to reduce criminal and violent behaviour, which is a specific aim of correctional treatment programmes. Additionally, conceptual models concerning the Psychology of Criminal Conduct (PCC) have been developed to gain an understanding of underlying mec hanisms. These models are used to evalu- ate correctional treatment progr ammes (Andrews & Bonta, 1998). Growing theoretical and empirical research such as this has promoted forensic psychiatry to a pro- fessional specialty in a few countries. In the US, forensic psychiatry became an independent sec- tion as early as 1934 (Bluglass, 2000). But cont rary to an increasing awareness by general psy- chiatrists of the specific requirements for treating mentally disordered offender s, forensic psychiatry in many western countries still does not have t he status of an independent speciality. Formalised professional training is often lacking, so that so me experts consider the empirical foundation for treating mentally disordered offenders st ill to be in its infancy (Hodgins, 2000). Thus, there is a need for extended research in the fi eld as well as for a consensual basic definition of forensic psychiatry, which mi ght be characterised as a sub-spec iality of general psychiatry that applies scientific and clinical expertise to legal i ssues embracing civil, criminal, correctional and legislative matters (Rosner, 1998). Mental health professionals providing care to per sons presenting both mental disorders and a his- tory of criminal offending should be competent in the following areas (Gunn & Taylor, 1993): the assessment of mentally ill offenders, the preparation of written reports for the courts, expert testimony in court, the treatment of chronic diso rders that lead to behavioural problems (especially chronic psychoses and personality disorders), and the knowledge of mental health law. During the past decade, the focus in forensic psychi atry has shifted from the concept of responsibil- ity towards the concept of dangerousness (Barras & Bernheim, 1990). Thus, the evaluation of fu- ture risks of recidivism has become a central issue, supporting the dev elopment of standardised risk assessments (Webster et al., 1995). Although resear ch is still in its early stages, there is al- ready some evidence that conditional release progr ammes for mentally disordered acquittals might be effective in reducing dangerous behaviour. Condi tional release and monitored community treat- ment programmes seem to be promising approac hes to balancing public safety interests and individual rights (Bloom & Wilson, 2000). Accordi ng to several meta-analyses, therapeutic interven- tion programmes are positively correlated to decreas ing criminal recidivism among the mentally ill. Effect sizes of certain appropriate treatment pr ogrammes were as great as 50% (L\u00f6sel, 1995; An- drews et al., 1990). According to these analyses, effective treatm ent programmes may be characterised as being highly structured, cognitive-behaviourally or ientated and multi-modal. Community-based pro- Introduction - Forensic Psyc hiatry 11 grammes offering assertive forensic treatment al so proved to be effective in symptom reduction and crime prevention (Bloom et al., 1991; M\u00fcller-Isberner & Hodgins, 2000). These findings seem to support a new enthusia sm for therapeutic approaches that are based on empirical research. They are likely to render forens ic care a therapeutically orientated sub-specialty of psychiatry that focuses bot h on rehabilitation and long-term community care as well as on the provision of inpatient care in high security facilities. If risk assessment procedures turn out to be effect ive in routine care, prevention might become an additional central mission for forensic mental health care in the future (Mullen & Lindqvist, 2000).

However, large sections of the general public are unaware of this fact and there is a widespread misconception that thos e with mental disorders or illnesses are a danger to other peo- ple. This persistent prejudice is a major source of the stigma attached to the mentally ill who are seen as being potentially dangerous people for whom detention seems a most appropriate meas- ure. Therefore, in order to do justice to the mentally ill, the issue requires more thorough and de- tailed exploration than it generally receives. In principle, three principal research approac hes can be adopted to explore the association be- tween mental disorders and violent or cr iminal behaviour (Eronen et al., 1998): analyse the prevalence of violent behaviour among mentally disordered persons who are integrated into the mental health care system and/or receive treatment, determine the prevalence of mental disor ders among persons who have committed violent acts and thus come into contact wi th the criminal justice system, conduct epidemiological studies to explore the prevalence of both psychiatric disorders and violent behaviour among the general population (t hus covering both those persons who are in contact with the mental health care or t he legal justice system and those who are not). Some studies that have adopted the first approach es timate the risk that violent acts will be com- mitted by schizophrenic patients as up to seven ti mes greater than that for persons not diagnosed with a mental disorder, as was found in Norther n Finland (e.g., Tiihonen et al., 1997). Other studies (e.g., Wessely et al., 1994) identified male patient s with schizophrenia as 3.8 times more likely to acquire a criminal record than persons suffering from non-psychotic mental disorders. There are other findings, for which Eronen et al. (1998) or Angermeyer & Schulze (1998) have provided a more detailed overview. A higher prevalence of severe mental illness or psychosis also is reported from findings among offenders (second approach). A study from the mi d-eighties analysing homicides and cases of manslaughter from a 25-year peri od identified 20% of male and 44% of female offenders as suffer- ing from a psychosis (Gottlieb et al., 1987). Sim ilarly, 53% of people found guilty of homicide or manslaughter in Northern Sweden had a lifetime diagnosis of a severe mental disorder (Lindquist & Allebeck, 1990). Co-morbidity of addiction disorders or substance abuse appears common (Gottlieb et al., 1987; Lindquist, 1986; C\u00f4te & Hodgins, 1992). Comparisons between randomly sampled male prison inmates and general population samples resulted in an up to two to three times greater prevalence of schizophrenia and major affective disorders in the prison sample (Teplin, 1994). In a more recent study, Steadman and co-workers (1998) determined the prevalence of community viol ence in a sample of patients discharged from acute psychiatric treatment during the twelve month period subsequent to discharge and compared it to the violent behaviour of residents from the same neighbourhood. Data was assessed from patient self-reports, reports from collateral info rmants or police, and from hospital records. Sub- stance abuse symptoms turned out to be the most important risk factor, raising significantly the rate of violence in both patients and controls. Howeve r, substance abuse symptoms were found more frequently in patients than in persons from the community sample. When substance abuse played no role, the rate of violent behaviour was simila r in both samples. The authors concluded that dis- charged mentally ill persons do not form a homogenous group regarding violent behaviour, thus specific disorders have to be considered. Introd uction - Mental Disorder and Crimina l Behaviour 13 Results from other epidemiological studies have pr oduced similar findings indicating that psychiat- ric patients have a two or three times greater pr evalence of violent behavi our than community resi- dents who had never been in contact with the mental health care system (e.g., Link et al., 1992). The probability of having committed a violent act mi ght be ten times greater in substance abusers (Swanson et al., 1990). Although more specific analyses are needed, findings like these - although not consistent in rates or figures - do contribute empirical evidence to a century-long but controversial debate on the rela- tionship between mental disorder and violent or criminal behaviour (e.g., Raine, 1993). Current research agrees that interdependencies are comple x. Three major and divergent hypotheses might be formulated for explaining a possible link: Violent or criminal behaviour is a direct sympto m of a mental disorder (causal hypothesis). Violent or criminal behaviour is one of severa l consequences of a mental disorder, as the disorder may affect cognitive or other m ental capacities and support social deviant behav- iour (intermediated a ssociation hypothesis). Violent or criminal behaviour and m ental disorder are independent phenomena (non- linkage hypothesis). It is not difficult to find arguments or data in support of each of the above-mentioned hypotheses. So the scientific discussion of how criminal behaviour and mental disorders are linked is far from being decided. The debate suffers from unclear definit ions of the concepts of violent or criminal behaviour, which from time to time are even used as synonyms. Other methodological problems may also contribute to biased study results. However, the scientific community currently favours the hypothesis of an intermediated association between the two phenomena. A closer look into the va rious sub-types of mental disorders supports this assumption. People suffering from organic mental disorders pos e no increased risk for criminality compared to the general population (B\u00f6ker & H\u00e4fner, 1973), although aggressive and impulsive behaviour is connected to certain types of brain damage (Nedopil, 2000). Substance abuse seems to be a most significant risk factor for offending behaviour. Apart from that, persons with paranoid schizophrenia or some ty pes of personality disorders are at greater risk of offending (Hart, 1997; Hare, 1990; Webster et al ., 1994). The same applies to certain types of affective disorders (Modestin et al., 1997). For most other mental disorders or illnesses, no increased risk of violence or higher rate of offend- ing can be confirmed, although self-destructive or suicidal behaviour - which could be categorised as violent although not being offending - is associat ed with most depressive disorders to an alarm- ing degree. Against all evidence of a positive correlation bet ween certain mental disorders and criminal behav- iour, it should be kept in mind that the contribution by mentally ill per sons to overall levels of crimi- nality is rather small - much lower t han those of many other social groups. Thus, there is a strong need to distinguish clearly when analysing or discussing the issue - for the public as well as for professionals, decision-make rs or anyone else involved in criminal proceed- ings against mentally ill people.

Psychological Medicine 24, 483-502 Introd uction - Criminal Resp onsibi lity 15 Criminal Responsibility The idea that offenders suffering from a mental disorder must primarily be considered as ill and should therefore be exempted from punishment is of considerable antiquity, dating back to ancient Greek and Roman sources. It is grounded in the concept that human beings have free will and are able to differentiate and choose intentionally between ri ght and wrong or good and evil. According to this concept, a person who commits a crime has chosen to transgress the law and is therefore subject to a punishment. The philosophica l basis of this concept might be labelled as non-deterministic. However, a mental disorder ma y impair an individual's ability to differentiate between right and wrong and seriously affect their fr ee will. Moral categories or any judgement of guilt are not strictly applicable in this case, which in turn diminishes the right or duty of society to take punitive sanctions against a person who has been affected by such a state, for having commit- ted a crime. Many societies have adopted the concept of \"criminal responsibility\" to describe these interde- pendencies. While \"criminal responsibility\" primarily stresses the judicial aspects of the problem, the term \"accountability\", which is often used sy nonymously, adds a medical connotation to it. Medical and judicial viewpoints delineate a major area of discussion which gives cause for reflec- tion upon the specific situation of mentally disordered offenders and the treatment of forensic cases. In the past, the complexity of the probl em fed an intensive scient ific and legal debate about how to define, specify and apply the concept of crim inal behaviour in routine judicial and psychiatric practice. This debate is still continuing. Aristotle considered a person to be morally responsible who, in fu ll knowledge of the circumstances and consequences, deliberately chooses to commit a specific act wi thout being forced or coerced to do so by third parties. However, Aristotle opted also for reduced punishment for criminal behav- iour committed in extreme affective states. Historically, the concept of res ponsibility became fundamental for the view of man as an intentional and free being, and gained recognition as such in Rom an Law. Already at that time lunatics or mad people were considered to have no will of their own and therefore to be incapable of criminal intent. Today's fundamental forensic doctrine that offender s suffering from mental disorders are not eligi- ble for criminal punishment dates back to these early roots. In mediaeval times, the old Hippocratic concept of considering mentally abnormal states as ill- nesses gave way to the idea that these were signs or consequences of sinful behaviour on the part of the afflicted person. Expiat ion and penance were consequently intr oduced as basic principles to deal with mentally disordered people. During the 13th century, while working on the issue of insanity and its legal consequences, the Eng- lish writer on law, Henry de Bracton, developed the conc ept of \"mens rea\" to characterise a state of mind indicating culpability (Rosner, 1998). According to this concept, a person lacking \"mens rea\" is insane and does not have available a free will. No such person can be considered to be mo rally responsible and - as a consequence of this lack of responsibility - should be exempted from punishment. These are the origins and basic ideas behind the so-c alled insanity defence. \"Insanity tests\" were first performed by lawyers and philosophers long befor e mental health care or the development of forensic psychiatry as a medical discipline. The te rm \"insanity\" as used in this context was clearly seen as a judicial term with only minor medica l connotations, indicating a defendant's lack of ability to understand the nature of his criminal behaviour. Introd uction - Criminal Resp onsibi lity 16 The McNaughton Rules from 1843 are considered to be a cornerstone of the further development of the concept of criminal responsibility. In England during the 1830s, Daniel McNaughton stood trial for killing the secretary to Prime Minister R obert Peel at Downing Street, after being convinced that the Prime Minister was leadi ng a conspiracy to kill him. When during the trial it became evident that McNaughton was mentally dist urbed, the jury - rather unusually for that time - ordered him committed to a mental asylum rather than hanging an obviously ill person. The uproar over McNaughton's acquittal prompted the creation of t he McNaughton's Rules by the House of Lords: to establish a defence on the grounds of insanity, it must be clearly proved that. At the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouri ng under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to kinow the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong\". The assessment as established according to McNaughton\u00b4s Rules of whether a defendant knew about the wrongfulness of his action was also known as the \"right-wrong-test\" (Andoh, 1993). The purpose of the rules was to restrict the ci rcumstances in which an insanity defence could be used, rather than to facilitate the procedure. The rules are so strictly drawn that most floridly psy- chotic defendants do not fall within them. Medically, they largely restrict the defence to people with organic disorders. The insanity defence itself had been introduced much earlier into British law (Rylander, 1961; Andoh, 1993). The concepts incorporated into the McNaughton Rules have been criticised (e.g., Menzies, 2002; Smith, 1982; Ward, 2002) for their exclusive definition of accountab ility - which was considered as uncertain regarding the nature and quality of the act or ambiguous regarding the wrongness of the act (Andoh, 1993). Furthermore, the McNaughton Rules defined insanity as intellectual incapacity while excluding emotional and volitional aspects. Thus, the Rules may not cover the eventuality where an offender may be intellectually able to concei ve that society considers his act to be crimi- nal behaviour but at the same time may lack the pow er to prevent himself from committing the act. In 1953, a report of the British Royal Commissi on on Capital Punishment therefore proposed an amendment to the Mc Naughton's rules, adding to t hem an \"irresistible impulse test\". The Royal Commission also specified the term \"wrongfulne ss\", under which the persons concerned are not held responsible for their actions, to include: illegality standards (applicable to defendants lacking the capacity to know or appreciate that their acts violated the law), subjective m oral standards (applicable to persons suffering from a disease of the mind that results in their belief that they were mora lly justified to carry out their actions), objective m oral standards (applicable to persons lacking the capacity to understand that society considers their actions to be morally wrong). In the event, the law was changed by the Homici de Act of 1957, which introduced the concept of diminished responsibility into English law, the standar d for which is very low within the Act. This enabled the substitution of a manslaughter conviction for a murder conviction in cases of mental illness (non-psychotic as well as psychotic), so allowing a range of possible disposal options. The concept of degrees of criminal re sponsibility is limited in the United Kingdom to cases of homicide. The Old Germanic Law as well as the Ancient Laws of Ireland or the Ancient Dutch Law are re- ported to already have included certai n features of the concept of reduced criminal responsibility for criminal acts, and thus reduced punishment (Zeeger s, 1981). Scientists and legal experts from continental Europe have also contributed to this debate. Far from being exhaustive, the following overview gives a general impression of some of the major and often controversial positions. Influential contributions came from Italy and were made by Beccaria (1738-1794) and Lombrosso (1836-1909). Beccaria, the founder of the classical sc hool of criminology, considered criminal acts to be a result of free will and thus to require punishment or penal sanction (Ciccone & Ferracuti, 1995). In contrast, Lombroso (1876) as a representative of the posit ive school of criminology, iden- tified physical features assumed to be characteri stic for criminal males and discussed criminal be- haviour as deterministic. As a consequence of crimes resulting from genetic predisposition, offend- Introd uction - Criminal Resp onsibi lity 17 should be treated rather than punished. Howeve r, Lombroso's prognosis for achieving remis- sion of criminal behaviour was not optimistic. Rocco\u00b4s Penal Code, as incorporated into Italian law in 1931, could be seen as a compromise in- corporating the main features of both discrepant schools of crimi nology. Since the code went into effect, Italian courts have had to judge whether an offence was committed by free will (with pun- ishment as a consequence) or to evaluate the ext ent to which it was affected by pre-determined disposition (requiring treatment) (Ciccone & Ferracuti, 1995). At the end of the 19th century, German psychiatrist Kraepelin criticised the use of punishment as the sole available sanction since it neglects the individual disposition of an offender and the chance to treat certain kinds of misbehaviour (Ho ff, 1998). Kraepelin emphasised the consideration of pathological sources of delinquent behaviour, applying t he criteria for mentally ill patients also to offenders. Thus, acquittal from imprisonment should depend on psychopathological status. As a consequence, the responsibility for a discharge decisi on should be shifted from judges or courts to the psychiatrist. Convinced that recidivism or repeated delinquency was closely linked to a mental disorder, Kraepelin favoured the integration of the concept of diminished criminal responsibility into the Penal Code. However, there were also cont rary positions. Karl Wilmanns, another influential German psychiatrist of the time, argued that fo rensic and judicial practice would become unpre- dictable and unjust, were there to be a compromise between being either fully or completely lacking in criminal responsibility (Wilmanns, 1927). In the Netherlands, the first statute referring to criminal responsibility of varying degrees appeared in 1809, to be applied to cases of insanity, varyi ng madness, organic diseases affecting the mental state and to severe mental retardation (Zeegers, 1981). Punishment or acquittal would be decided on the basis of the degree of criminal responsibilit y. However, this progressive law has never been applied in practice (Zeegers, 1981), due to the Frenc h annexation of the Netherlands in 1810, after which French Penal Law stayed in effect in until Dutch Penal Law was initiated in 1886. Although the Dutch Penal Law does not explicitly mention diminished criminal responsibility, the concept was implicitly introduced into the Dutch j udicial context in 1928. From this time on, pun- ishment for mentally disordered offenders has been able to be combined with specific restrictive measures (\"Terbeschikkingstelling\") in the Netherlands (Zeegers, 1981). Modern neurobiological research in our day has re inforced the century-old debate on criminal re- sponsibility. Today, some experts even reject the concept that human beings dispose of a free will and consider findings from functional brain imagi ng or neuro-psychology to be supportive of this theory. Some conclude that human actions can only be deterministic (Libet, 1983). At least in Ger- many, the consequence has been a demand for a reform of the penal system (Roth, 2001; Singer, 2003). These positions more or less resemble Lombroso's or Kraepelin's medical models of delin- quency. As is always the case with extreme t heories, there are also many experts who argue strongly for a non-deterministic concept of human existence. Although far from being decided, time will tell how this philosophical debate can relate to the daily routine of dealing adequately with mentally disordered offenders. There is still a great need for pragmatic solutions that balance the needs of society and of the persons concerned. References Andoh B (1993) T he McNaughten Rules - T he stor y so far.

Each country's regulations on the treatment and placement of mentally disordered offenders incorporate these elements in a dynamic process, usually with a trend towards slow but continuous change. The purpose of th is chapter is to provide a general, at-a-glance framework of such background factors and underlying influences. Legal Systems and Traditions The principles and practices of each national legal system are deeply rooted in the history and the iden- tity of a country. The legal syst em can be seen as a means of repr esenting and preserving from rapid change different visions of the individual and of human relationships, even within politically homogenous areas like the European Union. Roman Law Roman law underpins most legal syst ems in continental Europe. From its origins in ancient Roman and Greco-Roman tradition, its current forms reflect the evolutions it experienced during the Middle Ages in Central Europe under the Holy Roman Empire and at the beginning of the Modern Era with the French Revolution. In their many different forms and varieties, what all Roman Law systems have in common is their pre- scriptive nature. Codes state what is an offenc e and what is not, and lay down procedures and punish- ments which must be applied by magistrates and judges with little discretionary power. Interpretation is limited, codes and doctrines are the sources of j udgement, and jurisprudence plays a minor role. A con- sequence of such systems is that processes of change in specific areas are very slow (taking decades or centuries) and that there is little flexibility in adapting legal outcomes to circumstances and individual situations. Roman Law systems can be quite different. German laws may be considered the prototype of Roman Law, while Mediterranean countries seem to have simp ler systems, with fewer options and wider discre- tionary powers accorded to judges in difficult cases. France, Belgium and Holland (nations with many legal aspects in common) seem to have more detailed laws, in which many exceptions are regulated for, as well as Scandinavian countries in whic h civil law seems to regulate more matters. With regards to mentally disordered offenders Ro man Law tends to emphasise the psychological ele- ment of an offence: the basic concept is responsibility, which in cases of insanity at the time of an of- fence is considered to be diminished or lacking. In other words, mentally disordered offenders are deemed not responsible in a similar manner to children and therefore avoid judicial sanction. Usually, for reasons of public safety, a security measure can be applied in case of persistent dangerousness. This is one of the reasons for the development of s eparate psychiatric forensic systems. Common Law Common Law is practised in all countries whose legal systems developed from the Anglo-Saxon. Its roots lie in the more informal way of managing ju stice adopted in the early Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms and it is much less prescriptive in nature. It has a pragmatic approach and emphasises behaviour rather than psychological elements. The judge has wider discretionary powers and the trial is aimed at ascertaining 1 The editors of this report would like to thank Angelo Fioritti, Ri mini, for writing down this chapter after a discussion amon g all ex- perts during a study-meeting, and Miguel Xavier, Lisbon, for his comments during the preparation of the manuscript. Introduction - Background Factor s and Underlying Influences 20 whether the offence was committed or not (verdict of guilt). Once the verdict has been reached, a deci- sion is taken as regards the sentence or disposal of the case, which in cases of mental illness entails a placement in hospital for treatment. Th is disposal is a pragmatic decision arising from issues of justice, equality, effectiveness and the right to psychiatric treatment. There is no concept of responsibility, but a series of empirical acts and decisions which are tak en in the best interests of the individual and of soci- ety. The implications of this system are that each case can be flexibly managed as to procedures and to placement, that changes are much more rapid, allo wing for radical reforms and different practice, based simply on the decisions of one or a few judges, when new needs are felt. The forensic psychiatry system can undergo more rapid development and change. It is readily understandable, given t he above, that procedures and practices may be very different in these systems and that concept s and terminology may vary. Health Care and Welfare Sy stems As with their legal systems, European countries have adopted very different welfare and health care systems, in which variations are particularly great where mental health care is concerned. Italy, the UK and most Scandinavian countries hav e adopted a radical public health approach and run National Health Services (NHS) with an objective of universal and comprehensive coverage . Under this approach, the UK has promoted a major reform, integr ating within the NHS all forensic psychiatric treatment facilities, leaving to the judicial system only the role of r eaching a verdict and of disposing of mentally ill cases by transferring them into the health care system. Most European countries run mixed sy stems, where some basic servic es are provided by the State and most services are provided on private or public in surance schemes. The development of the forensic psychiatric system is always a State task, but it c an be accomplished either by the Ministry of Justice or by the Ministry of Health. It is clear that, in these countries, integrati on with general psychiatric services can be more difficult given the different administr ative arrangements governing different sectors. All in all, there is considerable variation in regulat ions which determine the int egration of forensic psy- chiatry into the judicial or general health care syst ems of the respective country. These regulations may additionally be influenced by the overall philosophy or direction of national health policies (e.g., NHS or insurance based, see tab.1). General Psy chiatric Policy A broad consensus to move towards de-institutiona lisation has taken place across most of western Europe for more than 20 years. This change is st ill underway in Central and Eastern Europe. Despite this, the rate of change has varied markedly, and s upport service models vary substantially. For in- stance, a survey of European psychi atrists reported that community mental health services existed in fewer than half of localities in Spain, Portugal, Gr eece and Ireland, and only as pilot schemes in Eastern Europe (Goldberg, 1997). In the last two decades of the 20th century, there has been a debate between those who were in favour of the provision of ment al health treatment and care in hospital and those who preferred treatment and care in community settings, where the two were seen as mutually exclusive. This dichotomy is increasingly replaced by a new agenda, in which balanced care includes both modern community-based and modern hospital-based care (T hornicroft & Tansella, 2003). Nevertheless, wide differences are still present within the member states of the European Union, with different levels of implementation of the principles of community psychi atry. The total number of psychiat- ric beds available in each country ranges from 1.7 per 10,000 population in Italy to 20 per 10,000 in Bel- gium (in 1998 according to an official figure from the Ministry of Health). Seven countries have more than ten beds per 10,000 population: Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finl and. Only four countries (Spai n, Italy, Austria and United King- dom) have less than six beds per 10, 000 population. Excluding Italy and Finland, all the other countries Introduction - Background Factor s and Underlying Influences 21 still have psychiatric beds in mental hospitals. Moreov er, although the majority of the EU countries have a national mental health programme (absent in Aust ria, Spain and Sweden), regional and local variations are present in most countries (Becker & Vasquez -Barquero, 2001). Other studies have confirmed this variation, although national figures or rates might differ due to varying algorithms, definitions or underly- ing sources (Salize et al., 2002). Many countries which have already chosen to switch to a community-based mental health system (e.g., UK) or have incorporated substantia l community services in a hospita l-based system (e.g., the Nether- lands, Portugal, some German Federal States), st ill provide a high number of psychiatric beds.

Two recent com- parisons of the legal frameworks in European Uni on Member States have delineated models for regulat- ing this complex issue: these may also influence l egislation and care routines for mentally disordered offenders (Fioritti, 2002; Salize et al., 2002). Cultural Attitudes There is no doubt that cultural attitudes have a strong influence in determining the shape of regulations, practices and innovations, both in judicial and health care systems. These cu ltural attitudes vary perceptibly and result from multiple social sources. Educational models and shared values emphasise respec t of the social norms in most Central Euro- pean, Scandinavian and English-speaking countries. Failure to comply with social norms results in in- volvement of criminal justice agencies and processing by a court. In Latin countries, informal diversion schemes are more routinely practiced and major violat ions of the law are perceived as a matter for the courts. Detention is practiced only in the case of major offences and alternative measures are often pro- Introduction - Background Factor s and Underlying Influences 22 posed. This may contribute to the low figures fo r detained mentally disordered people in prisons and forensic care in Latin countries. But also attitudes towards care may also help explai n the low figures. In Latin countries, informal sup- port from family, the community or non-professional agencies is traditionally stronger than in other coun- tries. In Italy and Spain, for example, children usually live with their parents until they marry and, if they need support for mental health problems, they usually receive help from familial or informal resources before utilising mental health care facilities. Only recently, with rapid and dramatic demographic changes (low birth rate, increasing immigration, the aging popul ation), do these traditional informal supports seem to be becoming weaker, with more requests for public assistance from the NHS or social services becoming apparent. In general, in Latin countries, it is still perceived as the responsibility of the family to take care of a person with mental disorder, and this mi ght explain the lower rates of institutionalisation.

British Journal of Psychiatry 185, 283-290 Introduction - European and International Policy Co ntext 23 The European and International Policy Context The placement and treatment of mentally ill pers ons who have committed a crime is an issue that does not fall within a single policy area, but cuts across a number of fields such as health, legal affairs and human rights in a variety of ways and to differing degrees. The fact that a mentally ill person who has committed a crime must be viewed as both a patient and as an offender encapsulates the complexity of the issue. C onsequently, for the European Community, the issue of the placement and treatment of ment ally ill offenders incorporates c oncerns both from the field of public health and from those of legal affairs and human rights. The European Union and Mental Health The emergence of health issues as a concern at the European Union level originates from health and safety provisions laid down in the Treatie s establishing the European Coal and Steel Commu- nity (ECSC) and the European Atom ic Energy Community (EURATOM). These were then followed by internal market considerations, with the free movement of people and goods making a certain degree of co-ordination in public health an essential requirement. With the Maastricht Treaty, public health for the first time became an official EU area of competence, alt hough on the basis of the principle of subsidiary. Article 3(o) of the Maas tricht Treaty highlights the responsibility of Commu- nity Institutions to ensure the Co mmunity's contribution to health protection. Additionally, it states that health protection requirements form an import ant part of the Community's other policies. In November 1993, the Commission published its communi cation on the Framework for Action in the Field of Public Health as a response to the new health provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. Drug dependency constituted one of the eight areas fo r action identified and in 1995, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addiction was set up in Lisbon. Although a common European Union health policy was not introduced, Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam provided the EU with a wider compet ence to act in the public health area. The Com- mission's activities remained within the general context of prevention and health promotion, em- phasising also the promotion of mental health . Community measures have concentrated on sup- porting co-operation and networking initiatives among the Member States through the provision of information, education and training, as well as repor ts on the state of health and the integration of health protection requirements in the European Community. With the development of public health as an area of competence for the Community, mental health issues were integrated step-by-step into this new competence. The Council Resolution of June 2, 1994 on the Framework for Community action in the Fi eld of Public Health called for the issue of mental illness to be explored and actions at Communi ty level to be identified in order to assist Member States in this area. The Commission co mmunication of April 16, 1998 on the Development of a Public Health Policy also identified mental health as a field that has to be taken into account in future Community ac tion. The Council Resolution of 18 November 1999 on the Promotion of Mental Health called for Mem- ber States to give attention to mental health , to promote the exchange of good practice and joint projects, as well as to support research activities, including using the support of the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes of the European Communi ty for Research, Technological development and Demonstration Activities. These developments have been accompani ed by an intense process in recent years to promote a European Mental Health Agenda so as to provide a vi sible platform of mental health issues in a European context. One of the first steps towards r ealising this goal was the founding of the Euro- pean Network on Mental Health Policy in 1995, whic h included all of the Member States plus Nor- way. Introduction - European and International Policy Co ntext 24 The next step taken was a research project in 1997 on the Development of Key Concepts for Euro- pean Mental Health Promotion.1 In April 1999, a Joint WHO and European Commission Meeting on Balancing Mental Health Promotion and Mental H ealth Care was held in Brussels, Belgium, fol- lowed by a European Conference on Promotion of M ental Health and Social Inclusion in October 1999, in Tampere, Finland. As mental health was identified as an issue of c oncern for the Community within the area of public health, relevant projects and research activities were supported under the Public Health Commu- nity Action Programmes by the DG XXIV H ealth and Consumer Protection, such as Mental Health Promotion for Children up to six years of age (1997)2 Comparative Study on The Support of People wi th Mental Health Problems in ten Euro- pean Capital Cities3 Compulsory Admission and Involuntary Treatment of Mentally Ill Patients - Legislation and Practice in EU Member States (1999-2001)4 Mental Health Promotion of Adolescents and Young People (2000)5 Mental Health Promotion and Prevention Stra tegies for Coping with Anxiety and Depres- sion in Europe (2001)6 Mental Health Economics to Assess The Economic Dimensions Relevant to Mental Health Systems in the Member States (2002)7 Mental Health in Europe, Eur opean Mental Health Conference (2002)8 Integration of Mental Health Promotion Interventions into Countries' Policies and Practice and the Health Care Systems (2002)9.

The European Union and Legal Affairs The issue of mentally ill offenders is also of conc ern with regard to the Community's policy area of legal affairs. Here, the Community is pursuing a policy to encourage legal cooperation in criminal matters and to slowly harmonise substantive and procedural criminal law with regard to those crimes that are of a cross-border nature. Although the Treaty of Maas tricht identified various areas of the Directorate General (DG) of Justice and Home Affairs as matters of common interest, there 1 Implementing Organisation: Finnish Na tional Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES), Hel- sinki 2 Implementing Organisation: Mental Health Europe - Sant\u00e9 Mentale Europe, Brussels. 3 Implementing Organisation: Mental Health Europe - Sant\u00e9 Mentale Europe, Brussels. 4 Implementing Organisation: Central In stitute of Mental Health, Mannheim. 5 Participation:14 Member States, Iceland, Norw ay.

In 1999, the Tampere European Council set further goals: the convergence of criminal law in specific sectors identified as areas of common interest, the co-ordination and the mutual recogni tion of judicial proceedings, and the protection of individual human rights. Certain cross-border crimes that were identif ied by the Tampere European Council as a primary field of action, such as the sexual exploitation of children, touch upon the issue of the placement and treatment of mentally ill offenders. Theref ore, the respective programmes that have been launched with the aim of combating these crimes Community-wide also include mentally ill offend- ers as a target group. The D APHNE programme was adopted in 1997 as a preventive action programme to fight violence against children, young people and women, and to protect victims and groups at-risk. The programme has been continued, with DAPHNE II running from 2004 to 2008. It funds research, training, networking, the exchange of best practi ce, and awareness-raising campaigns, as well as treatment programmes. Organisations eligible to apply for funding comprise non-profit organisa- tions and public institutions in the 25 Member St ates, the EFTA/EEA countries, as well as in Bul- garia, Romania and Turkey. In a wide-ranging appr oach, the DAPHNE programme does not only target the victims of violence, but has also identified perpetrators as a target group that needs at- tention. Examples of DAPHNE-funded projects that directly target offenders are: Research Study to Measure The Effectiveness of Programmes to Prevent Recidivism of Sex Offenders14 Training on Treatment of Young Perpet rators of Sexual Child Abuse15 Development of a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Module for People with A Sexual Interest in Children Who Also Exhibit Problematic Internet Use.16 Creation of a Europe-wide Telephone Hotline for Offenders Seeking to Opt out of The Cy- cle of Violence.17 The STOP programme, which ran from 1997 to 2000, sought to improve co-operation between people working in the judicial field, such as judges , prosecutors, civil serv ants and police, with the aims of establishing respective networks, foster ing knowledge of other Me mbers States' legal sys- tems, encouraging the exchange of experience and encouraging further research, especially on sex offenders. The follow-up programme, STOP II, came to an end in 2002. Since 2003, a Framework Pro- gramme on Police and Judicial Cooperation in Crim inal Matters, AGIS, has merged STOP and five other programmes. Various projects funded by the STOP and STOP II programmes had identified sex offenders as a target group for their activities: Seminar and Networking Activities to Combat Sexual Exploitation of Children: Comparison of Risk Management Methods across Member St ates; Improvement and Best Practice in the Field of Risk Management18 12 See Art.

With the current study, the DG of Health and Consumer Protection aims to close this gap. Mentally Ill Offenders and Human Rights - The Council of Europe The placement and treatment of mentally ill people who have committed criminal offences must be considered in the context of hum an rights. Human rights are inseparably linked to mental health as both are complementary approaches to the impr ovement of the human c ondition. Human rights also are the only source of law that legitimises international scrutiny of mental health policies and practices within a sovereign country (Gostin 2000). The fundamental document in the protecti on of Human Rights in Europe is the European Conven- tion for the Protection of Hum an Rights and Fundam ental Freedom s (ECHR ) of the Council of Europe, which was signed in 1950 and took effect in 1953. The European Convention is not statu- tory; it owes its legal existence si mply to the expression of the will of those states that are parties to it, from which it therefore takes its legal effec t. As an instrument of t he Convention, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) investigates all eged violations of the C onventions' Human Rights standards, involving both inter-state cases as well as individual claims. However, the Court is only able to consider those cases that have already exhausted all domestic remedies. There have been several judgements by the Court concerning national mental health laws and practices. The result- ing case law has dealt mainly with issues of co mpulsory detention, condi tions of confinement and civil rights, for example the case Aerts vs. Belgium . It contains implications for the provision of ser- vices.26 19 99/017. Participation: Sw eden, Ireland, United Kingdom. Implementing Organisation: University of Leeds, UK. 20 99/020.

Introduction - European and International Policy Co ntext 27 Article 5.1 of the C onvention states that \"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No- one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\" which subsumes under (e) \"the lawful detention of per sons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound m ind, alcoholics or drug addicts or va- grants.\" The primary impact on persons suffering from a mental illness has been in relation to protec- tion against arbitrary detention under this article (Fennell, 1999). Additional articles of importance to people with mental illness, including those who have committed an offence, concern the obligation to respect human rights (Article 1), the right to life (Article 2), the prohi bition of torture (Article 3), the right to a fair trial (Article 6), the prohibition of punishment without law (Art icle 7), and the prohibition of discrimination (Article 14). How can the impact of rulings by the European C ourt of Human Rights on the protection of human rights of the mentally ill be ev aluated? Bindman et al. (2003) argue that ECHR rulings have not set a high standard for modern mental health servic es, as the European Convention has tended to preserve old stereotypes and prejudices against people suffering from mental illness, apparent in the phrasing of the respective articles of the Conv ention, especially Article 5. It is the interpretation of the Convention on Human Right s by the European Court of Hum an Rights that is seen as the actual mechanism of protection of human rights of the mentally ill. The crux, however, is that hu- man rights can only be secured by challenges brought before the Court. People with mental illness for the most part have fewer means and less capacit y to undertake this step and are thus at a dis- advantage (Findlay, 2003). The rights as set out in this Convention have also been brought into the domestic law of those States which have ratified the Convention. France was one of the first to do so; Great Britain's Human Rights Act of 1998 took effect in 2000. Conclusions about the impact of this act differ. It was initially suggested that the Human Rights Act would be likely to result in \"a flood of legal cases\", particularly those of pati ents admitted on a compulsory basis under the Men- tal Health Act. This would necessitate the re-det ermination of the balance between the rights of the individual patient and those of the Community (Macgregor-Morris et al., 2001). However, Bindman et al. (2003) noted that during the first year after the Human Rights Act had taken effect, the num- ber of cases dropped rather than increased. Special attention was given to the mentally ill in 1983, when the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a Recom mendation Concerning the Legal Protection of Persons Suffer- ing from Mental Disorder Placed as Involuntary Patients. The Recommendation also covers ques- tions of treatment, legal capacity and dignity of those patients who were placed following criminal proceedings. The 1994 Parliamentary Assembly Recom mendation 1235 on Psychiatry and Hum an Rights refers to compulsory admission in general, and no special distinction is made between men- tally ill persons admitted under civil law and those admitted following criminal proceedings. Never- theless, the Recommendation gives special attenti on to the situation of detained persons, stating that the recommendations set out should also appl y to them. The Recommendation also applies to social therapy programmes, which should be set up for persons suffering from personality disor- ders. In 2000, the Council of Europe published a White Paper on the Protection of Hum an Rights and Dignity of People Suffering from Mental Disorder Especially Those Placed as Involuntary Patients in A Psychiat ric Establishm ent, the scope of which encompassed ci vil detention as well as deten- tion in the context of offending. The White Paper defines the roles and certain standards regarding the various agencies involved in the placement and tr eatment of mentally ill offenders, such as the police, courts, prisons and medica l experts. It further emphasises that Member States should en- sure sufficient provision of a range of hospital accommodation with the appropriate levels of secu- rity and community-based forensic psychiatric services. The European Prison Rules (1987) also stipulate an obligation to treat mentally ill detai nees, not in prison, but in appropriate establish- ments. Mentally Ill Offenders and Human Rights - The European Union From the mid-1970s on, human rights in the Comm unity became an increasingly visible issue for the European Commission and the European Parliament, which resulted in a joint declaration by Introduction - European and International Policy Co ntext 28 the EC institutions on human rights in 1977. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty incorporated a limited reference to human rights, also referring to t he European Convention on Hu man Rights by stating that \"The Union shall respect fundam ental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Hum an Rights and Fundam ental Freedom s (...)\" .27 However, at the same time it was ensured that the European Court of Justice w ould have no jurisdiction to enforce these com- mitments in the context of Justice and Home Affairs (Pillar III of the EU). In 1997, the Amsterdam Treaty incorporated provisi ons relating to human rights in the context of the access of new Member States. In December 2000, the EU proclaimed the Charter of Funda- mental Rights of the European Union. The legal status of this cata logue of basic rights laid out in 54 articles is still unclear and is presently under in tense debate as to the extent to which the Char- ter does have an effect (McCrudden, 2001). The scope of application of the Charter is limited to Union institutions and bodies and does not extend to Member States.28 As for the relationship be- tween the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, the Charter builds upon but does not intend to replace the Convention (Men\u00e9ndez, 2001). The Charter itself provides standards of health care in Article 35, stating that \"Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatm ent under the conditions established by national law and practice s. A high level of hum an health protection shall be ensured in the definition and im plem entati on of all Union policies and activities.\" The principles set out in this article are based on Article 152 of the EC Treaty and on Article 11 of the European Social Charter (the right to protection of health). Chapter VI on Justice includes the right to an effec- tive remedy and fair trial (Art. 47), the presumpt ion of innocence and right to defence (Art. 48), the principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties (Art. 49) and the right not be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same offence (Art. 50). Despite its non- finalised legal status, it is argued that the Charte r represents a step forward in the protection of human rights and articulates a new normative basis and a new ethic for the European Union (De B\u00farca, 2001). Mentally Ill Offenders and Human Rights - The United Nations As one of the main sources of law within the Un ited Nations system, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights attempts to achieve common standards of human rights. It contains several articles that protect human rights concerni ng the placement and treatment of mentally ill persons, including those who are placed on the basis of criminal pr oceedings. Article 5 states that \"...no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degradi ng treatment or punishment\". Article 12 of the Declaration states that \"...no one s hall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, fam- ily, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.\", an article which is put forward by critics against the granting of wider access to the m edical data of mentally ill offend- ers or the introduction of offender registration laws . The Declaration is not legally binding. Never- theless, as its key provisions have gained greater acceptance and been applied more often over the past decades, they are now considered to be customary international law and have inspired the development of legally-binding human ri ghts instruments (Gostin, 2000). In the early 1970s, the United Nations began intens e debates on issues of mental health, and the years 1983 to 1992 were designated as the \"Decade for Disabled Persons\". In 1989, the General Assembly adopted the Principles for The Protection of Persons with Mental Illnesses and The Im- provement of Mental Health Care, which formul ate detailed statements on the rights of people with mental illness. The Principles st ate that all people have the right to the best available mental health care and that treatment should be undertaken with humanity and respect (Principle 1). Specific reference is made to the fact that these principl es shall also apply to criminal offenders suspected of suffering from a mental illness (Principle 20). T he principles also determine standards of surgical procedures, stating that sterilisat ion should never be carried out as a treatment for mental illness. 27 Treaty of the European Union (The Maastricht Treaty ), 1992 O.J. (C191): Art. F(2). How ever, the Union is no party to the European Convention for the Protecti on of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 28 The exception to this rule concerns t hose instances in w hich Member States are \"implementing union law \" (see Article 49 of the Charter). Introduction - European and International Policy Co ntext 29 Any major surgical procedure should only be carried out on the basis of a formal domestic law and with the patient's informed consent. Any irrevers ible treatment should not be carried out on an in- voluntary patient. In addition, the principles determi ne that clinical trials and experimental treatment should never be carried out on a pati ent without the patient's consen t. If a patient is unable to give this consent, an independent body has to gi ve its approval (Principle 11). The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners states that persons found to be in- sane are not to be detained in prisons. It also states that prisoners suffering from other mental ab- normalities shall be observed and treated in spec ialised institutions under medical management and steps shall be taken to ensure the c ontinuation of care after release. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for N on-Custodial Measures (The Tokyo Rules) aim for the rehabilitation of offenders as well as thei r integration into the community and call for the development of non-custodial measures. The Rules re ject the controversial practice of community access to the personal data of an offender, stati ng that the offender's personal records should be kept strictly confidential with access limited to persons directly concerned with the case. Further- more, the Rules call for the avoidance of pre-trial det ention as a means of last resort only for inves- tigation or protection of society, and for post-sent encing alternatives to assist the offender with his/her reintegration into society. The UN Resolu tions as such are not legally-binding documents. However, they are of practical importance as they help to establish international human rights norms by creating a baseline for fair treatment of mentally ill persons and therefore also enable objective monitoring of psychiatric abuses. In addition, they can also be used as an interpretive guide to international treaty obligations (Gostin, 2000). Human Rights - An Issue That Matters Passmore et al. (2003) assessed psychiatrists' knowledge of the UK Human Rights Act and their ability to apply it to clinical scenarios. They c oncluded that the overall level of knowledge of the Human Rights Act was good, given that it had been implemented only shortly prior to the assess- ment. A thorough knowledge of human rights issues as well as of the respective international and national legal instruments is essent ial for both researchers and forensic practitioners in view of their implications for managing mentally ill patients, including those admitt ed under criminal law. This is particularly important with an eye towards the proc ess of integrating the Eastern and South-Eastern European countries into the EU.

A/46/49, 1991 Study 31 2 Study The study was aimed at gathering and analysing info rmation about the differences and/or similari- ties in legislation on the placement and treatm ent of mentally ill offenders across fifteen European Union Member States. The study was funded by a grant from the health promotion programme of the European Commis- sion (Grant Agreement SPC.2002448) and conducted from January 1st 2003 to September 30th 2004. The study centre was located at the Central Institute of Ment al Health (CIMH) in Mannheim, Germany and co-headed by Hans Joachim Saliz e and Harald Dre\u00dfing from the CIMH. The study relates in part to the previous EC -funded study \"Compulsory admission and involuntary treatment of mentally ill pati ents - Legislation and practice in European Union Member States\" which was conducted by the leaders of this study between October 1st 2000 and January 1st 2002 (EU grant agreement no. SI2.254882/2000CVF3-407). While in the above-mentioned study legislation for placing or treat ing mentally ill patients involun- tarily was analysed, this second phase study has focussed on the issue of legal frameworks for mentally disordered offenders. This specific gr oup is to be seen as different from non-offending mentally ill patients detained involunt arily under public or civil law. Judicial procedures and care for mentally ill offenders require a specific legislat ion regulating the varied and complex aspects of their placement and treatment. Standardised overview s of the various legal frameworks across the European Union are lacking. This study aims at br idging this gap by contributing essential informa- tion on the current situation in the Member States. This study document consists of a general outline of the issue, fifteen chapters (each of them dedicated to a Member State) reporting in a standardised way the national forensic systems and legal frameworks for mentally ill offenders, a synopsis of the current legislation and practice in the EU Member States, an analysis of similarities or diffe rences across the Member States, a concluding chapter which summarises c onclusions drawn from the analyses. Work Plan The implement ation of the project involved the following t asks: 1. The setting up of a network of experts and coll aborators (specialists in forensic psychiatry) from each EU Member State (prior to the extension of the European Union in May 2004). 2. Inclusion of contact persons from the ministri es of justice and the mini stries of health of the Member States in the network. 3. Development of a questionnaire for gathering structured information about legislation for the treatment of mentally ill offenders and current practice in each Member State (filled in by the specialists in forensic psychiatry), as well as inform ation about the national forensic psychiatric service provision (f acilities, number of beds etc). Essential information for the latter part was to be provided by the responsible National Ministries or other key agencies. 4. Development of guidelines for writing a chapt er describing specific characteristics of each Member State. The chapters were to be written by the national experts. Study 32 5. Assessment of the current si tuation in each Member State (by means of the questionnaire). 6. Analysis and comparison of the results of the assessment and compilation of a synopsis of the current situation in the European Union. 7. Organisation of a meeting to discuss the results and their consequences attended by at least one expert or collaborator from each Member State. 8. Analysis and aggregation of the discussion, results and conclusions from the meeting. 9. Report on the result s (study document). Netw ork of Experts At the beginning of the project, experts from all fift een EU Member States prior to the extension in May 2004 were selected. About a third of all experts had already worked on the previous study referred to above, and were therefore familiar with the study design. On a subcontractual basis,, all the experts agreed to fill in the study questionnaire, to write a national chapter on mentally ill of- fenders and to attend an experts' meeting to discuss preliminary results. The experts were also obliged to inform their responsible ministries of their collaboration in this study. The board of ex- perts comprised: Austria Prof. Dr. Hans Schanda, G\u00f6llersdorf Belgium Prof. Dr. Paul Cosyns, Edegem Denmark Dr. Peter Kramp, Copenhagen England & Wales Dr. David James, London Finland Dr. Riittakerttu Kaltialla-Heino, Tampere France Dr. Pierre Lamothe, Giorgius Alevizopoulos, Athens Dermot Walsh, Dublin Italy Dr. Angelo Fioritti, Rimini Luxembourg Dr. Jean-Marc Cloos, Luxembourg The Netherlands Dr. Catharina H. de Kogel, Den Haag Portugal Prof. Dr. Miguel Xavier, Lisbon Spain Prof. Dr. Francisco Torres Gonzalez, Granada Sweden Dr. Helena Silfverhielm, Stockholm Assessment Tools and Methods Information on legislation and practice concerning the placement and treatment of mentally ill of- fenders in the Member States was gathered by means of a detailed, structured questionnaire, which comprised the major assessment tool in this study. Following an exhaustive review of research lit erature and based on the knowledge and expertise of the project staff, a detailed questionnaire was dev eloped. The questionnaire consisted of more than 100 specific items including both structured and uns tructured questions covering the following top- ics: Legislation (laws, acts or legal instruments) on the placement and treatment of mentally ill offenders, Key concepts (mental disorder , criminal responsibility), Pre-trial procedures, Psychiatric assessment s, Trial procedures and relev ant court structures, Verdict (factors leading to a court decision), Placement and treatment facilities, Re-assessment procedures, Specific therapeutic procedures, Study 33 Patients' rights, Discharge procedures and aftercare, Epidemiological data (outcome). Because of the complexity of the issues c oncerned, the questionnaire had to strike a balance be- tween questions on empirical data and open questions about specific national characteristics that are hard to describe in a structured way. A major part of the work of the first study phase was de- voted to the development of this questionnaire. Additionally, guidelines for the composition of the country-specific chapt ers were developed. The national chapters were supposed to focus on iss ues and national particularities that cannot ade- quately be explored by means of a questionnaire, such as the advantages and the limitations of the current legal system, practical problems of plac ement and treatment of m entally ill offenders, as well as public opinion and media coverage of issues related to mentally ill offenders. Both the ques- tionnaire and the guidelines on the national chapters were forwarded to all experts. Expert Meeting A two-day meeting with partner experts was held in Mannheim, Germany, from 13th - 14th Febru- ary 2004. After a short introduction on major issues concerni ng the placement of mentally disordered offend- ers and forensic care, a summary was presented of preliminary results derived from the study questionnaire which had been filled in and returned by the attendees during the preceding months. This covered the following issues: Legal frameworks for mentally ill offenders in the Member States, Key concepts of mental illness and criminal responsibility, Assessment issues, Placement and treatment facilities for mentally disordered offenders in the Member States, Pre-trial and trial procedures, i ssues of verdict and sentence, Re-assessment and discharge arrangements, Epidemiology of mentally disordered offenders (prevalence and incidence data from the Member States), Treatments and therapeutic interventions. The presentations were followed by the completion of missing information from the Member States, a clarification of queries and an ex tensive discussion of preliminar y results. Among other points, the discussion focussed on key criteria for grouping t he legal frameworks of the Member States in such a way as to identify similarities or major differences in approaches across the European Un- ion. There was overall agreement on the complexity of the major issues covered by the study, re- quiring clear definitions for key concepts (e.g. crim inal responsibility), procedures or responsibilities for assessment and decision-making (court proc edures) and the patient groups included. It was agreed that the comparison of epidemiological data, i. e. time-series on forensic prevalence or inci- dence, requires unambiguous descriptions of incl uded patient groups and diagnoses, which is seri- ously affected by the rather heterogeneous health -reporting standards in the Member States. The attendants stressed the great need for a descripti on of the current situation in the Member States and an evaluation of the l egal frameworks and their impact on the routine practice of foren- sic care across the European Union. Dissemination of Research Results Dissemination of (preliminary) research result s started during the study period and has been con- tinued to be an integral part of the group's activities. At the 8th Annual Meeting of German-Speaking Social Psychiatrists (Austria, Switzerland, Ger- many) in Palma de Mallorca in March 2004, a pres entation was given on \"Legislation and Practice Study 34 of Civil and Forensic Detention of Mentally I ll in the European Union\". The presentation included both results from the previous study on civilly committed persons as well as preliminary results from the current study. Results were also presented at the 12th Symposium of the AEP-Section of Epidemiology and Social Psychiatry (Association of Eu ropean Psychiatrists) in Mannheim in June 2004. In the session \"Re- cent European Studies and Networks\", an overview of results was given with a particular focus on epidemiological data. In the session on \"Coercion in mental health care: legal frameworks and rou- tine practice in Europe\", a second presentation of the study focused more specifically on concep- tual and judicial aspects of criminal responsibilit y. An additional presentation concerned the results of the first study on involuntary placement and treatment of mentally ill patients. Additionally, study results were presented at the 6th ENMESH Conference (European Network for Mental Health Service Evaluation) \"Inclusion and Mental Health in the new Europe\" in London, UK in September 2004, and at the International W PA Conference (World Psychiatric Association) \"Treatments in Psychiatry - an Updat e\" in Florence, Italy, November 10th -13th 2004. Further dissemination is planned through participation in conferences and the publication of articles in relevant journals. Communication w ith the European Commission and Report Writing Two meetings with the Health and Consumer Prot ection Directorate-General were held in Luxem- bourg on February 3rd 2003. In addition to these meetings, communication by e-mail and phone took place when required. The interim activity report, as well as a financial interim report, were submitted to the Directorate-General by August 2003. This final study document was forwarded a fter the ending of the funding period. Resu lts 35 3 Results The following section presents the results from the survey which was conducted as a central part of this study. The section describes separately the re sults for each of the following topics: Legal Frameworks and Key Concepts Pre-Trial and Trial Procedures Forensic Psychiatric Assessment Reassessment and Discharge Procedures Patients' Rights Service Provision Epidemiology. By summarising and comparing country-specific information in a standardised way, it provides an overview of the current situat ion in the Member States. The chapter relies almost completely on data from the study questionnaire which was filled in by the experts from the Member States. When necessary, additional non-standardised information contributed by the experts was also included. In a few cases, information form other sources was added. Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 36 Legal Frameworks and Key Concepts Legal Frameworks This section summarises the various legal regulati ons relevant for decisions on mentally ill or dis- ordered offenders in the Member States participating in this study.

In the majority of Member States, these regulations apply nationwide. In some Mem ber States, however, forensic legislation may be wholly regional or split between the national and regional. Belgian forensic law is applicable na- tionwide, although there are specif ic regulations for the regions of Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia. Denmark has common legislation for the mainland, whereas there are separate regulations for Greenland. German Penal Law regulating criminal responsibilit y and the disposal of mentally disordered of- fenders applies nationwide, whereas federal law regulates procedural aspects. In case of the United Kingdom, England and Wales shar e the same forensic legislation, which is different from that in Scotland and that in Northern Ireland. In the case of split forensic legislation, the results and conclusions presented below refer to legal frameworks covering the largest jurisdiction in a given state (e.g. the mainland without Greenland for Denmark; England and Wales in the case of the UK) unless other wise indicated. No Member States provide all-embracing forensic legislation in a clearly demarcated code or stat- ute, but rather Member States pr ovide a variety of codes, laws or acts regulating different of the many aspects of forensic cases (criminal respons ibility, rules for detention or treatment, penal as- pects, trial or discharge procedures etc.). In c onsequence, the following overview does not cover all possible regulations, but describes the most significant forensic la ws or codes as selected by the contributing national experts. The most recent year of revision as listed in t able 2 suggests forensic legislation in the Member States is an issue under constant change and review. However, old codes are still in effect as well as newer ones. This may serve as an indication of the complexity of the issues or of the diversity of judicial approaches. This interpretation is supported by the varied dist ribution of relevant regulations into penal codes and health or mental health laws, which follows no obvious pattern and does not allow conclusions to be drawn as to whether medical or punitive aspec ts are to the fore in the judicial management of forensic cases. Legal Terms Defining Mental State Similarly to the wide variation in legal framewor ks, the basic terminology for addressing the mental condition of the persons concerned varies widely in the laws of Member States. Table 3 lists sig- nificant terms or wordings as used in national codes or acts. Please note that these terms are translated from the original language into English by collaborating experts for the purpose of this study, and therefore cannot be considered as official. The terms or descriptions are particularly non-spec ific, widely varied and, from a professional psy- chiatric point of view, in large part antiquated. T hey have little relation to the classification systems established in international mental health care (e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV, International Classification of Diseases ICD-10). This non-specific terminology embraces all kinds of mental disorders and allows broad scope in their construction. It remains debatable to what degree specific diagnos tic categories should be included in the basic legal regulations, taking into account the fact t hat these categories and the defining classification systems are subject to change and refinement over time. Thus, the concepts as employed by the law reflect the difficulty in determining the relati onship that nosological ent ities as defined by the current classification systems mi ght have to a person's intellectual capacity and volition. However, definitional uncertainties or the use of particula rly broad concepts of disordered mental state lay themselves open to wide interpretation by ex perts engaged in assessments or court procedures and provide a constant source of i nequality in their application and outcome. In addition, vague definitions of mental disorder are a serious obstacle to comparing forensic men-tal health legislation between the Member States and to reaching any conclusions as to differences between them as to which conditions are covered or explicitly included, or as to the conceptual differences which may lie behind any such differences. Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 38 Tab. 3: Legal Terminology for describing the Me ntal State in relevant Legislation within the Member States Austria - mental illness - mental deficiency - profound impairment of consciousness - other abnormal mental conditions - mental abnormality of higher degree Belgium - mental deficiency or mental retardation - severe mental unbalance - insanity Denmark - mental illness - state equal to mental illness - moderate to profound mental retardation - mild mental retardation - inadequate development, impairment or di sturbance of mental abilities England & Wales - Mental disorder , which is defined as any of the following:- - mental illness (not defined), - mental impairment (when treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent d rioration) ete- - severe mental impairment (when treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration) - psychopathic disorder (when treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration) - other disability of mind Finland - state of lunacy, senile lack of under standing, similar condition (penal law) - mentally ill (mental health act) France - mental disorder suppressing discernment or control of action Germany - mental disorder - severe disorder of consciousness - severe mental abnormality - intellectual disability Greece - morbid perturbation of intellectual functions or perturbation of consciousness Ireland - mental illness - mental handicap - dementia or any disease of the mind Italy - mental flaw - mental inferiority - insanity Luxembourg - mental disorder suppressing discern ment or control of one\u00b4s actions - mental disorder impairing discernm ent or control of one\u00b4s actions - power or irresistible restraint - severe psychiatric disorder endangering oneself or others the Netherlands - developmental deficiencies - pathological mental disturbance Portugal - psychic abnormality Spain - anomaly - psychological alteration - intoxication - perceptual disturbance Sweden - serious mental disorder - mental disorder - severe personality disorders Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 39 Excluding Mental Conditions Most national laws provide no clear definition as to which mental states automatically exclude a person from legal mental health provisions. In t hose laws which incorporate more precise descrip- tions, these usually concern only substance abuse disorders, persona lity disorders or disorders of sexual preferences. It is only England & Wales which incorporate sophist icated medical terminology into mental health law in defining sexual deviancy and alcohol or drug dependence as being excluded from the provi- sions of the legislation. There are other Member States which ex clude some or all of these disor- ders when deciding on the mental condition of sus pects having committed an offence (e.g. Finland, France, Ireland, Italy etc.), but these arrangements lack legal definition and have been established as a common guideline in routine practice instead. The relevant legal frameworks of the Member St ates do not function as practical guidelines for handling problems occurring during routine procedures (e.g. forensic assessment). Additionally, on a more political level, the lack of clear definit ions prevents moves towards the harmonisation of legal frameworks or of routine practices within or across the Member States. The above mentioned syndromes comprise mental conditions which some professionals and the broader public might consider as being more modifi able by volition than most mental disorders. Thus, forensic legislation across the European Uni on partly reflects a debate as to whether or not some specific conditions (e.g. addictive behaviour) belong to a more narrowly conceived concept of psychiatric disorder. Although this debate might be considered outgrown and resolved in professional mental health care circles, there are some serious conceptual problems in unambiguously incorporating offences committed under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs into forensic legislation. The mental state of a person who was intoxicated at the time of an offence might be affected by a singular pathological drug or alcohol intoxication a chronic state of intoxication due to addiction disorder dementia due to alcohol paranoid or hallucinatory states induced by drugs or alcohol. These states form different syndromes from a m edical point of view, and thus require different and complex judicial consideration (e.g. when judging the degree of individual responsibility). Not sur- prisingly, Member States have developed rather individual approaches. There is a group of Mem- ber States (including England & Wales, France and Ireland) where a suspect is not considered mentally ill or disordered within the terms of the re levant legislation, even in severe cases of addic- tion. Such individuals are subject to being tried in the same manner as \"healthy\" offenders. In some other countries (e.g. Luxembourg, Portugal), each case is decided on its merits, and a number of penal or forensic c onsequences may follow. Article 92/93 of the Italian Penal Code admits no spec ific judicial procedure or insanity claim for persons who commit crimes whilst intoxicated. Fr equent states of intoxication may even lead to more severe penalties (art. 94 Penal Code). However, chronic states of intoxication severe enough to cause physical damage may be admitted as a legal criterion for diminished criminal responsibil- ity. The Italian approach, although allowing cases to be considered in court trials according to their individual merits, provides an example of how medi cally defined terms such as \"intoxication\" might be widened in their interpretation when transformed into legal concepts. Inclusion Criteria Although omitting clear concepts and medical definitions of mental conditions on a legal level, in routine practice in most Member States a core set of mental disorders has been established which qualify for inclusion under mental health legislati on. These disorders were transformed into ICD-10 terminology for the purposes of this study and are described in table 4. Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 40 The highest level of agreement across the Member States concerns schizophrenia and other psy- chotic disorders (F2). Most varied is the inclusion or otherwise of addiction (F1), neurotic disorders (F4) and personality disorders (F6). Due to the absence of binding definitions, it ma y be the responsibility of psychiatrists, judges, courts or other authorities involved in trials against mentally disordered offenders to follow the common practices of the respective Member State or to apply individual criteria. Therefore, the overview presented here lacks official status.

A generally low age-limit for criminal responsibility mi ght be an indicator of a re strictive judicial sys- tem, attributing to young adolescents or even children full or only slightly diminished responsibility for offences committed. Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 41 There are considerable differences between the Mem ber States in the age at which a child or ado- lescent is liable to prosecution and to stand trial. Whereas the majority of states define the mini- mum age of criminal responsibility at between 14 and 16 years of age, England & Wales, France, Greece and Ireland remain below this figure. Be lgium, Luxembourg and Spain consider 18 years as a specific threshold (see table 5) However, even when prosecuting and judging a juv enile offender as an adult, that does not neces- sarily mean the application of the adult penal fram ework. Most countries provide a complex educa- tional and correctional system for juvenile delinquents. Tab. 5 Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility in the Member States 8-13 years 14-16 years 18 years England & Wales (10 y.) France (13 y.) Greece (8 -13 y.)* Ireland (12 y.) Austria (14 y.) Denmark (15 y.) Germany (14 y.) Finland (15 y.) Italy (14 y.) the Netherlands (16 y.) Portugal (16 y.) Sweden (15 y.) Belgium (18 y.)* Luxembourg (18 y.)* Spain (18 y.) * Belgium: In certain cases 16 years. Luxembourg: In certain cases 16 years. Greece: Although the penal law of 1983 is in effect (7 -12 years), juvenile regulat ory laws anticipate that an offender between 8-13 years of age can be prosecuted but only for therapeutic and only rarely for penal purposes. Below 8 years of age a child is considered as not accountable. However, low age limits for prosecution in general do not necessarily mean similarly restrictive thresholds for criminal responsibility in mentally disordered persons, no matter what age they might be. One touchstone for this might be the manner in which cases are processed which concern sus- pects suffering from mental disorders that affect cognitive abilities or volition to a lesser degree than most severe mental disorders. This incl udes especially personality disorders, and alcohol and drug addiction. As shown in table 4, there are several Member States with low age limits for criminal responsibility, where addiction disorders (France, England & Wa les, Ireland) or some personality disorders (France, England & Wales) are excluded from the sc ope of forensic mental health law. However, Member States with higher age-thresholds do likew ise. So the minimum age of criminal responsibil- ity does not provide a reliable indicator of restrictive forensic mental health laws. Criminal Responsibility as a Key Concept To assess mentally disturbed off enders differently from suspects whose mental abilities are not disturbed is a practice based on the assumption that mental disorders significantly affect a person's ability to exercise free will and to control their actions (see chapt er \"Criminal Responsibility\"). So the forensic laws of the Member States may be characterised by the extent to which they incor- porate the concept of criminal responsibility, or by whether different degrees of diminished respon- sibility are distinguished in their systems.. Resu lts - L egal Framewo rks and Key Co ncepts 42 As shown in table 6, the basic concept is appli ed in most, but not all Member States when judging mentally disordered offenders. Countries with an Anglo-Saxon or Common Law tradition, or those that adopt significant features thereof, usually exclude any assessm ent of a mentally ill suspects' criminal responsibility from pr e-trial or trial procedures. Thus, in England & Wales and Ireland, the criminal responsibility of a suspec t is considered only in cases of homicide, where the charge will be r educed to one of manslaughter, if the defendant's responsibility can be shown to have been diminished. As a consequence, in these Member States, the disorder of the person concerned is the decisive criterion, which usually means that a treatment or hospital order is made as a sentence. Tab. 6 Concepts of Criminal Responsibility in Mentally Disordered Offenders incor- porated into the Legal Frameworks of Member States Criminal responsibility either full or absent (dichotomous concept) Lacking, diminished or full criminal responsibility (graded concept) Criminal responsibility not applied as a legal concept Austria Belgium Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal Spain England and Wales * Ireland * Sweden * England & Wales, Ireland Diminished responsibility is only an issue in cases of homicide Although these results fit into the patterns of l egal tradition that have grown up in the different Member States, it remains questionable as to whether differences in concepts of criminal responsi- bility result in any significant consequenc es in routine forensic practice. There may be differences in legal or medical re sponsibilities during the post-trial phases (as shown in chapters below). However, whether or not the concept of criminal responsibility is applied, all Member States separate mentally ill offenders from mentally non-disturbed offenders and from non-offending psychiatric patients according to t heir individual needs for treatment and/or the de- gree of danger that they constitute to the public. So the degree to which the concept of criminal re sponsibility is incorporated into the legal frame- works of the Member States may not by itself comp rise as a useful criteri on for their evaluation. Resu lts - Pre- Trial an d Trial Pro cedures 43 Pre-Trial and Trial Procedures Placement Options Prior to Trial The type of facility in which a mentally disor dered suspect is detained before trial depends largely on when mental disturbance in the accused was fi rst suspected. In many cases, doubts about the mental functioning of a suspect are not raised until the subject is on remand, suspicion then being raised by disturbed behaviour on the part of the su spect, by the contents of witness statements or by the specific circumstances surrounding the case. In consequence, mentally disordered suspects are commonly found in remand prisons throughout the European Union. Nevertheless, it is standard practice in all EU Member States to attempt to ensure adequate treat- ment of remand prisoners where a serious mental di sorder is detected. However, the actual place or institution where such treatment is provided varies and the site of treatment can be crucial in determining the quality of care and its outcome. Placement options in the pre-trial phase are simila r in the various Member States (see table 7). When a suspect is thought mentally ill before trial, placement in a general psychiatric facility is pos- sible in twelve Member States, the exc eptions being Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal. All Member States other than Belgium provide for placements in a specia lised forensic facility before a trial has started. In eleven Member Stat es, a mentally ill suspect may also be placed in a remand prison, the exceptions being England & Wales, Ireland, Portugal and Sweden. In the case of minor offences, suspects can also be bailed to their home address for outpatient treatment in almost all Member States. Tab. 7: Placement Options Prior to Trial General psy chiatric facility Speci alised forensic facility Prison Austria Denmark England & Wales Finland France Germany Greece Italy Ireland Netherlands Spain* Sweden Austria Denmark England & Wales Finland France Germany Greece Italy Ireland Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales* Finland France Germany Greece Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Spain * Spain: only in rare cases and on a tem porary basis England & W ales: prison placem ent only in the short term whilst awai ting hospital placem ent However, the criteria concerning pre-trial plac ement and the attendant procedures differ from coun- try to country and vary according to local regul ations and practice. For example, in England & Wales, the mentally disordered person will initia lly be remanded in custody until the formalities of Resu lts - Pre- Trial an d Trial Pro cedures 44 transfer orders have been completed and will then onl y remain in prison until a bed becomes avail- able in the health service. The court cannot determi ne the hospital, but only sanction a transfer into a general psychiatric or forensic institution, based on the recommendation of the psychiatrist re- sponsible for the patient's area of domicile. Maximum Period for Pre-trial Placement The maximum length of pre-trial placement is specif ied by law in only five Member States (table 8), this ranging from a legally-defined maximum of 28 day s in Ireland to twelve months in Germany or Portugal. The question of importance here is whether the absenc e of legally defined time-limits constitutes a legal loophole or indicates an emphasis on the treat ment needs of the suspect. In Finland, for ex- ample, the treatment periods of mentally disordered suspects during the pre-trial phase vary according to rules set out in the Mental Health Act and according to the need for treatment (al- though the relevant legal regulations are under discussion). Where mental health care provision within the pris on system is poor, a failure to meet legal limits on pre-trial placement is likely to result in unmet needs for treatment amongst remand prisoners suffering from mental disorders. Tab. 8: Limits on Pre-trial Placement Specified by Law Up to one month Two to six months Six to tw elve months Not specified Ireland (28 days) Greece (6 months) Netherlands (106 days)Germany (12 months) Portugal (12 months) Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales Finland France Italy Luxembourg Spain* Sweden * Spain: there are no general lim its regarding the length of a pre-trial placem ent, m aximum length being specified by law according to the severity of the crim e (usually from one to four years). The Defence Counsel In the pre-trial and trial procedures, arrangements for acquiring defence counsel are of particular importance in the mentally ill, although none of the Member States' criminal laws include particular reference to mentally ill defendants. In all Member States, suspects have the legal right to an as- signed counsel, with the exception of Luxembourg where this right is only current practice. The assignment of a defence counsel against the defendant's wishes is possible in ten Member States, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England & Wa les, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Yet conditions for the a ssignment of a defence counsel against the defen- dant's wishes vary between Member States. For inst ance, in France it is mandatory for the defence counsel to be physically present at court, but t he suspect does not need to collaborate with a coun- sel assigned against his or her wishes. Only in England & Wales, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal is it possible for the trial to be held of a mentally ill defendant wi thout a defence counsel being allo tted (see chapter \"Patients' rights\"). Again, England & Wales does not specify such matters in its legislation regarding the men- tally ill. If a person chooses to defend himself, he may do so. Nevertheless, in practice courts are very cautious about letting mentally disordered defendants defend themselves. Resu lts - Pre- Trial an d Trial Pro cedures 45 In most Member States, the costs of an assigned c ounsel are covered by the Ministry of Justice. Only in Ireland does the social security system reimburse an assigned counsel. In Luxembourg, the defendant himself has to pay, and only where he is unable to do so will the state reimburse the costs. Defendants' Attendance at Court Similarities between states are also evident in trial procedures. In most Member States other than Denmark, Greece, Portugal and Spain, mentally ill or disordered defendants do not have to attend for every session of the trial. However, there are differences between those Member States in which full attendance is not obligatory. In Finland, it is part of the psychiatric assessment to determine whether a mentally disordered or ill defendant should attend. In England & Wales, the defendant's attendance is obligatory for plea and for sentencing. Finally, one should note that, in Denmark, an o ffender may be remanded without being present in the court, where he suffers from severe psychot ic symptoms, has been admitted to hospital and the psychiatrist considers the offender unfit to attend. Nevertheless, the offender has to be present for sentencing. Tab. 9: Consequences of Being Unfit to Plead Suspension of trial No suspension of trial Austria Belgium England & Wales* France Germany Greece Italy Ireland Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Denmark Finland Greece Portugal * England and W ales: the trial m ay be suspended whilst the defendant is treated in order that he becom e fit to plead, or a finding of unfitness m ay be m ade, in which case t he defendant is sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatm ent and the m atter m ay never com e to trial In cases where the defendant is unfit to plead, t he trial will be suspended in most Member States (table 9). Only in Denmark (see above), Finland, Greece and Portugal will the trial not be formally suspended, but the judgement may include a suspens ion of the sentence and the convicted person is sent to a psychiatric inst itution for treatment instead. Period w hen Mental Illness Present as a Decisive Factor in Disposal The issue as to the period when the defendant's ment al illness was present is of particular impor- tance in terms of the consequences that follow. If the defendant was ill at the time of the offence as well as at the time of the psychiatric assess- ment following arrest, the consequences are clear and are along the same lines in all EU Member States: disposal is by way of hospital placement and treatment instead of a prison sentence. If the offender was mentally disordered at the time of the offence but not at the time of the assess- ment, the potential danger for the public becomes a decisive factor. If the offender constitutes no further illness-related threat and if no relapse and no re-offending is to be expected, the offender is Resu lts - Pre- Trial an d Trial Pro cedures 46 acquitted in most Member States, e.g. in Austria, France, Germany or Italy. Criminal charges will be dismissed in the Netherlands in this case. If the offender is considered to be a danger to the public, in some Member States this would usually result in a referral to psychiatric care (e.g. in Denmark, Italy, Ireland or Luxembourg) whereas in others it would result in prison (e.g. in Greece or the Netherlands). In Member States such as England & Wales and France, both forens ic care or prison are possible options. There are country-specific and sometimes rather complex pathways to either psychiatric care or punishment when a defendant was not suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offence but is ill at the time of the assessment. Obligatory Psychiatric Treatment in Case of Specific Offences Obligatory psychiatric placement or treatment in the case of certain types of crime, whether or not related to a mental disorder, is an unco mmon option in the EU Member States. Treatment programs for sex offenders are available in some Member States in varying quality or quantity; only in France, Belgium (since 1998) and Germany are these programs required by law. However, in these States, these laws are relati vely new and therefore sufficient numbers of special- ised facilities to provide such treatment are still lacking. Furthermore, in Belgium, it is routine practice to provide treatment for drug offenders, although not obligatory by law. Similarly, most Member States provide treatment programs for substance- addicted offenders in prison or in other settings . However, concepts, capacities and inclusion- criteria differ even more than with sex-offenders treatment programs. Sequence of Psy chiatric Placement and Sentence A controversial question in forens ic psychiatry concerns the s equence of forensic placement or treatment orders and prison sentence in cases where both are imposed. In Member States which do not exempt mentally disordered persons from prison placement, the sequence is legally regulated only in seven (Austr ia, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, see table 10). In all others states where joint disposals can be imposed, the sequence is determined in each indi- vidual case at sentence. In routine practice, the availability of forensic hospital beds may have an influence on the matter, according to the exper ts from Greece and Luxembourg collaborating with this study. Tab. 10: Regulations for Sequence of Treatment and Prison Sentence Regulated by law Not regulated by law Not applicable Austria Belgium Germany Italy Netherlands Portugal Spain France* Greece Ireland Luxembourg Sweden Denmark England & Wales Finland * France: sequence regulated by law only in sex offenders Thus, the sequence most frequently followed varies between EU Member States. In Belgium, France and the Netherlands, a prison sentence may be served before admission to a forensic facil- ity. In Germany, Italy and Portugal, forensic ps ychiatric placements precede a prison sentence. However, there are exceptions to the general ru le. In Germany, for instance, the expected treat- ment outcome is a decisive factor in determining the sequence. If a positive result from treatment does not appear realistic, a prison sentence may be served first. The option to serve a prison sen- Resu lts - Pre- Trial an d Trial Pro cedures 47 tence and forensic treatment at the same time is possible in Austria, Gr eece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. In Portugal, this latter opti on is the one most frequently adopted, and only in the case of a need for medical treatment might a sentence be postponed (see table 11). Tab. 11: Most Common Sequence of Psy chiatric Measures and Prison Sentence Prison sentence be- fore forensic treatm ent Treatment before prison sentence Both at the same time Not applicable France Netherlands Germany Italy Portugal Austria Greece Ireland Luxembourg Portugal Spain England & Wales Denmark Finland If both psychiatric treatment and a prison sentenc e are imposed on the mentally ill offender, seven Member States provide for the option to count the duration of psychiatri c treatment towards the period of the sentence, namely Austria, Germ any, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain (table 12). In France, if a mentally ill offender is detai ned under a court order (\"mandat de d\u00e9pot\") before trial or after sentence, and if he has to be placed in a psychiatric hospital during this period (because he needs care during the assessment or is unable to stay in prison under art. D 398 of penal proce- dure code), the duration of treatment is counted to wards the duration of the final prison sentence Tab. 12: Duration of the Treatment Counted Tow ards the Length of Prison Sentence, where Both are Imposed Possible Not possible Not applicable Austria* Germany Ireland Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden* Belgium France Greece Italy Luxembourg Denmark England & Wales Finland * Austria: obligatory Sweden: depending on type and severity of crim e In Austria, 100% of the time spent in treatment is counted towards the time to be served in prison. In the Netherlands, the offender needs to serve at least one third of the sentence. In Germany and Portugal, it depends on the treatment outcome. Howeve r, in Germany, a maximum of two-thirds of the treatment time can be counted towards the sent ence. In Ireland, there are no relevant regula- tions . In Belgium, Greece, Italy and Luxembourg, there is no option for treatment time to be deducted from the length of imprisonment. Here different rationales might apply. For example, in Belgium, treatment is not linked to the prison sent ence and therefore cannot be counted towards it. In England & Wales and Denmark, in cases where there is pre-sentence treatment in hospital but the sentence given is one of imprisonment, time on remand in hospital is counted towards the sen- tence, just as would be the case wi th time spent in a remand prison. Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 48 Forensic Psychiatric Assessment Forensic psychiatric assessment is considered to be a crucial element in the judicial process, influencing all subsequent decisions on sentence, det ention, placement or tr eatment of the person concerned. Quite apart from determining the psychiatric treatment needs of the accused, the forensic psychiat- ric assessment of a suspect constitutes a major link between the criminal justice system and the mental health care system, requiring clear-cut procedures and clearly-defined responsibilities for both systems concerned. The si ze, content and detail of such procedural regulations may constitute a reflection of how important a thor ough psychiatric examination is considered by the various legal frameworks and may speak to the stat e of collaboration between judicial authorities and psychiatric experts. Legal Prerequisites for Forensic Assessment It is perhaps surprising that not all Member States stipulate an examination of the mental state as a legal prerequisite for a trial against a suspect assumed to be mentally ill or disordered. Tab. 13: Assessment of the Mental State as legally defined Prerequisite for a Trial Legally defined Not legally defined Not applicable Austria Belgium France Greece Ireland The Netherlands Portugal Spain Finland Germany Italy Luxembourg Sweden Denmark England & Wales So, in Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg or Sweden, judgements against mentally ill offenders can theoretically be issued without considering the opinion of an expert. However, this would hap- pen only in rare and obvious cases where the cour t's or judge's knowledge or expertise might suf- fice. In the Netherlands, an expert assessment is m andatory only in cases where a so-called \"ter- beschikkingstelling\" (TBS)- or hospital-order is to be imposed1. However, although not being legally mandated, it is common practice in other situations to assess suspects presumed to suffer from mental problems. 1 For details on the terbeschikkingste lling-order see the chapter on the Netherlands in the section \"Concepts and Procedures in the Member States\". Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 49 Denmark and England & Wales are classified here as 'not applicable', since their systems clearly separate the issue of reaching a verdict against a mentally disordered offender from the decision as regards disposal. In both Member States, the responsibility of the cour t during the trial is to decide, whether or not the defendant has committed the offence which he is accused of. Due to the basic philosophy of the common-law tradition, the mental state of a defendant is not relev ant to the decision as to guilt or innocence. So in England & Wales or Denmark, it is the task of an assessing expert to consider the issue of appropriate disposal, but not to form a view on guilt or other judicial concepts. Den- mark additionally refrains from evaluating the ment al state in cases of minor offences threatened with a fine. Scope of Forensic Assessment It is the basic task of any expert conducting a fo rensic assessment to examine and describe the overall medical condition and the mental state of a suspect or defendant. This might be extended to additional medico-legal aspects, among them the abilit y to control one's actions, the issue of in- sight, the degree of dangerousness to the public or t he likelihood of recidivism, which it is common practice to consider in all Member States except Denmark and England & Wales (see tables 14 and 15). The examination of these aspects goes beyond the basic medical tasks of reaching a diagnosis and recommending appropriate treatment. Tab. 14: Evaluation of additional Issu es as Part of the Forensic Assessment Yes No Austria Belgium Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Denmark* England & Wales* * Denmark: The evaluating expert can be asked for a risk assessment, but it is not obligatory England & Wales: Assessments have to contribute evidenc e for a treatment order, that requires the following: a) The person is suffering from a mental disorder \"of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in hospital for medical treatm ent, b) in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment that \"such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration of his condition, c) It is the most suitable method of disposing the case. Criteria for the diagnosis of mental disorders ar e clearly defined, whereas those for deciding on the above-mentioned medico-legal concepts are ill-defi ned and lacking in standardisation. As a conse- quence, this increases the latitude available to anyone asked to assess these aspects, as well as their degree of responsibility for their opinions. This may result in a broader disagreements among experts concerning such issues in a defendant than concerning his basic mental disorder, deter mined by well-established and internationally ac- knowledged diagnostic procedures. Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 50 Forensic Assessment of Specific Crimes Without it being legally stipulated, the mental state of offender s having committed grave crimes (e.g. homicide, infanticide, sexual abuse of child ren, other sexual crimes, repeated arson) is rou- tinely assessed. Similarly, this is done in case of spectacular, bizarre or extremely cruel crimes. Only France provides for the mandatory psychiat ric examination of persons having committed sex offences or other serious crimes listed in the penal code. These crimes are tried by special courts (\"court d'assises\") Whereas legal frameworks do not do so, routine prac tice in the Member States commonly supports a so-called medical model of delinquency, suggesti ng a strong correlation between mental disorder and the probability of committing an offence. Tab.: 15 Additional Conditions or Circumstances to be Assessed Ability to control one's actions Capacity for insight Austria* Belgium Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal Spain Austria Finland France Germany Greece Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal * Austria: Whereas in theory, this is a legal criterion decided by the court or judge, fo r which the expert only has to provide evidence, in rout ine practice this decisi on is made by the expert Connection between Offence and Mental Disorder To consider whether or how an offence relates to a mental disorder in the offender constitutes an essential part of the forensic assessment in many me mber states. In at least two thirds of Member States, the assessing expert has to evaluate the degree to which an offence was influenced by or committed as a direct consequence of a mental illness (see table 16). To provide evidence for a causal correlation often exceeds medical expertise. Clear signs or any defined criteria as to how far a mental diso rder might be connected to offending behaviour are missing. Only in clear-cut cases of severe ps ychotic symptoms (e.g. when an offence was commit- ted under the influence of command auditory halluci nations), a psychiatri c examination would be able to confirm a connection. Most probably, in routine practice a variety of strategies have emerged to deal with this dilemma. When going strictly according to the psychiatric textbook, an assessing expert must often fail to provide evidence for a causal connection between di sorder and offence, and by doing so overesti- mate the responsibility of the offender. As a c onsequence, a considerable proportion of mentally ill offenders might be considered to be mentally well. Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 51 Tab. 16: Correlation of Mental Disorder and Crime Assessment of correlation required Not required Austria Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Netherlands Portugal Spain Belgium Denmark England & Wales Ireland Luxembourg Thus, the varieties of interpretation of the connection between illness and offending may lead to a wide variation in outcomes in terms of sentence or placement decisions. Member States, whose regulations do not requi re evidence of a connection between offending and mental disorder, allow for a much clearer medi cal approach. The most significant stance is adopted in Denmark and England & Wales, where the basic legal philosophy demands treatment for any ill person who is in need of it. Thus, if a defendant is mentally ill and found guilty of a criminal offence, he will be sent to hospital, in lieu of any other punishment. As a consequence, the court will surren- der all power over the case. Th is is likely to occur, even where the defendant was not demonstrably ill at the time of the offence, but has become ill si nce. In this legal cont ext, questions concerning a correlation between offence and mental disorder are redundant. Expert Appointment Differing qualifications, professional training, ex perience and specific skills may all influence the assessment procedure and its outcome. Thus, m anner in which the expert is appointed and the selection criteria play an important role. Tab. 17: Entitled Authority for Appointing the Forensic Expert Court National Agencies Others Austria Belgium France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg The Netherlands Spain Finland* Portugal* Sweden* Denmark* England & Wales* * Denmark: According to defendant's address, in most ca ses the assessment will take place at one of four re- gional centres covering most of the country England & Wales: According to defendant's address Finland: Authority for Medico-legal Affairs Portugal: National Institute of Legal Medicine Sweden: National Board of Forensic Psychiatry Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 52 The court is authorised to select and appoint the a ssessing expert in more than two-thirds of the Member States (see table 17), whereas in Finland, Portugal and Sweden this is the responsibility of national agencies or authorities. Denmark and England & Wales, however, adopt a community approach by appointing the expert according to the defendant's home address. In D enmark, most forensic assessments are con- ducted at four regional forensic centres, coveri ng most of the country, whereas the home counties of the offenders are responsible for forensic care. The community approach is even more to the fore in the case of England & Wales, where hospital admission by court order may only occur upon the recommendation of a psychiatrist who will be treating the person in hospital and only if the hospital agrees to supply a bed. Number of Experts involved into the Assessment Only one-third of the Member States legally defi ne the number of experts having to contribute to a forensic assessment (see table 18). However, any regulation in this area does not encroach upon the right of the defendant to include additional independent experts into the procedure, credited (and often paid by) himself (see chapter Patients' Rights). Tab. 18: Number of Experts Contributing to the Assessment One expert Two experts More than two Not defined Austria France Ireland Sweden* England & Wales The Netherlands Spain* Sweden* Belgium Denmark Finland Germany Greece Italy Luxembourg Portugal * Sweden: one expert in case of \"minor forensic assessments\" , more than two in case of \"major forensic assessment\" Spain: From a legal point of vi ew, at least two experts must be designat ed by the court; in addition, the defendant may propose one or more exper ts paid for by himself The inclusion of more than one expert may increase the quality of a forensic assessment. Flexible regulations in this regard are most clearly seen in Sweden, where a so-called \"minor forensic as- sessment\", which does not even require the participat ion of a psychiatrist, is distinguished from a \"major forensic assessment\", undertaken by a team of psychiatrists, psychol ogists, social workers and nurses. This required participation of four ex perts from different professional backgrounds is unique in the European Union. Particular Professional Background of Experts More than two-thirds of the Member States lega lly require that a trained psychiatrist assess the mental state of a suspect assumed to be menta lly ill (see table 19). In Member States lacking a legal regulation for this, it is common practice fo r psychiatrists to conduct forensic assessments. Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 53 Tab. 19: Particular Professional Background required for Forensic Assessment Psychiatrist Any physician Psychologist/ Behavioural scientist Other Not defined Austria Denmark England & Wales* Finland France Greece Ireland Luxembourg The Netherlands* Portugal Sweden* England & Wales* France The Netherlands* Sweden* Sweden* Belgium Germany Italy Spain* * The Netherlands: The participation of at least two experts with different pr ofessional backgrounds is mandatory. In most cases, this means a psychiatrist and a psychologist. England & Wales: Two physicians contribute to the assessment, of which one has to be a psychiatrist. Sweden: A minor and a major assessment are distinguis hed. Four experts contribute to a major assessment. A psychiatrist is directing, a psychologist, a so cial worker and a nurse are additionally involved. Spain: Usually, one or two psychiatrists are the a ssessing experts, along with the court medical officer. However, other professionals might be involved additionally or instead of these. Due the complex requirements of a forensic a ssessment and to the far reaching consequences it might result in, it might be advantageous to have l egally binding regulations requiring the inclusion of experts from different professi onal backgrounds in any assessment.. Sweden is the Member State providing the most refined procedure in this regard, by having a team of psychologists, social workers and nurses, headed by a psychiatrist, contributing to a so-called \"major forensic assessment\". However, cost c onsiderations might prev ent such sophisticated ap- proaches being adopted in other countries. Certification of Experts / Quality Standards Beyond specifying the professional background of a ssessing experts, the legal regulations of most Member States require little further certificati on or quality standards. However, in Finland, experts have to be licensed by the Authority of Medico-Legal Affairs (TEO). Similarly, in Sweden, the National Board of Forens ic Medicine provides certification, and in Eng- land & Wales, forensic experts have to be approved by the Secretary of St ate under a section of the Mental Health Act. Professional associations from several Member States (e.g. Denmark, Ger- many and the Netherlands) have defined quality standards for forensic psychiatric assessment. A certificate for forensic psychiatric assessm ent has been proposed by the German Society of Psy- chiatry, but it is not yet a mandatory requirement to hold it. Professional Training in Forensic Psychiatry Professional training in forensic psychiatry is in corporated into the university curricula or medical schools of several Member States, but length and quality are rather variable (see table 20). Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 54 Tab. 20: Specialist Training in Forensic Psychiatry Available Not provided England & Wales (3 years) Finland (6 years) Germany (1 year) Portugal (6 months) Austria Belgium Denmark France Greece Italy Ireland Luxembourg The Netherlands Sweden Spain The most elaborate forensic training is offered in Finland (6 years separately from general psychiat- ric training) and England & Wales (3 years after a 3 year education in general psychiatry). Overall, experts from most Member States compla in of an insufficiency or total lack of quality stan- dards in forensic psychiatry. The formal construction and implementation of such standards is an important challenge for the future. Reporting Procedures and Quality Standards The responsibility and involvement of the assessing expert in trial procedures may be indicated by the format in which he or she has to deliver their report to the court. There are some Member States (Denmark, England & Wales, Finland or Sw eden) requiring merely a written report of the assessment (see table 21). In the remaining Mem ber States, the assessing expert has additionally to attend the trial and detail the results verbally. Whereas a written report might rest rict the contribution of the expert to his original professional expertise, giving evidence at court could result in the expert being drawn into a deeper involvement in the judicial procedure. Tab. 21: Reporting Formats of the Assessment of the Mental State Written but no verbal report at trial Written and verbal report at trial Denmark England & Wales Finland Sweden Austria Belgium France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg The Netherlands Portugal Spain Resu lts - F orensic Psych iatric Asse ssment 55 On a legal level, only Sweden defines quality standar ds for the expert report. However, in routine practice, medical associations from most of the Me mber States do provide guidelines or criteria for quality assurance. But these are far from being homogeneous, and international standardisation is missing. Funding Procedures The Ministry of Justice is the most common authority for reimbursi ng the cost of forensic assess- ments. Only in England & Wales and Finland is this t he responsibility of the Ministry of Health. This might indicate that the forensic assessment is widely conceived of as a legal procedure, whereas the subsequent detainment is seen as a res ponsibility of national health authorities. Resu lts - Rea ssessment and Disch arge Procedures 56 Reassessment and Discharge Procedures Most mental disorders are characterised by rather variable courses, requiring regular re- assessment of the mental state in general mental health care, but even more so in forensic cases, where fundamental restrictions on personal liber ty may be connected to a worsened or improved state of health. Consequently, it is of major importance to underst and how detailed national forensic laws regulate psychiatric re-assessment during forensic detentions, as well as t heir time-frames, comprehensive- ness and scope or other crucial conditions. Regular Reassessment of Placement Criteria All Member States bar one stipulate periodic re-a ssessment in their relevant laws. The only exemp- tion is Italy, which seems remarkable, consideri ng the seven-day periods at which re-assessment s have to be repeated in civil detenti on cases. Compared to this, the legal position of forensic pa- tients in Italy seems to be remarkably undefined and much weaker, at least as far as this aspect is concerned.

(see table 22). In some Member States, the re-assessment is the responsibility of the treating psychi atrist, thus allowing the closes t knowledge of treatment progress Resu lts - Rea ssessment and Disch arge Procedures 57 responsibility of the treating psychi atrist, thus allowing the closes t knowledge of treatment progress and the broadest back ground of information to be incorporated in the eval uation of the mental state or the prediction of future progress. However, in the case of lengthy detentions and long-lasting patient -therapist relationships, the risk of under-estimating important aspects (e.g. dangerous ness of the patient) might increase. This is one of the reasons why some Member States entru st third parties or independent psychiatrists with the responsibility for re-assessing the ment al state of forensic patients. This is the case in Greece, Luxembourg, Sweden, Ireland (Mental Health Review Board) and Bel- gium (Social Defence Commission). Austria, Ge rmany and the Netherlands provide mixed regula- tions, allowing for the involvement of independent psychiatrists in the routine procedures (by the treating psychiatrist) in the case of a specif ic court order. In the Netherlands, an independent psy- chiatrist is mandatory in a TBS-detent ion lasting longer than six years. In most Member States, standardised risk asse ssment scales (e.g. PCL-R or HCR-20) are used routinely in forensic practice, although not a legal requirement. Their use appears to be on the increase, as most experts collabor ating in this study confirmed. Tab. 23: Time-frames for Post-trial Reassessment of Mental State Every six months Every one to tw o years Every five to six y ears Belgium* Finland France Ireland Spain Sweden England & Austria: once each year and at any tim e on request of the offender Belgium : reassessm ent every six m onths on request of the detained person or his lawyer England & W ales: treatm ent orders last for six m onths and can be extended for a further six m onths and then annually by the tr eating psychiatr ist. T he cour t is not involved Denm ark: for patients with a placem ent-order a re-a ssessm ent (and court hearing) has to take place at least five years after sentence and afterwards every se cond year (again together with a court hearing). For patients sentenced to inpatient or outpatient tr eatm ent, an instruction from the Prosecutor Gen- eral orders the Regional Departm ents to ask for a re-assessm ent each year. Every six m onths, each forensic patient has the right to ask the pr osecution to bring his case before the court Greece: every second year after the expiration of the m inimum length of placem ent laid down at sentence for the category of dim inished responsibility (article 39 \u00a71): every third year for the category of lack of criminal responsibility (article 70) Luxem bourg: two m onths after adm ission, a report on the mental state has to be written by the psychiatrist in charge and m ust be forwarded to the Special Com mission. W here the placem ent continues, a re- exam ination is scheduled annually The Netherlands: psychiatrist from the treatm ent facilit y every year, independent psychiatris t after six years. TBS (see chapter \"The Netherlands\" ) has to be im posed for tw o years. Afterwards the court can extend TBS for a further one or two years each tim e Time-frames for Reassessment Time frames for regular re-assessments of the mental state of a person in forensic care vary con- siderably between Member States, reflecting differi ng concepts of forensic care within Europe. Clusters of Member States which might indicate common medical or criminological criteria for up- per limits cannot be detected (see table 23). Howeve r, from the human rights point of view, a com- mon definition of time-frames for regular re -assessment of the ment al state would appear desirable. Resu lts - Rea ssessment and Disch arge Procedures 58 Obligatory Assessment Prior to Discharge It might seem somewhat surprising that three Me mber States (England & Wales, Italy and Spain) do not legally stipulate an assessment of the mental state of a for ensic patient prior to imminent discharge (see table 24). This is particularly so, when one considers the public sensitivity to the potential threat from discharged ment ally ill or disordered offenders. However, these legal omissions do not necessar ily indicate that careless discharges happen in practice in these Member States, where form al assessments most probably take place even when legal stipulations are absent. However, this finding suggests at least that conditi ons or criteria for the termination of forensic placements are much less formalised in some Mem ber States than are the criteria for initiating placement or treatment. Tab. 24: Obligatory Assessment of Mental State Prior to Discharge Stipulated by law Not stipulated by law Austria* Belgium Denmark* Finland France* Germany Ireland Greece Luxembourg The Netherlands Portugal Sweden* England & Wales Italy Spain * Austria: independent expert when ordered by court, rout ine practice in case of discharge recom mendation (\"discharge suggested\" ) by for patients with placem ent order France: discharge only when two experts in separate assessm ents agree Sweden: a person who has com mitted a crim e under t he influence of a severe m ental disorder m ay be sen- tenced to forensic care with an order for special assessm ent prior to discharge when there is any risk of relapsing into crim inal behav iour. The patient can only be released after a trial before a County Administrative Court Appropriateness of Length of Forensic Placement It may be a matter of debate among legal experts, whet her or how the length of a forensic place- ment should relate to the upper limits of the prison sentence that could have been imposed if the offender were not suffering from a mental disorder. There may be arguments from a judicial as well as from a human rights perspective not to dismiss as inappropriate the idea of equivalence between t he length of a forensic placement and the sever- ity of the offence or the maximum term of impr isonment it would carry. This may be of increasing importance the longer a forensic placement lasts, in that it may last longer than any prison sen- tence would have for the crime in question. However, equivalence does not appear to be a criter ion for deciding on time of discharge from fo- rensic placements in most of the Member States. The majority seem to favour a more medical per- spective, emphasising the treatment needs of the pati ent and safety issues as criteria in discharge decisions. (see table 25). Resu lts - Rea ssessment and Disch arge 25: Equiv alence betw een Sev erity of Offence and Length of Stay as Decisiv e Crite- ria for Timing of Discharge from Forensic Placement Yes No Germany Ireland Italy Portugal Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales Finland* France Greece Luxembourg Netherlands Spain Sweden * Finland: not legally defined but in r outine practice equiva lence is considered Conditional Discharge or Discharge on Licence Conditional discharges and discharges on licence from forensic placements are part of a concept of graded re-integration of mentally disordered offenders into society. After what may have been a lengthy period of detention under conditions of strict security, it is understandable that a forensic patient may need a ssistance and close monitoring for a certain pe- riod of time after discharge, before a final decisi on is taken to remove additional restrictions im- posed on him. Legal regulations for conditional discharges or di scharges on licence offer the opportunity to take measures to assist the patient and to protect t he public in the event of subsequent deterioration in the patient's mental health or a perceived increas e in the risk of danger to the public. There are three Member States which do not provide spec ific regulations for conditional discharges or discharge on licence in their respective forensic laws (Ireland, Italy and Sweden, see table 27), whereas laws in the remaining Member States' in clude this as an option. In some Member States, e.g. in Portugal, conditional discharge is linked to the duration of the sentence, whereas it is only in Austria and Germany that discharges from forensic care only are always conditional (see table 27). Tab. 26: Times-frames for Discharge on Licence / Conditional Discharge Member State Time frames Austria five years for offences threatened wi th a sentence less than ten years ten years for offences threatened wi th a sentence longer than ten years Finland Six months at a time Germany Two to five years Portugal remaining duration of sentence Netherlands one year (TBS with mandatory hospitalisation); one third of an additional prison sentence can be conditional (in case of a sentence from one year to three years ). Spain up to a maximum of five years whenev er compulsory out-patient treat- ment has been ordered.

It is an issue of some dispute in most Me mber States and receives a considerable degree of public attention. This is often reinforced by spec tacular cases which attract intense media coverage and prompt intense discussion as to whether the patients' needs for treatment and reintegration into society are properly balanced with the need to ensure public safety. It is particularly in this context that the dual status of a mentally ill or disordered offender becomes evident, in that he or she is on the one hand a patient in the mental health care system and on the other an offender within the criminal justice system. Right to Appeal The most crucial patient right concerns mec hanisms of appeal. The overall right to appeal against detention is granted to mentally disordered offender s in all Member States, thus according with basic human rights principles. The question here is at which stages of the process appeal mecha- nisms are open to a mentally ill offender. The variable and complex procedures in the Member States incorporate a range of starting points for appeals during the various stages of the criminal justice process. Whereas the right to appeal against a verdict is unquestioned throughout the European Union, not all Member States consider pre-trial assessment or placement procedures as being eligible for appealing (see table 28). Tab. 28: Right to Appeal Right to appeal against Member States yes Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal no Austria, England & Wales, Franc e, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden pre-trial as- sessment not applicable Belgium, Denmark yes Austria, Denmark, Finland, Fr ance, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal pre-trial placement no Belgium, England & Wales, Spain, Sweden Due to the provisional character of a pre-tria l assessment or detention, appeals for mentally ill suspects in some Member States may fall under t he same regulations as for civilly committed per- sons, as is the case for instance in Finland. Appeals against issues of minor importance, e.g. denied leave requests, are also permitted. Usu- ally these are filed and decided at lower judicial or administrative levels, e.g. by the director of the respective facility. Resu lts - Pati ents' Rig hts 62 Legal Right to a Second Expert Opinion One of the most crucial rights during trial proc edures concerns the defendant's right to a second expert opinion in order to engage in and have a certai n level of control over the assessment proce- dures and thus the long-lasting consequences that may arise. This right is explicitly stipulated in several Member States (e.g. England & Wales, the Netherlands or Sweden in case of a major forensic assessmen t, see chapter \"Forensic psychiatric assessment\") and at least addressed in the respecti ve codes or laws in others. Most probably, Member States that do not explicitly stipulate th is option in law, do accommodate this option. However, an obstacle here might be t hat, in these countries, the government will not cover the cost of a second opinion . Tab. 29: Right for an Independent Expert covered by Law Addressed by law Not addressed by law Belgium England & Wales Greece Italy Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Austria Denmark* Germany France Finland * Denmark: The Medico-Legal Council as a consultative medical board gives medical and pharmaceutical opinions in legal cases. The statements of the Council re st on experts who are independent of the parties in- volved and of financial interest. Only courts and public authorities can ask for the opinion of the Council but the defence can approach the Medico-Legal Council through the court or the prosecution. Assigned Counsel against Defendants Will In trials against mentally ill defendants the role of the defence counsel is of utmost importance. The appointment of an assigned counsel against the defendant 's will is possible in two-thirds of all Member States (see table 30). In the Netherl ands, however, a suspect presumed mentally disor- dered who has been in pre-trial custody is assi gned a defence counsel by the government, which he is able to refuse. But that happens very rarely. Trial without Defence Counsel In only four Member States is the option available to proceed with a trial without a defence counsel, namely in England & Wales, Germany, the Nether lands and Portugal (see table 31). However, it needs to be born in mind that in most Member States there are no special regulations regarding mentally ill defendants. Therefore, the case of a mentally ill defendant standing trial without any defence counsel is rare and more of a theoretical option. A nd, as it is the case in England & Wales, courts are cautious about letting mentally ill defendants defend themselves and usually grant this option only after psychiatric expert evidence has confirmed the defendant's fitness to plead and capability to represent himself.

Civil Rights and long-lasting Restrictions for Mentally Ill Offenders In some of the member states, there is special refe rence in national legislation to restrictions on the rights of mentally ill offenders, most ly for reasons of safety. In the Netherlands, specific civil rights are less restricted for mentally ill non-offenders t han for TBS-patients e.g. regarding communication with the outside world or the care of children. A different picture can be seen in Austria. Here , prisoners with sentences of more than one year loose their right to vote. In contrast to this, ment ally ill offenders \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" (\u00a7 21,1 Austrian penal law) have the right to vote. However, mentally ill offenders who are criminally responsible (\u00a7 21,2 Austrian penal law) and who re ceive a prison sentence plus a criminal com- mitment for an indefinite period of time do not have the right to vote, even after having finished the prison sentence. Nevertheless, apart from the abov e mentioned exception of Austria, there are no long-term restrictions on mentally ill offenders fo llowing the release from prison and/or the comple- tion of forensic treatment in any of the Member States. Leave Regulations for Mentally Ill Offenders One of the most crucial questions which receives a considerable amount of public and media atten- tion and is a regular topic of controversy and discussion is that of leave conditions for mentally ill offenders. This issue highlights the special and sometimes contradictory aims of forensic- psychiatric care for mentally disordered offenders. On the one hand, the aim is to re-integrate the patient into society, which requires treatment c onditions \"as normal as possible\" including leaves; on the other hand, attention must be given to pr otecting the public and preventing re-offending by Resu lts - Pati ents' Rig hts 64 the persons concerned. Thus, various forms of leav es from forensic facilit ies are permitted for men- tally disordered offenders in all Member States, although these are regulated on variable judicial or administrative levels. Leaves may include escorted and unescorted leaves on the prem ises of the treating facility, escorted and unescorted leaves outside the premises of the treating facility, escorted and unescorted over-night stays off t he premises of the treating facility. In Greece, escorted and unescorted ov er-night stays off the premises of the forensic psychiatric facility are unknown. In Spain, the concepts of une scorted leave on the premises of the facility as well as escorted overnight stays off the premis es are unknown: mentally ill offenders may go on leave for week-ends or for one or more weeks. It should be noted that, in Denmark, leave regula- tions are only relevant for patients with a placement order. Leave Concepts explicitly Named in National Laws Although being a controversial issue, leave regulati ons are only addressed in national legislation in about one third of all Member States, namely in Au stria, Denmark (for pat ients with a placement order) England & Wales, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. In England & Wales, for example, \"leave of absence from hospita l\" is explicitly dealt with and, in addition, the Mental Health Act also contains an advisory code, which gives more specific details as to good practice in certain leave types. However, the C ode does not have the force of law. The Dutch law specifically refers to unescorted and escorted leav e as well as overnight stay and group leave. In Germany, federal enforcement laws provide for regul ations differing from Federal State to Federal State. Deciding Authority over Leave Request A highly controversial issue refers also to t he decision-making on a leave request, since this is perceived by the general public and the media as an indicator of how far the need for public secu- rity is considered. In most Member States, it is the medical institution which decides on leave re- quests by mentally ill offenders, including various forms of unescorted leave (see table 32). Natu- rally, the court plays a more prominent role when it comes to more extended forms of leave, such as over-night stays outside t he premises (see table 33).

Only in Denmark are patients placed in the high-security facility generally not granted any form of leav e outside the premises. However, these cases number up to 15 of the most dangerous patients among a total of approximately 1,400 forensic patients. Nevertheless, the detailed regulations suggest s ensible and responsible leave procedures across the Member States, which allow for detaining m entally disordered offenders considered as ex- tremely dangerous without loosening security measures for long periods or even permanently. Application of Treatment against the Will A disputed issue concerning the rights of mentally ill patients is that of compulsory treatment against the person's will. Such compulsory treatment is possible in 12 Member States (table 34). It has to be kept in mind that, in most Member Stat es, the relevant regulations are defined in the na- tional health acts and concern both forensic as we ll as civilly committed patients, this being the case for example in Denmark and in Finland. Neve rtheless, certain treatments, although defined in the national mental health acts, are hardly appli ed in practice. In Finland, for instance, anti- hormonal therapy and ECT are usually applied only with the consent of the patient, although the law theoretically allows for their involuntary applicat ion. In France, no treatm ent is specified by the law, which only refers to the placement against a patient's will. However, in routine practice, placement allows the imposition of treatment against a patient's will. In Ireland, there is no specific legal consideration of treatment, except for psychosurgery which can only be undertaken with the consent of the Mental Health Commission, and for ECT which can only be administered to an involuntary patient if it is deemed essential for the health and welfare of the patient by two consultant psychiatrists. However, medication cont inuously given to an involuntary patient by a consultant for a period longer t han three months must be reviewed by an independent consultant psychiatrist. This would include anti- hormonal treatment. In practice, despite legal au- thorisation to administer these treatments to in voluntary patients under the conditions specified, consultants would be very hesit ant to deploy such treatments unless the patient gave informed consent and would only disregard a refusal if there were strong clinical grounds for the treatment, such as for the safety of the pati ent or others, thought to be at risk.

Treatment of Mentally Ill Offenders In most Member States, treatment of mentally ill offenders differs from treatment of mentally ill non- offenders suffering from the same mental disorder only in terms of security measures. Additional differences can be found in Austria and Finland with specific legal conditions for applying or termi- nating a treatment. In Germany and the Netherlands , the targeted results of treatments may vary. Treatment of mentally ill offenders aims additiona lly to reduce dangerousness or the risk of recidi- vism, which may affect treatment strategies. As reported by the experts from Belgium and France participating in this study, treatment standards in these countries are generally lower for mentally ill offenders than for civilly committed patients. So, with the exception of Germany and the Netherl ands, there are no specific legal indicators to be found which may reflect the double function of forensic care for mentally ill or disordered offenders, which includes crime-prevention. On a judicial basis , the majority of Member States seem to trust that psychiatric treatment will automatically be likely to diminish the risk of future offending. This is a particular medical concept which some might cl aim to be no longer in line with empirical evi- dence. The application of well-established cr iminal-therapeutic approaches (e.g. reasoning and rehabilitation programmes) seems to be rather scarc e. Several experts contributing to this study declared standards of forensic care in many Me mber States to be lower than in general mental health care, although they should be considerably higher in this sensitive and controversial field. Resu lts - Service Pro vision 67 Service Provision The configuration and delivery of services for mentally ill offenders is influenced by the need to balance the interests of public safety against those of individual rights and treatment needs. Thus provision of forensic services in the EU Member States (and worldwide) tends to reflect national legal frameworks in terms of the respective emphases that national laws or statutes place on such considerations. As a specialised sector of mental health care, fo rensic psychiatry has inevitably been affected to some degree by the changes in this field over t he last four decades. However, varying degrees of involvement in the reform process have resulted in the emergence of varied models of forensic care across Europe. Some Member States have integr ated their forensic services quite tightly into the general mental health care system, wher eas other countries have developed separate ar- rangements for the care of mentally ill offenders, which are set apart from general psychiatry. Definition and Classification Problems All Member States use specialist forensic facilities, general mental health care services and the prison system to place and treat mentally ill or disordered persons who have committed minor or serious offences. The degree of involvement of eac h of these sectors and their individual patterns of usage differ widely throughout the EU. In addition, within each of these sectors, different Member States provide a variety of service-types which differ cons iderably with regard to organisa- tion as well as to quantity or intensity of care. In England & Wales, for example, there is no absolut e division of hospitals or wards into forensic and non-forensic, and there are no forensic hospitals within the pris on service. Local psychiatric hospitals and secure \"forensic\" hospitals treat both general and forensic patients and do so on the same wards. On the other hand, in Germany, all forensic hospitals are clearly separated from gen- eral psychiatric inpatient services. The responsibility for forensic care and even the designation of forensic facilities differs across the Member States, complicating any attempt to def ine categories for cross-national overviews or comparisons. In Austria, for example, despite it s being directed by a psychiatrist and fulfilling hospi- tal functions, the national forensic facility answers to the Ministry of Justice and is known as a \"Justizanstalt\", which is the common Austrian designation for prisons. Even more confusing is the fact that the major forensic facilities in Spain are referred to as \"Psychiatric Penitentiary Hospitals\", a label suggesting the combining of correctional and security aspects with medical function. A consistent, Europe-wide system of classification for forensic facilities based on functional criteria would be preferable for a number of purposes, in cluding research or health-reporting. Unfortu- nately, no such system currently exists. Facilities and Services for Mentally Ill or Disordered Offenders Overviews or typologies of forensic services in the Member States must take account of differ- ences in legal concepts between states, as well as of the different stages in the legal process through which a person passes, when suspected of, or found to have committed, a crime whilst mentally disordered. All these factors determine the type of det ention ordered and the type of ser- vice concerned. The type of detenti on is influenced principally by the stage in the legal process (pre- or post-trial) Resu lts - Service Pro vision 68 the legal status of the person concer ned - whether a suspect, defendant, convicted person, detained person or a patient, and the criminal responsibility of a m entally ill or disordered offender. Tab. 35 Post-trial Placement of Mentally Ill or Disordered Offenders (whose Criminal Responsibility is Diminished or w ho are Non-Responsible) General psy chiatric facilities Specialist forensic facilities (forensic hospitals, forensic w ards) Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales* Finland France Germany* Greece Ireland* Netherlands Portugal Sweden Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales* Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy* Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden * England & W ales: criminal responsibility is not an applicable c oncept, except in hom icide cases; the level of security and the need for treatm ent are the m ajor placem ent criteria Germany: the overall concept fores ees the separate placem ent of m entally ill offenders in forensic facilities.

As an overall category, this includes spe- cialist forensic hospitals, specialist forensic wards in psychiatri c hospitals or even - as a rare option - specialist forensic departments or wards within general hospitals. Although such placements are used most frequently post-trial, they may also be used for mentally ill or disordered persons who have yet to c ome to trial. All 15 Member States included in this study provi ded data about their forensic facilities , with re- spect to admission criteria, organisational featur es, quality of care, bed numbers and patient char- acteristics. There were wide variations. Some of the less populous Member States (e.g., Luxem- bourg, Ireland and Austria) have one central forensic hospital that serves the whole country and which might be supplemented by minor forensic ca re capacities in general psychiatric hospitals, whereas more populous Member States (e.g., Germany ) are characterised by a diversity of foren- sic provision. For capacity (i.e. numbers of fa cilities and beds) see below and in the various na- tional chapters. Mentally ill offenders who have committed serious offences and who are being held as criminally non-responsible (in so far as this concept is applic able in individual Member States) constitute the Resu lts - Service Pro vision 69 core clientele of forensic facilities, although there ar e some exceptions to this rule, most often for reasons of bed availability or security. Tab. 36 Placement of Dangerous Mentally Ill Patients (Non-Offenders) in Forensic Facili- ties Placement of mentally ill or disordered non-offenders in forensic facilities Denmark England & Wales Finland France Greece Ireland Netherlands* Sweden * The Netherlands: not in TBS hospitals, but in forensic psychiatric hospitals and in forensic departm ents of general psychiatric hospitals (for details see chapter for the Netherlands) A substantial proportion of Member States (Fin land, France, Ireland, England & Wales, Sweden, see table 36) admit aggressive, violent or \"high risk\" non-offending mentally ill individuals to foren- sic facilities. This is done most often under civil detent ion orders, but this is not necessarily so in all cases. Amongst these countries, Finland, in not r equiring an offending history as a major criterion for admission, has adopted one of the most straight-forward approaches, taking illness-related dangerous or destructive behaviour as the major criterion for admission to forensic care. General Psy chiatric Facilities During the pre-trial phase, it is common in most Member States for offenders suspected of being mentally disordered to be admitted to general psychi atry hospitals on a short-term basis (e.g. for assessment purposes). Post-trial, admissions to t he non-forensic wards of general psychiatric hos- pitals are rare in most states, especially as far as criminally non-responsible patients are con- cerned. But only Italy, Luxembourg and Spain explic itly exclude these patients from post-trial placement in general mental health care facilities. The situation is different in countries that do not apply the concept of criminal responsibility, like England & Wales, Ireland and Sweden, or for Member States that give priority to the need for treatment as a placement criterion, such as Finland and Denmark. In these countries, security considerations or the availability of treatment places may influence a decision for placement in general psychiatry. In Ireland, however, mentally ill offenders are admitted to general mental health care facilities only when they are unfit to plead. In England & Wales, only psychiatric hospital ser- vices in the area of residence are entitled to admi t, a form of community-centred forensic approach. Unfortunately, it was not possible to examine forensic provision in general psychiatric wards as part of this study, either in Member States whic h apply the concept of criminal responsibility in fo- rensic care or in those which do not. This was because very limited data were available to exam- ine. It is therefore difficult to draw any firm conc lusions about the overall quality of forensic care in general psychiatry wards. Post-t rial placement of forensic pat ients on general psychiatric wards might be evidence of positive featur es - the existence of a wide range of psychiatric provision or of an integrated treatment approach (where sufficient se rvices are available, both in general mental health care and in the forensic sector). But it could also mask a shortage of places in specialised forensic care and a shift of the burden to general psychiatry, which may often be poorly placed to offer appropriate treatment or security. See the flow charts in the national chapters for estimates of forensic bed numbers in general mental health care in the various Member States. Resu lts - Service Pro vision 70 Outpatient Forensic Care Although outpatient care is today an integral part of general mental health care, specialist outpa- tient care for forensic patients is underdeveloped. Follow-up may be usual in many Member States or indeed mandatory in the case of probation order s, conditional discharge or as a general after- care measure, but specialist services are usually lacking. Only Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands currently provide forens ic outpatient services as a spec ific post-trial measure (for Aus- tria see footnote of table 37). The Netherlands ar e the most well-provisioned Member State in this regard, equipping each forensic hospi tal (TBS facility) with an outpati ent unit to provide forensic outpatient and aftercare, in addition to such highly specialised services as forensic home-treatment or forensic sheltered accommodation (see table 37). In some countries (e.g., Italy), informal types of forensic outpatient care are implemented, when criminally non-responsible mentally ill offenders representing no public threat are cared for on a voluntary basis by community mental health services. Currently there is a debate among experts in Engl and & Wales, with many considering forensic outpatient treatment as far preferable. Sim ilar debates may occur among experts from other Member States. In terms of reintegration and rehab ilitation, this is considered to be a major area for future reform of forens ic care systems. Tab. 37 Availability of Specialist Serv ices for Forensic Outpatient Treatment Specialist forensic outpatient serv ices Austria* Belgium Germany Netherlands * Austria: only for treatm ent during leaves, after disc harge or in case of conditional crim inal com mitment Forensic Services for Offenders w ith Specific Mental Disorders Where Member States offer forensic services for offenders with specific mental disorders, these services in most cases concern substance abuse. Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands currently offer such substance abuse services fo r offenders. Specific di agnosis-related treatment programmes may also be available for forensic patients in other Member States, but most often only as part of wider treatment programmes in general psychiatric hospital se rvices, forensic units or prison services (e.g., so-called \"drug-free units\" in Portuguese penitentiaries or the Eleon Institution in Attica, Greece). Treatment for sex offenders is also provided in so me Member States, but these usually are of lim- ited capacity, and usually part of more general pris on-based programmes (e.g., in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England & Wales, Germany and Spain). Due to unclear definitions and differences between Member States as to whether disorders of sex- ual preference are included as a legal criterion for forensic placement orders, no overview is in- cluded here. Resu lts - Service Pro vision 71 Tab. 38 Availability of Specialist Forensic Serv ices for Specific Disorders or Patient Groups Specialist forensic serv ices for substance-abusing offenders Austria Belgium* Germany Netherlands * Belgium : only outpatient treatm ent program mes Prison Services Prison services are the most crucial sector and t he most difficult to describe when evaluating pro- cedures for the placement of mentally ill offender s across the Member States. All Member States that apply the concept of criminal responsibility in their jurisdiction place mentally ill or disordered persons who are held fully responsible for their o ffences in prison services or penitentiaries. How- ever, that does not necessarily mean that special prison wards or adequate psychiatric treatments for such people are indeed available. Tab. 39 Prison Placement of Mentally Ill or Disordered Offenders Criminally responsible mentally ill offenders (if concept is applicable) During pre-trial or transitional periods prior to final placement Austria Belgium Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Italy Netherlands Portugal Spain Austria Belgium Denmark England & Wales Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden * Luxem bourg: data not available Prior to trial, prison services are considered acceptable and are used by most of the Member States for detaining offenders suspected of sufferi ng from a mental illness or disorder, e.g., for assessment purposes or during transitional periods until the final placement is ordered. In Portugal, however, the court is never entitled to place in prison a person who is suspected of being mentally ill; instead the individual is placed in a specialist fo rensic facility, even if the mental state of the suspect has been not assessed by an expert. Resu lts - Service Pro vision 72 Post-trial placement of crimina lly non-responsible mentally ill offenders in a prison is hardly a legal option across the European Union. Ho wever, exemptions to this general rule are not as rare as might be expected. In several Member States, limit ed capacities in forensic facilities may determine the placement in prison of people fulfilling the legal criteria for specialist for ensic treatment. Such a practice has been reported during this evaluation by Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Greece and The Netherlands. Other Member States pr obably experience similar capacity problems. People who have committed serious crimes and who are suffering from psychiatric disorders not legally qualifying them for forensic care are us ually given prison-sentences. However, exclusion criteria for psychiatric disorder vary throughout the Member States. Most often excluded are the non-psychotic mental illnesses, substance abuse disorders, personality disorders or disorders of sexual preference (see chapter \"Legislation and Key Concepts\"). Individuals suffering from these disorders impose a heavy burden on prison systems. It is likely that there is a serious under- provision of psychiatric services for such condi tions. However, a thorough evaluation of the situa- tion of mentally disordered prison inmates ac ross the European Union is lacking and seems to be overdue. Forensic Bed Capacities Any valid indicator for comparing forensic care capacities across the Member States would provide a very useful tool for research or service-planni ng purposes. However, variations in definition of forensic beds and considerable, yet unknown number s of undeclared beds for mentally ill offenders in general psychiatry or the prison system are se rious methodological obstacles to calculating fo- rensic bed rates or any such indicators. Consequent ly, recent studies to develop a set of European mental health indicators do not include any estimate s of forensic care capacity (Korkeila et al. 2003). Despite the lack of common definiti ons, this study attempts to quantif y specific beds for the care of mentally ill offenders across the Member States in order to describe and compare the relative weight of national forensic se ctors across the Member States. Thus, for each Member State for which data was available the total number of declared forensic beds (for pre- and/or post-trial placement) and the number of declared forensic beds per 100,000 population (forensic bed-rate) were calculated. To calculate these estimates, the most recent data on the population of t he Member States were gathered from the Internet. However, time frames differ slightly. Population figures in most cases refer to 2001, whereas the reference years fo r forensic beds may vary from 1998 to 2003. Additional problems of definition have to be cons idered. Beds on psychiatric or general prison wards were not included in the estimates, although some Member States may occasionally use prison placements for detaining criminally non-res ponsible offenders due to shortages in specialist facilities. Unspecified forensic beds in general ps ychiatric hospitals could be identified for some Member States and were included in the total number of forensic beds, whereas for others the undeclared or unspecified capacities in general ment al health care facilities could not be quantified and thus were left out. Overall, estimates in table 40 or figure 1 sugges t a north-south divide within the European Union, with remarkable differences between similarly populous countries in Central and Southern Europe (e.g., Austria or Belgium compared to Portugal, or Spain compared to England & Wales). Low fo- rensic capacities in Italy, Portugal, Spain or Greec e might reflect a different concept of mental health care in those countries, commonly characte rised by low numbers of hospital beds in general psychiatry, home-based care and a considerable bur den on the families of the mentally ill. How- ever, it is doubtful whether general mental health ca re conditions in these countries also affect forensic service provision, given the rather different security c onsiderations and other requirements of forens ic care.

The poor reliability of current indicators should al ways be kept in mind, and caution exercised in drawing any conclusions or making comparisons of capacity between Member States. E.g. the low forensic bed rate in France is due to the specific practice of placing ment ally ill offenders under civil detention regimes which prevents from declaring spec ific forensic beds as is done in other Member States. So, table 40 and figure 1 were included here only as a proposal for future indicators of forensic care, and would require much improved and harmonis ed basic data from the Member States. For a Resu lts - Service Pro vision 74 more detailed description of forensic service provision in the Member States, see the national chapters.

Finland France Germany GreeceItaly Ireland Netherlands Portugal Spain Sweden Certification and Supervision of Forensic Facilities Responsibility for funding, supervising and regulating forensic facilities differs across the Member States. Regulation and supervision of facilities and of treatment are a means of quality control. Although levels and intensity of regulation and supervision may vary across the European Union, one indication as to whether the main emphasis in forensic care in a given country is upon the medical or the procedural aspects (e.g., security aspects) may lie in whether the responsibility for supervision or regulation lies with the judicial authorit ies, (e.g., the Ministry of Justice) or with a health agency (e.g., the Ministry of Health).

The reimbursement of forensic care by Justice Departments, may cause some problems, e.g. by setting financial incentives for exporting into for ensic care mentally ill individuals who have commit- ted only minor offences or who are merely aggr essive. This paradoxical and stigmatising effect, which is likely to undermine the integration of forensic and general psychiatric care, has been ob- served at least in Austria (Schanda et al. 2000).

In The Netherlands, the majority of forensic institutions (five out of nine TBS- hospitals) are in private ownership. In Spain, out of the three large national psychiat ric penitentiary hospitals, the one in Catalonia is privately run, whereas in England & Wales privat e forensic units are used by the NHS only where no beds are available in its own facilities. In E ngland and Wales, on the other hand, the intention is to phase out private involvement in forensic care by building more forensic units within the National Health Service. Some Federal States in Germany currently plan to privatis e federal forensic facili- ties. Preventive Detention In many countries, preventive detent ion following forensic treatment of or the completion of prison sentences by mentally ill or mentally non-dist urbed offenders who are considered to be extremely dangerous or resistant to treatment is a topic of discussion. The measure is seen as a specific means of enhancing public safety and reducing the risk of re-offending. Most commonly, such measures are advocated by public opinion or mass media campaigns, especially in the aftermath Resu lts - Service Pro vision 76 of spectacular crimes committed by mentally ill or disordered persons. Many experts consider pre- ventive detention to be a most delicate subject, likely seriously to tip the balance between public safety and the human rights of the persons concerned if it is not applied with special care and ac- cording to clearly defined legal criteria. Tab. 43 Forensic Facilities in the Priv ate Sector Private-sector running of forensic facilities (partial or total) Forensic facilities completely run by na- tional or federal agencies Belgium England & Wales Germany (planned) Netherlands Spain Austria Denmark Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg Portugal Sweden Although criteria or legal procedures may differ, preventive detention is cu rrently implemented in some Member States. E.g. in Denmark, unlim ited detention is possible in cases of dangerous non- psychotic mentally ill offenders. The measure is ordered at trial. Preventive detention after comple- tion of a prison sentence or a treatment order is not provided in Denmark, however. In several Member States that do not recognise the concept of preventiv e detention, civil commit- ment laws may provide a legal means of c ontinuing detention of danger ous patients who have served prison sentences in full or have been discharged from forensic facilities (e.g., in the Nether- lands).

The frequency of life-long forensic placements differs, although in general it does not occur very often. Modalities might vary also. For instance, in England & Wales, life-l ong orders when imposed may allow compulsory su- pervision of patients in the community after di scharge and allow recall to hospital when they re- lapse, whereas in other Member States, life-l ong forensic care means an uninterrupted inpatient stay in a forensic facility. In Spain, where life-long forensic care is unknow n, most forensic patients are transferred to gen- eral psychiatric hospitals for continued treatment on an involuntary basis after their stay in a foren- sic hospital. However, security and capacity probl ems in general psychiatry increase the risk of quick discharges of or esc apes by these patients.

Even data on indicators as simple as the number of court trials or decisions against mentally ill offenders are largely unavailable. Usually, there is no national register linking the forens ic psychiatric sector with the judicial authorities or even the na- tional health services. Even Member States renowned for their case-registers in general psychiatry (e.g. Denmark) seem to be rather inconsistent in entries on the legal status of registered patients. Only Sweden and the Netherlands obviously run o fficial nation-wide data bases which could be classified as forensic case registers. Thus, in many Member States, relevant data may be spread among various authorities like the Ministry of Justice, the National Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Health, the police or other agencies. Moreover, variations in definitions and conflicting classificati on systems frequently con- fuse information for calculating annual frequencies of forensic cases or other basic indicators, even within individual Member States. Methodological pr oblems multiply when trying to compare forensic frequencies or rates over time or across countri es. Unfortunately, recent proposals for a European set of mental health indicators omitted to incl ude estimates for forensic care, which would probably have promoted international standardisation. All in all, similarly to forensic service provisi on across the EU (see chapter \"Service Provision\"), there are serious obstacles to pan-European compar ison of legal outcomes with mentally ill of- fenders at the moment. Nevertheless, during this study, it was possible to assemble more or less consistent data for several basic indicato rs. These are presented in this chapter. Data was taken from a variety of sources. When available, official statistics were used. In some cases, this information was cross-checked with results from national studies. Due to the aforemen- tioned methodological and definitional problems, the re liability of figures from these sources may be reduced, and in a number of Member States, fi gures cannot be taken as being exact, but must be considered only as an approximation. This is the case, for instance, for Finland or Germany, where national statistics do not cover East Germ an Federal States from the former German De- mocratic Republic, and therefore were weighted by a population factor (see footnote to table 46). Unless otherwise stated, figures below relate to court-confirmed mentally ill offenders with dimin- ished responsibility or lacking in criminal respons ibility (where the concept is applicable) who are detained under forensic treatment orders or simila r legal regimes. Mentally disordered offenders judged to be criminally responsible are not included. All national definitions were harmonised as much as possible according to this basic dist inction, but nonetheless may differ more or less across the Member States. Conclusions must be drawn rather cautiously. Frequency of Forensic Cases across the Member States A basic epidemiological indicator for evaluating l egal concepts and the outcome of judicial proce- dures against mentally ill offenders is the annual number of cases in forensic care.

Given the large differences in population size, to tal numbers of forensic cases differ widely across the Member States (see table 46 or figure 2). Although comparing these figures across national boundaries would not be valid, national time-series a llow some conclusions at least to be drawn on trends or tendencies within each country. Resu lts - Ep idemio logy 80 In this regard, some characteristic patte rns can be detected. Throughout the 1990s, the annual number of cases (point-prevalence) in Germany , the most populous Member State, was much greater than the level in other Member States (see figure 2). Unfortunately, the German National Bureau of Statistics registers only data from West -German Federal States. To get nationwide esti- mates, for each year 21% was added according to the proportion of inhabitants in East-German Federal States. Moreover, the German figures presented here would have been more complete if offenders suffering from addiction disorders placed in forensic custody (according to \u00a7 64 StGB) had been included. These offenders have been omitt ed here for purposes of harmonising case definition. If they are added in, German figures in crease by approximately 30 to 50 % (prevalence) or by 120 to 150 % (incidence).

Resu lts - Ep idemio logy 81 These differing patterns do not suggest a common trend for the Member States during the 1990s. Most probably, national figures depend on a variet y of influences, which have to be analysed sepa- rately for each country. However, any consist ent relationship between numbers and external fac- tors is hard to identify. For instance, the decline of forensic cases in Italy until 1998 was partly paralleled by a dramatic increase in the rate of imprisonment in Ita ly, where the prison population doubled from 1990 to 1994. This was mainly due to a change in legal provisions about drug crimes. However, a stagna- tion in the number of prison-inmates after 1994 - when forensic cases decreased still further - pre- vents clear-cut conclusions being drawn about any interdependency between the two phenomena. The situation in other Member States is similarl y complex, usually lacking clear explanation. Thus, there is an urgent need for facing the challenge of identifying and analysing factors influencing forensic prevalence for eac h country separately.

Rates range widely, from 21.7 (Denmark in 1999) down to 2 per 100,000 population (Greece in 1996), supporting the hypothesis that there is a wide variety of factors influencing rates.

Similarly, forensic rates from Germany, whos e total numbers tower above those from all other Member States, fit rather neatly into the r ange of most neighbouring Central European countries. Among all Member States, Denmark shows the hi ghest rates and the most striking increase (see figure 3). The annual Danish growth rate has been estimated by national studies to be 6 to 7%, which could not be explained by changes in legisl ation or administrative or diagnostic routines. Instead, the exponential increase has been attributed to the effect of de-institutionalisation, resulting in increasing levels of criminal behaviour amongst schizophrenic patients (Kramp & Gab- rielsen 2003). However, there are countries with similar gr owth rates throughout the 1990s, namely the Nether- lands Austria and Germany, where prevalence ra tes have doubled (Germany, Austria) or even showed a three-fold increase (the Netherlands). Other patterns would also need deeper analysis, for instance the similarly low rates in Southern European Member States. More detailed study is necessary to determine whether this phenome- Resu lts - Ep idemio logy 83 non is a consequence of the low levels of forensic service bed provision in Greece, Italy and Por- tugal. Again, a common European trend is hard to deduct, although in figure 3 there appears to be a tendency towards slowly rising rates shared by a ma jority of Member States throughout the last decade Generally, when comparing prevalence rates across countries, data-biases (caused by differences in inclusion criteria, case definitions, recording routines, algorithms for ca lculating figures etc.) should be taken into account as a probable source for differences.

Time series on forensic inci- dence (table 48) as well as on incidence rates (figur e 5) from the Member States show a more uniform pattern than forensic prevalence. Uneven total numbers or rates over time are probably an effect of rather small figures. Only in Ge rmany and in England and Wales do new forensic epi- sodes exceed 500 cases per year, whereas in mo st of the less populous Member States, annual incidence stays consistently below 100. Again, Denmark constitu tes an exception in showing a steep increase in incidence, as was the case with forensic prevalence.

FINSWE Ep idemio logy 85 Mean Length of Stay in Forensic Care Data on length of stay in forensic institutions are scarce throughout the Member States, although this is a crucial indicator for evaluating the systems in question. However, comparing prevalence and incidence rates within a Member State allows some conclusions to be drawn as to the average length of stay of forensic cases during a given year. Thus, a high proportion of new admissions per year would suggest frequent annual discharges and thus a tendency towards a short mean length of stay under forensic care regimes. Table 49 shows the percentage of new admissions dur ing one year of all forensic cases (point prevalence) from those Member States in year s where data was available According to this rather rough indicator, Belg ium experiences probably the highest turn-over of mentally disordered offenders in forensic facilities, although the quality of forensic care is very low in most services. So many cases turn-over in facilities with low treatment standards. In England & Wales and Sweden, there are also high proportions of annual admissions, indicating a short aver- age length of stay, whereas other Central European and Scandinavian Member States (Austria, Germany, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands) eac h have similar proportions of new cases (be- tween 15 to 30 % annually). In Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and England & Wales, there is a tendency towards decreas- ing proportions of new admissions during the peri ods covered, indicating a trend towards longer placements.

Mentally Disordered Offenders judged as Criminally Responsible In most of the Member States , the numbers of offenders suffering from mental disorders but judged criminally responsible by the courts are usua lly hard to distinguish amongst the overall prison population. This is because, in severe offences , these persons are usua lly sentenced to prison terms, and National prison statistics usually do not distinguish between the re levant categories of prisoner. Resu lts - Ep idemio logy 86 So, incidence or prevalence data on this sub-group - which would allow an estimation of the bal- ance of cases judged criminally responsible and non-responsible - is rarely available. Only in Austria is it known, that during the 1990s, the annual number of those held by the courts to be responsible (according to \u00a7 21/2 StGB) and non -responsible (according to \u00a7 21/1 StGB) was more or less balanced. In Finland, a tendency towa rds rising numbers with full criminal responsibil- ity as a result of forensic assessments was observed during the 1990s, whereas at the beginning of the decade numbers for diminished responsibility and lack of criminal responsibility more or less balanced those judged to be fully responsible.. Gender The proportion of females amongst mentally ill o ffenders is low and does not exceed 17% in those Member States which were able to provide inform ation on gender distribution in forensic care (see figure 6). However, it is unclear in how far t hese figures are nationwide represent only selected samples. The dominance of males is not surprising, since as regards criminal behaviour in general as well as violent behaviour in mental disorders, male s are well-known to be over-represented. However, there is no information available as to whether service provision is adapted to the needs of female patients.

This is partly due to the confus ing and out-dated terminology for describing mental Resu lts - Ep idemio logy 87 disorders which is still prevalent in legal fram eworks, and which is incompatible with diagnostic schemes as used in contem porary psychiatric care. In consequence, available data on diagnostic patterns usually stems from research studies or one- off assessments, covering only selected populations or facilities. Even then, the classification sys- tems used vary between ICD-9, ICD-10, DSM-III and DSM-IV. Figure 7 shows diagnostic overviews from some Member States, most of them covering selected groups of mentally disordered offenders and not r epresenting national data. The various diagnostic schemes have been transformed into ICD-10 terminology for better comparison. Nevertheless, the figure shows that the majority of mentally diso rdered offenders in those Member States which were able to provide diagnostic data suffer from schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders (50% or more). Figure 7 also illustrate s the rather different approach in the Netherlands, where patients with personality disorders form the core-group of mentally disordered offenders subject to a TBS-order (the legal r egime of \"terbeschikkingstelling\"). Time series on mental disorders are even more scarce. However, in Ireland, time series suggest a slow but stable increase of schizophrenic cases and changing proportions of personality disorders over time.

A very recent example was the murder of Swedish Foreign Minister, Anna Lindh, in 2003. Where data is available, offence criteria or def initions are usually not harmonised between states, so that an overview across national boundaries must lack reliability. Nevertheless, some figures are presented here to give an impression of the dimensions of the problem. Figure 8 shows the annual proportion of serious cr imes committed by mentally ill persons (court decided cases) in the most recent year available from four Member States. Serious crimes include homicide, robbery, assault or sex offences. Ca tegories or recording procedures are not harmon- ised. The variation between states may also be in fluenced by narrow or wide legal definitions of mental disorders. Nevertheless, proportions are low, and there ar e Member States like Ireland where none of the persons indicted for murder (n=26), robbery (n=678) , assault (n=2058) or sex offences (n=715) in 2001 were found mentally disordered or unfit to plead.

Each Member State is described in a separat e chapter, written by the assigned experts who collaborated in this study. The chapters follow more or less the same struct ure. Each chapter is complemented by a flow chart giving an overview of the national judicial procedures and the pathways to forensic place- ment, and by a figure outlining the forensic service provision in the respective Member State. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 91 Austria Hans Schanda Introduction, Historical Development Up until the 1970s, mental health care in Austria wa s confined mainly to traditional inpatient treat- ment in psychiatric hospitals, with high rates of involuntary admissions (Katschnig et al., 1975, 1975a). The situation of mentally ill offenders re mained unchanged compared with the situation in previous decades: If a patient was found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI), he was exculpated and handed over to the regional psychiatric hospital for treatment without any further control or surveillance by the court (Schanda et al., 2000). In the course of a penal reform in 1975, the treat- ment of mentally ill offenders NGRI came under the control of the Mi nistry of Justice. This change accommodated the interests of the psychiatrists in the hospitals, w ho saw the forensic patients as an obstacle to opening the wards and other reforms. According to the new penal law (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB), the patients were to be committed by the courts to inpatient treatment at a special institut ion for an indefinite period. However, as the desig- nated central institution was only in planning at that time, in practice things did not change very much between 1975 and 1985. Despite new judicial conditions regulating admission and discharge, the offenders NGRI continued to be treated in closed wards of mental hospitals. After a delay of 10 years, the Ministry of Justice opened the central institution for the treatment of mentally ill offenders NGRI (Justizanstalt G\u00f6llersdorf) in 1985, thus disburdening the psychiatric hospitals of a good number of male criminally non-responsible off enders. The 1975 penal reform also prescribed crimi- nal commitment for those offenders who, though found to be responsible for their offences, were acting under \"a higher degree of mental abnormality\". The new distribution of responsibilities for menta lly ill offenders NGRI turned out to be meaningful not only in terms of costs but also in terms of the opinions of politicians and the public on the rela- tionship between mental illness and crime. It also became meaningful for the way in which general psychiatry regards all those aspects of treatment that deal directly or indirectly with aggressive behaviour by some of its patients. The changes in general mental health care began in Vienna with the psychiatry reform at the end of the 1970s, continuing in the rest of the country with the sectorising of inpatient treatment at the beginning of the 1990s. The reforms in the outpati ent sector moved along rather sluggishly and even today still have not been completely implemented. The last steps of the mental health care reform were a new formulation of inpatient ci vil commitment (Unterbringungsgesetz, UbG) in 1991 and a reform of the funding of inpatient treatment in 1997 that enforced short-term inpatient treat- ment (Schanda et al., 2000; Schanda, 2001). Legislation Austrian law sees the \"will to harm\" as prerequisite to criminal culpability, which can be traced back to the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana from 1770. \u00a711 of the StGB, coming into force in 1975, says that a lack of \"discretion\" (ability of insight) and/or \"dispositi on\" (ability to control one's actions) at the time of the offence, caus ed by functional or organic psychoses , severe intellectual disability, or other pathological mental states equal to the aforementioned conditions, makes a person not guilty. Along general lines, the terms discretion and disposition correspond with the McNaughten- rules of Anglo-American jurisdiction. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 92 Figure 13 shows the judicial and placement procedures for mentally ill offenders. In contrast to German law, for example, Austrian jurisdic tion knows only a dichotomy responsible/non- responsible. If the court has doubts with respect to the mental health of an arrested offender and assumes the possibility of later ex culpation, it can order - afte r commissioning an obligatory written expert opinion - the preliminary placement and treatm ent of the offender in the regional psychiatric hospital. (Optionally: it can order treatment and plac ement in the central inst itution for mentally ill offenders NGRI, or in a special department of a large remand prison in Vienna) according to \u00a7429/4 StPO (Strafprozessordnung, code of criminal procedure). At least one other obligatory expert assessment is necessary for the preparation of the trial, in which the court has to decide about guilt, crimi nal responsibility and further illness-related (\"spe- cific\") dangerousness. In the case of a mental st ate according to \u00a711 StGB (functional or organic psychosis, mental retardation or other mental states equal to the afor ementioned mental condi- tions) in direct (\"causal\") association with a minor offence (misdemeanour, potential penalty of less than one year) the offender is exculpated and has to be set free. In the case of a mental state ac- cording to \u00a711 StGB in direct association with a major offence (felony, potential penalty of more than one year), together with a high probability of at least one further illness-related severe offence, the offender is also exculpated, but undergoes criminal commitment for an indefinite period accord- ing to \u00a721/1 StGB, until the illness-related \"s pecific dangerousness\" has been substantially re- duced. Naturally, not all preliminary pre-tria l commitments under \u00a7429/4 StPO are followed by de- finitive criminal commitments according to \u00a721/ 1StGB. If sufficient treatment during the remand (pre-trial) period is able to improve an initia lly poor illness-related prognosis, the person will be released. As mentioned above, Austrian penal law does not prov ide for the legal category of diminished re- sponsibility. However, if an offence (potential penal ty of more than one year) was actually commit- ted not under the conditions of \u00a711 StGB, but under the influence of a \"higher degree of mental abnormality\" (mainly targeting more severe forms of personality disorders), penal law provides for the possibility of criminal commitment for an indefin ite period parallel to a prison sentence, if the court assumes a poor \"specific dangerousness- prognosis\" (\u00a721/2 StGB). The analogue to \u00a7429/4 StPO for pre-trial placement of responsible m entally ill offenders is defined in \u00a7438 StPO, however, it is very seldom applied to subjects awaiting trial. The courts decide only about the placement of an o ffender in general (prison sentence or criminal commitment according to \u00a721/1 or \u00a721/2 StGB). Plac ement after trial (which kind of prison in the case of normal convictions, central institution for mentally ill offenders NGRI or psychiatric hospital in the case of \u00a721/1 StGB, special forensic fac ility or special department of a normal prison in the case of \u00a721/2 StGB) is under the responsibility of t he Ministry of Justice. Criminal commitment ac- cording to \u00a721/1 or \u00a721/2 StGB has to be main tained until the \"specific\" illness-related dangerous- ness has been substantially reduced. The regional penal courts have to reconsider the requirement of further inpatient treatment once a year (at any time on request of the offender). Discharge (\u00a747 StGB) is in any case probationary for five or ten years, depending on the se verity of the index- offence. Because of the enormous increase in t he number of mentally ill offenders during the last ten years, an amendment to the penal law since 2002 offers the possibility of conditional criminal commitment, as well as the prolongation of the probation period. Criminal commitment - but only for a maximum of tw o years, and if the total duration of the prison sentence is two years or less - is possible for subjects with offences due to substance abuse (\u00a722 StGB), if a positive change in the behavioural/addictive pattern of the offender by specific treatment can be expected. However, only a relatively sma ll number of persons is treated under this condition in a special forensic facility for addiction treatment in Vienna. Problems Figure 10 shows the point-prevalence rates of ment ally ill offenders during the last 29 years. Five years after the introduction of the new penal law in 1975, a steady state of subjects under criminal Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 93 commitment was reached which remained stabl e between 1980 and 1990: the mean prevalence in mentally ill offenders NGRI (\u00a721/ 1 StGB) was 109, in responsible mentally disordered offenders (\u00a721/2 StGB) 127. Since 1990, we are facing a re markable development: While the prevalence of normal prisoners did not substantially change, t he prevalence of mentally ill offenders showed a dramatic increase (in responsible ill offenders by 128%, in non-responsible ill offenders even by 177%). In the former case (\u00a721/2 StGB) this may possibl y be due to a change in the legal practice and - at least partly - to an increase in the mean length of stay under criminal commitment. In the latter case (\u00a721/1 StGB), it is the internationally well-known side-effect (Munk- J\u00f6rgensen, 1999; Schanda, 1999, 2000; Schanda et al., 2000) which started in Austria rather slowly in the seventies of the 20th century and have been translated into action with increasing ve- locity since the early 1990s (see Introduction, hist orical development). Like everywhere else, the insufficient provision of outpati ent facilities and sheltered care accompanied hospital downsizing. The new law that has regulated inpatient civ il commitment since 1991 (UbG) and the reform of inpatient funding in 1997, which encourages psychiat rists to shorten even mo re the length of inpa- tient treatment by means of financial pressure, hav e worked as a kind of magnifier that makes the existing problems in general psychiatry visibl e and available to scrutiny (Schanda et al., 2000). Fig. 10 Prev alence of Mentally Ill Offenders in Austria 1979 - 2003 (census data, January 1, each year) 050100150200250300 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Mentally ill offenders NGRI (\u00a721/ 1 StGB) Responsi ble mentally ill offenders (\u00a721/ 2 StGB) The consequences for the most severely ill patients with respect to the mean duration of stay in hospital and the quality of treatment are obvious (Schanda, 2001; compare also Dickey, 1998; Nor- ton, 1998). Problems primarily arise in each of the two intersections between general and forensic psychiatry (before the offence and at discharge): General psychiatry is increasingly unable or un- willing to deal with the unpleasant effects of clinical reality, mainly those with respect to the violent Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 94 behaviour by some of its pati ents and with respect to coercive treatment (Schanda, 1999, 2000). This has led to an enormous increase in the rates of admission for mentally ill offenders NGRI (see figure 11) . Fifty-six percent of the 280 non-responsible patients under criminal commitment at 1st April 2003 were admitted during the last three years. T he original aim of the legislator to reserve criminal commitment only for a small group of extremely dangerous mentally ill subjects has been undermined by a disproportionate increase in the num ber of patients with less severe offences (threat, compulsion), who represent a well-known ty pe of psychotic patient with a lack of insight and compliance and high rates of co-morbidity (substance abuse and/or personality disorders). These \"difficult-to-treat\" and \"difficult-to-place\" patients are the losers of the psychiatry reforms, also in Austria (compare e.g., Munk-J\u00f6rgensen, 1999 for Denmark). Their indirect shift from the general mental health system to the forens ic system (Schanda, 2001; Schanda et al., 2000) is accelerating also for financia l reasons. As the the Ministry of Justice is responsible for the treatment of mentally ill offender s, the criminal commitment of a patient not only disburdens the counties' health administrations from the expenditures for care as long as he/she is under criminal commitment. In recent years, the local health authorities have also become increas- ingly reluctant to take on the care of dischar ged patients, arguing that even aftercare is beyond their (financial) responsibility, as discharge is pr obationary and as such \"exclusively a matter of the justice system\". This makes discharge increasingly di fficult as it also reduc es the courts' confidence in the sufficient translation of necessary aftercare measures into practice. Thus, the Ministry of Justice is under increasing financial pressure. Fig. 11 Incidence of Criminal Commitments NGRI (\u00a721/1 StGB) / Prison Sentences. Aus- tria 1990- 2001 0102030405060 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Criminal commitments (NGRI) Prison sentences x1000 Several attempts by the Ministry of Justice to cope with this problem (to make forensic beds \"cheaper\", to establish own outpatient facilities, hos tels and sheltered care) are in fact suited to provide at least partial relief. However, all thes e measures again reinforce the other parties' opinion Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 95 that the violence of and coercion against mental patients lies outside their responsibility. The ef- fects of the aforementioned regulatory measures introduced in 2002 (conditional criminal commit- ment and prolongation of the probati on period) have to remain open. Up to now there seems to be no change in the tendency towards an ongoing increase in admission rates. Practice Mentally ill remand prisoners (\u00a7429/4 StPO, see Legislation) are primarily kept in closed wards or in the forensic departments of the regional psychiatric hospitals and in a special department (12 beds) in Austria's largest remand prison in Vienna. Mentally ill offenders NGRI (\u00a721/1 StGB) are treated: 1. in the Justizanstalt beds for male offenders). (The Justizanstalt G\u00f6llers- dorf, though formally one of Austria's 29 correctional institutions, functions de facto as a psychiatric hospital and it is the only judicial institution with 24-hour presence of a psychia- trist and of nursing staff.), and 2. in three small forensic departments of psychiatric hospitals (total 84 beds), 3. while the rapidly increasing number of the rest of the offenders (meanwhile 32%) is treated in closed wards of the regional mental hospitals together with the (mainly acutely ill) civil patients. The latter institutions are not able to offer any s pecial programmes for forensic patients. This re- sults in the transfer of \"diffi cult\" patients who pose problems with regard to security, dangerousness or absconding to the Justizanstalt G\u00f6llersdorf, despite the fact that this institution is extremely un- derstaffed compared to the (forensic) department s of mental hospitals (Schanda, 2000, 2001a). The situation in the special sta ff sector of the Justizanstalt G\u00f6 llersdorf answers for the most part the question concerning systematic programmes des igned for specific groups of offenders. Treat- ment - apart from medication - for the primarily psychotic patients target s the improvement of compliance, impulse control, problem-solving stra tegies and social skills, mostly by use of group therapies. The use of prognostic instruments like the PCL-R and the HCR-20 is a matter of routine there. Even more problematic is the situation with respec t to criminally responsible mentally disordered offenders (\u00a721/2 StGB), who for the greater part are committed for sexual offences, arson and vio- lent offences (Katschnig et al., 2001). The special forensic institution in Vienna (Justizanstalt Mit- tersteig) for male offenders (130 places) is extremel y understaffed. This institution has a tradition of psychodynamically oriented individual psychother apies - a concept that has now gradually changed in favour of a more cognitive-behavioural approach. Additionally, each of the three large Austrian prisons has a small special department (wit h a total number of 39 places) for criminally responsible mentally disordered offenders. As t he prevalence of this group is on the rise too and e.g. some sex-offenders without any legal order have to be treated in the Justizanstalt Mittersteig, an increasing number of criminally responsible m entally disordered offender s (\u00a721/2 StGB) is kept in prisons together with non-mentally disturbed inma tes. The situation with respect to the therapeu- tic staff in the prisons is even worse than that in the Justizanstalt Mittersteig (Schanda, 2001a). None of these institutions/depar tments, including the aforementioned small department for mentally ill remand prisoners (\u00a7429/4 StPO) in Vienna's large re mand prison, has at its disposal a psychia- trist or of nursing staff during the night hours. The patients' rights of crimina lly non-responsible mentally ill o ffenders (\u00a721/1 StGB) differ some- what depending on their placement: If the offender is tr eated in hospital, he is subject to the civil commitment law (UbG) which - in contrast to the si tuation with regard to civil patients - has to be executed by the local penal court. However, once the offender has been transferred to the central institution for the treatment of mentally ill off enders NGRI (Justizanstalt G\u00f6llersdorf), the decision Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Au stria 96 about e.g. involuntary medication is - like in all ot her correctional instituti ons -the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice. Conclusion Austria is a small country with eight million inhabi tants. Despite a relatively favourable situation (prosperity, low crime rates, low rates of drug abuse), general mental health care is developing in a problematic direction with respect to increasingl y insufficient care for a subgroup of severely men- tally ill patients with a lack of insight and compliance and high rates of co-morbid substance abuse and personality disorders. The enormous increase in the number of mentally ill offenders NGRI (\u00a721/1 StGB) indicates the indirect shift of these patients from the general mental health system to the forensic system (Schanda, 1999, 2000, 2001; Schanda et al., 2000). This development is the source of increasing problems for the Ministry of Just ice, intensified by the aforementioned peculiarities of financial responsib ilities (see Problems). Any improvement of this situation seems difficult due to its complex genesis, reflecting the changes in society in general with diverging interests and (partially hidden or unconsci ous) motives for acting. The directly involved parties take up differing points of view: Patients' self-help groups target coercion in general and try to generate support for a better understanding of thei r situation, however, sometimes carefully omitting the problem of violence by some of their fellow sufferers. Self-help groups of the patients' relatives take up an intermediate position, additionally criticising the lack of support when left alone with their untreated, non-compliant relatives. Patients' advocates often restrict their activities to questions of civil rights, arguing t hat the assessment of future vi olence cannot principally influence this position. General mental health care professionals , whose reputation is impaired by violent incidents involving their patients, sometimes exhibit an ambivalent attitude, characterised by the (increasingly difficult) denial of the problem and an attitude of helplessness, sharing the projective blaming of others with patients' advocates, judges and politicians. A fundamental improvement in the situation is im possible without the cooper ation of mental health care professionals, all other groups involved in the (involuntary) placement and treatment of a sub- group of high-risk patients and the m ental health administrations of the several Austrian counties. For the latter, cooperation would mean the acceptanc e of financial burden - i.e. their share of ex- penditures for the treatment of offenders according to the principle that the party responsible (for the local increase in the number of criminal commitm ents) is responsible for its costs. Therefore, the activities of the Ministry of Justice are restricted to attempts to reduce the exploding costs (see Problems). A revenue sharing which was recent ly agreed upon and intended to reimburse a certain share of hospital costs of the \"L\u00e4nder\" (federal states) by the nati onal Ministry of Justice brought only gradual relief. This situation does not seem suited to reduce the old, well-known prejudices of the public regarding violence of the mentally ill in general. Rather one can notice a change in the reporting of the media during recent years: Institutional coercion, having been one of t he two major topics of the news media when reporting about psychiatry, has lost some of its importance - leaving \"secu- rity/dangerousness\" (violent incident s, \"irresponsible\" discharge and practice with regard to leaves). Thus, we have been facing a rapidly changing situat ion these past few years. Nobody knows when the curves in figures 10 and 11 will flatten. Until now, it has not been possible to assemble the vari- ous representatives and institutions responsible for mental health care (civil and penal legislation, regional/county governments, mental health adminis trations, mental health professionals) for a general discussion. Obviously, appeals to reason and a sense of responsibility are hardly success- ful where emotions and money are involved.

According to the Social Protection Act mentally disordered offenders can be declared criminal irre- sponsible. An accused person who has committed a crim e or an offence and who at the time of the act was either in a state of insanity, or in a state of severe mental unbalance, or in a state of severe mental deficiency rendering him/her incapable of controlling his/her actions will be interned. Internment is not a punishment but a measure of social protection fo r an undetermined period of time. From that time on- wards the interned person is subject to the decisions taken by a Social Protection Committee. The So- cial Protection committees are competent to designate, in complete independence, the place of con- finement. The most important available options include confinement in an Institut e of Social Protection, confinement in a forensic psyc hiatric facility offering adequate treatment and where appropriate secu- rity measures prevail, confinement in a regular ps ychiatric hospital, partial release from one of the aforementioned or definitive release under certain conditions mostly re lated to the diagnosis which mo- tivated the internment and to the act that was committed. History The Social Protection Act was introduced on 9th April 1930. This Act included the placement of an ac- cused person under observation. The purpose of t he procedure for placing an accused person under observation is to assess his mental state and to ens ure the most favourable material conditions for such an examination. The courts became competent to order internment for a fixed period of time (5, 10 or 15 years) and Social Protection Committees were established to decide upon the place of con- finement and provisional or permanent re lease of mentally ill offenders. The revised version of the Social Protection Act of 1st July 1964 consolidated t he legal position of the interned person. The fixed periods of internment were abolished and the installation of a prison re- search and observation centre was written into the law. Procedures The examining judge who issued the arrest warrant may, exceptionally, through a well-founded order, recommend that the warrant be exec uted in the psychiatric unit of a prison ('placement under observa- tion') if there is reason to believe that the accused is either suffering from a mental disorder or is in a serious state of mental instability or deficiency that renders him incapable of controlling his actions. The competent examining body and the trial court also have the power to place under observation an accused person who is already bound by an arrest warrant. The purpose of placing an accused person under observation is to assess his mental state and to ensure the most favourable material conditions for such an examination. The period of plac ement under observation may not exceed one month Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Belg ium 100 unless the competent body that decided on or confirmed placement under observation orders an ex- tension for a further month. The extension may be renewed but the entire period of placement under observation may not exceed six months. According to the wording of the Social Protecti on Act, courts can order for an undetermined period of time the internment of an accused person who has committed a crime or an offence and who at the time of the act was either in a stat e of insanity, or in a state of seve re mental unbalance, or in a state of severe mental deficiency rendering him/her incapable of controlling his/her actions. From that time on- wards the interned person is subject to the decisions taken by a Social Protection Committee which is composed of a presiding magistrate, a lawyer representing the bar and a psychiatrist. The Social Pro- tection Committees are competent to designate, in complete independence, the place of confinement. These administrative bodies are fully autonomous and enjoy jurisdictional powers. The committees place internees either in an Institute of Social Prot ection, in a forensic psyc hiatric facility offering ade- quate treatment and where appropriate security measures prevail or in a regular psychiatric hospital that agrees to accept such patients. Before taking important decisions in the case in which the information needed may be lacking, the So- cial Protection Committee can appoint a psychiatrist other than the one who is already a member of the committee, who shall submit to them an appropriate report. The Social Protection Act is applicable only to pers ons of legal age; the Youth Protection Law of 1965 makes it possible for Youth Courts to entrust psychiatrists with the examination of minors. The interned person, assisted by his lawyer, can appear every six months before the Social Protection Committee. The committee decides how the internm ent will be carried out. Provisional or permanent release is possible if the mental condition of the interned person has improved sufficiently and if the conditions for reintegration have been fulfilled. Medica l-social treatment is an obligatory condition for provisional release. The decision to release the person in question ma y be opposed by the Crown Procurator. In such cases the file is submitted for a decision to a Higher Social Protection Committee, which rules on the case. The internee's lawyer may appeal a decision in which the committees have decided that there are no grounds for release. Practice The Social Protection Act prescribes that the psychiatric examination of an accused person take place, during a renewable period of observation of one month, in the psychiatric unit of a prison. In practice the placement under observation is rarely done becaus e of the lack of well-equipped psychiatric obser- vation units. More often than not, psychiatric examinations will be carried out on simple requisition of an expert by the examining magistrate, by the public prosecutor or by the court before which the accused is appear- ing. An expert psychiatrist (or, exceptionally, a college of three exper t psychiatrists) will be appointed to answer at least three questions: (1) Was the accused at the time of the act in a st ate of insanity, of severe mental unbalance, or in a state of severe mental deficiency that r endered him/her incapable of controlling his/her actions? (2) Does the state of the accus ed make him/her socially dangerous? (3) Is the accused at present in the same state? The expert-psychiatrist may also be asked to outli ne the main personality features of the accused and to point out what conditions of a medical, social and psychological nature should be taken into account in order to enable a judicious application of the law. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Belg ium 101 There is a strong tendency among the Social Protecti on Committees to attribute a permanent value to the initial psychiatric report leading to an internment and, in the absence of more recent examinations, to turn them into instruments of irreversible st igmatisation. These reports will be joined to the peniten- tiary file of the person and like his shadow, will follo w him without ever being c ontradicted or corrected. In a majority of cases it is practically out of t he question that an interned person might ask for a critical assessment by an independent psychiatri st of a previously endured psyc hiatric examination. The ex- pense would be simply prohibitive. In Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgium) the main Instit ute of Social Protection ('Merksplas') is financed by the Federal Minister of Justice. The psychosocia l team (psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker) is responsible for the reception, screening and treatm ent of interned persons. However, treatment is hardly organized in this institute. The lack of qua lified staff and a non-therapeutic setting are major or- ganizational deficits. 'Merksplas' has a capacity of 210 interned persons. Due to a lack of capacity in the main Institute of Social Protection, and additi onal 240 interned persons are incarcerated in Flemish prisons. Forensic units in psychiat ric hospitals are financed jointly by the Federal Minister of Justice and the Federal Minister of Public Health. Specia lized outpatient services for sex offenders are fi- nanced by the Flemish Minister of So cial Welfare. These services ar e integrated into regular mental health outpatient services. In Wallonia (French-speaking Belgium) two Institut es of Social Protection ('Tournai' and 'Mons') are financed by the Walloon Minister of So cial Welfare. Another institute of Social Protection in Wallonia ('Paifve') is financed by the Federal Minister of Ju stice. Specialized outpatient services for sex offend- ers are established and financed by the Walloon Minister of Social Welfare. These services are inte- grated into regular mental health outpatient services. Internment Committee for Revision of The Social Protection Act An internment committee was established on 23rd September 1996. The task of the committee was to make a critical study of the Social Protection Act and practices in that area, and to develop future pros- pects. The final report of the committee was issued in April 1999. The principal recommendations con- tained in the internment committee's report are the following. The requirements for internment should be more clear ly stated in the Social Protection Act. The in- ternment committee proposes to change the archaic medical terminology (e.g. 'insanity' and 'mental unbalance') into 'diagnosis and persistence of a mental disorder'. The Social Protection Act should ex- plicitly mention the assessment of the person's cognitive capacities and his ability to control his ac- tions. In addition, the new act should provide expre ssly that internment be ordered only if the offender poses a danger to society (danger being defined as the \"risk of relapse\"). The Act should provide for the possibility of multidi sciplinary assessment in addition to solely psychiat- ric assessment. The multidisciplinary assessments will result in a single, coherent report. The intern- ment committee agrees that the f ees of the expert-psychiatrist should be raised since poor payment regulations generate a low standard of quality in psychiatric reporting. A new structure should be put in place for the eight psychiatric units in prison, which, to this day, have never fully carried out their mandat e of placing arrested persons under observation. The units should be responsible only for detainees with psychiatric problems during their detention. In this regard, the committee welcomes the recent establishment of a prison research and clinical observation centre. The task of this centre, which has been given the status of a State Scientific Inst itution, is to carry out multidisciplinary observation under optimum conditions. However, in March 2004 this centre is not yet operational. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Belg ium 102 The composition of the Social Protection Commi ttees should be reviewed. They should be presided over by a serving judge, and the lawyer, who is currently a mem ber of these committees, should be replaced by a specialist in social reintegration. The presence of a lawyer on the committee is no longer justified since the Act of 1964 provided that internees must be assisted by a lawyer. The definitive release of an internee is possible only after receipt of a psychiatric report re-evaluating his mental state and the danger he poses. Adequate medical structures for the treatment and follow-up of internees should be created,. In this regard, the committee proposes the establishment of a \"justice - public-health\" partnership, and an in- tegrated and diversified network of both outpatient and residential treat ment. In addition, the care of internees should be the subject of a written, tripartite agreement on guidance and therapy that speci- fies the rights and duties of the inte rnee, of the therapist or therapy service, and of the Social Protec- tion Committees. Future Prospects The deputy chairman of the Internment Committee fo r Revision of The Social Protection Act deposited in April 2001, by order of the Minist er of Justice, a first draft of t he revised Act. This document resulted in a bill approved by the Council of Ministers in Ju ly 2002. Major changes in the planned revision of the Social Protection Act include the distinction between psychiatric examination, multidisciplinary exami- nation and placement under observation; the terminology \"s tate of insanity, or in a state of severe men- tal unbalance, or in a state of severe mental def iciency\" will be changed to \"mental disorder\"; a Com- mittee for the Execution of The Internment will replace the Social Protection Committee, and a prison research and clinical observation centre will be made operational. After a special meeting of the Council of Ministers in March 2004, the Minister of Justice launched the project of a new Institute of Social Protection (' Antwerp') with a capacity of 300 to 400 interned per- sons. An Institute of Social Protection in Wallonia ('Paifve') was promised a capacity extension from 80 to up to 200 interned persons. These measures s hould deal with the overcrowding of the Belgian prison system. Conclusion Mentally disordered offenders can be declared criminally irresponsible according to the Belgian Social Protection Act (July 1st, 1964) and as a consequence they will be \"i nterned\". The psychiatric treatment of this population is inadequate and the law must be revised. An Internment Committee for Revision of The Social Protection Act has, at the request of the Minister of Justice, put forward conclusions in his report of 1999. The political authorities plan to review the So- cial Protection Act, but these efforts will remain in va in if no decisions are taken to implement the medi- cal requirements of the law, and if no valuable for ensic psychiatric treatment network is developed.

The grow- ing number of forensic patients means, however, that more and more psychiatrists are working within this field. It is assumed that within a fe w years forensic psychiatry will become a more for- malised subject area. Each of the fourteen Danish counties and the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg (which together have the same tasks as a county) bear the responsibility for providing the total psychiatric service, including forens ic psychiatry, to the county resident s. As to forensic psychiatry, the counties differ widely. In some counties all fo rensic patients are treated within the general psy- chiatric facilities, while other counties have est ablished small units for the most difficult-to-treat forensic patients; and a few counties have larger fo rensic facilities that are responsible for the treatment of most of the forensic patients, including their outpatient treatment. The various forensic facilities do not have any formal legal status and neither local nor governmental authorities certify them. Denmark, with a population of five million inhabitant s, has one high-security psychiatric facility with 30 beds. This facility receives ve ry dangerous and psychotic patients, civil as well as forensic. In recent years, around half of t he patients have been civil commitment s, with the other half being forensic admissions, including a few admissions per year for whom psychi atric assessment s must be prepared for the courts. One of the counties runs th is special facility, but the Ministry of Justice has endorsed the regulations. Denmark has 82 district courts, two high courts; one for the western, and one for the eastern part of the country, and one Supreme Court. In Denmark one c ourt system processes all types of cases, and apart from the Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen, special courts, e.g., juvenile courts, are not known. If a defendant pleads guilty, and he/she is not suspec ted to be mentally ill, only one judge (jurist) tries the case, regardless of the severity of the case. If a defendant pleads not guilty, one judge (jurist) and two lay judges try the case (minor cr imes). In all cases in which a defendant is sus- pected to be mentally ill, one judge (juris t) and two lay judges try the case. In cases of serious crime, to which a defendant - ment ally ill or not - pleads not guilty, a jury is in- volved. It is for the jury (twelve lay persons) al one to rule on the guilt or innocence of a defendant, whereas the jury (twelve votes) and three judges (j urists, each four votes) together decide the sen- tence. The judgement is divided into two parts. Based on the evidence of the case (including the degree of \"intention\"), the court decides whether a def endant is guilty or not. Mentally ill and mentally healthy defendants are tried in precisely the same wa y. Secondly, the court decides the sentence - for the mentally healthy, an ordinary sentence, be it prison, a community penalty, a suspended Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 106 sentence, etc.; for the mentally ill, a psyc hiatric measure according to the Penal Code. (For a brief account of the Danish Court Sy stem and criminal procedure see: www.domstol.dk ) Structure of the Legal System The current Danish Penal Code dates from 1930, with a revision carried out in 1973/1975, which was important from a psychiatri c point of view. The 1930 law was heavily influenced by the optimis- tic therapeutic attitude of its era. Psychiatrists took it upon themselves to explain and combat crime. Indeterminate security measures were favoured and fo rensic psychiatrists held key positions in the legal system, participating in eval uating and sorting offenders, placi ng them in criminal asylums, labour camps, and special institutions for alcoho lic offenders, for recidivists and for young offend- ers. This treatment-oriented approach wa s at its height in the early 1950s. Then the pendulum swung back. Treatment was abandoned, and what has been called the \"neo- classic\" school of penology reappeared in Denmark as also in many other countries. This resulted in the reform of the penal code in 1973/1975, with particular regard to the sanctions that could be imposed on non-psychotic mentally abnormal offenders. Under the new legislation they received ordinary sentences. Denmark still has a sanction of unlimited durat ion, known as security deten- tion, which is imposed upon non-psychotic, dangerous offenders with severe personality disorders (Penal Code, \u00a7 70). During the 1990s, however, this \"nothing works\" attitude began more and more to be replaced by the attitude that \"something works on somebody \". There have been minor changes to the Penal Code and regulations belonging to the law, e.g., that a disposal in cases of non-violent sexual crimes can be a suspended sentence on condition of ps ychiatric/sexological treatment or in cases of alcohol-abusing drunken drivers, a suspended s entence on condition of treatment against alco- hol abuse. Along the same lines, the Danish Department of Prisons and Probation has developed treatment programmes for young inmates, drug abus ers and other groups during the recent years. The age of criminal responsibility is fifteen years. For criminals who are 15-17 years old there exist an array of social disposals. Psychotic (and ment ally retarded) adolescents are treated in the same manner as adults. A minor revision of the Penal Code in 2000 set time limits upon psychiatric measures in cases of not too dangerous criminality. Patients' organisati ons had pointed out that in some cases the dura- tion of the psychiatric measure was much longer than the ordinary sentence that would have been imposed had the offender not been mentally ill. Many psychiatrists, including the Medico-Legal Council (vide infra ), explained that the reason for the long dur ation was seriously ill offenders, who were not motivated to seek treatment. Disconti nuation of the treatment might therefore mean a relapse into crime. Parliament, however, wei ghted proportionality higher than the psychiatrists' viewpoint. But Parliament also decided that a research project should evaluate the consequences of the new legislation. Psychotic Offenders The general philosophy of the Danish legislat ion from 1930 (and even before that) has been that psychotic offenders shall be treated, not punished. \u00a7 16 (1) of the Danish Penal Code states: \"Per-sons, who, at the time of the act, were irresponsib le owing to mental illness or similar conditions or to a pronounced mental deficiency, are not punishabl e\". The legal term \"mental illness\" is equiva- lent to the psychiatric term \"psychotic\". In other words, persons who have been found guilty by the court, but who are irresponsible owing to a psychosis (or a pronounced mental retardation) are not punishable. Mental retardation will not be discussed further because the rules and practice for this group correspond exactly to those ap- The translation of the Danish Penal Code into English uses the words \"psychiatric measures\", which also will be used in the following. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 107 plicable to psychotics. Two elements have to be fulfilled to exempt an offender from punishment - he must be psychotic and for that reason be considered not re sponsible for the crime. If the psy- chiatrist finds a defendant psychotic, it is for the court to decide whether the person in question is responsible or not. The psychiatrists have to work only within their own discipline, describing and diagnosing mental disorders. It is the court, never the psychiatrist, who takes the final decision as to whether or not a defendant is punishable. The word \"irresponsible\" thus contains an additional requirement of a legal nature. The word is neither defined in the law nor in the preparatory work for the law or elsewhere. Knud Waaben, Professor LL. D. of Criminal Law, has formulated its meaning as follows: \"All that can safely be said is that the word is intended to serve as a vague reservation in order to ensure that the final decis ion rests with the court.\" (Waaben, 1982). It is important to stress that the use of \u00a7 16 does not require that there be any relationship between the psychotic condition and the criminal act. Howeve r, in the very few cases of psychotics who have received ordinary sentences, the court has said that there was no connection between the mental abnormality and the crime. The offence in such cases has most often been white-collar crimes - fraud, violation of fiscal legislation etc. Case 1: A dentist was charged with violation of fiscal legisl ation. The examining psychiatrist found the of- fender shy, introverted and preoccupied with bizarre sexual fantasies. At least partly because of these fantasies he had developed delusions, feeli ng that other people looked at him and talked about him. He was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid psychosis and consequently came un-der \u00a7 16. While the lower court supported the psyc hiatrist, in the High Court he was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment. The High Court determined this sentence by saying that there was no con- nection between his mental abnormality and his mani pulation of his account s and the presentation of false information to the taxation authorities. However, cases like this are very rare - less than one per year - and for all practical purposes, the court considers psychotic o ffenders to be irresponsible. In accordance with the meaning of the word \"irres ponsible\" in \u00a7 16, the concept of diminished re- sponsibility is not used in the Danish legislation. The concept of \"similar conditions\" (to mental illness) has been added to the concept of psychosis in order to exempt from punishment cases wher e a mental abnormality, although not classified as a psychosis, has had a similar effect on the mental faculties and behaviour of the offender. Clinically a \"similar condition\" almost always is a state of confusion due to somatic diseases such as hypo- glycaemia or epileptic seizures. There are at most one or two such cases per year. The Psychiatric Orders \u00a7 68 (1) of the Penal Code establishes that m easures other than ordinary punishment can be used against psychotic offenders: \"Where an accused pers on is acquitted in accordance with section 16 of this act, the court may decide on the use of ot her measures, which it considers to be expedient for the prevention of further off ences\". \u00a7 68 (2) mentions some of these measures: \"If less extreme measures such as supervision ... psychiatric tr eatment and so on are considered insufficient, the court may decide that the person in question shall be placed in a psychiatric hospital.\" Some more socially oriented disposals mentioned in the la w are not discussed here; nor are the disposals which can be used against the mentally retarded, as these are in principle the same as those for psychotics. The subsection mentions two possibilities: psychiatric treatment or placement in a psychiatric facil- ity. The differences between the two possibilities are mainly a question of how much security the court considers necessary, a placement order being the most radical measure. Both imply transfer- ral of the offender to the general psychiatric service run by the counties. T here are other psychiatric measures: At one end of the scale, psychiatric treat ment on an outpatient basis only; at the other Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 108 end, the very rarely used high-security facility for dangerous psychotics. However, both of these extreme psychiatric measures, outpatient treatment and the high-security facility, play only a minor role. Placement Order Placement in a psychiatric facility means that t he offender is admitted to a (forensic) psychiatric facility and cannot be discharged without a new court order. Leaves are restricted. The psychiatrist can grant unattended leaves on the premises of t he psychiatric facility and unattended leaves up to three hours per day off the premises of the psyc hiatric facility. Longer unattended leaves, overnight stays at home, etc., have to be granted by the regional prosecutor t ogether with the psychiatrist. It is entirely a matter for the psychiatrist to decide where the patient should be placed within the facil- ity, e.g., in an open or a closed ward, just as a ll decisions about treatment are taken only by the psychiatrist. Basically patients placed in the high-security facilit y are not granted leaves, but the Ministry of Jus- tice can grant short-term attended leaves. \"Placement orders\" are used in cases of crim inality dangerous to others, e.g., homicide, man- slaughter, some cases of arson, rape etc. Most of the patients suffer from schizophrenia of the most severe kind. The \"placement orders\" are almo st always of unlimited duration. Normally, after a few years a \"placement order\" will be changed into a \"treatment order\". Case 2: A 50-year-old unmarried man was charged with atte mpted homicide. He had shot at a police offi- cer, who was injured, but not critically. The o ffender had no criminal record and, on his pleading not guilty, the court ordered his admission to a psychiatric facility for mental observation. The report to the court concluded that he had suffered from par anoid schizophrenia for at least 20 years. Some years previously he had been admitted to a psychiat ric facility and treated there with antipsychotic drugs; he improved, but discontinued treatment upon his discharge, being convinced that he was not ill. During the admission for mental observati on he was preoccupied with ideas of reference, grandiosity, formal thought disorder, and autistic contact. He refused medical treatment, saying he was not ill. The examining psychi atrist concluded that the offender had been psychotic at the time of the criminal act and thus he came under \u00a7 16 of the Penal Code. Placement in a psychiatric hospital was proposed and the jury agreed. Treatment Order The order of \"psychiatric treatment\" means that an offender by and large is to be treated like any other patient. Legally there are two types of \"treat ment order\". Under the first type, an offender is admitted after the judgement; under the second type, treatment may start on an outpatient basis. For all other practical purposes, the two types are identical. The psychiatrist decides on any leaves and also on the type of leave. The patient can work outside the psyc hiatric facility, can go home at weekends and can be discharged by the psychiatri st when appropriate. Following his discharge, the patient is obliged to enter outpatient treatment. In nearly all cases the court will also order su- pervision by a probation officer. The task of the probation officer is to offer social support to the discharged patients and, together with the hospital, control their a ttendance at outpatient treatment. Moreover, the probation service is nationwide, whereas the psychiatric health care system, as pre- viously mentioned, is run by the individual countie s. Some forensic patients often move from one county to another, thus it is much easier for the probation service than for the psychiatric system to follow the patients from place to place and establish contact to a new (forensic ) psychiatric facility. If necessary, the psychiatrist, together with the pr obation officer, can readmit a patient to the psy- chiatric facility. As mentioned previously, a \"pla cement order\" eventually c hanges into a \"treatment order\", and thereby the former placement-pati ent can gradually be integrated into society. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 109 Case 3: A 27-year-old married woman was charged with hom icide; she had fatally poisoned her two-year- old child with gas and at the same time attempt ed to commit suicide. She was severely depressed and already at the preliminary examination the c ourt ordered her admission to a psychiatric facility for mental observation. The forensic psychiatric report concluded that she suffered from a bipolar affective disorder. She had previously been admi tted several times for both manic and depressive episodes. It was further concluded that she had been suffering from a major (endogenous) depres- sion at the time of the crime. During the adm ission for assessment, she was treated with antide- pressants and recovered to some extent, but still needed psychiatric treatment and support. She was found to come under \u00a7 16, and the examining psychiatrist recommended \"psychiatric treat- ment\". In court the prosecutor argued for a \"pla cement order\", emphasisi ng the severity of the crime. The High Court, however, followed the for ensic psychiatrist (and the defence) and decided on \"psychiatric treatment\". This case illustrates that it is the offender's mental state at the time of the crime, not at the time of conviction, that is decisive for the applicability of \u00a7 16. Most \"tr eatment orders\" are time-limited, lasting three or - most often - five years. This period can be extended by a new court order. Psychotic States after the Offence If an offender develops a more permanent psychotic condition after the time of the criminal act, but before the trial, \u00a7 16 cannot be used. The court then has two alternatives. The first alternative is an ordinary sentence, but, under \u00a7 73 of the Penal Code, the offender shall be placed at a psychiatric facility until he has recovered sufficiently to serv e the ordinary sentence. The time the offender spends at the psychiatric facility c onstitutes part of the sentence. The other alternative is a psychi- atric measure - be it placement or treatment - and no prison sentence. Whichever alternative is found most expedient in such cases depends on the severity of the case, the diagnosis, etc. According to \u00a7 78 of the Act on Enforcement of Sentences etc., prisoners, who become psychotic while serving a sentence will be admitted to a (for ensic) psychiatric facility and remain there until recovery or until release. Psychotic States at Time of Crime, Recovery before Trial It follows from \u00a7 16 that persons who were psychotic at the time of the act (and are irresponsible), are not punishable, and according to \u00a7 68 (1) \"ot her measures\" (than ordinary sentences) must be \"expedient for the prevention of fu rther offences\". This means t hat there might be cases where a person is not punishable and \"other measures\" are not cons idered \"expedient\" because the defen- dant has recovered completely. The person may leav e the court without any sentence. Such cases are very rare, less than one per year, but they do exist. Case 4: A 46-year-old man was charged with violence. He had been an alcoholic for many years. He lived alone and drew a disability pension due to the somatic consequences of his abuse. In order to stop his increasing and very heavy alcohol consumption, two lay persons from an alternative treatment group followed the man to an isolated house at the countryside. There he developed a full-blown delirium tremens and due to visual hallucinations, he assaulted the two companions. He was admit- ted to hospital and his delirium tremens were treated. At the time of the assessment he appeared as a ch ronic alcohol abuser, slightly demented but not psychotic. He came under \u00a7 16 (1) (being psychotic at the time of the act), and a \"treatment order\" was recommended. However, before his case came to trial a fire accident injured him seriously. He was admitted to a surgery ward (and developed a new delirium tremens). Afterwards he decided to stop drinking, and he was briefly admitted to a psychi atric facility for treatment of withdrawal symp- Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 110 toms and then discharged. At the trial he pleaded gu ilty, but maintained that he did not need any treatment, because he no longer abused alcohol. T he court decided upon a new assessment. This confirmed that for many mont hs the defendant had been totally s ober and that clinically he had improved considerably, in terms of both his soma tic and his psychiatric st ate. The new assessment concluded that the man had recovered and no psychi atric measure could be suggested. The court followed the assessment. Non-psychotic but otherwise Mentally Disturbed Offenders For non-psychotic but otherwise mentally abnormal offenders the regulations are as follows (Penal Code, \u00a7 69): \" Where the offender at the time of the act was ... in a condition which was dependent on inadequate development, or an impairment or distur bance of his mental abilities, not being of the character referred to in \u00a7 16, the court may, if considered appropriate, decide upon the use of measures such as those referred to in subsection two of \u00a7 68, instead of punishment \". These few words \"inadequate development, or an impairment or disturbance of his mental abilities\" cover most, if not all non-psychotic psychiatric disorders, such as neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, personality disorders, subst ance use disorders etc. This section establishes that rather than punishing this category of off enders, the court instead can use psychiatric meas- ures if these are recommended by a psychiatrist. A psychiatric measure may be considered in the ca se of schizotypal diso rders, grave (but non- psychotic) organic disorders, mild cases of As perger's syndrome, and a few cases with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, who ar e motivated to seek psychiatric treatment. The measure used is practically always \"psychia tric treatment\". The orders imposed on \u00a7 69-cases are of limited duration. The court determines the to tal maximum time, e.g., the sum of the duration of each admission, an offender can be detained in a ps ychiatric facility, most often up to one year. This period can be extended by a new court order. Ou tpatient treatment is most often also time- limited, lasting three or five years depending on the severity of the crime. Case 5: A 20-year-old unmarried man was charged with several cases of burglary, traffic offences and ar-son. During the last two years he had receiv ed several fines and a suspended sentence for bur- glary. He was placed in custody and the assessm ent took place on an outpatient basis. He was found to be emotionally withdrawn but not autisti c. His train of thought was vague although he was not found to be clinically depressed. Psychological testing confirmed the clinical description and revealed latent paranoid features. However, he could not be classified as psychotic; he had never hallucinated, his sense of reality was not di sturbed nor was he paranoid. The examination con- cluded that he might be suffering from latent schizophr enia or from a schizotypal disorder. He was classified as a \u00a7 69-case and \"psychiatric treat ment\" was recommended, partly on account of the diagnostic uncertainty, and partly because the o ffender needed and was motivated to seek treat- ment. The court followed the recommendation. Case 6: A 27-year-old divorced man was charged with r obbery and serious assault. He had previously been sentenced several times for burglary and assault. For some years he had abused alcohol, and he had been admitted to psychiatric facilities severa l times because of parasuicidal behaviour. On one occasion, a short-term psychosis with paranoid features had been suspected. However, all the admissions had been short, as he had soon discharged himself. During mental observation some organic disturbances were recognised, probably associated with a head injury in childhood and alcohol abuse. He was emotionally labile, suspic ious, and narcissistic. He minimised his alcohol problems, his criminal behaviour and his previous psychiatric admissi ons, stating that the latter only had occurred because he had wanted a bed and something to eat. The mental observation con- cluded that he suffered from an antisocial persona lity disorder with some organic disturbance and Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 111 alcohol abuse. He was found to come under \u00a7 69 but no special sanction under \u00a7 68 (2) was thought more appropriate than ordinary punishment. In the event he was sentenced to 3.5 years imprisonment. These two cases illustrate that an important fact or in recommending a psychiatric measure in \u00a7 69- cases is whether there is a realistic possibility of a favourable response to treatment. Very closely related to this is the attitude of an offender towards psychiatric treatment. In the first case, the of- fender expressed a serious desire for treatment: During the last few years, supported by his par- ents, he had several times considered consulting a psyc hiatrist, but in this as in many other situa- tions, he had been indecisive. In the second case, while the offender declared that he was inter- ested in psychiatric treatment, his history clearly demonstrated that this was not the case. The Herstedvester Institution In Denmark offenders with severe personality disorders have never been regarded as forensic patients in a narrower sense. From the 1930s on, this group of offenders who have committed dangerous crimes has served their sentences at the Herstedvester institution, which is a prison operating under exactly the same regulations as other prisons. With around 120 inmates, the Herstedvester institution is at the same time a well-staffed treat ment-oriented institution which of- fers the inmates all sorts of psychiatric treatm ent. Involuntary treatment cannot be used within the prison system. The treatment staff consists of five psychiatrist s and seven psychologists, together with psychiatric nurses and social workers. The prison management is composed of the prison governor and the chief psychiatrist. The security detention of unlimit ed duration is seldom used, the actual number of cases in 2004 being roughly 20. This sanction is imposed only for reas ons of security, not for treatment. As a rule, however, these offenders are placed at Herstedv ester and are offered psychiatric treatment. Some offenders from Greenland serve their sentenc es, including security detention, at Hersted- vester. This has been criticised, because the Greenlanders, some of whom do not even speak Danish, are removed from their culture. A special group of offenders consists of those sentenced for serious se xual crimes. For years, this group has served their sentences at Herstedvester. Consequently, the institution has a long history of experience in the treatment of sexual deviants. Previously ca stration was used in some cases. The treatment now used in the most serious ca ses is anti-hormone drugs, always combined with an offer of psychotherapy. The anti-hormone therapy treatment can only be initiated with the of- fender's consent. As regards treat ment of sex offenders, Herstedv ester has established a formal collaboration with three psychiatric facilities spread around the country. This link means that an offender can be released on probation under the stipul ation that he continue t he treatment initiated at Herstedvester. The combination of punishment and treatment has occasionally generated debate and criticism. The broadly accepted advantage is that offenders with severe personality disorders are treated within the prison system and not brought together with psychotics (and a few others), who are treated entirely within the psychiatric health care system. Procedures In accordance with the overall principle that m entally ill offenders shall be treated, not punished, all defendants suspected to be mentally ill shall undergo a formal psychiatric assessment for the court except in cases of minor offences, which are s entenced to a fine. Diversion is not applied in Den- mark. According to an instruction from the Prosecutor General, the prosecution will also ask for an as- sessment if a defendant is charged with a serious crime - homicide, arson, repeatedly odd violent Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 112 behaviour, rape and other serious sexual crimes etc., even he is not suspected to be mentally ill. In these cases, the court will normally follo w such a request from the prosecution. Remanded Defendants The court decides whether a remanded prisoner shall undergo a formal psychiatric assessment (procedural law \u00a7 809), but the defence and the prosecutor can ask for it. Formalised medical pre- trial assessments are not known in Denmark, but many defendants undergo a socially oriented examination carried out by a probati on officer. This social inquiry report might recommend a formal psychiatric assessment. The prison staff is instruct ed to be attentive to signs or symptoms of men- tal illness, and the prison doctor can ex officio recommend an assessment. Most often the court's decision is based on such information as previous psychiatric admissions, the social inquiry report, police reports about the defendant's behaviour during interrogations, statements from prison doc- tors or information from relatives. The court also decides whether the assessment mu st take place during admission at a (forensic) psychiatric facility or on an outpatient basis. The form er takes place in a (forensic) psychiatric facil- ity within the home county of the defendant. The latter takes place at one of four forensic centres, covering most of Denmark. (The re st of the country (part of Zealand) will in the nearest future probably be attached to one or two of the exis ting centres.) The remanded prisoners are thus transported from the remand prison to the centre where the assessment take s place. The Ministry of Justice pays three of the centre s, run by three counties, for t he assessments. While the Ministry itself administratively runs the last centre, t he Clinic of Forensic Psychiatry in Copenhagen, the clinic is independent within its own professional area. The clinic was established in the 1930s, and today it is by far the largest outpatient centre in Denmark, receiving around 250 assessment cases per year. In addition, the clinic has research and educational activities. The Ministry of Justice has enter ed into an agreement with each of the four centres with respect to the minimum standards for the reports. According to the agreement, the maximum time limit for the assessment and writing the report is six weeks. Inpatient assessments usually take longer due to, among other things, a shortage of psychiatric beds. The courts therefore are reluctant to order an inpatient assessment. The prosecution decides in a few cases per year that a court-ordered inpa- tient assessment shall take place at the high-security facility. Admission for Treatment The court can decide that a remanded prisoner w ho consents shall be admitted to a psychiatric facility for treatment (Procedural Law \u00a7 765 (2)). In special cases, such as for security reasons or an obvious need for treatment, the admission can ta ke place without the defendant's consent (Pro- cedural Law \u00a7 777). In emergency cases a prison doctor can admit a remanded prisoner to a psy- chiatric facility (Procedural Law \u00a7 770 (2)). The legal authorities shall be informed as soon as pos- sible. Admitted defendants are still remanded, and therefore a court order concerning a formal assess- ment is necessary. In such cases, the court will o ften obtain a brief statement from the psychiatrist about the need for an assessment. Defendants Charged but not Remanded A defendant might not be remanded in cases of theft, bur glary, minor violence etc. In such cases, the prosecutor or the police can ask for an assessment on condition of written consent from the defendant or his defence. These assessments will always take place at one of the above- mentioned centres along the same lines as previously described. If the defendant refuses to par- ticipate, the prosecutor or the police may bring t he case to court. Ultimately the court can decide that the defendant should be admitted for an assessment if the defendant continues to refuse to participate but this option is seldom used. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 113 Practice When the court (or the prosecution or the police) has decided to commission an assessment, the police are responsible for the following practical st eps: collection of relevant legal documents from previous convictions, prints from the central crime register, previous assessments if any, social inquiry reports, if any, and so on. When thes e documents have been gathered together, the police send the whole case, together with the order or the defendant's written consent, to the psychiatric facility. The psychiatric facility asks for e.g., m edical and social records and statements from hospi- tals and social authorities. If the defendant does not consent, the psychiatrist can ultimately bring the matter before the court. The psychiatrist retu rns the legal documents t ogether with the assess- ment report to the police, who are then obliged to immediately send a copy of the report to the de- fence. Normally the court will not see the report until the trial date is set. Report The above-mentioned agreement between the Ministry of Justice and the four centres describes some quality standards, mainly the c ontent of the assessment report: Introduction Existence of neuro-psychiatric disorder s and/or criminality in the family A detailed social history A summary of previous somatic diseases based on the defendant's own information and records commissioned from the General Practitioner, somatic wards etc. Previous sentences The present charge, with a short summary of the defendant's explanation to the court (or to the police in cases of minor crimes, w here the defendant is not remanded and has not been in court for a preliminary examination) Information about the defendant from other source s such as records from psychiatric facili- ties, records from social and welfare authoritie s, substance abuse treatment facilities, psy- chiatrists in private practice and in so me cases, interviews with relatives A thorough and comprehensive psychiatric examination with the main emphasis on psy- chopathology A psychological test (if clinically relevant) An \"objective\" clinical psychiatric description A somatic examination with e.g. an EEG or a CT-scan (if clinically relevant) The defendant's present situation - rem anded or not, medication, if any etc. Discussion (in complicated cases) Conclusion The conclusion contains the psychiatrist's position on the key questions: Was the defendant psy- chotic at the time of the crime? Is he psychotic at the time of the asse ssment? Is he mentally re- tarded? The premises for any diagnosis are mentioned briefly. In cases of psychosis or mental retardation, the psychiatrist makes a proposal for a psychiatric measure. Basically the reason for a proposal is medical and the psychiatrist is not supposed to take the se verity of the crime, the sense of justice, or other legal matters in to consideration (cf. case number 3). Is (was) the defendant not psychotic (or mentally retarded), the question then is whether he comes under \u00a7 69 and if he does, whether a psychiatric m easure can be proposed. The psychiatrist will never give a direct opinion about ordinary sentences. In cases where security detention of an unlimited duration is mentioned, the psychiatrist will be asked to make a risk-assessment; if not asked to so, the psychiatrist can make such an assess- ment ex officio. The Danish Medico-Legal Council The Medico-Legal Council is an independent consultation medical board. The task of the Council is to give expert medical and pharmaceutical opinions to the public authorities in legal cases. Tradi- Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 114 tionally, the Council is also asked to assist in some fundamental legal questions such as law revi- sions involving medical issues. The Council current ly consists of ten ordinary members and more than 150 extraordinary experts covering the whole fi eld of medicine. The members have their own specialities and membership on the council is a par t-time function only. A lawyer heads the secre- tariat, which examines all the cases and offers guidance to the medical experts concerning legal aspects. Only courts and public authorities can ask for the opinion of the Council but the defence can ap- proach the Medico-Legal Council through the court or the prosecution. In the majority of cases, the Council's opinion is based on written material only. In special cases, however, the opportunity exists to examine a person directly. At least three members are involved in each case and express their opinion in writing. A case may circulate several times until agreement has been obtai ned, or it has been established that this is not possible, in which case the Council's opinion then will include a dissenting opinion. The annual number of psychiatric and non-psychiatri c cases is about 2,000. Many of these are more or less routine cases concerning e.g., intoxicated drivers; others are more complicated, in- volving, for example, malpractice. Roughly 600 ar e psychiatric cases, many of which are compli- cated and time-consuming. This is illustrated by the fact that six of the ten ordinary members of the Council are psychiatrists. The majority of psychiatric cases concern m entally abnormal offenders. Around one third of the assessments for the court are laid before the Council, such as all cases where a \"placement order\" is suggested, cases where the diagnostic and thereby the legal classification is doubtful, and cases involving serious crimes such as murder or some sexual crimes. The Council's opinion is also re- quested in many cases concerning changes to or abo lition of a psychiatric measure. Furthermore, the Council is involved in some civil cases. In forensic psychiatric cases the Council's statem ent includes a short summary of the essential part of the psychopathological findings, a diagnostic cl assification, and the Council's position on the legal aspects - whether an offender comes under \u00a7 16 or \u00a7 69? Can a psychiatric measure be recommended, and if so, which type? Is it justifiable from a psychiatric point of view to abolish a psychiatric measure? The Medico-Legal Council is solely an advisory body , serving as a link between psychiatry and the legal system. In general, the public, psychiatrists and the legal system accept the authority of the Council. The statements of the Council rest on experts who are independent of the parties involved and of any financial interests. Furthermore, the ex istence of the Council ensures uniform guidelines for forensic procedures in different jurisdictions of the country, and last but not least, guarantees a certain level of quality in forensic psychiatric wo rk. The Council thus asks for further information in 15-20% of all cases, and from time to time ev en requests a new formal assessment. In 10-15% of the cases, the Council's opinion differs more or less from the conclusion in the material laid before the Council. In such cases, the examining psyc hiatrist is requested to comment on the Council's opinion and the comment is enclosed the Council's statement. Practice The principles for the assessment and treatm ent of psychotic offenders have remained unchanged in Denmark for decades. These principles are broadl y accepted within the society, be it the public, the politicians, the legal profession or the psychiat rists. From time to time, small groups such as some patients' advocacy groups have suggested fundamental changes, but t he debate, if any, has been brief and limited. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 115 Legislation The Danish legislation on mentally ill offenders onl y supplies the framework, whereas the detailed regulation is found in circulars and instructions, such as a comprehensive instruction on mentally disordered defendants from the Prosecutor General. This is looked upon as an advantage because it is relatively easy to change such legal instrum ents and by this means, adjust practice due to e.g., new knowledge or structural alterations within society, including psychiatry. Another major advantage is the form ulation of the laws. \u00a7 16 (1) us es the word \"mental illness\", which according to a more than 100-year-old traditi on is equivalent to the psychiatric term \"psycho- sis\". Consequently, psychiatrists k now the exact meaning of the j udicial term, because it corre- sponds precisely to a medical concept. Furthermore, changes in the psychiatric classification systems, such as the introduction of ICD-10 in 1994, or of new diagnostic entitie s, do not play any role, because the legal system accepts that psychiatry like other medical disciplines cont inuously develops theory and practice. In 1885 the Danish psychiatrist Knud Pontoppidan (1885) wr ote about a paranoid horse-dealer charged with threats: \"It may be that this man 100 years ago would not have been regarded as mad, and it may be that in 100 years he will not be regarded as mad. As for now, however, according to our present knowledge, this man is mad\". The same applies t oday. The term \"similar conditions\" (to psychosis) in \u00a7 16 (1) furthermore gives the psychiatrist some elbow-room in atypical cases. Last but not least, Danish forensic psychiatrists do not have to deal with the philosophic or legal concept of \"responsibility\". \u00a7 69 of the Penal Code deals with non-psychotic, but otherwise mentally abnormal offenders. The words used are vague - \"inadequate development, or an impairment or disturbance of his mental abilities\". The psychiatrists recommend a psychi atric measure for some defendants within \u00a7 69, and the terminology used in this section makes it possible to adjust practice according to current psychiatric knowledge, such as suggesting psychiat ric measures to some offenders with PTSD or pervasive developmental disorders. Collaboration Generally speaking, the collaboration among the various parties within Danish forensic psychiatry is smooth, with respect and understanding for the duties and tasks of the different professions. Forensic psychiatrists are regularly invited to lecture at meetings and seminars for judges, prosecu- tion or defence lawyers and vice versa. Every year or every two years, the Section for Forensic Psychiatry of the Danish Psychiatric Society arranges two- or three-day seminars on current foren- sic psychiatric issues with roughly 100 participants, around 30 of whom are from the legal profes- sion. The above-mentioned instructi on from the Prosecutor General came into force in 2002. The Prosecutor General requested a fo rensic psychiatrist to participate in the working group preparing the draft. Thereby many practical details were adjus ted to psychiatric viewpoi nts, to the benefit of both forensic psychiatry and the prosecution. Sex Offenders During the 1990s in Denmark as in many other countries sexual crimes became a rather heavily debated issue, and in 1997 a nationwide treatment programme for sex offenders was launched. The treatment is carried out in collaboration between the psychiatric health care system and the Department of Prisons and Probation. As prev iously mentioned, off enders who have committed non-violent sexual crimes and who are motivated for treatment might receive suspended sentences on condition of psychiatric/sexological treatment. The treatment takes place at one of the three psychiatric facilities collaborating with the Herstedv ester institution, all of which are departments of Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 116 university psychiatric clinics. Two of the three clinics are also connected with the aforementioned assessment centres. Based on individual needs, the clinics offer counselling, cognitive therapy, psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy or group therapy, together with psychopharmacological treatment if indicated. An offender is also under the supervision of a probation officer, who is re- sponsible for social support and help in cooperat ion with the local social authorities. Offenders who have committed more serious sexual crimes receive ordinary sentences. The im- prisonment, however, starts with a s hort stay in a special unit at the Herstedvester institution for the purpose of examining an offender's motivation fo r treatment, and if needed and possible, to moti- vate him for treatment. Treatment-motivated offenders then serve their sentences in open prisons and receive psychiatric/sexological tr eatment as previously described. The most dangerous sex offenders are not included in this arrangement, but are still offered treat- ment during their imprisonm ent in Herstedvester. A research project on the efficacy of treatment of sex offenders has from the very beginning been integrated into the treatment programme. Pre liminary results (Department of Prisons and Proba- tion, 2004), however, show that neither the rate of recidivism for sexual crimes nor the type of re- offending differs among those who have received treatment and those who have not. Changes in referral and treatment procedures, for example with greater emphasis on alcohol abuse, are under consideration. Capacity Problems The paramount problems within Danish forensic ps ychiatry are problems of capacity. The number of forensic patients has increased from ar ound 300 in 1980 to around 1,500 in 2004. During the same period, the total number of psychiatric beds has decreased from around 10,000 to around 4,000. The causes behind the increasing number of forensic patients are disputed, but de- institutionalisation probably plays a major role (Kramp & Gabrielsen, 2003). The growing number has many consequences for the assessment and treatment of forensic patients. Due to the shortage of psychiatric beds, some def endants suspected to be mentally ill must wait for weeks or even months for admission for an i npatient assessment and then the report may be de- layed due to a lack of resources. For many years the assessments of outpatients presented similar problems in some parts of the country, but these have been alleviated by the establishment of the aforementioned four centres. The shortage of beds also implies that mentally ill prisoners - remanded or not - have to wait for admission or - and perhaps more often - are quickly returned to the prison once treatment, for example neuroleptic treatment, has been initiated. Psyc hotic inmates may also prefer to stay in a prison rather than be admitted to an overcrowded psychiatric facility. Studies of the treatment of for ensic patients have shown that some outpatients in need of inpatient treatment and care may wait months for admission and that outpatient treatm ent in some cases is far from being intensive enough (Kramp et al., 2001). At the political-administrative level, the countie s and the government discuss t he issue of who is to pay - the legal system is run by the government, the psychiatric health care system by the coun- ties. Do forensic patients belong to the former or the latter? Patients Rights Generally speaking, the rights of Danish forensic patients are one or the other in accordance with international conventions. The instruction from t he Prosecutor General mentions that the police shall be aware of possible signs of mental di sorder in defendants and not interrogate mentally ill Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 117 defendants without the presence of the defence. A defence lawyer w ill be appointed to a mentally ill defendant from the start of the case, and a defendant can appeal against all decisions to a higher court. During the course of a psychiatric measure - be it \"placement\" or \"treatment \" - the prosecution is obliged to make regular inquiries about a patient, and the psychiatrist responsible for the treatment may at any time suggest that a psychiatric m easure be changed or abolished, if e.g., a patient's condition has improved to such a degree that t he measure presumably is not needed any longer. In such cases, a court hearing will take place. Ever y forensic patient is appointed a representative, either of their own choice or from among a corps of interested lay persons. Every six months, the patient or his representative c an ask the prosecution to bring his case before the court, pleading that the measure should be changed or abolished. C oncerning the \"placement sanctions\" of unlim- ited duration, the prosecution is obliged to bring the case before the court at the latest five years after the judgement and thereafter, every second year. The regulations about involuntary treatment, coercion etc. are stipulated in the Mental Health Act and are the same for forensic and for civil pat ients. An independent regional board must approve involuntary treatment. In certain emergency cases the psychiatrist can initiate involuntary treatment and afterwards lay the case before the board. The Danish ombudsman inspects prisons (includi ng the Herstedvester inst itution) and closed (fo- rensic) psychiatric facilities. Mi nor mistakes like misunderstandings or insufficient notes about e.g., decisions on leaves can always be found, but the ombudsman has not expressed any general criti- cism of the patients' rights. The European Committee for the Prev ention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has visited t he same types of facilities and observed the same as the Danish ombudsman. Epidemiology Denmark has a long tradition of epidemiological research within general psychiatry and during the last ten years, some epidemiological forensic studies have been carried out by a group based at the Clinic of Forensic Psychiatry in Copenhagen. G enerally, however, forensic psychiatric research is limited, probably because until recently th is area has not attracted attention. The Danish Psychiatric Register is a well-know n tool in epidemiological research (Munk-Jorgensen & Mortensen, 1997); the Danish Crime Register is the most thorough, comprehensive and accurate crime register in the Western world, and has been used in major epidemiological studies (Brennan et al., 2000). Every citizen in Denmark has a civil registration number, registered in the Civil Regis- tration System. The civil registration number makes it possible to link data from various registers such as the Psychiatric and the Cr ime Registers. All such register-based studies are subject to rigorous safety regulations. The exchange of register data for clinical use is forbidden. Gottlieb et al. (1987a & 1987b) have studied homic ide in Greater Copenhagen and shown that the number of psychotic (schizophrenic) homicides increased from 1959 to 1983, and that alcohol abuse and homicide are connected. In a clinical study, Andersen has investigated possible psychiatric/psychological consequences of solitary confinement (Andersen et al., 2000) and ps ychiatric morbidity, substance abuse etc., among remanded prisoners (Andersen et al., 2004). Roughly two thirds of the prisoners were diag- nosed according to ICD-10, including substance abuse disorders. The mental and physical health of many prisoners improved due to regular food, heal th care service etc. Solitary confinement de- lays this improvement and some of those sent enced to solitary confinement develop adjustment disorders or mild depressive reactions. Sestoft (1997) has made a thorough clinical st udy of remanded schizophrenics, including those admitted to a psychiatric facility. Criminal sch izophrenics are socially much more strained than Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - D enmark 118 criminals who are not mentally ill. Not all schizophrenics are diagnosed by the prison health ser- vice. Munkner (2004) has studied a Danish cohort of schizophrenic patients and among other things shown that close to 50 % of all young schizophrenic males are registered in the Crime Register for transgression of the Penal Law. Many males, however, had committed the first crime(s) before they were diagnosed as schizophrenics, whereas the crim e debut for females lies after the disease has been diagnosed. In a clinical study, Gosden has found a high psychi atric morbidity in a representative sample of remanded adolescents. A register-based study s howed that the risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder is increased among adolescents who have been charged or sentenced for violence and who also have previous admissions to a psychiatric facility (Gosden, 2004). Kramp and Gabrielsen (2003) have estimated the annual growth rate of the population of forensic patients in Denmark from 1980 to 1999 to be 6 % - 7 %. At present around 75 % of all forensic patients suffer from schizophrenia. Significant ly more schizophrenics than the general population commit acts of violence and ars on (Kramp & Gabrielsen, 2004). A recent study has established t hat 56 % of the Department of Pr isons and Probation's entire clien- tele - prisoners, remanded prisoners, and client s under supervision - commit substance abuse: 14 % abuse opioids (and many other drugs), 6 % abuse mainly stimulants, 14 % mainly cannabis, and 22 % commit alcohol abuse (Kramp et al., 2003). Risk-assessment has not been a big issue in Denmar k, but studies concerning this field are con- sidered. Public Opinion and Mass-Media The debate in Denmark concerning crime and criminal s, as it appears in the media, is contradic- tory. On the one hand, public opinion calls for severe punishment, while demanding more treatment on the other. Both possibilities have been realised. T he punishment for offences such as violence, some sexual crimes, and organised drug dealing has become more severe; at the same time, a treatment programme for sex offenders has been in itiated and various \"anti-violence\" educational programmes, together with many other progra mmes, have been introduced in prisons as well as within the probation service. There is little debate about mentally ill offenders. The main theme is the aforementioned capacity problems. This debate, however, takes place mainly among psychiatrist s themselves and between psychiatrists and administrators/politicians, not with the public. As a result of this debate, some new forensic psychiatric beds will pr obably be established within the years to come, mainly by convert- ing general psychiatric to for ensic psychiatric facilities From time to time, the question about security and dangerousness blows up in the media. Some forensic facilities are located in old mental hospitals with a rather low level of structural security, and escapes have occurred. If a patient is supposed to be dangerous, blame has been placed on the security and perhaps on the psychiatrist, but not on the legislation about mentally ill offenders. With regard to court cases against mentally ill offenders, the media are by and large subdued, re-stricting themselves to descriptions like \"severe psychic problems\" or \"clearly mentally ill\". The as- sessment report is presented in court, but details from the report are almost never reproduced in the media. Psychiatry has always been a matter of public debate and the current topics in Denmark are the homeless and/or substance-abusing mentally ill, the use of coer cion and involuntary treatment, and how to treat immigrant patients. While forensic psychiatry is part of general psychiatry, and may thus be included in the debate, of itself forensic psyc hiatry is not in the public focus, neither for the good nor for the bad.

These areas contain 52 million people (88.5% of the total UK population). The la w in Northern Ireland (population 1.7 million) is similar to that in England & Wales. That in Scot land (population five million) is rather different. The chapter concerns 'mentally disordered offenders' , a term which incorporates both those suffering from mental illness and those with disorders of pers onality. The two are strictly differentiated in the United Kingdom. Overview Practice regarding mentally disordered offenders in England & Wales differs from that in most European countries in the following respects: The issue of criminal responsibility is absent, except in cases of homicide. Treatment in hospital is through a sentence of the court, after a finding of guilt is made. Although provisions for defences of 'not guilty by reason of insanity' exist, they are very little used as they are not necessary for a court to adopt a hospital disposal of a criminal case. The sentencing court plays no further part in the case after a person has been sent to hospital. The court cannot sentence a person to hospi tal treatment unless the intended hospital and treating physicians agree to provide a bed for a patient. The main expert in giving advice about the need for hospital treatment is in all cases one of the psychiatrists from the hospital which will be treating the patient. There is no division of psychiatrists into experts and treating physicians. The court does not determine which hospital a sentenced person is treated in. This is determined by the domicile of t he defendant and the psychiatrists' opinion as to the level of security needed. There is no strict division of hospitals, or wards within hospitals, into forensic and non- forensic. Local psychiatric hos pitals treat both, and forensic patients may be treated in the same wards as general patients. All forensic facilities for the mentally ill are par t of the National Health Service: there are no forensic hospitals with in the prison service. The forensic psychiatric system is focused on the treatment of people with serious mental illness: until recently, there has been little att ention given to those with disorders of personality. There is a well-developed psychiatric sub-specialit y of forensic psychiatry, with its own full- time higher training programmes, which are stri ctly regulated by a national body. There is a minimum of three years higher training in the speciality, after basic post-graduate psychiatric training and examinations have been completed. Criminal Law in England & Wales England and Wales differ from most other European countri es in that the system of law is not closely based on Roman law. There is no Criminal Code in English law. Criminal law has two sources: common law and legislation. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 123 Com mon law is that part of English law which is not t he result of legislation. It originally developed from the decisions of judges which were based in tradtion, custom and precedent. Decisions on individual cases in the appeal courts act as a bindi ng precedent and in effect modify the law (statute as well as common law) in a manner which influences the outcomes of future cases. There are some offences which exist in common law only. For instanc e, murder is a common law offence: there is no statutory law against murder, although the penalty is set by statute. Statute law : the vast majority of offences are defi ned and regulated by statut es, i.e. Acts of Parliament which have duly been passed through bot h Houses and received the Royal Assent. The Criminal Courts in England & Wales Criminal cases are investigated by the polic e. Prosecutions are undertaken by a separate independent prosecution agency, the Crown Prosecution Service. In other words, the police do not prosecute cases, and there are no examining magi strates. The functions of investigation, prosecution and judging of cases are entirely separate. The lowest criminal courts are the Magistrates' C ourts, which deal with minor offences. They are less formal than higher courts. Cases are heard by magi strates, who are either trained lawyers sitting alone, or members of the public who have become 'Justices of the Peace' and usually sit as a triumvirate, supported by a legally -trained clerk. More serious cases are heard in the Crown Court, in front of a judge and jury. The Crown Court also hears cases appealed from the Magistrates Courts on factual points. Cases are appealed on points of law to the High Court (Queen's Bench Division). Appeals against conviction and sentence are to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). The House of Lords is the supreme court of appeal. Its judicial functions are separate from its legislative work. Cases are heard by up to thirteen senior j udges known as Law Lords. As a Member State of the European Union, the United Kingdom is obliged to defer to the European Court of Justice on matters of European Union law and as a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom is answerabl e before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The enactment of the Human Right s Act 1998 conferred new powers and duties on the English Courts. Laws Concerning the Placement and Treatment of Mentally Disordered Offenders Mental health legislation in England & Wales is comprehensive, detailed and re latively sophisticated. Its emphasis is on the patients' best interests in terms of their health. The legislation does not prevent psychiatrists or the cour ts from imposing compulsory treat ment in hospital where this is thought necessary. Such powers are balanced by a comprehensive system of safeguards and independent checks on their use and an emphas is on ensuring patients' rights. Mental Health Act 1983 Nature One Act of Parliament regulates compulsory adm ission and treatment of bot h civil patients and those concerned in criminal proceedings or under sentence - the Mental Health Act 1983. Part III of the Act deals with those concerned in criminal proceedi ngs or under sentence. T hose parts of the Act concerning compulsory treatment and appeals procedures apply to both groups. The 1983 Act determines that the Secretary of Stat e (in effect the Department of Health) prepare, and from time to time revise, a Code of Practice to offer practitioners guidance on how to carry out their functions under the Act. The Code of Practi ce is published as a substantial volume which details good practice in terms of procedures for compulsory detention and treatment, but also covers in detail areas not dealt with in the primary legisl ation, including restraint, seclusion, and after-care. The Mental Health Act does not impose a legal duty to comply with the Code, but as it is a statutory document, failure to follow it could be referred to in evidence in legal proceedings. In practice, it is used as the standard by the independent commission which monitors the implementation of the Mental Health Act in individual hospitals. As su ch, it is for the most part rigidly adhered to. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 124 The interpretation of the meaning of sections of the Act is regularly redefined or modified by decisions in the courts, which ac t as precedents for future cases. An increasing number of cases are being decided by reference to the European Convent ion of Human Rights, which was incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act of 1998. The annotated version of the Mental Health Act, including notes on interpretation and case law, re levant rules and government circulars and the Code of Practice, now runs to 850 pages in small font (Jones, 2003). Scope The legislation concerns people with \"mental diso rder\", and applies to any age. Mental disorder comprises four categories: \"mental illness\" (which is not further defined); \"arrested development of mind (mental impairm ent)\", \"psychopathic disorder' (in effect, personality disorder), and any other disorder or disability of mind\". The definitions of \"mental impairment\" and of \"psychopathic disorder\" specify that there must be \"abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct\" for the persons concerned to fall within the scope of the Act. Specifically excluded from t he scope of the Act are \"immoral conduct, sexual deviancy or dependence on alcohol or drugs\". Prov isions The Act includes provisions for the transfer to hospital of remand prisoners for assessment or treatment. It also includes provisions for the transfer to hospital of serving prisoners who have become ill in gaol. Treatment as a Sentence The main treatment order, that dealt with under section 37 of the Act, concerns those that have been found guilty of any criminal offence for which the law would potentially allo w a custodial sentence. Being sent to hospital under this order constitutes a sentence of the court. It should be emphasised that this follows a finding of guilt, and that concepts of criminal responsibility are irrelevant, except in cases of homicide. For such an order to be imposed, the court must be satisfied, on the written or oral evidence of two medical practitioners (at least one must be a psychiatrist) that: 1) The person is suffering from a mental di sorder \"of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in hospital for medical treatment\". 2) In the case of 'psychopathic order' (in effec t, personality disorder) or mental impairment, that \"such treatment is likely to alleviate or to prevent a deterioration of his condition.\" 3) That this is the most suitable method of disposing of the case, given the nature of the offence and the record of the offender. (In other words, that community treatment or other disposal would not be preferable). 4) That, on the evidence of the psychiatrist who will be treating the patient or of any other representative of the hospital management, that the hospital in question agrees to treat the patient and will offer a bed within 28 days. Compared with many other European jurisdictions, the criteria for hospital disposal can be seen as almost wholly medical in nature, although the legal terminology used to describe mental disorder does not coincide exactly with modern medical term inology. \"A hospital order is not a punishment.... Questions of retribution or deterrence are immaterial . The sole purpose of the order is to ensure that the offender receives the medical care and a ttention which he needs in the hope and expectation that the result will be to avoid the commission by the offender of fu rther criminal acts\" (v. Birch, 1989). For most people put on such an order, their position becomes almost exactly the same as if they were a civil patient. The patient in effect passes out of the penal system and into the hospital system. The courts retain no powers of any kind. Leav e and discharge are the decision of the treating psychiatrist and are not reviewed by any other authority. The psychi atrist may discharge the patient at any time, as may the managers of the hospital. The patient may only be detained for six months, unless the order is renewed by the treating psychi atrist. This can only be done if certain conditions, which resemble those which were satisf ied when he was admitted, are fulfilled. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 125 The court may also impose a 'guardianship order' under section 37, in cases where treatment in the community would be preferable. This requires the patient to live at a certain address and to attend appointments with a psychiatrist and social worker. It cannot enforce pharmacological treatment in the community. Restrictions on Release Where a person has been convicted of a serious off ence, a Crown court has the power to add to a treatment order under section 37 a so-called 'restric tion order' under section 41 of the Mental Health Act. This has the effect of removing from the treat ing psychiatrist the power to release the patient from hospital. Release is determined by the Inte rior Ministry, or by an independent Mental Health Review Tribunal. The decisions of the Tribunal are based on strictly defined legal criteria set out within the Mental Health Act. There is no concept of 'tariff', or the patient remaining in hospital for longer for more serious offences. In order for the Court to impose a restriction order , it must be the judgement of the court that the imposition of the order is necessa ry \"for the protection of the public from serious harm\". This is therefore a provision based upon considerations of pub lic safety. The decision to impose a restriction order is however not based on the gravity of t he offence as such, but upon a judgement as to dangerousness and prognosis, based in part upon the defendant 's previous record, both in terms of offending and in terms of co-operation with tr eatment. It remains possible (and indeed not unusual) both for patients to be released from hospital after a relatively short period, despite having committed a very serious offence; and also for patients to be k ept in hospital for longer periods that they would have served, if they had been giv en a prison sentence. This is because discharge is determined principally by medical outcome. The imposition of a restriction order also has two further consequences. Fi rstly, it deprives the psychiatrist of the power to give a patient leave in the community wi thout the approval of the interior ministry. Secondly, it provides for the conditional discharge of patients. This means that patients have to comply with conditions imposed by the M ental Health Appeal Tribunal. Failure to comply may result in recall to hospital, if there is any deterioration in mental state. The most common conditions to be imposed are attendance at a psychi atric clinic and taking medication; keeping in contact with a social worker; and residing at a specific address. A conditional discharge from a restriction order is the nearest thing in the curr ent mental health law to a form of compulsory treatment in the community. The necessity for such an aftercare provision in a given case is a common reason for a psychiatrist to recommend to a court that a restriction order be imposed. Trial of treatm ent post conviction Under section 38 of the Act, it is possible for a pers on to be sent to hospital for a trial of treatment. This is often used for those where the diagnosis is in doubt. It is also usual for the relatively few cases of personality disorder disposed of under the Act to undergo such a trial of treatment in order to decide whether or not a section 37 treatment order should be recommended. Treatment before Trial The most common form of transfer to hospital befor e trial in cases of violent offending is a Home Office transfer warrant under section 48 of the M ental Health Act. This is an order made by the Interior Ministry for transfer to hospital (there is no Ministry of Justice in the UK). It is based upon the recommendation of two doctors, one of whom must be the future treating physician or another psychiatrist from the relevant hospital. It is possible for the Crown court to use powers under section 36 to transfer a person to hospital for treatment, the mechanism being not dissimilar to an order under section 37. In practice, this provision is rarely used, mainly because there is a twelve-week limit on the power and this is rarely long enough. In less serious cases, where the court process will be completed rapidly, it is usual to move straight to trial. A section 37 hospital treatment or der may then be imposed after conviction, based on psychiatric assessments made in the rem and prison or in the cells at court. Assessment before Trial Most assessments of defendants will o ccur by psychiatrists visiting the defendant in prison. Many of these will lead to transfer to hospital for treatment before trial. It is possible for a court to remand a Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 126 person to hospital for reports under section 35 of t he Act. The only advantage to this provision is that it only requires the recommendation of the treati ng psychiatrist, or someone acting on his behalf. The disadvantages are that the order does not allow compulsory treatment, and that a bed has to be provided within seven days of the order being made, a difficult task when there is a shortage of beds. For these reasons, the order is little used. Other Modes of Compulsory Treatment Defendants can also be sent to hospital for treatmen t, either pre-trial or pos t-trail, under the civil provisions of the Mental Health Act. A system of so-called psychiatric 'diversion schemes' has been set up in the last 15 years at magistrates' courts in England & Wales. This involves psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers ex amining defendants in the cells at court, and making recommendations for civil or forensic orders, in order that the per son can be admitted directly to hospital without any delay (James et al, 2002). Transfer to Hospital of Sentenced Prisoners for Treatment Prisoners serving a sentence can be transferred to psychiatric hospital for treatment under an Interior Ministry warrant under section 47 of the Mental Health Act. This requires the recommendations of two doctors, one of whom must be a psychiatrist from the treating facility. The circumstances for such transfer are similar to those for compulsory hospital admission from the community. After successful treatment, the patien t/prisoner can be returned to prison to continue with their sentence. In practice, such a return is often counter-productive, and many patients will instead stay in hospital until such time as their earliest date of release from their sentence is reached. Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 This Act incorporates provisions that can be used for cases where a person is unfit to plead or where a person fulfils the antiquated criteria for a ve rdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. Fitness to Plead Opinion as to fitness to plead is provided by medi cal practitioners, but the criteria upon which fitness is decided are legal ones, based largely upon case la w and not defined by legislation (James et al., 2001). With distant origins in medieval concer ns about muteness, and s haped by defining nineteenth century judgements along lines of intellectual c apacity and comprehension, the criteria are now principally applied to mental illness, the largest category in unfit findings. Variously set out in expanded or condensed form by different authorities, t he criteria concern a series of capacities and comprise the following. Does the person under stand the nature of the charge? Does he understand the meaning of entering a plea? Does he underst and the consequences of his plea? Is he able adequately to instruct his solicitors? Can he under stand the details of the evidence? Can he follow the proceedings of the trial so as to make a proper defence, for instance challenge a juror? Legally, only one of these questions need be answered in t he negative for a finding of unfitness to be made. The procedure for dealing with fitness to plead under the Criminal Procedure Act 1991 involves a complicated process, with the empanelment of two juries in a Crown Court, one to make a decision as to fitness to plead, after hearing medical evidence, and the other to decide on a 'trial of the facts' (in other words whether, under the balance of probab ilities, the defendant did the act leading to the charge), where the defendant is deemed unfit. This procedure is rarely resorted to. It has few benefits. The disposals available to the court after a finding of unfitness are si milar to those available to the court after a finding of guilt. And a pers on deemed unfit may be returned to court for trial, should they later become fit with treatment, although ther e is no obligation to return them to trial. In practice, use of the Criminal Procedure Act for ca ses of unfitness is avoided where possible. Unfit defendants are treated in prison pre-trial under the Mental Health Act, so avoiding all the complications mentioned above. Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity In practical terms, the existence of an insanity verdict is something of an irrelevance and only a few such findings are made each year. The disposals ava ilable to the court after an insanity finding are virtually the same as those that are available if the person pleads or is found guilty of the offence with which he is charged. The only benefit from going dow n the insanity route, therefore, is to avoid a Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 127 conviction being recorded on the individual's criminal re cord. It is simply not necessary in facilitating hospital disposal. In order to qualify for an insanity defence, it has to be proved that \"at the time of committing the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.\" These Victorian legal terms hav e little to do with modern clinical reality. In any case, they are so restrictive that many floridly psychotic individuals would not fall within them. Hom icide There is only one sentence that can be imposed fo r the sentence of murder, and that is life imprisonment. This was introduced for political reasons upon the abolition of capital punishment, and appears to many an illogicality, as it does not allow the sentence to reflect the circumstances of the crime. It also presents difficulties, should someone w ho is mentally ill be found guilty of murder, as it does not permit a disposal direct to hospital, necessitating instead the complexity of transfer to hospital as a convicted prisoner. Where someone who is mentally ill is accused of murder, there is usually a defence available of diminished responsibility available to them under se ction 2 of the Homicide Act 1957. This reduces the category of crime from murder to manslaught er. On conviction for manslaughter, the judge can impose a wide variety of sentences, including hospita l disposal under the Mental Health Act. This defence applies, in the words of the Homicide Ac t, \"if he was suffering from such an abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent cause or induced by disease or injury) as subst antially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts.\" This is decided by a jury. The terms in the Act are legal ones, rather than medical. Their scope is potentially very wide, and successf ul diminished pleas have occurred in cases of relatively minor abnormalities, including pre-menstrual tension. The provisions of section 2 of the Homicide Act were relevant when the sentence for murder was death, in that they provided an easier means than the insanity def ence of avoiding sentencing the mentally ill to death. The provisions would not now be necessary at all if the mandatory life sentence for murder were abolished. This seems unlikely to happen because of base political considerations. The problem with the Act remains that the conc ept of diminished responsibility is a legal one. Although decided by a jury, it entails psychiatrist s giving their opinion on matters of responsibility, which most would see as inappropriate. The Infanticide Act of 1922 This is of relevance only in cases where women kill their children in the first year of life. It is a historical curiosity from the days when capital puni shment still existed. If a woman \"causes the death of her child under the age of twelve months, but at the time of the act...the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactati on consequent on the birth\", a finding of infanticide will be made. The law is used in a handful of cases each year . The commonest sentence is a probation order. Proposed Changes to M ental Health Law The government is proposing the introduction of a new Mental Health Bill, which would make major changes to the provisions for civil detention. Its aim is to allow compulsory treatment orders to apply both in the community and in hospital. The Bill was drawn up without any form of meaningful consultation with the medical profession. The proposals have been heavily criticised by the psychiatrists' professional body, by civil liberties groups and by mental health charities. The introduction of the bill has now been delayed. The Bill, in its current form, would affect the treat ment of mentally disor dered offenders less radically than civil patients. However, there are important changes propos ed. There are changes to the definition of mental disorder. There would be no exclusions, so allowing the detention of people for alcohol or drug addiction. The stipul ation that treatment must be of benefit is removed for those with personality disorders and mental impairment. This would potentially lead to the detention of Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 128 untreatable people with personality disorder, and the i ndefinite incarceration of people with no mental illness simply to prevent offending. In addition, the Bill would allow those placed on community treatment orders in the community and then incarcerated in prison, to continue to be treated compulsorily after being placed in prison. In the view of most psychiatrists, this would be unethical, as coercive treatment and punishment should not become mixed. The standard of prison medical services is currently very poor, and compulsory tr eatment in prison is not currently permitted. Any change to this, apart from the ethical considerat ions, would probably be impractical and unworkable. It is anticipated that the government may make subs tantial changes to its bill before it is introduced to parliament. Provision for M entally Disordered People in the Health Care System The United Kingdom has a National Health Service whic h is entirely free at the point of delivery. No payments of any kind are made by pat ients. All provision for the treatment of mentally disordered offenders has been within National Health Service hospi tals or in private hospitals, paid for by the National Health Service. There are three principal tiers of security within i npatient psychiatric provisi on in the Health Service. All will take both patients detained under civil or ders and those detained under forensic orders. The patients are mixed within the hospitals and wi thin individual wards in the hospitals. 1) The first tier is the general psychiatric hospital . These facilities used to be located in large asyla, many of them originating in the nineteenth century. Most have now been replaced by small local psychiatric units, often attached to general hos pitals. These units will have both open wards and wards where the door is locked ('local secure wa rds'). Minor offenders will be admitted to general psychiatry wards. More serious offenders are likely to be moved back to general hospitals after periods spent in more secure facilities. It is not possible to calculate how many beds are occupied in such facilities by people originally admi tted from the criminal justice system. 2) The third level of secure care is the high security hospital . There are three such hospitals, of which the best known, Broadmoor, was opened in 1863. Thes e hospitals have both internal security and perimeter walls. In order to gain admission to these hospitals, patients have to pose a grave and immediate danger to the general public. This is a very high standard to meet, and would not include most homicide cases. The numbers in these hospi tals are now being reduced and there are currently around 1,200 patients remaining. It is no longer thought appropriate to detain women in such facilities. The average length of stay in su ch facilities is seven to eight years. 3) Until the 1980s, there were no facilities other than the general hospitals and the high security hospitals. Since that time, an intermediate tier of facilities has gradually been built. These are known as medium secure facilities. Whilst they have good staffi ng levels and internal locks and limits on movement, they do not have any walls or perimeter security. To this sort of unit will be admitted most cases of homicide or serious wounding. The units will also take patients on civil orders whose behaviour is so disturbed that t hey cannot be contained in general psychiatry wards. There are around 2,000 medium secure beds in England and Wales, which is an insufficient number. A building programme is underway, hampered by a shortage of fu lly-trained forensic psychiatrists. There are said to be an equivalent number of medium secure beds in the private sector , which contain patients being paid for directly by the National Health Service. Whilst many contain longer-term forensic cases, there is a greater represent ation of civil cases, reflecting t he shortage of low secure beds (in particular, long-term low secure beds) in general psyc hiatric units. In most medium secure units, the average length of stay is two to three years. Longer-term units are now being built for patients whose illnesses are refractory to treatment. Medium secure units differ from general psychi atry units by being better-appointed in terms of buildings and facilities, and far better staffed. The maximum recommended number of patients for any consultant (senior psychiatri st) is between twelve and fourteen. Each consultant works with a team including a psychologist, a social worker, an occupational therapist and one or two junior doctors. Medium secure and high secure units are staffed by fo rensic psychiatrists. Fo rensic psychiatry is a high-status sub-speciality. In order to become a forensic psychiatri st, doc tors mus t first qualify in Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 129 basic psychiatry. This takes a minimum of three to four years, and involves passing two sets of examinations. Thereafter, would-be forensic psychiatrists need to spend a minimum of three years in specialist forensic psychi atry training rotations, before they are qualified to apply for substantive posts. There are currently approximately 200 consult ant forensic psychiatrists in the country. The number thirty years ago was six. There is a proj ected need for 460 by the end of 2006, which it is unlikely that it will be possible to meet. Each area has a tertiary forensic psychiatry servic e, usually based in a medium secure unit. This will usually provide a range of other services: consult ant sessions in local pris ons; specialist aftercare teams which aid in reintroducing patients to general psychiatric community care; diversion schemes in magistrates' courts and/or police stations; and an assessment service to local hospitals and to distant prisons. The psychiatrists w ill also provide psychiatric reports to courts on all cases domiciled in the area for which they are responsible. There is a nationwide lack of inpatient forensic beds for adolescents. At present, most adolescents are treated by default on adult wards. This inappropr iateness of this situation has been recognised and there are plans to built adolescent forensic fa cilities, when sufficient funds become available. Until recently, all wards except in high security hospitals, have been mixed in terms of gender. There are now moves to provide some female only fac ilities, especially for acutely ill patients. The development of specialist forensic facilities for women is envis aged. However, such developments will be limited by their disproportionate cost, and the di fficulty in finding staff who wish to work in them. The government is in the process of introducing a new initiative for the treatment of people with personality disorder. Currently, very few such people are admitted to general hospitals or to medium secure units from the courts. Some cases are admitted to high security beds. The law restricts the treatment of people with personality disorders to those who psychiatrists deem treatable. These are few in number. The government is now introduci ng experimental assessment and treatment centres for people with personality disorders. Most of these are in prisons, and are the province of psychologists, not psychiatrists. There is also a new unit being developed in a high security hospital. Many psychiatrists are suspicious of these developments and do not view the inpatient treatment of those with primary personality disorders as the role of medicine. There are also concerns that the government, with the legal changes proposed in its Ment al Health Bill, will try to use mental health legislation to accomplish the indef inite preventive incarceration of people with no mental illness who have committed no offence and who are not amenabl e to any form of medical treatment. The Sy stem in Practice Admission to hospital The pathways from the criminal justice system into psychiatri c care are illustrated in the accompanying flow diagramme. They are as follows: 1) If a policeman finds someone in a public place and they deem them to be \"in need of care or control\", he may take them to a psychiatric hos pital where they may be detained for upto 72 hours to allow them to be assessed for detention under the ci vil sections of the Mental Health Act. This applies whether or not the person has committed a criminal offence. 2) A person arrested by the police may be exami ned by a psychiatrist at the police station and admitted to hospital under a civil order or on a vol untary basis. In such cases, the person is given police bail. The police may chose to continue with cr iminal charges, if this is thought to be in the public interes t. 3) A person who is arrested and held in custody by the police, must be brought before a magistrates' court within 24 hours. Where there is a psychiatri c diversion scheme at the court, it may be possible to divert the person to hospital for assessment or treatment under the civil or the forensic provisions Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 130 of the Mental Health Act. This can occur whilst the case still continues: the person will be bailed to hospital. Or the case can speedily be dealt with, and transfer to hospital can be as a sentence after a finding of guilt. 4) An accused person may be remanded in custody by the magistrates' court and sent to a remand prison. If the person appears ill, the court may ask for a psychiatric report. If the person appears ill at reception into the prison, the Prison Health Service is likely to offer a vol untary report to the court. Where the prison doctor thinks that a person ma y need hospital treatment, a consultant general psychiatrist from the hospital responsible for t he prisoner's domicile will be asked to come to the prison, examine the prisoner and give a report. If t hat consultant believes that the person needs a higher level of security than he can provide, the case will be passed on to the forensic consultant responsible for the domicile in question. The psyc hiatrists can quickly arrange the transfer of some one to hospital by: using a Home Office transfer warrant under section 48, inviting the court to make the appropriate pre- sentence order or to sentence the person to hospital after a finding of guilt. There are three important points to note: i) The report has to be provided by the psychiat rist who will be treating the person in hospital (or by one of his colleagues from the same hospital). ii) The courts are usually delighted to be able to send someone to a psychiatric hospital. The opinions of the psychiatrists in terms of Mental Health Act orders are not questioned or contested. iii) Delays in admission to hospital are comm on, owing to a shortage of beds. People may have to wait in the remand prison until a bed in the health service hospital becomes available. 5) Where the case involves a serious offence, it w ill be sent to the Crown Cour t for trial or sentence. The same range of possibilities exists as in 4) above. In addition, the Crown Court can impose a restriction order under section 41 of the Mental Health Act. It can also hear fitness to plead cases, and insanity defences. In contrast to the situati on with Mental Health Act disposals, the Crown Prosecution Service and/or the Court may order independent psychiatric reports from forensic psychiatrists, who need not be working in the hospi tal responsible for the domicile of the patient. Contested cases may arise, with psychiatrists giving contradictory evidence. The same may occur with defences of diminished responsibility in murder cases. If the experts all agree, then the matter tends to be processed quickly and without undue delay. 6) Sentenced prisoners who develop psychiatric ill nesses will be transferred to local general or forensic psychiatric hospitals using Home Office transfer warrants under section 47 of the Act. The process involves the psychiatrist from the treat ing hospital and is unproblematic apart from problems with bed shortages. Once the person is sentenced to hospital following a finding of guilt, a finding of unfit to plead or an insanity verdict, the court has no fu rther role in the case and it passe s into the control of the health service. As state above, t he patient's position becomes virtually t he same as that of a civilly detained patient, unless the court has imposed an additional restriction order. When a person no longer needs the level of security at which they have been detained, they will be passed down the chain, for instance from high security to medium security or from medium security to a general psychiatry ward. Movement from one level to another is based upon clinical need. Most patients admitted to forensic facilities through t he courts will eventually be looked after in the community by the general psychiatrists re sponsible for the area of their domicile. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 131 Leave Arrangements The psychiatrist responsible for t he patient's treatment has the power to allow leave into the hospital grounds or into the community, unless the patient is subject to a restriction order. In the latter case, the psychiatrist may allow the patient into the hospital grounds, but needs the permission of the Home Office to allow the patient out into the community. It is standard practice for patients to be allowed escorted community leave, followed by unescorted community leave, as their condition improves. Alcohol and Drugs Addiction to alcohol or drugs is an exclusion criter ion from the provisions of the Mental Health Act. These conditions cannot therefore be treated com pulsorily. Addicted prisoners will be detoxified on admission to prison. There will be limited voluntar y participation in group work concerning addiction whilst they serve their sentence in prison. Sex Offenders Disorders of sexual preference or behaviour are excluded from the Mental Health Act. Most sex offenders who are not suffering from mental illnesses will be given prison sentences. A very small number, who have treatable personality disorders, w ill be admitted to high security hospitals. In prisons, sex offenders may choose to attend sex o ffender treatment programmes, led mainly by probation officers and prison psychologists. Patients' Rights Issues Patients' rights are relatively we ll protected in England & Wales. Compulsory Treatment All compulsory orders, except for one assessment order, permit treatment as well as detention. Exceptions are for ECT, where either cons ent or permission from an independent \"second opinion\" psychiatrist is required: and fo r psychosurgery and the surgical im plantation of hormones, for which both consent and a second opinion are required. In addi tion, in all people involuntarily detained, after compulsory treatment has been administered for three months, a second opinion as regards the desirability of treatment must be obtained before it is continued, unless t he patient consents to treatment. Appeal Procedures Patients may appeal against detention either to the hospital managers or to an independently constituted Mental Health Review Tribunal. The latter will include an independent psychiatrist who will examine the patient. Both bodies will receive written reports from the treating psychiatrist and social worker (who are unlikely to be the same as those involved in the original detention). The appeal bodies may also hear evidence from these professionals and from the patient, whose case is usually put by a legal representativ e. The cost of the latter is me t by the State. Both appeal bodies have the power to discharge the patient from hospital. Extension of Treatment Orders Treatment orders last for six months, and c an be extended for a further six months, and then annually. Extension of a treatment order is deci ded upon by the treating psychiatrist, who must examine the patient and determine that the preconditions for compul sory treatment still apply. The continuation of detention is then examined by the hospital managers at a review meeting, at which the patient and a legal representative may be present, if the patient so desires. Independent Supervision of the Act An independent Mental Health Act Commission is c harged with the duty of reviewing the use of compulsory powers within the Mental Health Act, of investigating complaints, and of inspecting Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 132 facilities which patients are compul sorily detained. A system of regul ar inspection of facilities and of compulsory detention records is in place. Such in spection is searching, and includes the practice of unannounced visits, some being at night. Other than reviewing the use of the Act, the Commission reviews the conditions in which patients are detai ned, and compliance with the guidance given in the Code of Practice. Their duties extend to the ins pection of seclusion policies and records, and of practices concerning other aspects of practices impinging on patients' rights, such as search policies, the withholding of mail, and restrictions on visitors. Their reports on individual hospitals are made available to relevant agencies, and progress in addressing criticisms of practice is reviewed upon subsequent visits. Epidemiology It is not possible to provide exact figures as to the number of people admitted to psychiatric hospital from the courts each year. Provision of figur es is hampered by some being provided for England alone and some for England & Wales. Some are published for calendar years and some for the financial year. In addition, the presence of psychi atric diversion schemes has led to patients being admitted from the courts under civil sections. Whilst the number of these may be substantial, there is no way of differentiating civil orders made at courts from civil orders made at any other location. An additional problem is that patients are oft en admitted under pre-trial orders and then transferred to post-conviction orders. It is di fficult to track the changes in order, and there is a danger of double- counting. It is also unlikely that the figures gathered for non-restricted cases are particularly accurate. There are important inconsistencie s between figures gathered by different agencies. In 2002-03, 5% of all compulsory admissions to hospital in England were from courts and prisons. This was a decrease from the figure of 9% ten year s earlier. These figures include pre-trial transfers to hospital. During this period, the overall number of compulsory admissions rose by 20%. (Department of Health, 2003). In 2002, 657 people were admitted under unrestrict ed section 37 treatment orders in England & Wales. 204 were admitted with re stricted section 37 orders. There were nine restricted admissions after findings of not guilty by reason of insani ty. There are therefore probably around 1,000 hospital disposals under the forensic provisions of the Mental Health Act in England & Wales each year. There do not appear to be major changes in numbers from year to year. At 31st December 2002, there were 2,989 people current ly detained in hospital under various forms of restriction order, including sentenced prisoners, pre-trial prisoners and those found unfit to plead or not guilty by reason of insanity. Of these, 1,939 were detained under a section 37 treatment order (sentenced to treatment after a finding of guilt). Of the 2,989, 13% were detained solely under the category of personality disorder. Figures for new admissions show smaller proportions of people with personality disorders, as bed occupancy figures are distorted by their l onger length of stay. In 2001, 4% of all restricted admissions had a primar y diagnosis of personality disorder. The proportion of unrestricted patients with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder is much smaller. Current Problems Bed Shortages There is a chronic shortage of psychiatric beds , particularly in general psychiatry and medium security. The greatest shortfall is in low secure beds (particularly longer term beds) and in medium secure beds (particularly longer term placements) . The system must be seen as a hydraulic one, and pressure at one point in the system will be felt at another. As the numbers of high security beds contracts, the level of offending to achieve admi ssion to medium secure beds increases. This then has a knock-down effect on the level of offending amongst those admitted to general psychiatry beds from the courts. Improved services to prisons result in the identif ication of greater numbers of people in need of transfer to the health service, and this further increases pressure. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - En gland & W ales 133 Shortages of Forensic Psychiatrists The rapid expansion of new forensic psychiatri c facilities is hampered by an inability to produce sufficient fully-trained forensic psychiatrists to r un the facilities in question. The system of junior doctor training is also insufficiently flexible to a llow the numbers of junior medical staff to expand to keep pace with the expansion in bed numbers. Difficulties at the General-Forensic Interface The shortage of low secure beds in general psychiatri c hospitals is resulting in general psychiatrists placing unrealistic expectations on the forensic serv ices about which patients they will agree to take. This results in friction. The better staffed and better equipped forensic services arouse the envy of the general services. There is beginning to be a c onsensus that forensic services have expanded far enough and that general services should receive more money. The idea is that many forensic cases represent failures in civil care through service s hortage. If these were corre cted, then many patients might not come before the courts. Expanding Prisoner Numbers Retributive legislation, based on the US model, which has been introduced over the past thirteen years by the current government and its predecessor, has resulted in the near doubling of the prison population. The UK now has the highest number of prisoners per capita of population in the European Union. The government is now beginning to realise that this position is unsustainable. However, it continues to cause problems in terms of services to prisons, given the poor state of prison health care. References Department of Health (2003) St atistical Bulletin.

The Mental Health Act regulates the assessment of offenders assumed to be mentally ill and the treatment of offenders who are m entally ill. Criminal law stat es the need to assess criminal responsibility by defining certain conditions for le ssened criminal responsibility or the lack thereof. Criminal law (Rikoslaki 1889/39, 3, 4\u00a7, 13.6.2003/515) defines general criminal responsibility from the age of 15 years on. Offenders younger than that do not enter c ourt processes. Secondly, the offender who has turned 15 at the time of the criminal act also has to possess criminal responsibility with regard to his /her ability to understand the nature of her/his offence, or its unlawfulness, and the capacity to control her/his behaviour. The law states that an offender can not be held criminally responsible if at the time of the act s/he is not able to comprehend the nature of the act, or to control her/his behaviour, due to mental illness, mental retardation, or severe mental disorder. An offender who is seen as not crimi nally responsible for a given crime will not be sentenced for that crime. It is po ssible that an offender might bear full criminal responsibility for one crime but lack understanding regarding another, and thus will be sentenced for one but not be sentenced for the other act. The law also acknow ledges the possibility that an offender may be less criminally responsible for an act but not lack comp lete criminal responsibility. In case of lessened criminal responsibility, the offender will receive a lesser sentence. A state of intoxication, or a similar condition that the offender her/himself has caused, does not lessen criminal responsibility. If the court does not sentence an offender who is judged to have acted without understanding and with a lack of criminal responsibility, the court has to consider whether the person is in need for involuntary psychiatric care. The decision on th is matter is requested from the Authority for Medicolegal Affairs (TEO). Involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation is regulated in the Mental Health Act. In order to find out whether an offender is m entally ill and perhaps has acted without understanding and may not have criminal responsibility regarding a given crime, the court can request a Forensic Psychiatric Assessment (FPA) from the Authority fo r Medico-Legal Affairs (TEO). The possibility to order FPA is stipulated in legislation regulat ing court processes (Oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari 17, 45\u00a7). The right to request FPA is given only to the court. The Mental Health Act regulates the involuntary treatment of the mentally ill. Independent of her/his will a person can be taken into psychiatric treatment if s/he is a) mentally ill, and b) due to her/his mental illness in need of treatment because failu re to provide treatment would result in deterioration of her/his mental health, or in harm to her/himself, or in harm to others, and c) no other treatment options are adequate. (Of the three different criteria in paragraph b, 1-3 must be fulfilled). While the Mental Health Act does not further define mental illness, the background material defines that mental illness refers to psychotic conditions, independent of aetiology. Finnish legislation and practice strongly emphasize the need for treatment and the best interests of the patient. In civil commitments, dangerousness to others (harm to others, as it is defined in Finnish law) is hardly ever used as the sole criterion fo r committing a mentally ill person. In addition to civil commitment, the Mental Health Act regulates F PAs and involuntary treatment of mentally ill offenders who have been given tr eatment order by TEO. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 137 Forensic Psychiatric Assessments are carried out to assess whether at the time of the crime an offender was mentally ill in such a way that her /his criminal responsibility must be considered lacking or lessened. The essence is the criminal re sponsibility: Mental illness or a mental disorder not alone is not sufficient for concluding a lack of criminal responsibility (and altering the consequences); rather it must be concluded that the mental state stood in causal relationship to the crime. In assessing criminal responsibility, the exper t must consider the extent to which the person was able to understand the factual and legal-moral nat ure of her/his act, and the extent to which s/he was able to control her/his behaviour. The ex pert must also consider whether the offender understood the consequences of her/his act for t he victim and her/himself, and whether s/he, at the time of the crim e, could control her/his actions . In addition, it must be stated whether the offender is now (at the end of the FPA) in need of involuntary treatment (fulfils the commitment criteria), and whether she/he can be heard at the trial. The Mental Health Act was passed in 1991. Since then it has undergone minor changes, mainly concerning changes in some decisive bodies , the names of which have consequently been changed in the text of the law, and in 2002, a more major change to clarify the criteria pertaining to the use of coercion during psychiatric inpatient treatment. However, the principles of involuntary treatment and the FPA have not changed. Assessment of \"danger to the public\" in Finnish legisl ation is implicitly incorporated into the Mental Health Act, since one of the commitment criteria is the risk of harm to others (see above). There is no further definition at the legislative level of how the risk should be assessed. The concept of \"danger to the public\" is not explicitly used, nor does the legislation ex plicitly mention risk assessment, to say nothing of requiring specific ri sk assessment protocols. Involuntary treatment after FPA is regulated by the same legislation that regulates civil commitment, with only some exceptions with regard to reassessment interval s and to the decision-making about termination of treatment. In civil commitment, involuntary treatm ent decisions are reassessed at three months after commitment, followed by a second reassessment six months after the first one. If involuntary treatment is considered necessary beyond nine mont hs, an external assessment is required. The second decision (at three months after the first detainment) is subjected to confirmation by administrative court. In the involuntary treatment of mentally ill offender s for whom the Authority of Medico-Legal Affairs (TEO) has issued an order for involuntary treatment, the reassessments take place every six months and are always made by the medical experts at the hospital of treatment. Like in civil commitment, the decisions are subj ect to confirmation by an adminis trative court. While normally it is medical doctors who decide about termination of tr eatment, in the case of criminal patients, for whom the Authority for Medico-Legal Affairs (TEO) has issued a treatment order after the FPA, the final decision is made by the TEO. The topic of mentally ill offenders has not been ve ry intensively discussed in Finland in recent years, nor has involuntary treatment in general been the target of public attention. The discussions that have been going on have not focused on either FPA or the subsequent involuntary treatment. A relevant major discussion and forthcoming change to the law that must be mentioned here is the planned option of psychiatric treatm ent rather than a penalty in legi slation (penal law) concerning crimes carried out as young person (15- 21 years) . This would apply to lesser crimes than those that may result in FPA, and presumably adolescent s coming to treatment through this route would not classify as \"mentally ill offenders\". Howeve r, this also illustrates the treatment-oriented philosophy in Finnish legislation concerning norm-breaking behaviour. (Otherwise, after serious crimes such as homicide, adolescent offenders can be assessed with regard to their criminal responsibility in a process similar to that for adult offenders.) Another current issue is that with the modernisation of criminal law, relating a lack of criminal responsibility to \"an act committed in state of lunacy, or in lack of understandi ng because of senility or alike conditions\", dating back to the late 1800s, has been changed to describing as a condition for the lack of criminal responsibility the offender's inability to comprehend the nature of t he act, or to control her/his behaviour, due to \"mental illness, mental retardation, or severe m ental disorder \". This requires a review as to how to interpret \"severe mental disorder\" as basis for lack of criminal responsibilit y, since in the Mental Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 138 Health Act, the basic criterion for commitment is \"mental illness\", a narrower concept. The Parliament has set the requirement that the gov ernment ensure that Crim inal Law and the Mental Health Act fit, so that an option of involuntary tr eatment is available with regard to those who lack criminal responsibility and thus would not be sent enced, particularly if the offender poses a danger to others. Prompted by this and some other developments and needs in mental health care, the Mental Health Act will possibly be modified, but it is yet too early to predict the outcome of this process. A committee led by the Ministry of Health and Welfare is working on the topic. Procedures When a crime becomes known to police, they start primary police investigations. If the crime was serious and it is considered important for safety or for the investigations, the police can detain the suspect(s) or imprison them for the duration of the investigation. The police can decide upon short detainment, while the court orders any longer periods of imprisonment before the final trial. If in this phase it is already obvious that the person suspected is mentally ill, she/he can be committed to a mental hospital according to the civil commitment ru les, where she/he, their health providing, would be heard, and from which s/he coul d come to court trials. Following conclusion of the police investigations , the prosecutor decides whether or not to prosecute. If a decision is made to prosecute, the case comes before the court. Criminal issues are primarily dealt with by the lower courts (k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oi keus). Verdicts by lower courts can be appealed to intermediate courts (hovioikeus), and further to the highest court. If t he prosecutor does not prosecute, victim can take the case to the court on their own initiative. The same structure of court responsibility pertains. If the crime is a serious one, such as a serious vi olent crime, homicide, a serious sexual crime or the like, the court can order an FPA to determine whether the offender's cr iminal responsibility is lessened or lacking. The TEO is responsible for this assessment, which can also be made only on the basis of documents. However, such decisions are rare; usually the TEO chooses the facility where the FPA is carried out as the period of i npatient assessment. The FPA are carried out in the two state hospitals, which are the forensic psychiatric hospitals serving the entire country, and in six other facilities which include the forensic psychiatric wards at certain hospitals, and a prison psychiatric ward. The assessment must be comple ted within two months of its beginning, although an extension can be requested and granted if there is good reason for that. At the end of the FPA, the expert(s) carrying out the a ssessment submit a written report to the TEO that concludes the criminal responsibility of the offender, her/his need for involuntary psychiatric treatment, and whether s/he can be heard in court. The person can not be heard if s/he is unable to attend (a very serious somatic illness), or if going to court would seriously endanger her/his health and safety (a seriously suicidal patient, whose safety could not be guaranteed if t he patient were to be taken out of the ward; psychosis alone, on the other hand, is not an absolute obstacle, even though the offender's court hearing might then not be meaningful.). The TEO board evaluates the expert FPA and formulat es its conclusions for the court. The court decides whether the offender acted in full criminal responsibility, had a lessened criminal responsibility, or completely lacked criminal res ponsibility. If the court conc ludes that the offender lacked criminal responsibility, it can ask the TE O to assess the need for involuntary psychiatric treatment. While the decision about involuntary treatm ent is in process, the court may order that pending the decision the offender be placed in prison. The TEO issues an order for the involuntary treatment of an offender who is current ly in need of psychiatric treatment. There are more decisions stating the lack of criminal responsibility than decisions mandating involuntary treatment. If a person is concluded to have lacked crimi nal responsibility, she/he will not sentenced to a penalty. If a person is concluded to have had full criminal responsibility for the crime but is now mentally ill and in need of treatment, the penalty may not be actualized but the person will be committed. If the person is mentally handi capped and in need of involuntary care for the Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 139 mentally handicapped (Act on Special Care for T he Mentally Handicapped), an order for her/his treatment under the relevant legislation is issued. In obvious cases and regarding lesser crimes, t he court may decide upon the lack of criminal responsibility of a mentally ill offender without commi ssioning a formal FPA. In practice, it is very likely that in such a situation the offender will already have been civilly co mmitted before the trial. A mentally ill offender for whom a treatment or der has been issued will be reassessed at six month intervals to determine whether the criteria for involuntary psychiatric treatment continue to be present. This assessment is carried out by the psychi atrists at the facility of treatment and. focuses on defining whether or not the commitment criteria given in the Mental Health Act (see above) are still fulfilled. Although one of the commi tment criteria is the risk of harm to others that the patient would pose without involuntary treatment, the l egislation does not otherwise define how such dangerousness should be assessed. The decision made in the reassessment process is subjected to confirmation in administrative court. The patient can appeal the decisions to continue treatment. The Mental Health Act also defines a possibility fo r the conditional release of forensic patients for whom a treatment order after FPA has been issued. In order to further confirm that her/his mental health is stable enough to allow final discharge, or to test whether her/his necessary psychiatric treatment in the community indeed is feasible, such a patient can be discharged for a maximum period of six months at a time into the supervision of the specialist level psychiatric unit serving the area where the patient permanently resides. Practice The Finnish process for the FPA of offenders suspec ted to be mentally ill is rather heavy, but the TEO has expressed its satisfaction with the results as to the reli ability and validity of the process. The judges have in a recent survey also expre ssed their satisfaction with the FPA-practices and the written reports they receive for trials. Over the past decade, the court practices have c hanged slightly so that the annual number of FPA ordered has somewhat decreased, and further, the c ourts tend to conclude less lack of criminal responsibility and less lessened criminal responsibility. This has inspired discussions (mainly within the psychiatric profession) as to whether more mentally ill persons now enter the prison system; indeed some research has suggested that there now might be more mentally disordered prisoners than there were earlier. However, most of the disorders detected in prison populations are not psychotic disorders, and the available studies failed to satisfactorily show that the problem would be that greater numbers of offenders who were ment ally ill to begin with would be entering prison. Rather, it seems that mental disorders related to substance use and conditions induced by acute detoxification are increasing particularly in the prisons. The psychiatrist s emphasize the importance of detecting those mentally ill offenders who s hould not be sentenced to prison but who should be treated. Less concern is expressed about the po ssibility that the FPA might produce \"false positives\", meaning that persons who are not really mentally ill would not be sentenced but would enter involuntary treatment. This has not been a significant problem in practice, even if it is, of course, a theoretical although unlikely possibility. The issue of carrying out stru ctured assessments of the risk of violence has been raised by the psychiatric profession, and forensic psychiatric facilities are increasingly using structured risk assessments such as HCR-20 and PCL, although nei ther the law nor the guidelines for FPA require them to do so. Risk assessments are espec ially utilized towards the end of the involuntary treatment to help clarify whether and how a person can be discharged from the hospital. The practice of conditional release after forensic psychiatric inpatient treat ment was not initially incorporated into the 1991 Mental Health Act, but added later in 1997. Civil psychiatry does not foresee any kind of compulsory outpatient care. The legislation focuses on FPA, treatment order and reassessments, and discharge, but the practices within the treatment period are left to the Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 140 discretion of the units of treatment. Such issues as leaves are thus a matter of the treatment plan like in psychiatric inpatient treatment in general , and are decided upon by the treating psychiatrist. The main forensic facilities are the two state psychiatric hospitals, Niuvanniemi Hospital and Vanha Vaasa Hospital. They admit patients for FPA and fo r involuntary treatment as ordered by the TEO, but they also admit especially challenging (viol ent and noncompliant) psychi atric patients without criminal status, who cannot be safely treated in the psychiatric facilities of the 22 health care districts. The expenses of the FPA are covered by the state, but the costs of the treatment periods are finally paid by the municipality of residence of the patient. Some of the psychiatric hospitals of the 22 health care districts also have their own forensic psychiatri c wards. The TEO can order the FPA and also decide to place a mentally ill offender in to treatment in the forensic psychiatric wards of the health care districts as well, if it is considered safe enough. The most challenging patients are placed in the state hospitals. If the period of tr eatment is very long (year s), the transfer of the patient to the facility in her/his own health care dist rict after the initial treat ment period in the state hospitals is possible if her/his potential for viol ence has decreased essentially. On the other hand, if necessary, it is also possible to transfer a patient from a health care district's forensic wards to one of the state hospitals. For minor forensic patients, two new units which serve the entire c ountry have been established since 2000. One of them, the Psychiatric Treatment and Research Unit for Adolescent Intensive Care (EVA), works in Tampere University Hosp ital, and the other is operating in Niuvanniemi Hospital. These units are designed to meet the requi rement that minor forens ic psychiatric patients and minor patients with especially challenging (violent and noncompliant) behaviour be treated separately from adult patients. Until now, minor patients with criminal patient status have been treated in adult forensic wards. In the Tampere unit, criminal history is not a requirement for admission, but the Unit admits adolescents in need of intensive care (of whom, however, many have at least a minor criminal hist ory, even if they do not qualify as \"criminal patients\" or \"mentally ill offenders\"). The number of under-aged ment ally ill offenders (who have gone through FPA and have not been sentenced but for whom a treatment order has been issued), has been very low, mainly zero to three cases per year have been in treatment (this may include the same patients from year to year, since these treatments tend to be long). The courts, the TEO, and the treatment facilities a ll appear to be fairly satisfied with the current legislation and practice of FPA and treatment of mentally ill offenders. J udges were surveyed about their opinions in 2003. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has expressed its concern about the expenses of the FPA, and the TEO ordered an evaluation by an exper t advisor of the practices and costs in the Nordic countries in 2003. However, the TEO has not exercised great pressure to reduce costs since it wishes to emphasize the re liability and validity of the assessments rather than the economical aspects. Initiating the process of FPA depends on the courts, and both the political climate and public opinion influence the courts just like any other pr ocess in society. It has been observed that the courts currently tend to order fewer FPA than in earlier times. Conditional release from forensic treatment was introduced for mentally ill offender s in 1997 in order to improve the quality of aftercare and reduce risks. As to the treatment of sex offenders, although some programmes were begun in recent years in prisons, no national programmes or guidelines exist. The National Development and Research Centre for Health and Welfare (STAKES) in now planning to initiate and coordinate treatment programmes for under-aged sexual offenders. Offenders who have committed their crime under the influence of alcohol and drugs are fully responsible for their crimes and are sentenced acco rding to the crime. There are substance-use treatment programmes in prisons, and prisoners can apply for placement in such a programme. In the community, treatment programmes are availabl e for those who have committed crimes, as well as to all users, but the involuntary treatment for substance-use disorders is not possible in Finland. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 141 Only psychotic conditions (suc h as delirium tremens, amphetam ine psychosis) can be treated on an involuntary basis. As for minor persons, legislative changes are curr ently in process to facilitate the psychiatric treatment and treatment of substance-use disor ders in minors who have committed crimes, instead of or as part of the verdict. It has been recomm ended by a committee for the revision of this law that under-aged offenders under certain circumstances receive a verdict mandating substance- use treatment or psychiatric treatment instead of, or as a part of their sentence. This would be a lighter process that the above-described FPA: the practi cal solutions are currently being discussed. Patients' Rights Patient rights in the process of forensic asse ssment and treatment are well protected in Finland. The criminal law protects mentally ill offender s from being sentenced. The Mental Health Act carefully regulates the treatment decisions and use of coercion during inpatient care. The Patients' Rights Act (passed 1993) is in force regarding offenders for whom an order for involuntary treatment has been issued, as well as with regar d to all patients. There have not been any major patients' rights debates in psychiatry or in forensic psychiatry for a long time. Epidemiology In summary, the relevant national trends in this context include: the decreased in the number of FPA requested by the courts over the past decade, from somewhat above 200 per year in the early 90s to somewhat fewer than 200 per year in the early 2000s (in 2000: 169, in 2001: 195, in 2002: 181, data based on the statistics of TEO); the decreased proportion of those judged as havi ng \"lessened criminal responsibility\" in favour of the category \"full criminal res ponsibility\". In 1991-1992, the TEO concluded that 48.4% of those assessed in FPA were fully responsible, 32.9% had a lessened criminal responsibility, and 18.6 % lacked criminal responsibility. In 2000 the figures were 54.4%, 22,5% and 21.9%, respectively, in and in 2002: 60.8% as fully responsible, 15.5% as lessened criminal responsibility, and 22.7% lacked criminal responsibility (Statistics of TEO). Data relevant to the study of crime trends and t he issue of mentally ill offenders are collected in: different registers of the Mi nistry of Justice and police or ganisation (figures of crimes investigated by police and brought to court, number of prisoners, main crimes of prisoners, information on how many times the prisoner s have been imprisoned (first timers, second, third...)). registers of Authority for Medico-Legal Affairs: TEO reports annual number of FPA requested, FPA completed, categories of criminal responsibility concluded, and involuntary treatment orders issued for offenders; afte r completing relevant permission procedures researchers can utilise the archives more thoroughly, and outstanding research has been carried out based on FPA documents National Hospital Discharge Register collects in formation on all inpatient treatment periods in Finland (in all specialities); for psychi atric inpatient treat ments, the patient's age, sex, municipa lity of residence, diagnoses, dates of arrival and discharge, referred by, referred from, discharged to, GAS, mode of entering the hospital (emergency, from waiting list), mode of referral (voluntary, involuntary, for FPA, on treatment order by TEO), coercive measures used (involuntary medication, seclusion, mechanical restraint, physical restraint, restrict ed leave), carers met during treatment (yes, Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 142 no). The data is person identifiable. (NHDR data has been used in structured questions - part of the present study.) As to mentally ill offenders, no information on the crime is registered in NHDR. Likewise, registers of the justice system do not contain information on mental illne ss. A more detailed picture of mentally ill offenders necessitates carrying out spec ific research using FPA documents and register linkages. Permission for research can be obtai ned via ethics committees and bodies supervising the registers of interest. Guidelines exist for permission policies. Data security legislation makes it difficult to exchange information even within the health care system unless the patient is co- operative. In carrying out FPA, the expert has a right to obtain information from all public institutions (school , health care etc.) independent ly of the patient's consent, but for treatment purposes, obtaining info rmation from previous treating agents, not to mention other bodies, requires the patient's inform ed consent. In general, this is likely to generate unnecessary costs in health care by resulti ng in repeated laboratory testing and the like. Public Opinion and Mass Media Court trials in Finland are generally open to the public and the media, and it is an exception if the court decides to handle a case behind closed doors. This could happen due to details related to the offender(s), or the victim, or the nature of the crime. It is individually decided in each case. It would not be automatically tied to the (assumed) mental illness of the offender, but this could be a reason for closed doors. The media has shown no particular in terest in the case of mentally ill offenders, not to mention their treatment. Rather certain crimes gain a lot of attention, such as violent crimes, especially homicides, where the o ffender is under-age, or the nature of the crime is particularly strange, disgusting, or cruel. In such cases the media and public discussion would carefully follow and present a lot of background material as well, but the point for the interest is not a particular interest in mentally ill offenders: the point is a parti cular interest in shocking crimes. In such cases, FPA of the offender(s) is often carried out. These have not systematically re sulted in the placement to care of the offender(s), rather it is my impression that a prison sentence has been the more common solution. Finnish research on homicide has characterised that in a typical Finnish homicide both the offender and the victim can be described as a socially ve ry unprivileged man, usually under the influence of alcohol. The victim is usually someone close to t he offender, like his peer; another typical victim is the offender's spouse. These incidents do not attrac t the special attention of the public or the media. The legislation on FPA and the involuntary ps ychiatric treatment of the mentally ill offenders has not been changed since the Mental Health Act went into effect (the minor changes that have been carried out have not influenced the basic stru cture or philosophy behind the processes), which also indicates that there have not been any powerful discussions that would have influenced the legislation or even the prac tices. By and large, discussions on criminal policy have focused on whether it is better to favour treatment and agreem ent (social care, mental health care, substance- use services; offering a second opportunity, agreeing) instead of, or at least within the penalty system, or whether Finland adopt a stricter line and give longer sent ences, higher penalty fees etc, and also emphasize full criminal responsibility whenever possible. One reflection of these discussions seems to be the fact that the propor tion of \"lessened criminal responsibility\" among those assessed in FPA has decreased. On the other hand, with regard to adolescents who commit crimes, treatment options w ill be increased in the future. Unlike the UK, for example, in Finland there has been no major public discussion of public safety and mental illness, or of public safety and mentally ill offenders. Public discussions and activities of interest groups focus instead on the mental health domain, on the support to carers, access to care, reimbursements for psychotherapies, etc. Both psychiatrists and jurists have criticized t he routine lesser sentence in cases of lessened criminal responsibility. Examinees concluded to possess a lessened criminal responsibility often suffer from personality disorders and substance dependence, and are especially likely to violently Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F inland 143 re-offend. That these offenders are released into the community after a shorter sentence than would otherwise follow after the crime in question seems illogical and irrelevant.

Each regulation, whether a law or a rule on a lower le vel, is based on a constant dividing line: the ques- tion of criminal responsibility, which is exclusivel y defined with regard to the ability of discernment and to control one's action. This criterion acts as a clear dichotomy. When a mentally disordered offender is considered (by expert-assessment wh ich might not obligatorily be followed by the judge) as being responsible for his act, his case is practically treated as if he was not mentally ill. The new CP from 1994 changed the definition of criminal responsibility. The present legislation comprises full criminal responsibility or total lack of criminal responsibility. Any partial or dimin- ished responsibility is not included into the concep t. However, the law defines more the lack of responsibility than the concept of responsibility it self. Article 122-1 of French Penal Code (CP) states: \"Any person experiencing m ental or neuro-psychia tric problem s abolishing his discernm ent or the control of his action during the tim e at which the incident took place is not responsible in the sense of penal justice. A person experiencing m ental or neuro-psychiatric problem s abolishing his discernm ent or the control of his action during t he time at which the incident took place which have altered his discernm ent or ham pered the control of his action rem ains punishable. However, the jurisdiction takes into account this ci rcum stance when determ ining the sentence and setting execution m odalities .\" (cited by the authors, due to unavailable official translation) The terms \"mental problems\" or \"neuro-psychiat ric problems\" are not defined, however, and the interpretation and evaluation are left to experts or judges as well. They are not related to any particular diagnosis. The second paragraph of article 122-1 of the CP, wh ich is very short, leaves open most of the crucial questions for holding trials against m entally ill offenders and puts the responsibility on judges and courts to cope with any specific case s. One could understand that this article is ex- pected to reduce sentences or open the way to adequate care measures under probation. But in reality, the evocation of Articl e 122-1, 2 of the CP leads to t he opposite, resulting in longer sen- tences. The concept of unfitness to plead is not specifically defined. T hus it happens that offenders show- ing clear symptoms of severe mental illness are tried and judged. Sometimes a trial is suspended \"sine die\" after assessment (which is not m andatory) ordered by the court on request of the de- fence or jurisdiction itself. The prosecution might not be withdrawn even w hen the mental state of the person concerned is disturbed for years. Additional assessments may be requested by the prosecutor supplementary to regular reviews of the detention order which are stipulated by the law. More than elsewhere in Europe or the western wo rld, new care strategies can be observed in France that risk relying on prison- placement instead of placement in public psychiatric hospitals to cope with behavioural problems of the persons concerned or to fulfil requirements of public safety. Public psychiatric hospitals in France operate today almost completely with open ward- policies to provide adequate care for consenti ng patients, whereas closed wards offering ade- quate and secure environments are lacking. Appropr iate wards or beds for long-stay detainees Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F rance 146 are scarce. Rather common are small cells for dangerous or agitated patients that are usually without access to secured yards So instead of being conducted in hospitals under temporary involuntary placement conditions, medical or psychiatric examinati ons of offenders suspected of bei ng mentally ill are regularly car- ried out in prison under provisional detention-regimes as a safety measure. Being a part of clinical files, the results of these pre liminary examinations very oft en determine conclusions on the men- tal state of the person concerned in terms of an expert-assessment prior to any judicial decision. Actually there is a general trend in France to s end even severe psychotic patents to trial. The conceptual or ideological background might be the idea that confrontation with the judicial system might have a therapeutic effect. In the year 2000, less than 2% of people having committed an offence eligible for prosecution were f ound irresponsible due to mental problems. When considering study results estimating 3% of the population at large and 7% among delin- quents as suffering from schizophrenia, it could be concluded that mentally ill offenders in France are not adequately recognised and most often are treated like non-disturbed persons. A Senates Commission officially stated that 0.47% mentally ill offenders were found to be non-responsible for their acts. However, this is the proporti on of cases seen by investigational judges (\"judge d'instruction\"), whereas many minor crimes are handled directly by a prosecutor or are returned to immediate hearing (\"comparution immediate\"). So the real figure might be higher, probably estimated at a maximum of 2%. Both the public and professionals often object to t he present legislation which allows for suspen- sion of prosecution under Article 122-1 of the CP, ignoring the interests of the victims and their families, as well as those of the community. Ho wever, in 1995 there was a change in legislation concerning the possibilities of appeal against a non- suit decision which can be brought before the \"chambre d'instruction\": On request of the vi ctim, a defendant may appear at the hearing of the court if he has the medical and mental capacity to attend. The experts have to be heard person- ally as well to affirm their evaluation (Article 199-1 of CPP). But \"chambres d'instruction\" do not have the power of a court trial, and all evidenc e or facts are not disputed as done at court. Recently a working group has been established to anal yse the issue of implementing special trial procedures for mentally ill offenders lacking criminal responsibility. Attendants should comprise victims for a better understanding the basis of court decisions resulting in on-suit verdicts. The recommendations of this working group have not led to any modification of the legislation. How- ever, many experts fear that respective changes would narrow the rights of persons concerned and that these would encourage proposals for implem enting registers for mentally ill offenders. Assessment At every stage of the judicial procedure an asse ssment of the mental st ate of the person con- cerned might be ordered (first by the prosecutor during the pre-trial period, then by the judge in charge of the investigation and finally by the j udge chairing the trial). Mandatory questions of the assessment focus on criminal responsibility, which means the defendant's ability of insight and his ability to control his action. Additional fields are at the discretion of the court and may include public safety and risk assessment. An assessment is mandatory in the case of major offences listed in the CP as crimes judged by the \"court d'assises\". But during the pre-trial investigation by the \"juge d'instruction\", an assess- ment can be conducted in order to prepare for the trial. An assessment of t he mental state of the defendant can be ordered for smaller offences, also on request of the defence or the victim of the offence. It is routine practice to assess the defendant if he holds a certain record, if he exhibits certain behaviour or if he has committed a serious or unus ual type of crime with minor benefit for the offender. The defence or the prosecuting parties can only request an assessment which always must be ordered by the court or the judge. The appointment of the expert is also at the discretion of the Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F rance 147 court or the judge. Each court of appeal maintain s a list of official experts pre-selected on the basis of complex or undefined criteria (e.g., reputat ion, titles, function). An expert who is not pre- selected may be admitted to court but must swear an oath for each particular case. Placement of Mentally Ill Offenders Most mentally ill offenders who are found to lack criminal responsibility receive forensic care. However, lack of criminal responsibility does not obligatorily lead to forensic care and the men- tally ill offender who is held not responsible fo r his act may benefit from a non-suit decision and can be acquitted without further consequences! If a mentally ill offender meets the criteria for the so -called \"hospitalisation d' office (H.O.), which is originally a civil detention regime whose major criterion is public threat, he will be placed under Article L3213-7 of CSP. However, this placement cannot be ordered directly by a judge. It has to be submitted for administrative decision, which is taken by the \"Prefet\", the authority of each re- gional \"department\" representing the government. The assessment itself may not be sufficient as usually the delay between the examination by an expert and the trial is too long, so that an additional more recent certificate is required, confirming that the criteria for involunt ary placement are still fulfilled. If a mentally ill offender is found not to be a public threat but to meet the criteria of the \"hospitali- sation \u00e0 la demande d'un tiers\"-regime (H.D.T.) which applies on the request of a third party in case of an obvious need for care and inability to c onsent, he will be placed under this rule. In this case a discharge will not require a mandatory assessment, instead the recommendation of the treating physician as part of the required monthl y report will be sufficient. This patient placed against his will has no peculiar obligation towards justice. This non-suit decision ends any right of disposal by the court, changing the legal status of a men- tally ill offender to that of a ci villy committed patient. The only difference refers to the modality of discharge. Here, the recommendations of two diffe rent experts resulting from two separate as- sessments are necessary (Article 3213-8 of CSP). If an offender has been found responsible for his ac t, regular penal procedures will apply. In case of deterioration of the mental st ate after the assessment and if, in this case, this altered state meets the conditions for placement, the person concerned will be admitted to a psychiatric hospi- tal under the conditions of the general mental health law. Only public hospitals enlisted and certi- fied are legally allowed to admit these patients. When a mentally ill offender is detained in prison, the provisions of a possible placement are regulated by Article D398 of the Code de Proc\u00e9dur e (CPP) which states that no detainee should be \"mentally deranged\" and maintained in prison. T herefore this person should be committed to a public psychiatric hospital under civil law until he eventually recovers. This article, which was not formulated very precisely and is therefore not easy to apply; unfortunately was restricted in 1998 by an amendment stating that a detainee must meet the criteria of Article L3213-1 of the CSP (Code de la Sant\u00e9 Publique, Mental Health Act of 1990) which supposes predictable dangerous- ness. Thus many mentally ill offenders who are really disordered and suffering but are not esti- mated as dangerous are left in prison without t he benefits of Article D398 and are not transferred to public psychiatric hospitals. Service Provision Currently available institutions in France do not provide any specif ic facilities for mentally ill of- fenders. There are four security units in psychi atric hospitals (\"unit\u00e9s pour malades difficiles\" UMD), which all together offer 400 rooms for male s or females) that are not considered to be forensic wards; they are simply supposed to pr ovide space for very dangerous or very difficult Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F rance 148 patients. Thus, most mentally ill offenders are put into prison when found responsible for their acts. Legal criteria are defined broadly enough to do so. Usually mentally ill offenders are admitted to so -called regional medico-psychological services which are implemented in 26 of the main prisons in France. However, these facilities are not sup- posed to care for detainees serving long-term sentences. Only one prison (Chateau-Thierry) is prepared for these specific clientel e. Thus, sentenced mentally ill o ffenders often stay for years in non-suitable wards even when suffering from severe mental problems affecting their personality or behaviour. Currently, the French Government is conducti ng an assessment regarding the possible imple- mentation of special units for prisoners with mental problems (e.g., chronic psychotic patients), who most often receive inadequate psychiatric care . A potential opening of such units might be in 2006. These units will be integrated in public psyc hiatric hospitals, but custody might probably be the responsibility of penitentiary administration. At the moment there is no special security staff available in psychiatric hospitals. Prisoners treated in general hospitals are in the custody of the police. Criminal Responsibility in Routine Practice As the term \"lack of criminal responsibility\" is not precisely defined by law, psychiatric experts are left alone without any guidelines on how to c onduct assessments and draw conclusions. In rou- tine practice, each expert applies his own criteria , often adopting those of the judge by whom he has been appointed. Overall, there are two different schools of thought or ideological pos itions prevailing. The one that might be dubbed \"latin\" is based on a dichotomy of psychiatric diagnosis and a determination of responsibility. One mentally ill offender mi ght be schizophrenic or paranoid and be considered criminally responsible, whereas a second person with the same diagnosis might very well be held non-responsible. This view assumes that psychiatri sts would be able to get specific clinical data (from interviews, medical or criminal files et c.) enabling them to conclude on or answer the ques- tion of the patient's discernment and ability to control his actions. Some psychiatrists are convinced that this exceeds the specific psychiatric domain and will dan- gerously extend to a moral concept of behaviour. The key question here is whether a psychiatrist should be allowed to declare a mentally ill offender competent to decide \"right from wrong\" and to apply this concept to confir ming criminal responsibility. Quite different from this view is the approach of experts who consider mentally ill offenders per se as being non-responsible for their acts when they are suffering from a severe mental disease (usually psychotic problems) and offence and pathology are linked. This view follows more or less the rules and practice of the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition. In this case, a diagnosis may be put against a defendant's intention to be sent to court to claim his responsibility. The evaluating ex- pert may consider this claim itself to be part of a delirious state. Compulsory Forensic Treatment At present, French law does not specify treatment modalities fo r mentally ill patients but only regulates conditions of involuntary placement. There is an ambiguity in the present legal regulat ions which reoccurs in daily practice: When a detained dangerous mentally ill patient, regardless of whether or not he is an offender, refuses medical treatment, there are no clear regulations that would allow physicians to impose this treatment, even in locked psychiatric wards. Patients' associations often claim that placem ent does not automatically imply treatment. Most psychiatrists, however, would se riously consider applying treatment against the will of a patient when a patient is detained under the Mental Heal th Law. This discrepancy clearly underlines the Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - F rance 149 lack of a clear legal regulation. Currently, coercive or forced treat ment already is a topic of debate in France, independent of the modalities of placement. Compulsory treatment in prison is not applied. In no case would a treatment applied beyond the medical domain be mandatory. There is a clear dichotomy between justice and medicine in this regard. So even if a mentally ill offender who has been sentenced with a complementary \"obliga- tion de soins\" (which is a very soft measure, w here the presumed patient is just supposed to pro- duce a certificate issued by any doctor confirmi ng his presence) is eventually detained for some- thing else, his obligation is denied during his prison stay. The only legal stipulations for mandatory forensic treatment that can be ordered by the judge are defined by the law of June 15th, 1998, which disposes that se xual offenders can be sentenced with an \"injunction\" of care (not treatment) under the control of a new kind of medical profession called \"coordonateur\". A coordonateur is neither an expert nor a therapist but an individual who will evaluate the effectiveness of care. This inj unction may be an alternative to a prison sentence or a complementary measure after the sentenc e has been served. However, it can not be im- posed against the patient's will. The person concer ned is able to refuse treatment and is able to opt for a supplemental prison sentence. The \"injunc tion of care\" does not concern the prison time, during which any treatment must always be applied with the detainee's consent. This consent is also a delicate issue since the re vision of the CPP in December 1998. As ruled by Article 362, it has been added that a detained pers on must not be treated without his consent \"except if he is not competent to consent\"! Thus, emergency treatment is legal in prison and probably even measures exceeding the actual st ate of emergency, underlining a rather sub- effectively regulated environment which might be appreciated by some players in the field and complained about by others. When the physician in charge of treatment also has to determine the patient's competence to consent, he is always at risk of either disclai ming all responsibility or of abusing his medical power. Most of the time, psychiatrists, who are al ways subject to criticism by the mass media or possible prosecution in case of spectacular cons equences of their decisions, choose to reject this responsibility and leave mentally ill offenders wi thout the needed care or medication. Frequently, this may result in behaviour problems on the part of the person concerned and subsequent disci- plinary or penal consequences. The question of appeal against a placement order or its duration is well defined in the French Mental Health Law. Different appeal procedures are possible, either through the court or a court- like body. However, there is no option to appeal agai nst placement in a psychiatric prison-ward. Thus, despite the fact that the inspection of psychi atric services in prisons is the responsibility of the health administration and not of t he penitentiary administration, it is rather difficult for psychia- trists to act on behalf of the well-being of incarc erated patients with equal respect for their rights and their informed consent.

This means that only a person who was aware of the unlawfulness of his actions at the time and who was free to decide not to commit the offence can be blamed for his actions. This aw areness and the freedom of decision are considered as preconditions for guilt in the actions. Only when the offender can be regarded as \"responsible\" for his actions can a punishment appropriate to t he individual guilt for the offence be imposed. For this reason, the law provides for restrictions of the responsibility for juvenile (aged between 14 and 18 years) and for adolescent (aged between 18 and 21 y ears) persons that are oriented to the ab- sence or partial presence of the ability to recogni se the unlawfulness of the actions. Children under fourteem years of age can not be punished under cr iminal law for offences which they commit. A decrease in or a loss of responsibility can also result from mental disease: If, at the time of the offence, the offender was unable to recognise t he wrongfulness of his action or was unable to act in accordance with this understanding as a result of such an illness or disturbance, then he cannot be regarded as guilty of his action in this specific legal sense. As a result, it is not possible to im- pose a punishment - the offender will be acquitted of guilt. Particularly when the offender has already commi tted offences in the past, the acquittal without punishment of offenders with an absence of respons ibility comes into conflict with the demands of society for effective protection of t he legal state. Thus it was more considerations of criminal policy that led to the so-called \"two-t rack\" criminal law system which is applied today in Germany. This means: Temporally limited detention sentences are imposed upon offenders who were conscious of their responsibility, and temporally unlimit ed detention upon offenders who were unconscious of their responsibility but who represent a potential source of danger. On the one hand, this system opens up the possibility of an offender-oriented tr eatment and improvement instead of an offence- oriented punishment, whilst at the same time ensur ing the protection of society from further of- fences. The start of this two-track system dates back to the \"Prussian General Law\" of 1794 (Blau, 1984); it was taken up by the legislators in almost all t he European nations at the beginning of the last cen- tury. This system was incorporated into German cr iminal law with the passing of the \"Act against Dangerous Habitual Offenders\" in 1933 which, before being perverted under National Socialism, permitted for the first time that mentally ill and addicted offenders be committed to psychiatric insti- tutions (concerning these consider ations see: Aschaffenburg, 1912). The objective of compulsory commitment to a psyc hiatric hospital is not to punish the offender but to allow him to be treated and to enable an improvement in his condition to take place, whilst at the same time protecting society. In the German Penal Code the regulations on the placement and treatment of mentally ill or distur bed offenders in a psychiatric hospita l, respectively in a detoxifica- tion centre, are subsumed under the section \"Meas ures on Improvement and Safety\". \u00a7 63 StGB provides for the temporally unlimited commitment to a psychiatric hospital. In accordance with \u00a7 64 Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Ger many 153 StGB, addicted offenders can be committed to a detox ification centre for a period of up to two years. These compulsory measures are primarily indi vidual preventive measures and not criminal pun- ishments. They relate to the future potential danger of the offender; they are not linked to an of- fence in the past. In order to clarify it by the example of \u00a7 63 StGB: A precondition for imposing this measure is that the offender at the time of the offence was suffering from a pathological mental disorder, a profound disturbance in consciousness, a mental deficiency or some other serious mental aberration\" that prevented him from recogni sing the unlawfulness of his actions or from acting in accordance with this understanding. Thes e entrance criteria of a missing or decreased criminal liability are designated in \u00a7\u00a7 20 and 21 StGB. At the same time, it must be foreseeable that the offender will commit further substantial illegal acts due to this illness or disturbance. This means a prognosis according to which further acts are not only to be expected as possible, but also as justified. The admittance in accordance with \u00a7 63 StGB take s place without a given duration. The reason for the admittance is the danger of the pat ient; it is at the same time t he criterion for the continuation of the accommodation. Accordingly, it is the goal of the treatment to cure the patient of his disorder or to improve his condition such that he is no longer dangerous (\u00a7 136 of the Ex ecution of Sentences Law - StVollzG). A similar regulation exists for the admittance of addicted persons (\u00a7 137 StVollzG). This purpose of the compulsory meas ures was underlined in the course of the 2nd Pe- nal Reform in 1975, when the earlier formulati on Measures on Safety and Improvement\", was altered to Measures on Improvement and Safety\" After the penal reform in 1975, the time frame of the accommodation also was redefined. Up to then the legal default was: \"Placem ent continues for as long as it is required by its purpose\". Now \u00a7 67d section 2 StGB determines: \"If no maximum peri od is provided or if a provided period has not yet expired, then the court suspends the further execution of the measure on probation as soon as it can be answered for to test whether or not the accommodated person will commit more illegal acts outside of the measure of execution\". Also, due to a misleading perception of this formulation by the public, a new formulation was defined within a change of law in the year 1998: ...the court suspends the further execution of the measure ... if it is to be expect ed that the accommodated person will commit no more illegal acts out side of the measure of execution\" While the arrangement of the measures, just like t heir completion, is essentially regulated by Fed- eral Law, their implementation depends on state laws (\u00a7 138 Section 1 StVollzG). Appropriate state laws, which put into concrete terms the legal ar ea unsettled until then, were adopted relatively late, however, starting in the late seventies. Some of the German Federal States integrated the legisla- tion concerning the placement and tr eatment of mentally ill offenders into the general laws for men- tally ill persons (e.g., Schleswi g-Holstein, Bavaria, Baden-Wuer ttemberg), while other Federal States adopted their own laws on the measure of execution (among others Lower Saxony, Hessia, North Rhine-Westphalia). During the last 20 years, the di scussion on the goals of the measures was particularly character- ized by three developments: 1. the development of new legislation in the East German states of the Federal Republic after reunification, 2. the further arrangement and adjustment of existing measure of execution laws to the scien- tific level of knowledge (in particular by consi deration of the requirements of qualified after- care for dismissed patients) and 3. a more restrictive handling and/ or tightening up of the legislat ion for the placement of of- fenders who have committed violent crimes and sex ual offences - this caused in particular by those offenders, who committed renewed crim inal offences after the completion of a term of imprisonment or a measure. In parti cular, a new regulation must be mentioned here that was newly introduced in the year 2002, according to which a psychiatric appraisal must be carried out before a release from the fo rensic psychiatric hospital can take place (\u00a7 454 Abs. 2 StPO). Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Ger many 154 Pre-trial Procedures During the preliminary investigation in particular, two regulations of procedural law are used: If there are urgent reasons for the presumption that the offender acted in a condition of missing or diminished criminal liability and that the admission to a psychiatric hospital or to a detoxification centre will be arranged, then the court can arrange a provisional accommodation in such an institu- tion. A condition is that such a provisional accomm odation is required for reasons of public security (\u00a7 126a StPO). For the preparation of an expert a ssessment of the mental state of an accused individual the court can arrange that the accus ed be brought into a public psychiatric hospital and observed there. A condition is that the accused person is urgently suspicious and the arrangement does not stand except in relationship to the puni shment or measure which can be expected (\u00a7 81 StPO). In all cases in which an accommodation in a psychiatric hospital, in a detoxification centre or a preventive detention in a prison is to be expec ted, an expert must be heard at trial. He has to give information about the mental condition of the accused and about the prospects of treatment (\u00a7\u00a7 246a, 415 Abs. 5 StPO). The assessment will be carried out by an expert a ssigned by the court, usually during the provi- sional accommodation in the psychiatric hospital. In such cases in which there is no direct danger to public safety and no further reasons exist agai nst the whereabouts of the accused at liberty, an ambulatory assessment is possible. The dut y of the experts includes three steps: 1. the assessment of whether the prerequisite s of a missing or decreased responsibility as specified by the law have been present, 2. the assessment of whether the offender for the reasons mentioned was unable to recog- nise the unlawfulness of his action or to act in accordance with his insight (absence of re- sponsibility in accordance with \u00a7 20 StGB) and/ or whether his ability was substantially de- creased (decreased responsibility in accordance with \u00a7 21 StGB), and 3. the prognosis of whether further substantial cr iminal offences are to be expected due to the illness or disturbance. Trial Procedures The expert has to report the results of the assessment during trial. If the court comes to the conclu- sion that the offender was acting in a state of an absence of or in a state of decreased responsibil- ity due to a mental illness or mental disorder or due to an addiction, and that further substantial criminal offences are to be expected due to this condition, then the prerequisites are there for a court order in accordance with \u00a7 63 or 64 StGB. In the case of an absence of responsibility, the offender is acquitted of the charge and his admission to a hospital is arranged at the same time. In the case of a decreased responsibility, the court can sentence the person to additional imprison- ment, which is to be executed after the measure. Practice In Germany, special accredited psychiatric hospitals (special forensic hospita ls) or the psychiatric departments of general hospitals are usually designat ed for the involuntary placement or treatment of mentally ill patients. Hospital services for mentally disorder ed offenders exist across a range of levels of security. At the maximum security end of the spectrum, there are high-security standard hospitals (e.g., Westphalian Centre for Forensic Psyc hiatry at Lippstadt or the Bavarian Centre for Forensic Psychiatry at Straubing). In a few ca ses, patients also might be admitted to nursing homes and rehabilitation centres. Involuntarily pl aced patients are not usually separated from vol- untary patients. Whether or not common ward s are open or closed depends on various local cir- cumstances (with the excepti on of high-security standard hospitals; see above). Although both options are possible in principle, an open-ward po licy is preferred in some regions of Germany, indicating a rather liberal philosophy in routine care. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Ger many 155 Special hospitals take the most serious offender s (including a small number of women) who are considered to be a grave and immediate risk to the public, and rely on a high degree of both pe- rimeter and internal security. The nursing staff are not only trained in control and restraint tech- niques, but also know how to deal with dangerous untoward incidents such as hostage-taking. The special hospitals have increasingly begun to offer treatment focussed on particular problems (e.g., long-stay-departments, departments for psychopathic patients) and there are expanding forensic psychotherapy departments also with academic and clinic al interests. Most of the hospitals also have excellent workshops, training and education fac ilities. In the past, conditions in the special hospitals, and the treatment provided to their pati ents, were heavily criticized. But much was under- taken in the late 1990s to improve outmoded practi ces such as the over-use of seclusion and to reduce professional isolation. Although many regions in the Federal Republic of Germany provide good standards of community- based mental health care, there is statutory stipulat ion of the least restrictive settings for involun- tary regimes as well; State Acts do not menti on any option of compulso ry outpatient treatment. However, most of the State commitment laws s uggest aftercare following involuntary inpatient epi- sode, and the role of the social ps ychiatric services is emphasised in this process. In some Federal States patients are referred autom atically to community services upon discharge from involuntary inpatient stays. Moreover, four State commitment laws stipulate a referral without the patient's con- sent, even when the involuntary status does not pr evail after discharge. Commitment laws in fifteen Federal States explicitly permit the interrupti on of involuntary episodes for defined periods and certain purposes, including vacation. Some forensic intensive care units are situated within district general hospital psychiatry units. They are designed to manage patients with cha llenging behaviour\", who may or may not have a criminal history or be facing current charges. Thes e smaller, low-security units are not ideal for patients who require a long stay as they often lack large day areas on the grounds in which the patients can be taken out on parole. On the other hand, they are likel y to be nearer to the homes of partners and family, thus making visiting, and if indicated, joint work, more practicable. At maximum and medium levels of security, and frequently on intensive care units, patients are managed by a multi-disciplinary ward team with spec ial forensic expertise. Forensic psychiatrists and psychotherapists work alongside with forensic ally trained nursing staff, social workers and occupational therapists. The approach to assessm ent and treatment is, and has to be, eclectic, since for many patients, both biological and psyc hological problems are aetiologically significant. Most are treated with a combination of medica tion, cognitive-behavioural techniques, and group or individual interpretive work, in which at least one of these professionals usually has a special train- ing and interest. Often overlooked, but equally import ant, is the milieu therapy\" that is offered by forensic in-patient facilities. This term refers to the beneficial effects of an environment that empha- sises containment, structure, in volvement and a practical orientat ion to individuals whose lives have hitherto been chaotic and unpredictable. Patients Rights From a legal as well as a procedural point of vi ew, patients' rights in Germany are safeguarded in many ways. Continuous reforms of the mental health acts have increasingly emphasised basic human and legal rights. The basic distinction between involuntary pl acement and treatment, requiring the patient's consent for most therapeutic interventions, strengthens the autonomy of the persons con- cerned, although this might limit their chances for adequate treatment. The independent decision by a court or a judge guarantees compliance with the most basic democratic principles during all stages of the procedure. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Ger many 156 levant data. Patients have the right to appeal to courts at any stage of the proc edure. Patients have to be heard. Patients' advocates are approved during all stages. Control commissions supervise quality standards at various levels (procedures, facilities, treatments etc.). Coercive measures have to be strictly recorded. Epidemiology In the Federal Republic of Germany no conti nuous nationwide collecti on and evaluation of data concerning the accommodation and treatment of m entally ill or addicted offenders takes place. Only as a part of the general crime statistics are some data available on the type and frequency of the placements in forensic psychi atric institutions. However, thes e data are limited to the old West German states (since 1996 including East Berlin) and they are limited to a few selected characteristics, representing an absolute mini mum. There is no information about diseases, duration of accommodation or other epidemiologically re Tab. 50 Number of Criminally Non-responsib le Mentally Ill Offenders in Custody in Germany (data excludes East German F ederal Stat es in the former German Democratic Republic, w here information is not registered. Da ta source: National Statistical Office, Wies- baden) Year (Census Data, March 31) in forensic hospitals (\u00a7 63 StGB) in detoxification centres (\u00a7 1,127 3,600 The available surveys show a clear increase in t he admissions to a psychiatric hospital and/or to a detoxification centre since beginning of the '80s. Therefore, the number of approximately 3,600 patients accommodated in a forensic psychiatric institution in the year 1991 had increased almost continuously to approximately 7,400 in 2003. The increase in the accommodations concerns both the mentally ill or disturbed offenders in accor- dance with \u00a7 63 StGB, as well as addicted offender s in accordance with \u00a7 64 StGB. Within the group of addicted offenders, however, certain differ ences exist: While the number of the accommo- dated alcoholics is constant at a relatively high level (in the means of the last ten years approx. 850 per year), the number of drug-dependent offenders has clearly increased, and since the year 2001 has continued to exceed the number of al cohol-dependent offenders (von der Haar 2003). The majority of the available dat a originate, however, from the fe w nationwide research projects (e.g., Leygraf, 1988; Dessecker, 1997), and are limited to the situation within individual States of the Federal Republic (e.g., Seifert & Leygraf, 1997) or they were collected as stock-takings with regard to specific questions due to inquiries from politicians (Federal State Parliament North- Rhine/Westphalia, 2000). Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Ger many 157 Only recently have some initiatives by individual professional associations and forensic hospitals systematically extended the state of knowledge about general developments of the measure of execution and also about epidemiological questions. Wo rthy of particular mention is the working group Forensic Psychiatry\", a subgroup of the Federal Conference of Medical Superintendents\". In the year 1994, this group initiated the first nationwide annual survey of addicted offenders ac- cording to \u00a7 64 StGB.1 A comparable survey of mentally ill or disturbed offenders accordance with \u00a7 63 StGB has been carried out since 20002. Public Opinion and Mass Media The psychiatrist as an expert witness in court and at important trials is always a focus of great me- dia and public interest. Such trials offer a good chanc e to have a look at forensic psychiatry. But this is also the chance ( and a risk) for forensic psychiatrists to inform the public about their work, about the treatment and about the ther apeutic limitations. Activities of interest groups (such as the DGPPN in Germany) may help to focus the public interests on the objectives of the field of forensic psychiatry. Some \"key-cases\" and the subsequent reaction from the public may have conse- quences for care and legislation! For this reason, some forensic hospital departments in Germany initiated a \"pro-active media-work\" effort to info rm the citizens, the public and also the political au- thorities about the needs and aims of the work of forensic hospitals.

Some of those opinions, such as that of guilty intoxication, have remained immutable until the present day. In Greek penal law, the notion of incom petence was reported for the first time in article 86 of P.L. of 1870, where a person was considered \"incompetent\" who suffered from fury, complete or partial lunacy, or from any damage to the brain, or mental illness, the free use of logic totally excluded (Striggaris, 1947). Currently, there is no special mental health care ac t in Greece for mentally ill offenders but some of the articles in the general penal legislation cover the relevant issues. Articles with regard to mentally ill offenders are included in the penal la w (penal code p.c.) and the procedural law that has remained in force with minor additions sinc e 1950. To our knowledge, there are no plans for any reformation of the laws and regulations, alt hough the small numbers of psychiatrists in Greece who practice forensic psychiatry are pressing the government to draw up a special act for mentally ill offenders. The basic philosophy of the existi ng law emphasises aspects of human rights as well as public safety is sues. The committee of N.D. 1947 worked out the penal law, which in 1950 became the law of state, Law 1492/17-8-1950 of \"Ratification of Penal Code\". The p.c. of 1950, even if it remains immutable, is compiled in the Greek common language (demotike) by the committee of article 36 \u00a71 of L. 1406/83 and has been in effect since 1985, accordi ng to the presidential decree 283/Official Journal of the Hellenic Republic 106, copy first, 31st May 1985. The laws 1160 of 1972 and 410 of 1976 revised some of the articles of the procedural law of 1950 (Dragatsis, 1997). The major articles of the penal and procedural laws, as we ll as the general philosophy behind the criminal legislation are described briefly in the following: Wi th regard to the penal character of the criminal actions, the p.c. foresees immunity for criminal actions by deaf-mutes and by individuals who have disturbed intellectual functions or conscience. Article 33: \u00a71. The action that took place by a deaf-m ute is not ascribed, if he is judged as not having the required intellectual ability to conceive of his action as unfair or to act according to his perception of this unfair deed. \u00a72. If it is not a case of application of the previous paragraph, the deaf-m ute is punished with a decreased sentence. Article 34: The action is not ascribed to the perpetrator if, when he com mitted it, due to m orbid perturbation of intellectual functions or perturbation of conscience, he did not have the ability to conceive of his action as unfair or to act according to his perception of the unfair deed. Limitations of these general principles that c oncern criminals with a circumstantial mental disturbance are described in the subsequent articles . Also determined is the place of detention of perpetrators that belong in these categories: Article 35.: \u00a71. An act that som eone has decided upon in a normal mental situation, but which to perform it has brought him self into a situation of disturbed conscience, is ascribed to him as if it took place with deceit. \u00a72. If the action that took place in such a situation is other than the one that had been decided, the guilty person is punished by a decreased sentence. \u00a73. An act that the guilty (person) foresaw or could foresee that it would probably take place, if it results from a situation of perturbation of con science; is ascribed to him as an action that has taken place by negligence . Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Gree ce 161 Article 36: \u00a71. If, due to the m ental situations that are r eported in article 34, (the person) was not completely incom petent, however, the com petence to be charged, that is required by this article, was decreased considerably, the sentence im posed is decreased. \u00a72. The provision of the previous paragraph does not apply in the case of guilty intoxication (A. 35). Article 37: When the situation of the individuals is that provided for by article 36, of a dim inished crim inal responsibility for being charged and im poses particular treatm ent or concern, the sentences that are imposed are executed in forensic psychiatric fa cilities or departm ents of prisons. Article 38 : \u00a71. If the person who, according to articl e 36, has dim inished crim inal responsibility due to perturbation of intellectual functions or a ccording to article 32 \u00a72 is a deaf-m ute dangerous to public safety and the action that took place is a felony or delinquency for which the law threatens a sentence longer than six m onths, the court condem ns him to detention in forensic psychiatric facilities or departm ents of prisons in accordance with article 37 \u00a72. In the decision, only the minimal limit of the duration of detention is det ermined, which can not exceed m ore than half the maximum according to the article 36 \u00a7 1 lim it of the sentence for the ac tion that has taken place. Article 39: \u00a71. After supplem entation of the m inimal limit that the decision fixed according to article 38 \u00a72, the case is exam ined every two years, either upon application by the detainee or upon ex officio appointm ent, to determ ine whether the per son can be released. The m agistrate' s court (plim elliodikio) in the region in which the sentenc e is executed decides the case after consultation of special experts. \u00a7 2. The discharge is always granted under the term that it can be recalled according to the term s fixed inn article 107 (retraction of discharge when the person does not comply with any detention m easures) \u00b7The discharge becom es final, if in five years it is not recalled according to the provisions of article 109 (consequences of non-retraction of sentence). \u00a73. In any case, after supplem entation of the m inimal limit that fixed the decisi on, the detention cannot continue beyond ten years for delinquencies or beyond fifteen years for felonies. Article 40: The court that is foreseen by the previous article can at any tim e, on application by the public prosecutor and afterwards in the consultation of special ex perts, decide the replacem ent of detention, with a sentence of im prisonm ent or imprisonm ent that was determ ined according to \u00a73 article 38, if it judges that the detention of the convicted person in forensic psychiatric facilities or departm ents of prisons is not necessary. In this ca se, the time that was spent in the forensic psychiatric facilities or departm ents of prisons is deducted from the sentence that has been imposed. Article 41: \u00a71. If the person who was condem ned according to article 38 to detention in forensic psychiatric facilities is judged according to articl es 90 and 91 as a recidivist crim inal, the m inimal limit of the duration of detention is determ ined in the lim its of the sentence according to article 89 (sentence after recidivism ). If the law on the acti on that was taken place foresees the death or lifelong im prisonm ent, lifelong im prisonm ent is imposed. \u00a72. The court can change at any tim e the terms according to the previous article of the detention order in the sentence of vague imprisonm ent foreseen according to the articles 90 and 92. Completing the relative legislation with regard to the penal code for the placement mentally ill offenders we shall refer to two other articles r egarding the guardianship of \"insane\" criminals. Article 69: If som eone due to m orbid perturbation of intelle ctual functions (article 34) or by reason of being a deaf-m ute (article 33 \u00a7 1), is acquitted from the sentence or the prosecution for felony or delinquency, for which the law threatens a sentence of more than six m onths, the court orders his guardianship in a public therapeutic facility, provi ded that it judges that he is dangerous to public safety. And Article 70: \u00a72. The guardianship is continued as long as (the person) im poses a danger to public safety. \u00a7 3. Every three years the m agistrate' s cour t in the region in which the guardianship is executed decides if guardianship should cont inue. The sam e court can, however, whenever upon application by the public prosecutor, or addre ss of the authority of the therapeutic facility, order the discharge of the incom petent crim inal. Procedures In usual practice, when an individual for whom ther e is sufficient evidence that he/she suffers from mental illness, is arrested and after the police subm it him/her to the preliminary investigation, he/she is referred to regular interrogation. During this phase the interrogator can, at his judgment, Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Gree ce 162 order a psychiatric assessment. The defendant can also request an expert report. This is the pre- trial process. The jury can also order a psyc hiatric assessment at any time, even during the hearing. For the expert report, the defendant is usually detained in the forensic hospital of Korydallos or in a general psychiatric hospital. Since in the psychiat ric hospital of Korydallos, there are approximately 200 beds available, the detention of a suspected mentally ill offender in a common prison is not rare. Sometimes, when there is an urgent need fo r treatment that the forensic setting cannot provide, the detainee is transferred to either a psychiatric or a general hospital of the NHS (L. 2289/1995 article 10 \u00a79). During detention at any of the above settings, the alleged offender can be under psychiatric treatment according to the instru ctions of a psychiatrist appointed at the setting. Thus the defendant can be on psychotropic medication, which often modifies the clinical picture, further complicating the assessment by the experts. During the exam ination process it is possible to grant psychological tests although the relevant l egislation does not foresee this practice. Hence, the use of psychological tests is limited to cert ain tes ts, (e.g., MMPI, MMSE, WAIS). Other more specific tests are held by no means. We suggest t hat the main reasons for not using a wide range of psychological tests is that the ju ries are generally reluctant to take into account the results of the tests. And in any case, very few psychologists are trained to administer and evaluate tests more sophisticated than the ones mentioned above. After the court's decision, the offender who has fu ll criminal responsibility is incarcerated in one of the prisons in Greece. If there is a need for ps ychiatric treatment, this is provided by the psychiatrist at the prison. If there is a need for further treatment that cannot be provided in the prison, the prisoner is transported to a psychiatric hospital. In t he event that the decision of the court is that of lack of criminal responsibilit y and the person is a danger to the public, the court orders his/hers guardianship in a public hospital. The guardianship is re-evaluated every three years (Art. 69, 70, p.c.). If t he criminal responsibility of the offender is limited and he/she is dangerous to the public, the offender is detained in either a forensic hospital (namely the psychiatric hospital of Korydallos) or in a pris on (Art. 38 \u00a71, \u00a72). This option is applicable, in practice, only to male offenders, since t here is no forensic hospital for women. Practice The assessment is held by at least two psychiatrist s who are appointed from a list of experts that is designated by the court of first instance of each r egion. This list is compiled every year after the application of interested experts and is ratified by the council magistrate's court. In order for an expert to be included on this list, it is enough to be a qualified psychiatrist wit hout a criminal record. No other qualifications are required. With r egard to the educational background, up until a few years ago psychiatrists in Greece di d not receive any special training in forensic psychiatry during their specialisation. Within the last decade three mont hs' practice in forensic psychiatry is foreseen for the trainees. Hence, there is a significant va riation in both the cont ent and the quality of the expert reports provided. Concerning the expert diagnoses, confusion often exists due to the terminology. For example, the te rm \"psychotic syndrome\" is oft en used indiscreetly for individuals suffering from schizophrenia, mood disorders, delusional disorders, etc. The use of the terminology and the criteria of either ICD- 10, or DSM-IV is not mandatory and they are rarely used in the reports. The report is always written and in most of the cases, the physical presenc e of the expert in the court during the hearing process is ordered. The court judges the expert report freely, and is not obliged to follow the conclusions of the experts. Since the authorities of the penal system (judges, public prosecutors, interrogators) lack essential training with regard to the subject of mental health, very often the danger of misinterpr etations is exceptionally high. In Greece there is only one forensic psychiatric hos pital for male offenders, which is located near the Korydallos prison in Athens and has a capacit y of roughly 200 beds. Some of the mentally disordered male offenders are treated in six of the public psychiatric hospitals in various areas of Greece (Madianos, 2002), but a significant number of mentally ill offenders remain in prisons without any special or adequate care. Nonetheless, neither the psychiatric nor the general hospital Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Gree ce 163 of Korydallos fulfils the standards to meet the therapeutic needs of the in carcerated population. For example, the psychiatric hospita l of Korydallos is not in a position to administer psychiatric treatments such as ECT. In such cases, the mentally ill offenders must be transferred to another hospital for a period of time. Since there are no forensic psychiatric facilities for females, women suffering from mental illness are treated either in the female prison of Korydallo s or in psychiatric hospitals of the NHS. As a result, those conditions lead to a high representation of mental illness in the correctional settings of Greece as opposed to rates in prisons in the other EU member states (Alevizopoulos et al., 1998). It is obvious that the degree of the relati onship between the penal sy stem and the NHS is occasional and rather the result of direct needs for treatment of mentally ill offenders in cases where the provision of treatment is impossible in the existing forensic settings. This vague relation poses a number of difficulties in the treatment of psychiatric populations within the penal system. For example, the treatments that are provided in the general psychiatric hospitals do not focus on delinquent behaviour. Also the therapi sts who provide services in t he psychiatric settings of the NHS are reluctant to treat such populations, who do not constitute part of their professional choice but are occasional clients. Furt hermore, they have not received any special training concerning the specific treatment of such patients. The relative ly small number of health care providers at the psychiatric hospital of Korydallos, the lack of liais on with research centres, academic institutions and rehabilitation services limits t he range of the treatment to mere ly psychotropic medications and the management of procedural issues. Recently, there has been an important movement to incorporate the forensic settings in Greece, namely the general hospital and the psychiatric hospi tal of Korydallos, into the National Health System. Nevertheless, for the time being this remains a plan. The only improvement in this situation has been the establishment, in 2002, of a special care forensic unit for approximately 200 drug addicts, in the area of Eleon near Athens. As it is clear from the precedents, the Greek legislation presents import ant advantages with regard to the guarantee of public safety. The placement of mentally ill offenders in the forensic settings of the penal system, as well as in the psychiatric hospi tals of Greece serves this aim. On the other hand, however, the services provided do not focu s on the particular needs of such a special population. There is no legislated pre-trial process, if, for example, an individual is incompetent to stand trial. There are no explicit guidelines with respect to the diagnoses of mental illnesses that are related to the charge, and there is no const ant framework for the ev aluation of mentally ill offenders. In practice, the time intervals betw een the arrest until the ev aluation and the trial are often extremely long, sometimes lasting up to many months, time intervals that serve anything but the needs for placement and treatment of mentally ill offenders. The absence of a developed subspecialty of forensic psychiatry in Greece, the limited training and the lack of explicit standards for t he professionals in mental health in respect to forensic issues, as well as the limited resources do not allow the benefit of satisfactory prov ision of services for mentally ill offenders. At the same time, the interest in forensic psychiatry , psychology, social work, nursing, etc on the part of professi onals in the field of mental health is limited in the correctional settings and absent in the psychiatric hospitals of the NHS. Thus in many cases, the phenomenon is observed that mentally disor dered offenders can be inpatients for years in psychiatric structures without receiving any kind of tr eatment focused on the particular offensive behaviour. For example, there are no services or programs for sex offender s or other special offences. The only therapeutic programs available in the prisons in Greece are t hose for drug addicts. As a result, the evaluation of recidivism, the maintenance of factors that led to offensiv e behaviour, the assessment of the existence of other potential vict ims and so on is obscure, and the tendency is to detain mentally ill offenders for longer periods of time. Beyond the above, the absence of a psychiatric network of co mmunity-oriented mental health services dramatically increases the danger of losi ng track of mentally ill offenders after discharge, particularly in cases where a supporting familial environment is absent. Overall, the system is far from being modern and rational. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Gree ce 164 Patients' Rights The patients' rights during the entire proc edure are guaranteed by both the penal code and the code of criminal procedure. Furthermore, the general legislation for prisoners covers certain issues with respect to the rights of any per son in detention (L. 1851/1989, 2289/1995). In practice, the problem is not the legislation, but the resources available. There is a characteristic shortage of adequate facilities in Greece. As has been reported previously, are no forensic psychiatric beds are available for women and there is a much greater need for forensic psychiatric beds among the mentally disordered male offenders than those that the psychiatric hospital of Korydallos can provide. The lack of adequate forensic care provision results in the inadequate placement and treatment of many mentally ill offenders. Epidemiology The epidemiological data are the weakest point in the entire system. Only a small part of the available information is collected and reported. The records of the National Service of Statistics contain only general information and the most rec ent update is the one of 1996. The data indicate a general decline in crime between the years 1990 to 1996, from 109,190 to 86,892 convicted persons, respectively. An intere sting finding is that the number convicted male offenders sentenced to life imprisonment and detained in the psychiatric hospital of Korydallos increased from twelve in 1990 to 40 in 1996, respectively. The relevant research is minimal, and to our k nowledge there is only one st udy by Alevizopoulos et al. (in press) concerning the incidence of mental illness in Korydallos prison. According to our results, 15.96% suffered from a mental disorder: 2.63% of the population of the convicted prisoners suffered from schizophrenia, 4.44% from major depre ssive disorder, 1.01% from bipolar 1.41% had dual diagnosis; 29.26% were incarc erated for drug related crimes, 10.64% for homicide and only 0.8% for sexual offences. Public Opinion and Mass Media Unfortunately, in Greece there is still a great deal of stigmatisation of mentally ill offenders. The mass media play an important in manipulating the fear and the concern of the public. The legislation in Greece forbids the presence of medi a in court during the hearing in order to protect the defendant. Nevertheless, the trials of mentally disordered offenders are attractive subjects, particularly for television. Most of the relevant cases are covered without sensitivity, generating feelings of fear and insecurity, mainly with regard to the danger of recidivism among mentally ill offenders (Alevizopoulos, 2003). Finally, there ar e no NGOs for mentally disordered offenders other than the interest groups for prisoners and mentally ill persons. Pub lic donations, the Greek Orthodox Church and the private sect or support financially these groups. Acknow ledgments The authors express their acknowledgments to M.

Prisons and bridewells were the recipients of many mentally ill per- sons, the majority of them guilty of minor offences such as thieving, vagrancy, etc. Since there we- re no public institutions for the mentally ill, whet her criminally so or not the prison system became the usual repository for such persons and prisons were plentifully disposed around the major towns at that time. With the setting up of an Inspecto rate-General of Prisons in 1773 some measure of surveillance of prison conditions and the acknowledgem ent of the civil rights of their occupants ca- me into being. With the passage of the Act of Union in 1800, Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ceased to have an independent par liament until 1922. The country of Ireland was administered by a Lord Lieutenant and his administration on behalf of, and subject to, the Westminster Parliament in London. Accordingly, mental health legislation, although applying exclu- sively to Ireland, was very heavily influenced in ph ilosophy and in practical application by the stat- utes elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Legislation of 1812, 1821, 1846 and 1875 set out the provisions to be put in place for the care of pauper lunatics and the setting up and regulation of private madhouses. In these early years the compulsory admission and detention of lunatics in district lunatic as ylums was a function of the lo- cal judicial authority. The quality of care provided in the institutions was subject to the regulatory and statutory role of the Inspectorate of Lunacy, an office established in 1846 as a breakaway from the Prison Inspectorate which in 1826 had been giv en statutory powers \"to visit and inspect all madhouses and places where idiots or lunatics are confined, whether the same shall be any public establishment or kept for profit by any private individual, as well as all Gaols and Prisons throug- hout Ireland.\" In 1838 a statute to \"make more effectual Provisi on for the Prevention of Offences by insane per- sons in Ireland\" was enacted, which made it lawful for two Justices of the Peace to commit to gaol persons identified as dangerous lunatics or dangerous idiots. Significantly, in 1845, Parliament le- gislated for \"The Establishment of a Central Asyl um for Insane Persons charged with Offences in Ireland\", and on its erection, the transfer of all Cr iminal Lunatics held in detention in all gaols or district asylums. This asylum became known as the Central Mental Hospital in later years. In the 2nd half of the 20th century its administration became vest ed in the Eastern Health Board and sub- sequently the East Coast Area Health Board. It rema ins the only secure forensic psychiatric facility in the country. The Lunacy Act of 1875 made further provision for t he admission to and care of mentally ill persons in an extended network of asylums. With the foundation of a separat e Irish Free State in 1921, Bri- tish administration in the southern 26 counties of Ireland ceased, and the mental hospital system, as it had now become, was administered by the Irish Government from Dublin. Nonetheless, the provisions of the 1875 Act continued to operate until the putting in place of the Mental Treatment, 1945. This new legislation while still influenced by the 1875 Act, was innovative in a number of ways, not least in establishing a category of voluntary admission, which hitherto fore, had been exclusively compulsory. A Mental Health Act, 1981 was signed into law, but was found to be inope- rable and never came into operation. In 2001 a Ment al Health Act was signed into law by the Pre- Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 168 sident, but at the time of writing (August 2003) has not yet become operative. Accordingly, the pro- visions of the 1945 Act still operate. Criminal Law Insanity Legislation Since 1843 the test for insanity as a defence in a criminal prosecution stems from the Mc Naughten Rules which had applied throughout the United Kingdom where they were formulated. For a suc- cessful defence to be established on grounds of ins anity they required that the accused person must have suffered, at the time of the act, from a defect of reason due to disease of the mind, such that he or she, did not know what he or she was doing, or did not know that what he or she was doing was wrong. These rules were accepted as the general test for insanity in Irish law despite doubts being expressed that they represented a comprehensive statem ent of Irish law on the sub- ject. However, a decision by the Supreme C ourt in 1965 went beyond McNaughten in introducing a third factor, an irresistible impulse which the Court said \"debarred the defendant from refraining from committing the act\". The onus of proving in sanity on the balance of probability is on the per- son alleging it. It should be borne in mind that the Irish legal system is an adv ersarial system with evidence and examinations and cross- examinations of witnesses bei ng carried out in court by both sides, prosecution and defence, usually before a judge and jury. If the defence is successful the trial Judge must bring in the special verdict of \" guilty but insane\" as provided under the Trial of Lu- natics Act 1883 and commit the person to detention in the Central Mental Hospital. In trials where insanity is raised as a defence th is will be supported by expert witness testimony usually by a psy- chiatrist or occasionally by a psychologist and the Stat e as prosecutor will do likewise if it feels that there are grounds for refuting the insanity defence. In such cases the prosecution will call psychi- atrists from the national forens ic service based at the Central Mental Hospital. When a person committed to the Central Mental Hospital as guilt y but in sane is deemed recovered by the psychi- atrist in charge there have been difficulties in det ermining who has power or responsibility for di- scharging the person, whether the courts or the ex ecutive. In cases where a prisoner is on remand facing charge and the matter of his or her \"fitness to plead\" arises on grounds of mental illness this will be tested in similar manner and be presented to the court. If the insanity plea is accepted then the Court will order the detention of the person in the Central Mental Hospital even though uncon- victed, until such time as he or she becomes fit to plead and when expert evidence to this effect is given to the court. If a prisoner requires treatment which cannot properly be given in a prison, the Minister for Justice may direct that he/she be transferred to the Cent ral Mental Hospital for assessment and treatment. This is affected through the powers of what is know n as a hospital order under 17(6) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914. If the treatment of such a prisoner/patient without his/her consent is an issue, steps may be taken to have the person certified. This is done under section 13 of the Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act 1875, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. In this instance, a certificate in the appropriate form is comple ted by two doctors (usually general practitioners supplying medical services to the prisons) with or wi thout the advice of a forens ic psychiatrist to the prison. Following the medical certif ication the Minister for Justice may make an order that the pri- soner be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital. This is referred to as a Ministerial Order. The decision as to whether a patient should be retur ned to the prison is treated as purely a medical matter, lying within the sole discretion of forensic psychiatrists at the Centra l Mental Hospital. There is no automatic review of such patients while detained in the Central Mental Hospital under existing legislation nor under the proposed Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002. However representations have been made to the Department of Justice to in clude this group of persons in its remit. Two sections of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 and as amended, allow the transfer of patients from district mental hospitals and from private m ental hospitals to the Central Mental Hospital. Section 207 provides that where a person detained in a mental hospital or unit is charged with an indictable offence before a Justice of the District Court sitting in such hospital and evidence is pro- duced, which in the view of the Justice, constitu tes prima facie evidence that a) the person commit- ted the offence and b) that if placed on trial would be found unfit to plead, the Justice shall by order certify that such person is suitable for transfer to the Central Mental Hospital, subject to approval by the Minister acting on a report on the examination of the person by the Inspector of Mental Hospi- Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 169 tals. In practice, through doubts of the constitutionalit y of this section it has fallen out of use al- though there still remain some persons in the Centra l Mental Hospital transferred thereto under this provision many years ago. Section 208, which allows for the transfer of patients in psychiatric hos- pitals to other hospitals for the purpose of receiv ing therein treatment not available in their parent hospital has been used for the purpose of transferring persons to the Central mental Hospital con- trary, one imagines, to the spirit of the section. The Supreme Court ruled in a test case in 1997 on the appeal of the parent of a person so transferred t hat for the purposes of this section the Central Mental Hospital was a hospital like any other - a thesis difficult to accept and leading to the employment of this section to make further transfe rs of this kind, mostly on the grounds of security in the absence of a national system of secure psychiatric units in the country apart from the Central Mental Hospital. In the light of the generally unsatisfactory natur e of statute provision for and management of the mentally ill offender an Interdepartmental Commi ttee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons published an interim Report in 1978 which made a number of recommendations. As a result and for other reasons such as the European Conv ention on Human Rights Bill 2001 a new Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill was introduced to the Oireacht as (parliament) and as of August 2003 has had its first reading. Although this is still a bill rather than a la w, it is likely that by the time this report is published it will be the functioning legislation and t herefore will be the legislation on which this contribution is based and the questionnaire completed. In any case a very brief outline of the e- xisting position has been presented. Criminal Law Insanity Bill 2002 The area of the criminal law which is the subject matter of this Bill is concerned with the drawing up of appropriate rules to govern the criminal re sponsibility of mentally ill persons who may have committed offences. It has its origins main ly in the common and statue law of the 19th century with further significant developments in case-law throughout the 20th century. While the legal and medi- cal definitions which apply are not co-extensive, the approach adopted in the Bill takes into account the overlap between the criminal justice elements, and the need to have regard to the treatment aspects of mental health legislation, particularly concerning matters which a court must take into account when considering the options available to it following a determination of \"unfitness to be tried\" or \"not guilty by reason of insanity\", otherwise known under existing law - but due to be changed under the Bill - as \"unfitness to plead\" and \"guilty but insane\". The Purpose of the Criminal Law Insanity Bill 2002 With the development of modern psychiatry and greater understanding of t he underlying causes of mental illness and its associated conditions, it has become apparent that this area of the criminal law needs clarification and development. The difficu lty, however, in making any change is illustra- ted by the fact that no singular or uniform solution has been adopted in the various common law countries, including those with which we are closely connected. The purpose of the Bill is to clarify, modernise and reform the law on criminal insani ty and fitness to be tried and on related issues; and, to bring it into line with the jurisprudenc e of the European Conventi on on Human Rights, which will soon be given further effect in domestic law in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, 2001. At present the Convention is law for Ireland on the interna- tional plane, but it is not part of the domestic la w in Ireland. The Bill provides for extensive new provisions dealing with fitness to be tried, (which term will now apply rather than fitness to plead) as well as new rules in relation to appeals against such findings, a statutory def inition and restatement of the test for criminal insanity based on the ex isting rules at common law as developed in Ireland, a new verdict of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" to replace the existing \" guilty but insane\" verdict, and a new plea of \"guilty but with diminished respons ibility\" in cases of murder. In doing so, the Bill implements certain recommendations made in the Third Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Mentally Ill and Maladjusted Persons (The Henchy Committee) published in 1978. In addition, and in the light of obligations under t he Convention on Human Right s as already mentio- ned, the Bill will establish a new Review Body - the Mental Health Review Board - whose function Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 170 it will be to review at regular intervals or on application the cases of persons detained following verdicts of \"not guilty by reason of ins anity\" or findings of \"unfitness to plead\". Provisions of the Bill Psychiatric Centres and Prison Centres Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill set out the nature of centres designated by the Minister for Health and Children (with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the case of the designation of a prison or any part there of) for the reception, detention and where appropriate, the care and treatment of persons committed there under the Bill. For the most part it is intended that most centres will be psychiatric c entres that have in-patient specia lised psychiatric facilities. The designation of a prison as a centre is to cater fo r the situation where it might be more appropriate, under the provisions of the Bill, to detain a person in prison rather than in a psychiatric centre. Mental Disorder The term \"mental disorder\" is defined for the purpos es of establishing criminal liability and includes a person suffering from a mental illness or handicap, dementia or any diseas e of the mind, but exc- ludes intoxication from alcohol or other substances . While the definition is not fully inclusive, the essential element for the court, for example when criminal insanity is pleaded, is had the accused the mens rea to commit the crime for which he or s he is charged. The definition of mental disorder is intended as the test for the court in coming to a decision on that issue. It should be noted that the definition differs from that of the Mental Health Act 2001 which specific ally excludes personality disorder and social deviancy from its definition of mental disorder - a matter not without some prac- tical difficulties which will be referred to later. Fitness to be Tried Section 3 of the Bill introduces this concept in place of the term fitness to plead which is used in the relevant provisions of the Lunac y (Ireland) 1821, which will now be repealed. Where in the course of criminal proceedings against an accused person the question arises, at the instance of the de- fence, the prosecution or the c ourt, as to whether the person is fit to be tried he or she will be dee- med unfit if unable by reason of mental disorder to understand the nature of the proceedings so as to plead to the charge, instruct a legal repr esentative, make a proper defence or understand the evidence. Where the Court determines that an accused person is unfit to be tried, that Court shall adjourn the proceedings until further order, and may, if it is satisfied, hav ing considered the eviden- ce of a consultant psychiatrist and any other evidence, that the a ccused is suffering from a mental disorder, as defined, and is in need of inpatient care or treatment in a designated centre, commit him or her to a specified designated centre. If the Court determines that the accused is fit to be tried the proceedings will continue. A Court determining fitness to be tried will be presided by a jud- ge sitting alone without a jury. The period of commi ttal to a designated centre shall be for a period of not more than 28 days. In effect this period of committal is for the purposes of assessment. And the Court will direct that the accused be examined by a consultant psychiatri st at that centre and within this 28 day period the psychiatrist of the centre shall report to t he Court on whether the ac- cused is in need of in-patient care or treatment in a designated centre. If the court is of the opinion that this is the case then the court shall make an order committing the accused to that centre. Not- withstanding this the defence may apply to the cour t to allow evidence to be adduced as to whether or not the accused committed the act alleged and if t he court is satisfied that there is a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the act alleged, it shall order the accused to be released. Not Guilty be Reason of Insanity This new verdict is dealt with in section 4 of the Bill and replaces the existing special verdict of guil- ty but insane. The test to be applied relates to t he state of mind at the ti me of the alleged offence and not at the time of trial. Where on trial the c ourt or the jury finds that the accused person com- mitted the act alleged against him or her, and, having heard evidence relating to the mental condi- tion of the accused given by a c onsultant psychiatrist, finds that the accused person was suffering at the time from a mental disorder such that he or she should not be held responsible for the act alleged by reason that he or she did not know the nature and quality of the act or did not know that what they were doing was wrong or was unable to re frain from committing the act the court or jury Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 171 shall return a special verdict that the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity. Where the court considers that such a person not guilty by reason of insanity is in need of inpatient care or treat- ment in a designated centre the court may commit that person to a specified designated centre for a period of not more than 28 days and direct his or her examination by a c onsultant psychiatrist during that time. This period of time may on applic ation to the court be for a period or the aggregate of the periods to a total not exceeding 6 mont hs essentially for assessment purposes and during the period of committal the consultant psychiatrist of the centre sha ll report to the court whether the accused is suffering from mental disorder and is in need inpatient care or treatment in a designated centre. Diminished Responsibility Where a person is tried for murder and the jury or the Special Criminal Court finds that the person committed the act alleged, was at the time suffering from a mental disorder which was not such as to justify him or her being not guilty by reason of in sanity, but was such as to diminish substantially his or her responsibility for the act, the jury or c ourt shall find the person not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the ground of diminished re sponsibility. It shall be in such cases for the defence to establish, presumably on the evidence of expert testimony, to establish that the accused is not guilty of murder. While a verdict of murder carries with it a mandatory life sentence the ver- dict of manslaughter allows a the judge take into account the mental state of the convicted person when considering what sentence to impose. The ava ilability of the verdict of diminished responsibi- lity should reduce the danger that a jury will retu rn an insanity verdict when faced with a person whom they regard as not completely sane, even if he or she does not meet the legal criteria for in- sanity. Appeals Under this Bill persons found unfit to be tried or not guilty by reason of ins anity have the right of appeal to higher courts to have these decisions set aside on the grounds that he or she did not commit the act or was not suffering from mental disorder. Health Rev iew Board The Bill provides for the establis hment of a Mental Health Review Board which shall have regard to the welfare and safety of the persons whose detent ion it reviews and the public interest. The Board shall hold sittings for purposes of review and at the sittings may receive submissions and such evi- dence as it thinks fit, take account of the court re cord of the proceedings of the court to whose de- cisions the request for review relates and assign a l egal representative to a patient the subject of the review unless he or she proposes to engage one. The establishment of the Board will comply with obligations under the European Convention on Hu man Rights. The main function of the Board will be to review the detention in designated centres of persons found not guilty by reason of insani- ty or unfit to be tried in designated centres by order of a court. The Board will determine when such a person should be released. The Board shall comprise a senior lawyer or judge, a consultant psy- chiatrist and such other number of members as the Ministers of Health and Justice may appoint. Review of Detention The Review Board shall ensure that the detention of a patient is reviewed at intervals of such length not being more than six months as it cons iders appropriate and the clinical director's hall comply with any request by the Review Board in connection with the review. Where the clinical di- rector of a centre of a designat ed centre forms the opinion in rela tion to a detained patient that the patient is no longer unfit to be tried he or she s hall forthwith notify the c ourt that committed the pa- tient to the designated centre of this opinion and the court shall order that the patient be brought before it as soon as may be to be dealt with as t he court thinks proper. Where the clinical director forms the opinion that a detained pat ient, although still unfit to be tried, is no longer in need of in- patient treatment at a designated c entre he or she shall forthwith not ify the review Board of that opinion. On notification of this opinion the Review Board shall order that the patient be brought be- fore it as soon as may be and having evidence given by the consultant res ponsible for the patient shall make an order for the patient's disposal, whet her for further detention, care or treatment in a designated centre or for his or her discharge whet her unconditionally or subject to conditions for out-patient treatment or supervision or both. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 172 Temporary Release The clinical director of a designated centre may, with the consent of the Minist er of Justice, direct the temporary release of a patient on such conditions and for such period or periods as the clinical directors thinks appropriate. Procedures The legislation does not allow for pre-court assessment procedures such as when a person having committed an offence, is arrested by police, who suspecting or knowing that the person suffers from mental illness, can seek a ps ychiatric examination with a view to not proceeding with a formal charge and cannot, instead, seek care or treat ment, thereby avoiding a charge and court appea- rance. Neither does the legislation prohibit such deviation procedures and it is the ambition of the forensic psychiatric services to move in this direction. As matters stand a person charged can be the subject of psychiatric assessment for the purposes of the court's deliberations at the instigation of the defence, the prosecution or t he court itself. The point at issue is whether the accused is fit to be tried. If the court finds on the basis of psychiatric evidence that he or she is not then the court will order detention in a designated centre for fu rther assessment up to a period of 28 days during which time a further report will be submitted to the court to determine, on the basis of the report of the consultant of the designated c entre whether the accused is fit to be tried or not. If the court rules that he/she is unfit to be tried then the court will make an order committing the person to a designated centre where he/she must be the subject of review by the Review Board within six months or at any earlier time and as soon as ma y be if the consultant informs the Board that he/she is of the view that the accused has become fit to be tried. The board, then on hearing the consultant's evidence, will determi ne whether to send the accused back to the court or to continue care or treatment either in the centre or on an outpatient basis. When a case proceeds to trial but a plea of not guilty, by reason of insanity at the time of the act the subject of charge, is raised by the defence, the court will hear expert evidence for the defence and perhaps refuting evidence by the prosecution. If a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is returned, the court will then consider the mental c ondition of the accused at the time of trial to de- termine whether he/she should be released or detained for inpatient care or treatment. If the latter is decided then the care and treatment will be prov ided in a designated centre. Thereafter this per- son shall be subject to the review procedures of the Review Board as set out for a person detained as unfit to be tried. Where a court, on the basis of expert testimony, in t he case of a person tried for murder, finds that the charge of murder is not sustained through dimini shed responsibility, it will bring in a verdict of manslaughter. No powers or responsibilities are given by the bill to the court in relation to care or treatment in such cases. Practice It is not possible to comment as the proposed legi slation is still a bill which has not yet been enac- ted and therefore has not been tested in practice , however, a number of organisations have ex- pressed some reservations about cert ain aspects of what is proposed. There is much concern that the definition of ment al disorder differs between the civil mental health legislation - the Mental Health Act (2001) - and the Criminal Law Insanity Bill, because the civil leg- islation specifically excludes personality disorder and the forensic does not. This may lead to sub- stantial operational difficulties; fo r example where a court on the basis of personality disorder or- ders a person to be detained in a psychiatric unit wh ich under the civic legislation by which it oper- ates has no power to detain such a person. Addi tionally psychiatrists hav e generally not welcomed the responsibility of detaining persons in a milieu, a general hospital psychiatric unit, where as far as other patients are concerned, the emphasis is of care and treatment under the least restrictive alternative i.e. open doors etc. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Irelan d 173 Another point of contention, just ifiable perhaps, is that courts can only refer persons, for assess- ment or treatment as detained in -patients instead of having the br oader option in accordance with expert opinion of referring them for such interv entions on a non residential basis, i.e., as out- patients, day hospital patients etc. There is much criticism of the use of the concept of \"irresistible impulse\" as an ingredient in the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict, as being unsustainable on scientific and philosophical grounds. The issue of whether the designated centre has pow ers to treat without consent is not dealt with and there is a sentiment that the forensic legisl ation should be brought into line with the civil psy- chiatric law which does deal with this giving pow ers of treatment without consent to detained pati- ents under stipulated conditions. There has been objection to the use of the word \"insanity\" in the Bill as being antiquated and pejo- rative. Likewise there is a fear that the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity with the implication that the person has therefore not been guilty of any crime will hi nder therapeutic intervention based on the self-perception of wrong-doi ng through lack of self-control.

Four codes [Criminal (CP), Criminal Procedural (cpp), Civil (CC), Civil Pr ocedural (CPC)] strictly define rules and procedures, and the role of interpretation by magistrates is quite limited. The Criminal Code was approved in 1930 and since the '60s seve ral boards appointed by the Italian Parliament have been working on a new CC revision, which is not expected to reach its final version until the elapse of another five to six years. In 1988, a new Criminal Procedural Code was approved, whose main purpose is to balance the power of attor ney and defence during the pre-trial and trial phases. In general, the system is much more prescripti ve and less flexible than those following the Anglo- Saxon system of Common Law. Both criminal and civil tribunals are national instit utions, while regional legislation regards purely administrative issues, such as health legislati on, which is shared between the national level (gen- eral principles, objectives and criteria) and the r egional one (their actual im plementation and use of resources). This explains why the changes in health legislation are much more rapid than those in criminal law. In 1978, Italy passed a major reform in psychiatry, establishing a radical community- based system and the closure of all mental hospita ls. This law has promoted a dramatic change in the philosophy behind and the practice of all mental health services, but has not affected the pro- cedures and practices regarding mentally ill offender s, which have basically remained regulated by the Criminal Code of 1930. All magistrates and attorneys (civil and criminal) involved both in pre-trial and trial procedures be- long to the same professional body ( Magistratura ), though many political parties are claiming for a separation of their functions and ca reers. The general philosophy of Italian criminal law follows Ce- sare Beccaria's principles of equity and balanc e between punishment and treatment, assuming that the main scope of a sentence is to bring back citiz ens to society. The declared philosophy of Italian prisons aims at integrating pr eventive and treatment approaches by means of offering opportunities for the social rehabilitation of the criminal offender. Due to the above-mentioned split between administrat ive and criminal legisl ation, current provi- sions regarding mentally ill offenders and their placem ent reflect the philosophy and practice of the 1930's, while ordinary psychiatric services are designed along the lines of a post-de- institutionalisation community-based system of care. Public opinion, most political representatives, and psychiatric professional associations all agree that a harmonisation of these two aspects is mandatory, but the long times required to produce changes in criminal law are likely to prevent such an update in the short run. Procedures Current procedures for the management of mentally ill persons who have committed a criminal of- fence comprise four phases: Inquiry , Pre-trial, Trial and Placement. Inquiry During this phase the General Attorney (Procuratore della Repubblica - PR ) must acquire all ele- ments in order to decide whether the act committed is a crime. In this phase he is entitled by \u00a7359 Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Italy 177 cpp to appoint a psychiatric expert in order to obtain elements which can enable him to decide whether to start a prosecution by the preliminary judge ( Giudice per le Indagini Prelim inari - GIP ). In the case of trivial offences committed by a person deemed ill by the expert, it is not unusual for the PR to refer the offender to ordinary community services rather than to prosecute him/her. Pre-trial The structure of the pre-trial phase is quite similar to that of a small trial, with one judge (GIP) who has to take a decision about investing a court of the trial and about all measures to be taken before the trial, including the placement of the offender in this phase. The PR and the defence play a sub- stantially equal role in this phase. They can present elements and proofs, including the results of assessments carried out by their experts. The GIP can appoint his/her own expert (according to \u00a7392 CPP) in order to obtain a psychiatric assessment, including recommendations about provi- sional placement. The parties have the right to appoi nt their own experts, who can participate in all sessions that the GIP expert is having with the suspected offender. The GIP expert must refer orally and present a written report. The PR's and defendant's experts can present their own re- ports. The GIP holds a hearing at which all exper ts are present and can debate among themselves. During this phase the GIP can order provisional placement in a prison, in a forensic psychiatric hospital ( Ospedale Psichiatrico Giudiziario - OPG ) an ordinary psychiatric facility (\u00a773, \u00a7286 CPP), when there is a need for ca re or a problem of public safety. At the end of this phase the GIP must decide whether or not to conv ict the offender by the Court. In the case of trivial offences committed by a per son deemed mentally ill, the GIP usually ceases prosecution and commits him/her to ordinary psychiatric care. In the case of serious crimes or of persons deemed dangerous, a tria l is common practice. Trial Court composition varies according to the severi ty of the crime committed. Crimes punishable by four years or less of detention are judged by the Low Courts ( Giudice Monocratico ), composed of only one judge. More serious crimes are judged by a High Court ( Corte d'Assise ); when there is a conviction for homicide, the Court also compri ses lay members who work together with three judges whose task is to compile a written report on the reasons for the sentence. The court usually holds a hearing of the expert( s) who have been working during the preliminary phase. Where these have not been appointed or when the Court warrants an independent as- sessment, the Court appoints its own expert (\u00a7508 C PP). All parties can appoint an expert and they have the right to participate in all sessions. All experts are heard both independently and together. Sometimes all experts from the pre-trial and the trial phases are heard together and they can be cross-examined by the Court and by the par- ties: Sometimes courts allow fo r a real debate among the experts. The court takes the final decision according to the criteria of criminal responsibility and dangerous- ness (\u00a7\u00a788-89 CP; \u00a770 CPP). Criminal responsibility refers to the time of offence, dangerousness to the time of trial. In the event of full criminal responsibility, the offender receives his/her sentence without any special treatment. In the event of a complete lack of criminal responsibility (\u00a7215 CP and following) there are two options: a) If the offender is deemed dangerous to public sa fety, he/she is acquitted and sent to a psy- chiatric forensic hospital (OPG) for a period wh ich varies according to the crime (two, five or ten years). b) If he/she is deemed not dangerous, the offender is acquitted and set free and enters ordi- nary psychiatric care. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Italy 178 In case of a partial lack of criminal respons ibility and of dangerousness (a verdict often passed for offenders with learning disabilities or severe per sonality disorders), there are again two possibili- ties: a) The sentence is mitigated by approximately one third. b) The offender is sent to a psychiatric forens ic hospital (OPG) for half of the period provided for complete lack of responsibility and then to prison for the second half. Practice The system of practice resulting from these provisions is well est ablished and reasonably consis- tent, as it has been in effect since the 30's. Although some psychiatric concepts are defined only legally (e.g., criminal responsibility criteria reflec t the legal categories of insanity and mental flaw, not clinical ones) tradition and professional work over the decades have produced a certain degree of homogeneity in GIPs and decisions by the c ourts. Following many decades of harsh debates and conflicts medical professionals themselves (psy chiatrists, forensic m edicine experts and crimi- nologists) now share a more common scientific and professional ground, though the case for dif- ferent conclusions by Cour t, PR and defence experts in t he trial arena is still frequent. This system is nonetheless far from being consi dered satisfactory by m any stakeholders involved in it. The main perceived limitation regards: 1. the selection, certificat ion and appointment of experts, 2. the actual complete split between the or dinary psychiatric syst em and that of foren- sic psychiatry, 3. the actual organisation of the forensic psychiatric sector and the quality of care it provides. The Experts in the Court Currently PRs, GIPs, defence and the courts can appoint any registered m edical doctor, without any need for certification of specif ic training and experience in the fo rensic field. Although for all tri- bunals there is a register of experts by specialt y, this is rarely used and appointments follow the general rule of personal knowledge. Furthermore, criminologists and coroners (with usually little experience in clinical psychiatry) are appointed most frequently, while clinical psychiatrists play a minor role in forensic practice. This paradox is also enhanced by the scarcity of educational and training opportunities in forensic ps ychiatry at the medical faculties of Italian universities. Forensic Psychiatry is neither a field of post-graduate specialisation nor a subs pecialty of psychiatry in Italy. A more formal system of certification and appoint ment is currently demanded by most psychiatric scient ific societ ies. The Split betw een Psy chiatry and the Forensic Sy stem Italy has been operating a National Health Servic e (NHS) since 1978 and about 5% of the NHS re- sources are allocated to child and adult psychiat ry, excluding services for drug abuse and learning disabilities. The NHS is organised into 235 Local Health Trusts (Aziende Unit\u00e0 Sanitarie Locali - AUSL) , each of which cares for a geographically- defined population of 200-500,000 inhabitants and each of which comprises one Mental Health Department ( Dipartim ento di Salute Mentale - DSM ) that provides comprehensive psyc hiatric care to the population and manages on a unitary basis the full set of services established as necessary by national policy documents: community mental health centres, day-hospital/day-c are rehabilitation centres, psychi atric wards by the general hospi- tal, non hospital residential medium- and long-term facilities. This system (Fioritti et al., 2003) is the conc lusion of a process that began with law 180 of 1978, which basically decided five issues: 1) All mental hospitals were to be gradually phased out, with a halt to all new admissions; 2) general hospital psychiatric wards each having a maximum of 15 beds were established; 3) severe limitations in procedures for compulsory admissions and in their length (maximum period: seven days, renewable weekly) were se t; 4) community mental health Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Italy 179 centres were established to provide psychiatric care to geographically defined areas; and 5) all new and old public psychiatric services were integrated into the NHS. The only area left untouched by the reform is Forens ic Psychiatry, which still comprises only six Fo- rensic Psychiatric Hospitals. T hese institutions host those acquitt ed on grounds of mental infirmity and judged to be socially dangerous for a term co mmensurate with the crime committed and ex- tensible without any upper time limit. They are run by the Ministry of Ju stice and have virtually no contact with the ordinary psychiatric sector. The la w allows for placement of mentally ill offenders in an ordinary psychiatric setting only during the pre-tr ial phase, but does not allow for treatment or rehabilitation reasons once they ar e acquitted. One recent sentenc e bys the Supreme Court seems to enables post-trial placement in alternative NHS or dinary psychiatric settings, but it is unclear to what extent this option will be used. This situation is perceived as a real discriminati on and as a breach of equality in the right of citi- zens to health. An important consequence of this par adoxical split is that once the offender leaves the judicial system, there is no specific legal tool to allow an assertive follow-up by DSM services. This lack of flexibility is perceived as highly negat ive by mental health professionals and caregivers associations. Quality of Care w ithin the Forensic Sy stem One additional problem is the situation of forensic institutions themselves : Five of them (Reggio old-fashioned and obsolete 19th century institutions, with a severe shortage of medical and nursing resources, run by the Ministry of Justice mainly by means of custodial staff. Only one (Castiglione delle Stiviere) is run by the NHS Trust of Mantua, under an allowanc e scheme by the Ministry of Justice, and em- ploys only health staff under the supervision of Prison Magistrates who decide on prolongations, discharges and transfers. Apart from Castiglione delle Stiviere, living conditions and the quality of care are widely perceived as very poor and most users associations, psychiatri c scientific societies, associations of psychiat rists working in OPGs and also the po litical parties are demanding a radical reform of this sector and its integration within the NHS. Other problems on the agenda include: 1. a revision of provisions about the crimi nal responsibility and placement of alcohol and drug abuse offenders, who now constitute 40% of the prison population and show in- creasing rates of psychiatric co-morbidity, and 2. the absolute lack of provis ions for the treatment and rehab ilitation of sex offenders (who are now dealt with completely within the pris on system, with no specific psychological or psychiatric monitoring or approach). Unfortunately, all of these problems imply a revisi on of the penal code, which is not a realistic ob- jective in the short run, given the procedural aspects connected with the Roman Law system. Epidemiology One remarkable aspect of the Italian situation is the shortage of institut ional data on the commis- sion of crimes by the mentally ill and on their management. Although the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice publish periodical r eports monitoring criminality rates and the prison population, periodical reports from the psychiatric forensic institutions are not released and only a few ad hoc studies by the Ministry of Justice are available (Andreo li, 2002). Moreover, there is not a national register linking the forensic psychiatri c sector with the judicial authorities and no connec- tion between the NHS and any instituti on from the judicial sector. Most available data indirectly support the view that there has not been an increase of severe crimes committed by the mentally ill during the deins titutionalization process. The actual number of people placed in OPGs has not increased since 1978. In 1980, the population of OPGs comprised Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Italy 180 1,424 people and then a gradual trend of decrease took place until 1998, when it reached its lowest number (977). Since 1999, an opposite trend has appear ed and the last census available counted 1,282 people on March 12th, 2001. The prison population increased dramatically at the beginning of the '90s, due mainly to a change in provisions about drug crimes. In 1990, at a census day there were 25,573 people in Italian prisons. In 1994, t heir number reached 50,723, which remained sta- ble throughout the '90s. Since 1999, a new incr easing trend appeared, bringing this figure to 56,403 in March 2003. However, the degree to whic h the mentally ill are represented within the prison population remains absolutely unknown. Despite the relevance of the above-mentioned problems, the epidem iological literature on the prob- lem in Italy is confined to a handful of articles (Fioritti & Melega, 2000). One five-year retrospective follow-up has been conducted on 96 patients dischar ged from the OPG at Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, showing a poor liaison with or dinary psychiatric services and a 23% rate of criminal recidi- vism, with serious crimes (homicide, attempted homicide) committed in 7% of cases (Russo, 1994). The same group has recently carried out a retrospec tive comparison of clinical and criminological features of a sample of patients from Barce llona Pozzo di Gotto OPG and a sample of patients admitted to a public NHS nonforensic hospital (Russo et al., 2003). In a study aimed at describing clinical, criminol ogical and psychosocial features of the population of forensic hospitals (Fioritti et al., 1998; Fioritti et al., 2001a), 118 patients admitted to three OPGs and 118 matched controls from community non-for ensic services were assessed and followed-up for three years. Seventy-two percent of the subjects had a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis, and 75.2% had committed serious crimes against pers ons. Fifty-four percent of the crimes were homicide or attempted homicide. 60% of the subjec ts were being treated by a community service at the time they committed the index crime, and 68.9% had been compulsorily admitted previously. OPG inmates had a more frequent history of s ubstance abuse, had committed more crimes, and had lower social disability than controls. This st udy showed that the populat ion of Italian OPGs is quite homogeneous, comprising mainly patients with severe Axis I disorders who committed seri- ous crimes or repeated trivial crimes. Data about follow-up from the same project showed that the mean length of stay within the OPG is about th ree years and that discharge criteria are based mainly on the seriousness of the crime while a diagnosis of schizophrenia plays an independent role. The most common destination after dischar ge is a sheltered psychiatric environment, gener- ally in a supported housing facility (Fioritti et al ., 2001b). Preliminary data fr om the fol- low-up of the same cohort of pati ents show that criminal recidivi sm by discharged patients is very rare, much lower than the commission of crimes by their matched controls who were followed by community psychiatric services (Fioritti et al., 2002). Mental health care in prisons presents the same kind of problems as those caused by the split be- tween NHS and Forensic Health Systems provided by the Ministry of Justic e. According to peniten- tiary codes (\u00a711 L.354/1975), all prisons must have a health facility and at least one psychiatrist, only occasionally belonging to NHS community mental health services. In 1998, a national law (D. L.g.vo 22/6/1999, n.230) allowed for a pilot projec t to gradually transfer health services to local trusts in six regions. In May 2000, the National Health Prison Framework was published, in which mental disorders are among the priorities emphasis ed. Nevertheless, psychi atric care is mostly provided by private psychiatrists under an allo wance scheme with the Justice Department. Only one cross-sectional study has tried to define the prevalence of mental disorder within an Ital- ian prison (Carr\u00e0 et al., in press) among consecut ive male prisoners referred, over a twenty-month period, for a clinical psychiatric assessment, am ong the population (n=990 with 22% foreigners) of prison \"Torre del Gallo\", Pavia. One hundred and ninety-one men of 990 consecutively admitted male prisoners (19.3%) had one or more DSM-IV Ax is I current mental disorders (excluding sub- stance misuse), including 13 cases of (1.3%) psychosis; 53 cases of (5.4%) mood disorder; 24 cases of (2.4%) anxiety disorder; and 26 cases of (2.6%) adjustment disorder. The prevalence of mental disorder in this population seems to be higher than the US and EU averages, and might even be underestimated for particular diagnostic subgroups. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Italy 181 Public Opinion and Mass Media The 2000s have seen a resurgence of fears and emot ional attitudes in Italian public opinion to- wards crimes committed by mentally ill people. A fe w famous cases involving mentally ill people or just impulsive crimes of highly emotional cont ent (murder of a child by his mother) have been widely publicized by the media and debated in very popular TV talk shows. This has enhanced a climate of suspicion and irrational fear. It is possi ble that the rise both in the prison population and in the OPG population may be attributed indire ctly to this new mass media attitude. This new trend has had political consequences too. Some interest groups (especially some asso- ciations of caregivers) have demanded a more restrictive psychiatric l egislation, revising the reform of 1978. Associations of psychi atrists and some political parties have proposed to link any adminis- trative reform to a radical reform of the criminal justice system, bringing into practice the integration of forensic institutions into the NHS. Currently there are four psychiatric reform bills under examination by the Parliament and one commission working for the revision of the part of the penal code regarding the assessment, re- sponsibility and placement of the mentally ill offender . No major change in either the laws or prac- tice can be expected before the pass age of another couple of years.

Conc epts and Proc edure s in the Member embourg Jean-Marc Cloos, Romain Thillman, Spautz Structure of the Legal Sy stem Compulsory admission and involuntary treatment of mentally ill persons in Luxembourg is governed by a special mental health act (Loi du 26 mai 1988) that abrogated regime of the old law on the insane (Loi du 7 juillet 1880). The Youth Protecti on Law regulates the procedures concerning mi- nors (Loi du 10 ao\u00fbt 1992). In some cases, adole scents over the age of 16 may be held fully ac- countable. In order to regulate the judicial procedures of t he placement and treatment of mentally ill offenders, a new law was issued on August 8th, 2000 (Projet de loi n 4457, Loi du 8 ao\u00fbt 2000) that amended Chapter VIII of Book I of the P enal Code (article 71) (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice: Code p\u00e9nal du Grand- Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg), Art. 3 of the Criminal Inve stigation Code (Minist\u00e8re de la Justice: Code d'Instruction Criminelle g), the of the Penitentiary Administra- tion (Loi du 27 juillet 1997), as well as the 1988 Ment al Health Law, which now includes a special section on mentally ill offenders. The respec tive legal texts are available online at http://www.legilux .lu (in French). a) Legislation prior to the Law of August 8th, 2000 (Hoffm ann, 1993) The text of Article 71 of the Penal Code: \"There is no infraction if the accused or the prisoner was in a state of dementia while committing the act.\" (\"Il n'y a en \u00e9tat de d\u00e9mence au moment du fait. \") dates back to 1810. It was introduced in the national legislation at the same time as the Penal Code by the law of June 16th 1879 and for a long time was identical to Article 64 of the Fr ench Penal Code and Article 71 of the Belgian Penal Code. The major difficulty of Article 71 was the absence of a legal definition of dementia. The jurispru- dence has since suggested several formulations, fo r instance: \"The notion of dementia applies to all pathological mental states capable of influenci ng determination in a way that the person pursued no longer has control over his free will [...].\" This Article therefore emphasizes the situation of the accused, who, during the moment of committing t he objectively reprehensible act, suffered from a severe psychological disorder which alienated his discernment and control faculties and abolished his will to not commit the infraction (Court - Adjudication 180/99 of June 29th, 1999). Article 71 also did not include intermediate cases in which mental faculties were seriously dimin- ished without being completely impaired. In tangi ble cases, however, the psychiatric assessment on which the judge relied mentioned either a comple te lack of discernment or a diminished respon- sibility, which the judge could cons ider while pronouncing the sentence. Finally, there was a clear separation between Arti cle 71 of the Penal Code and the procedures of the Mental Health Law of May 26th, 1988. According to Article 2 of the latter, a person can be invol- untarily placed should he/she present a severe mental disorder and should he/she pose a danger to himself/herself or to other persons, but this decision is mainly a medical one and the legal au- thorities did not have any ability to decide upon a pl acement or the maintaining of a mentally ill offender (e.g., a murderer) in a closed psychiatric ward. In practice, a mentally ill offender could Conc epts and Proc edure s in the Member States - Lux embourg 185 therefore be acquitted according to Article 71 of the Penal Code without, however, being automati- cally placed in a closed psychiatric ward. b) The Law of August 8th, 2000 In France, the law of July 22nd, 1992 abolished the old Penal Code Article 64 and replaced it by the two new Articles 122-1 and 122-2 (see chapter on France). With the law of August 8th, 2000, Lux- embourg also modified its corresponding Article 71, including the two new Articles 71-1 and 71-2, with texts similar to those of the French Articles 122-1 and 122-2. The title of Chapter VII of Book I of the Penal Code (that contains Article 71) has also been changed into: \"On the causes of justification, i rresponsibility and excuse\". The new Article 71 now includes a cause of penal irresponsibility for pers ons suffering from mental disorders having abol- ished their discernment and control of actions. It r eads as follows: Art. 71: \"Is not considered responsible according to the penal law, the person who, at the time of the act, suffered from mental disorder suppressing discernement or control of her or his actions.\" (\"N'est pas p\u00e9nalement responsable la personne qui mentaux aboli son discernement ou le contr\u00f4le de ses actes.\") The mental disorder is considered to have influenc e not over the acts t hemselves but over the perpetrator of the acts. For this reason, in or der to describe the cause of non-imputability, the legislator has introduced the concept of penal irres ponsibility. Please note that Article 71 refers to \"mental disorder\" to qualify the state of dementia rather than to \"psychic or neuropsychic disorder\" (as in Article 122-2 of the French penal code) in order to maintain conformity with the international psychiatric classifications. The concept thereby covers all the medical definitions of mental disorders without, however, listing them explicitly. The new Article 71-1 covers diminished criminal responsibility in the case of impairment of mental faculties, thereby providing current practice with a legal foundation: Art. 71-1: \"The person who, while committing the ac ts, suffered from a mental disorder impairing his/her discernment or the contro l of his/her actions remains punishable; however, jurisdictions take into account this circumstance to determine the sentence.\" (\"La personne qui \u00e9tait atteinte, au ayant alt\u00e9r\u00e9 peine.\"). In the case of an offence committed while under t he influence of alcohol or drugs, the judge, how- ever, remains the one to decide whether or not the suspect is fully responsible. Finally, the new Article 71-2 covers the lack of criminal responsibility in certain other cases, e.g., a crime of passion: Art. 71-2: \"Is not considered responsible accord ing to the penal law, the person who acted under the influence of an irresistible power or restra int.\" (\"N'est pas inte \u00e0 laquelle elle n'a pas pu r\u00e9sister.\") Another major change in Article 71 is the fact, that if the article is applied and if the person continues to represent a danger to himself or to others, the judge then has to order the placement of the offender in a certified ps ychiatric institution or ward, t hereby introducing the concept of \"judicial placement\" in addition to the r egular placement of the mentally ill. Procedures While sentence and/or placement after trial is regul ated by the Penal Code, more specifically by Article 71, 71-1 and 71-2, pre-trial placement (for tr eatment or reasons of security), psychiatric as- Conc epts and Proc edure s in the Member States - Lux embourg 186 sessment, placement, and treatment, as well as discharge and aftercare are regulated by the amended 1988 Mental Health Law, which now includes a chapter on \"judicially placed persons\" (Chapter 4). In the new law, as opposed to regular placement and the previous legal si tuation, decisions con- cerning the maintenance of the \"judicial placem ent\" are no longer taken by a physician but by a special commission (Art. 21) that includes two magistrates and two persons suggested by the Min- istry of Health (one of whom should be a psychiatrist). Two months after admission, a report on the ment al state of the person placed and addressed to the special commission has to be written by the psychiatrist in charge. If placement is continued, an annual re-examination is scheduled. If the psychiatrist in charge considers that the m ental status of the plac ed offender has improved in such a way that placement is no longer necessa ry, he informs the special commission, which will decide or rule upon the case within a one month period. The special commission may also decide upon severa l forms of leave during placement (alone, daily or weekly). The expansion of the placement conditions may be requested at any time by the person placed or a relative. However, in the case of refusal, the person place or the relative must wait a full year before filing a new application. Should the mentally ill offender be discharged on probation, he/she will be placed under medico - psycho-social guardianship. The special commi ssion decides upon the modalities and duration of the guardianship. If the guardianship conditions are not respected or the person again becomes dangerous, the person wll be re-admitted. Practice (Spautz, Graas & Hentgen, 2000) Mentally ill offenders can be placed only in a specia lly designated institution, currently the Neuro- psychiatric Hospital Centre (Centre Hospitalier Neuropsychiatrique, CHNP) in Ettelbruck, formerly known as the State Neuropsychiatric Hospital. There no institution other than the prison and the CHNP that is able to deal with mentally ill off enders. A major problem continues to be the absence of adequate structures for aggressive minors, who t herefore are often placed in the CHNP as well. Concerning prison, in 1996, Professor Bernheim from Geneva was asked to study the general medical and psychiatric treatment of prisoners (Bernheim & Restellini,1996). The resultant study recommended that the psychiatric treatments of prisoners should be offered mainly within the prison walls, while the CHNP should contribute to the functioning and direction of a psychiatric annex of the prison medical ward. This psyc hiatric ward was inaugurated in July 2002. Even though a project of a specialised ward for m entally ill offenders is under discussion, the cur- rent psychiatric infrastructure may show insu fficiencies and may [not??] have the necessary means of security needed for the treatment of this population in the future. Since the introduction of the new law in 2000, there has been no \"judicial placement\" up to now (January 2004). No epidemiological data are available. Patients' Rights In case of an expertise, the Criminal Investigat ion Code allows the suspect to choose an expert to assist him at all stages of the assessment. He may address all possible requests to the experts appointed by the court and state his observati ons at the end or in a separate report. Article 71 of the Penal Code allows the filing of an appeal against the placement decision. In this case, however, the placement procedures will be pursued. Conc epts and Proc edure s in the Member States - Lux embourg 187 The 1988 Mental Health Law evokes the respect of human rights and freedom. Concerned persons such as family members or tutors are informed in the event of an involuntary placement. The law stipulates that the patient has the right to be treated according to his/her condition. A personal treatment plan has to be established and applied by qualified medical and paramedical staff. The treatment aims to reintegrate the patient into society and is given wi th respect to the patient's free- dom of thought, as well as to his/her religious and philosophical convictions. Family and social con- tacts should be encouraged whenever possible. Public Opinion and Mass Media In Luxembourg there is still a strong stigma attached to mental disorders. P ublic opinion and that of the mass media opinion are ambivalent and vary from \"lock them up for life\" to \"abolish the asy- lum\", making necessary objective discussions about the subject difficult. The level of political inter- est in mental health can be qualified as low and the fu ture will show if the legal presence in the field will increase with the new regulations. The best-known recent case of a mentally ill o ffender in Luxembourg is the one in 2000 covered by the media worldwide in which a man took severa l children hostage. At trial the offender was not given a diminished sentence but was sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment, despite the fact that the psychiatric assessment had concluded that the offender was suffering from paranoia.

Two main non- punitive measures exist for adult mentally disordered offenders: the entrustment order of 'Terbeschikkingstelling' (TBS-order, article 37a CC) and the hospital order (article 37 CC). Detainees who are considered unfit for penitentiary institutions due to a mental disorder or developmental deficiencies can be admitted to a psyc hiatric hospital for the duration of their pre- trial custody and/or prison sentence (article 15 PBW). For juveniles, the measure of 'Placement in an institution for juveniles' exists (article 77s CC) which can (also) be applied to mentally disordered juvenile offenders. The hospital order, 'commitment to a psychiatric hospital' (article 37 CC) can be imposed upon offenders who are mentally disordered and are considered by the court not to have been responsible for their acts. The func tion of article 37 is to 'branch off' mentally disordered offenders from the justice system to the mental health system , where they are then subject to mental health la w (Cleiren & Nijboer, 2002). The TBS-order can be imposed upon mentally disordered offenders who are considered not re- sponsible or to bear only a diminished responsibilit y for their offence(s). The measure of TBS is reserved for offenders who have committed serious, almost always violent offences. Most TBS- patients are found in maximum security hospitals wi thin the justice system (e.g., Van der Heiden & Eggen, 2003). In the case of partial criminal responsibility, an additional prison sentence or other penalty is optional. A condition for both the TBS-order and the hospital order is that the offender is considered to be dangerous to others or to the gener al safety of persons or goods. The hospital order can also be imposed if the person concerned is 'only' a danger to him or herself. In all cases, the dangerousness must have a causal relationship to a mental disorder or developmental defi- ciencies. The court can impose TBS or a hospital order only after it has sought the advice of at least two experts. There are two versions of TBS: TBS with mandatory hospital care (article 37b CC) and TBS with conditions attached. The first can be im posed almost only for violent (sexual) offences. The latter version can be imposed for offences which do not directly concern the physical safety of other persons, in which cases the risk of criminal recidivism is considered to be such that manda- tory hospitalisation is not necessary. TBS has to be imposed for two years. Thereafter the court can extend TBS for one or two years each time. TBS with mandatory hospitalisation is in principle unlimited in duration, however, as soon as the risk of criminal recidivism has dimi nished to a level considered to be acceptable, the TBS measure must be terminated. TBS with conditions attached can be extended only once and thus has a maximum duration of three or four years. The application of extension of the TBS measure by the prosecutor has to be accompani ed by a report and the advic e of the institution treating the patient. The district court decides w hether or not the TBS measure is to be extended. Appeal against this decision is possible to a spec ial section of one of the courts of appeal. Every six years an independent expert report (not by the hos pital treating the patient) has to accompany the application of the prosecutor. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - T he Neth erlan ds 190 TBS ends when the prosecutor does not apply for c ontinuation or upon the cour t's rejection of the requisition to prolong TBS. A further elaboration of t he legal position of TBS-patients, such as rules for care and treatment, is laid down in the Pr inciples Act TBS (Beginselenwet Verpleging RVT). This chapter will focus on the T BS-order, the main measure for dealing with men- tally disordered offenders within the ju stice system in the Netherlands. General Philosophy of TBS Legislation In 1928 the entrustment order of TBR (Terbesch ikkingstelling van de regering) was introduced to create the possibility to sanction individuals who we re considered not to be or only particlely crimi- nally responsible. TBR was criticised among other things for its lack of regulation of the legal posi- tion of TBR-patients (Hofstee, 2003): TBR could be imposed for any offence, there was no maxi- mum to the duration of TBR, nor was appeal against the verdict of TBR possi ble. Only the institu- tion of treatment could decide about prolongation of TBR. The government decided that the legal position should be regulated by law and in 1988, a te mporary regulation of the legal position of TBR-detainees (TRT) went into effect. In 1997, the present TBS-legislation took effect. The main function of the TBS measure, especially TBS with mandatory hospitalisation, is to protect society from the risk of criminal recidivism with se rious consequences. The second function of the TBS- measure is to care for the TBS-patient and provide treatment in order to prev ent criminal recidivism in the longer term. Much has been invested in the treatment, education and rehabilitation, and thus in the interests, of the TBS patient. In TBS-hospitals a socio-ther apeutic climate has been created to support patients' learning and their rehabilitation. On the other hand, in individual cases the measure can have, due to its unlimited (and usually long) duration and prev entive character, a greater impact on individual autonomy than a prison sentence. Although judicially not a punishment, TBS-patients in practice experience TBS as a severe punishment, due to the uncertain duration of the measure and the stigmatisation of being a 'mad criminal' (e.g., N oorlander, 1999). The duration of unlimited TBS is often substantial. Calculated on the basis of patients whose TBS ended, the mean duration is about seven years. If calculated on the basis of cohorts entering T BS, the current mean duration is about nine years. This is due to the fact that a substantial number of TBS-patients cannot be dis- charged since treatment was not succe ssful. In the past five years, tw o so-called long-stay units for TBS-patients have opened. Here, patients are no longer treated with the objective to re-socialise them but care is provided in order to stabilize their condition and optimise their quality of life. The duration of TBS can exceed the maximum pr ison sentence for the offence in question. Re- search in the early 90s showed that the longer the duration of the TBS-measure, the more the court tended to terminate it, contrary to the advice of the hospital, especially if the duration exceeded the maximum prison sentence for the offence in ques tion (Drost, 1991). The same study shows, how- ever, that patients whose TBS was terminated contrary to the advice of the hospital subsequently more often committed serious offences than pat ients whose TBS was terminated upon the advice of the hospital. The Future of TBS The suggestion to abolish the TBS-measure is a recurrent topic of discussion in Parliament and in the media. There are several points of criticism with regard to the TBS-measure. On the other hand, the obstacles to replacing TBS are also s ubstantial. Objections against the TBS-measure come from different angles: economical, crime pr evention and legal protection of the TBS-patient. An intrinsic argument against the TBS-measure is the long duration of TBS-treatment, and for a substantial number of TBS-patients, the lack of treatment success. The sector therefore struggles with overwhelming capacity problems and a substantial rate of criminal recidivism, in particleicular among sex offenders (e.g., Leuw, 1999; De Vogel et al., 2003). However, recidivism rates of former TBS-patients are substantially lower than recidi vism rates of offenders released from prison Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - T he Neth erlan ds 191 (Wartna et al., 2005). Furthermore, the same study shows that recidivism rates of former TBS- patients appear to be dropping in recent cohorts. Economical arguments criticise the high daily costs of a TBS-bed compared to the costs of a bed in prison or a long-term bed in a psychiatric hospita l: circa 468 vs. 155 and 143 Euro, respectively, in 2000 (Commissie Kosto, 2001). A judicial argument is the proportionality of the duration of deten- tion. The unlimited duration of TBS has been and cont inues to be a topic of serious discussion in judicial circles. The mean duration of TBS-treatm ent is circa seven years. In addition, TBS can be combined with a (long) prison sentence. The main objection to it is the loss of proportionality be- tween the offence and the duration of the sancti on (e.g., Van der Landen, 1993; Cleiren & Nijboer, 2002) which is a forteriori the case for the so-called long stay-patients (De Hullu, 2003). A related topic of discussion is the sequence of execution of the TBS-meas ure and a prison sentence in the case where both have been imposed. The function of TBS is less credible when a person who needs treatment urgently is first sent to prison. The usual sequenc e is to execute the prison sen- tence first, which has a retaliatory function. Some advocate the simult aneous execution of both sanctions, integrating TBS completely wi thin the prison sentence (De Hullu, 2003). Another aspect is that it may be more or le ss coincidental whether TBS is imposed (De Hullu, 2003). The possibility to impose TBS is strictly connec ted to the mental stat e of the person in ques- tion while he or she committed the offence and to the seriousness of the off ence. For instance, the question of whether a (serious enough) offenc e has been committed can determine the choice between TBS or a hospital order (article 37 CC), mo re so than the type of treatment and security needed. Furthermore, in the Netherlands as well as in other countries, pris ons host a substantial number of mentally disordered offenders (e.g., Bulten et al., 1999; Schoemaker & Van Zessen, 1997; Agency of Penal Institutions, 2001). One suggestion is to (in term) integrate the TBS-measure within the prison sentence (Van der Lan- den, 1993; De Hullu, 2003). The TBS-measure would then no longer serve the function of protect- ing society because it would be temporally maximi sed. In that case, there should be a sufficient number of adequate treatment facilities within the pr ison system, and long-stay facilities to protect society from incurable dangerous offenders should be provided by the ment al health system. How- ever, this would not be a short-term solution because at present, the prison system is not equipped to take over the treatment of TBS-patients. Nor does the mental health system seem sufficiently capable at the moment of dealing with patients who have committed serious violent (sexual) of- fences and have a high risk of criminal recidivism. Legal Procedures A global description of procedural steps regarding mentally disordered offenders in the pre-trial and trial phases of the criminal process follows below (see also flow charticle at the end of this chapter). If in the pre-trial phase it is suspected that t he offence was committed by a mentally disordered offender, an expert assessment is usually performed. If the court considers imposing TBS (article 37ab, 38 CC) or a hospital order (article 37 CC), such an assessment is mandatory. An expert as- sessment can be initiated by the prosecutor, the judge of inquiry, the defence or the court, depend- ing on the phase of the criminal process. The asse ssment of mental state and mental disorders has to be performed by two experts, for whom it is mandatory that one be a psychiatrist. Subsequently the court decides about the degree of criminal responsibility and the sanction. In the case of full criminal responsibility, depending on the offence a prison sentence or another penalty can be imposed. If the offender is considered not to be responsible for his acts, then no penalty will be imposed. In such a case, depending on the offence and the risk to society, the court can impose TBS or a hospital order (article 37 CC). An off ender can also be considered particlely criminally responsible. In such a case, TBS can also be imposed, depending on the seriousness of the of- fence and the risk to society. Offenders judged to bear diminished criminal responsibility often re- ceive an additional prison sentence. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - T he Neth erlan ds 192 Practice About 80% of the TBS-patients are diagnosed with a personality disorder, 25% with a psychotic disorder, and about 40% with substance abuse (Van Emmerik, 2001). Co-morbidity is high, about 60% of the TBS-patients are diagnosed with disor ders on both axis I and axis II of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM , American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Prob- lems of validity and reliability exis t with respect to the concept and classification of personality dis- orders as well as discussions on treatability (McM urran, 2001). In TBS-hospitals the approach is increasingly one of risk assessment of criminal recidivism, risk management and treatment directed at 'criminogenic factors'. In the nineties of the last cent ury the TBS-sector had to deal with a dramatic increase in the num- ber of TBS-patients (see table 51). This was due to a growing number of TBS-orders imposed by the courts and an increase in the mean duration of TBS-measures (Van der Heide & Eggen, 2003). A general increase in violent criminality, and a dec rease in the non-judicial alternatives for danger- ous and mentally disordered persons are identified by Leuw (1998) as the most likely explanations for the increase in the TBS-population. A cons equence of the rising number s of TBS-patients was capacity problems. Capacity problems have been a dominant policy-theme regarding TBS since the nineties.

Data taken from Agency of Penal Institutions (Dutch M inistry of Justice) * This concerns persons whose TBS-treatm ent should starticle but who have to wait in prison for a place in a TBS-hospital due to lack of capacity One of the aspects is the so-called 'Passantenpr oblematiek'. 'Passanten' are TBS-patients without a prison sentence or whose pris on sentence has been executed, who have to wait in prison for a place in a TBS-hospital. Their numbers are in creasing (table 51). In 2001, for instance, 151 pa- tients waited in prison for a mean period of 259 days. According to legislation (Principles Act TBS) a patient whose TBS is in execution must be plac ed in a TBS hospital within six months. Twelve months after the start of the TBS-measure, a patient whose placement has not been effectuated is entitled to a compensation of 600 Euro a month. Every three months the compensation is in- creased by 125 Euro. This compensation, although j udicially correct, is considered to be unaccept- able by many in view of the serious o ffences committed by t he persons concerned. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - T he Neth erlan ds 193 Serious offences by (ex) TBS patients have a great impact on society. The most recent study of criminal recidivism in former TBS-patients indi cates that recidivism rates are dropping. After 10 years, about 60% of patients whose TBS ended in 1974-1988 had recidivated with a serious of- fence1 while in patients whose TBS ended in 1994-1998 this was about 30% (Wartna et al., 2005). The recidivism for grave offences2 is more constant at about 30% after 10 years in older cohorts and about 20% in patients whose TBS ended in 1994-1998. There are also studies on recidivsm of specific subgroups of TBS-patients. Hildebrand and co-workers (2003) found 55% of a group of sex offenders were sentenced for another violent (sex ual) offence (mean follow-up period: 11.8 years after TBS, range: 1.8-23.5 years). Sex-offenders w ho were also psychopathic (in the sense of the Psychopathy Checklist, e.g., Hare et al., 2000) had t he highest rate of recidivism after TBS: 76% were sentenced for a violent (sexual) offence. Several strategies have been initiated to deal wi th the capacity problems, long duration of TBS treatment and criminal recidivism of (ex-) TBS patients. The capacity of TBS-hospitals was in- creased mainly by the building of three new TBS-hos pitals in the late nineties. Investments were made to reduce the duration and increase the effect iveness of treatment. A financial differentiation was made according to treatment duration. TBS hos pitals are reimbursed at a lower rate for pa- tients with a treatment duration in excess of six years. At the same t ime research ('What works f or whom?') and the implementation and development of new treatment methods were stimulated. Since the mid-nineties, research and the practi ce of risk assessment and management of violent behaviour (following the Canadian model) has experi enced a strong growth in the TBS-field. To enhance the efflux of patients from TBS hospitals, 'f orensic circuits' are stimulated in different re- gions. Several judicial and mental health institutions work together within these circuits to offer a complete range of care and security to forensic ps ychiatric patients. More forensic facilities are being created within the mental health sector. In addition, facilities for aftercare have been strengthened. Every TBS hospital has a forensic out-patient clinic and more sheltered living facili- ties for ex-TBS patients have been created. In order to reserve treatment oppor tunities for patients who may profit from them, long-stay facilitie s have been developed for forensic patients who are no longer considered to have a realistic treatment per spective but who are still considered to pose a danger to society. As of 2003 there are a total of 60 long-stay-beds in the TBS-sector. However, the need for long-stay facilities appears to be much greater (De Kogel et al., 2005), and the Minis- try is planning additional facilities. In conclusion, the TBS-sector undeniably has to cope with seri- ous difficulties. Nevertheless, several promis ing developments have been initiated to deal with these problems. Patients Rights The Principles Act TBS regulates the legal positi on of TBS-patients. Three values are fundamental to the measure of TBS: protection of society, tr eatment to reduce the risk of recidivism, and protec- tion of the legal position of the TBS-patient. The aspect of protection of society mainly has conse- quences for decisions about leave and termination of the TBS-measure. Security is a high priority: the head of the institution in nearly all cases may deny privileges if that is considered necessary for order and security. Appeal against such measures is then possible after a certain period of time. The first evaluation of the Principles Act T BS (Leuw & Mertens, 2001) concluded that although in general, the Act and the way it is practiced prot ect the legal position of TBS patients adequately, there has been relatively little development of the l egal position with respect to treatment. The TBS- patients have few enforceable rights with regard to the nature, course and ev aluation of their treat- ment. Yet the course and evaluation of treatment are of great importance to the patient because these usually are a prerequisite for terminating the TBS. 1 Including e.g. particular violent off ences, particular sex offences, theft, burglary , and traficking of illict drugs. 2 Including e.g. murder, manslaugther, viol ent offences w ith grave phy sical damage, theft and burglary while using violence, sex offences like rape or sex w ith children under 16, arson. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - T he Neth erlan ds 194 Epidemiology Several judicial and mental health agencies maintain databases to support work processes and facilitate management, which (in particle) contain information about mentally disordered offenders. For instance, the foundation GGz Nederland (Mental Health Care Netherlands) keeps a national database called Zorgis that includes information about treatment, patient trajectories and costs. The police, the Prosecution Service and the Forensic Psychiatric Service keep databases with case registrations. However, these databases we re not developed primarily for research purposes. One of the consequences encountered in practice, for in stance, is that variables of interest to re- search are not always coded in a reliable manner. Criminal records are registered in the national Judicial Documentation System (JDS ) of the Ministry of Justice. The Judicial Documentation Data- base for Research and Policy (OBJD) contains a pr ocessed selection of the data. This database is the main source of information about criminal recidivism. The Monitor Information TBS-patients (MITS) is a national database managed by the Agency of Penal Institutions of the Ministry of Jus- tice. MITS was developed as a management inform ation and research database and contains, for instance, information about judicial history, demographic information, and information about the execution of the current TBS-measure (see also the epidemiological trends described in tab.1). Public Opinion and Mass Media When scanning newspaper articles about TBS, topics t hat most often catch the eye are case sto- ries and figures about violent (sex) offences by (ex-) TBS-patients, and the question of how this could have happened and how society can be better protec ted from criminal recidivism by such mentally disordered offenders. Offences against children particularly shock the public. Cases of escape and re-offending by TBS-pati ents have given rise to questions in Parliament n a regular basis. In an effort to enhance the protection of the public, there have been several discussions about the TBS-measure, focusing, for instance, on t he necessity of stricter criteria for leave and release, calls to abandon unescorted leave for TBS- patients all together and for more intensive monitoring of sex-offenders after their release. This recently led to a bill to change the maximum period of conditional release for TBS-patients from three to six years. Furthermore, Medio 2004, a new protocol for leaves, including mandatory use of a risk assessment instrument has come into effect. On the other hand, ethical and economical questions about the placement and treatment of mentally disordered, difficult pat ients and offenders are also cover ed in the media. For instance, the position of mentally retarded and mentally disordered (juvenile) offenders in prison, often with few opportunities for adequate treatment, is a regular topic of discussion.

The 1995 revision of the Code, which was undertaken following a number of general recommendations by the European Un ion, paid particular attention to the social reintegration of offenders, the replacement of prison terms by alte rnative forms of punishment (e.g., fines, community work), and improvements in the preconditions for applying \"security measures\" (it established maximum periods for the la tter that cannot normally be exceeded). A ruling that the Supreme Court of Justice (STJ) handed down on October 28th 1998 offers a good example of the general philosophy underlying the manner in which the law is applied in relation to crimes committed by mentally ill offenders in Portugal: \"The purpose of interning a dangerous per- son who may not be held responsible for his acts is on the one hand to relieve the com munity of the presence of a citizen who endangers it by not behaving in accordance with its ethical, moral and social values; but on the other - and more importantly - to cause the state of social danger- ousness that has led to the internm ent to cease to exist in the offender and thus return a citizen who is capable of respecting the com munity' s rights to life in the com munity \". One of the most important guiding principles laid down in the CP is the crucial difference between punishm ents (applicable to persons who may be held responsible for their acts) and securit y measures (applicable to those who may not). Although bot h seek to protect legal rights and reinte- grate the offender into society, security meas ures are fundamentally undertaken with a view to treating him/her in such a way as to stop him/her from being dangerous. In other words, in cases in which an offender cannot be held responsible or be c onsidered \"guilty\", it does not make sense to punish his/her behaviour and he/she is therefore sentenced to a security measure and not a pun- ishment. In cases in which both a punishment and a security measure are appropriate, the CP re- quires that the latter occur first because it is more directly aimed at the tr eatment and elimination of the cause of danger. Internment is not the only security measure that can be applied to persons who cannot be held responsible. On the contrary, it is considered to be the alternative of last resort and once applied, the courts are under a general duty to suspend it (subject to the minimum three- year period determined by law) when it is plausible to expect that doing so will contribute to the fundamental objectives described above - i.e., the pr otection of legal rights and the offender's rein- tegration into society. In addition to the general provisions of the law, persons aged less than 16 years are exempt from criminal responsibility (CP Art. 19) and there is specific legislation for those aged between 16 and 21 years (CP Art. 9). This specific legislation is based on the observation that juvenile delinquency can be a transitory phenomenon and is intended to avoid stigmatising young people early on in their lives. Under this principle the law resorts as little as possible to prison terms and instead im- poses fines, community work or internment in establishments designed for young people. Given that Portugal is not a federal state, this set of laws is applied in the same manner throughout the country (on the mainland and in Madeira and t he Azores) and there is no legislation of a re- gional nature in this area. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Po rtugal 198 Legal Instruments and Law Besides the general provisions laid down in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, the legis- lation on penal matters is basically contained in the 1982 Penal Code, as revised in 1995 (concep- tual aspects of the law), and the 1987 Code of Crim inal Procedure (CPP) (procedural issues). The legislation governing crimes commi tted by mentally ill offenders is incorporated into the general penal law, unlike that on the com pulsory admission of mentally ill non-offenders, which is the object of a specific law (the Mental Health Act - Law 36/ 98). However, this separation is not complete and there is a certain degree of overlap between the tw o. For instance, under the Mental Health Act (Art. 29) a mentally ill offender whom a court has considered not responsible, but who has not been placed in a Forensic Unit, may nevertheless be subjected to compulsory placement on a general psychiatric ward if his/her clinical condition requires it. The Legal View of Mental Disorders The legal view of mental illness: Within the ov erall range of mental disorders, the CP purposely fails to describe or list any nosological categories that can cause a reduction in criminal responsibil- ity. This is partly due to the observation by the j udicial and legislative communities of the uncertain- ties that underlie the definition of mental illness, the successive c hanges in the nosological classifi- cation systems in the psychiatric field and the difficulty of determini ng the relative effect that each nosological entity has on a person's intellectual capac ity and volition. As a result, the law employs the concept of \"psychological anomaly\", which is not narrowly defined but includes all kind of men- tal disorders. Legal instruments also apply for pers ons, who, while not suffering from a mental dis- order, have committed an offence while being intoxica ted with s ubstances: In fac t, intoxic ation should be assessed and valued for the purpose of a ttenuation or increasing the sentence, accord- ing to the circumstances of each particular situation. Criminal Responsibility From a theoretical point of view the legal concept of not being responsible for one's acts is really quite a complex one, inasmuch as despite the fact that the concept is not of a biological nature, its application in a legal context is always subject to prior psychiatric evaluat ion of a person's mental state. A look at the historical ev olution of the notion of \"lack of criminal responsibility\" shows that the balance between its bio-psychological (medica l) and normative (legal) components inevitably leads to the development of one of two different paradigms for the assessment of criminal respon- sibility, in which, when it comes to taking the final decision as to whether or not a person is respon- sible, the weight given to expert psychi atric evidence is completely different. Under the restricted model a lack of responsibility results from the ex istence of a mental illness that reduces the sufferer's intellectual and affective capacity and volition; the assessment of both the diagnosis of the illness and the latter's impact on the offender's behaviour lies with a psychiatrist and cannot be questioned by a judge. Under the broad model there must still be a mental anomaly, but not necessarily a categorical nosological entit y, and this more flexible concept includes any disturbance that affects individual behaviour; in th is situation the declaration of non-responsibility lies more in the hands of the judge and the psychiat ric evidence is relatively less important and is not binding. Although no formal statement is made to this e ffect, the Portuguese Penal Code leans more to- wards the restricted model of lack of responsibilit y, under which judges cannot issue rulings that go against the expert evidence and can only ask the experts for additional clarifications or order a new examination (CP Art. 158). The concept of criminal responsibility is therefore a key concept of the penal legislation that states the next four categories: full respons ibility, diminished responsibility, slightly diminished responsibility and lack of res ponsibility. Under the Portuguese legal system \" A person is not responsible for their actions when, due to a mental anom aly, at the m oment when he acts he is incapable of assessing the illicit nature of his action or acting in accordance with that assessm ent\" (CP Art. 20-1). Thus, the legal pre-requisite s for lack of criminal responsibility are: Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Po rtugal 199 presence of a psychological anomaly; diminished/abs ent capacity to evaluate the illicit nature of an act, due to this psychological anomaly; diminished/abs ent capacity to act according to this evalua- tion, as a consequence of the psychological anomaly. If the ability to assess an action's illicit nature is not totally lacking, but is significantly diminished due to a psychological anomaly, in certain circumstances an offender can still be held non- responsible (CP Art. 20-2). If the inability to assess w hat is or is not illicit is merely transitory and results from a voluntary act in which the offender engaged with a view to committing the crime, he/she is considered responsible (CP Art. 20-4). The most paradigmat ic cases in this respect are those involving alcohol or drug-induced intoxicati on, in which the mental anomaly was self-induced with the intention of reducing criminal liability. Pre-trial Procedures Pre-trial placement is regulated by the general laws mentioned earlier, not by a specific law con- cerning only the mentally ill offenders. The Court is entitled to place a person suspected of being mentally ill in a specialised forensic facility (never in a prison), ev en in the absence of a preliminary expert full evaluation. Whenever doubts are raised as to the extent of an offender's criminal re- sponsibility, the Court must order an expert ps ychiatric assessment (CPP Arts. 159, 160, 351), which is a mandatory prerequisite for a trial. Th is assessment, which can also be requested by the Public Prosecutor, looks at the following aspec ts of the offender: socio-demographic and economic circumstances, presence of psychological anom aly, ability to control his/her actions, level of insight, dangerousness and recidivism. The experts (always psychiatrists), who are appoint ed by the National Institute of Forensic Medi- cine, are expected to give a repor t stating their opinion as to whet her the crime was a direct conse- quence of a psychological anomaly. If the offender refuses to be assessed, they should mention this in their report. The CPP states that judges are not free to evaluate the judgement that is inher- ent in expert evidence - in reality, a judge can disagree with an expert's opinion, but in this case must justify the reasons for this disagreement with technical/ scient ific arguments of the same na- ture as those presented by the expert (Art. 163-2). A judge can always require experts to give addi- tional clarifications and can also order a new exper t assessment by the same or different psychia- trists (assisted by psychologists, where necessa ry) and this does provide a greater degree of bal- ance between expert testimony and a judge's freedom of decision (CPP Art. 158). However, a judge cannot rule against the results of an expert assessment. Trial This kind of case is heard on the same basis as any other trial, in the same courts (see Annex 1 for a description of the types of court in Portugal), wi th the same number of judges and, in the majority of cases, without a jury (alt hough the defence is entitled to ask for one). The suspected mentally offender has to attend all the Court sessions. Besides the right to appoint a particular trial lawyer, the offender has the right to claim for an assigned counsel, fully paid by the Mi nistry of Justice; on the other hand, the offender can be assigned a counsel against his/her will, namely when he/she refuses to have any legal representative (e.g., due to paranoid delusions), in order to guarantee the constitutional right to defence at trial. Both the defence and the Public Prosecutor have the right to ask for an additional independent expert report, namely in the following situations: 1. Disagreement with the diagnosis or other con- clusions, 2. Failure to demonstrat e a causality link between the ment al condition and the offence, 3. Discrepancy with previously existing psychiatric reports. The court may rule that an offender is either responsible or not responsible for his/her acts; in the former case , responsibility may be full, diminished or slightly diminished. If an offender is not considered to be criminally responsible for his/her acts (CP Art. 20), the c ourt will hand down a \"security measur e\" and can place him/her in a Forensic Unit whenever the seriousness of the m ental anomaly and the crime mean there is a fear that he/she may otherwise commit more off ences of the same kind (CP Art. 91-1). Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Po rtugal 200 In cases in which the crime in question is punishable by a prison term of more than five years (for offenders who are not mentally disturbed), this intern ment must last for at least three years (CP Art. 91-2). If it is proven that the accused did not commit the crime or did so but there is no reason to intern him/her in a Secure Unit, he/she can still be forcib ly interned in a general psychiatric service, but under the terms of the Mental Health Act (Law 36/98). The difference is that in these circum- stances, the purpose of the internment is only to ensure the patient's treatment in a strictly medi- cal/psychiatric context, and not to punish him/her criminally. In cases in which an offender is held responsible fo r his/her acts, but it is shown that a psychologi- cal anomaly which existed prior to the crime means that there is a risk that he/she may be preju- diced by the normal prison regime, the court must place him/her in an institution intended for per- sons who are not responsible (C P Art. 104-1), because this will be mo re beneficial to his/her rein- tegration into society. If the mental anomaly has arisen since the cr ime and the condition renders him/her dangerous, the court will also intern the offender in a Forensic Unit (CP Art. 105-1); if not, the court will suspend the criminal sentence until such time as the mental anomaly has passed. Offenders not suffering from any form of mental disorder but w hose crime has been considered to have been committed under the influence of extreme affective conditions (e.g., crime of passion ), may be convicted and given a shorter sentence due to their diminished responsibility. Internment ends when a court de- termines that a patient's dangerous state has ended (CP Art. 92-1). However, in cases in which the normal sentence is greater than eight years of imprisonment and the danger continues to exist, the internment may be extended for successive two-year periods (CP Art. 92-3). In the particular case of a person who has committ ed a crime while drunk and has a prior history of alcoholism, the punishment is deemed \"indeterminate\" and is equal to 2/3 of that normally applied for the same crime (CP Art. 86); the same occurs in situations involving drug abuse (CP Art. 88). In both cases, the sentence is geared towards treat ing the addiction (CP Art. 87) and the prison au- thorities are required to actively work to hel p offenders of this kind recover (CP Art. 89). If both psychiatric treatment and a prison sentence are imposed on a mentally ill offender, the most frequent sequence is treatment before prison, alt hough both may occur at the same time; in both situations, the duration of the psyc hiatric treatment is always part of the total duration of the prison sentence. A practical example of the way in which these provisions are applied is to be found in the Drug-Free Units (ULD), which are independent from standard prison areas and house drug-addict inmates who want to be treated. The treatment progr amme in these residential units, which aims to achieve abstinence from drug taking, lasts for an average of 18 months and includes educational, occupational and therapeutic activities with a st rong group element. Apart from placement, a court can issue other types of sentence, such as com pulsory treatment, prohibition of further consump- tion and/or prohibition from entering places where alcoholic beverages are sold. Placement /Treatment The convicted mentally ill offenders lacking criminal responsibility have to be placed in special Fo- rensic Units. There are just five units in the entire country (ten million i nhabitants), three of which belong to psychiatric hospitals. The mentally ill off enders are not placed in prisons, except for those cases where, despite the mental anomaly, there is a full criminal responsibility. Unlike the concept of 'unlimited placement for treatment purposes', the concept of 'limited pl acement for treatment purposes' is incorporated into the law. The criter ia for a limited placement include the type of psy- chiatric diagnosis, the current clinical situat ion and the degree of severity of the offence. Concerning leave, there are several forms allow ed during the placement of mentally ill offenders, ranging from attended leave on the premises of t he forensic unit up to unattended over-night stay off the premises of the forensic unit, all possib ilities and combinations are permitted by law. The only thing that changes is the institutional status of the person c harge with deciding whether or not the request for leave will be granted: the ther apist's authorization is enough to grant unattended Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Po rtugal 201 leave off the premises of the forensic unit, but not to grant an over-night leave; the latter at all times demands an authorization by the Unit's Director (l eave < 48 h) or even by the Court (leave > 48h). The law stipulates periodical re-assessments, whic h may occur at any time during the placement period (e.g., when required by the offender, the Public Prosecutor, etc.), with a maximum re- assessment interval of two year s. The re-assessments (and the reports for the Court) have to be made by the psychiatrist(s) of t he Forensic Unit, covering several aspects such as the offender's mental state, general behaviour, socio-familiar condi tions (in terms of predictable support), risk of recidivism and danger to the public. Despite the absence of legally defined criteria to portray it, the effectiveness of the forensic treatment has to be r eported by the psychiatrist to the Court at least every two years and also before any scheduled discharge. If forensic treatment is certified as effec- tive by the Court prior to the end of an additional prison sentence, the sentence does not have to be completed, and the offender can be discharged. Regarding the therapeutic procedures, there is no difference between mentally ill offenders and non-offenders - in both cases, therapeutic program s seek to integrate biological and psychothera- peutic care with social skills training and profe ssional education, thus following the general princi- ples of the Mental Health Act. The greatest obstacle to integrating care in this manner continues to be the shortage of forensic services, inasmuch as in Portugal there are no specialised facilities reserved exclusively for offenders wi th mental disorders; at the sa me time, those Forensic Units that do exist do not have specialised outpatient facilities, so in parol e situations psychiatric supervi- sion can only be conducted at the general psychiatri c service of the offender's area of residence. Recently the Directorate-General of Prison Services (DGSP) has been doing some very interesting work in the field of offenders suffering from dr ug addiction, which includes the Drug-Free Units (in prisons), treatment motivation programme s, methadone replacement programmes and pro- grammes involving the use of opi ate antagonists. There is also a halfway-house for female inmates who have successfully completed the drug-addict ion treatment programme and whose judicial situation allows them to be housed under an open regime . The objective of this facility is to con- solidate the gains they have made during treatment by inserting t hem into society and work, thanks to a number of community resources that offer them jobs. According to the law, specific kinds of treat ment, such as ECT and psychosurgery, can only be applied after informed consent from the offender plus an authorization by the National Council for Mental Health, based on an assessment c onducted by two independent psychiatrists. Rights As soon as a suspect is charged, he/she immediat ely acquires a set of rights that apply in every phase of the judicial process (CPP Art. 61): to be informed, to be present at court sessions, to be heard by the court, to choose his/her own defence counsel and to ask the court to appoint a public defender, not to answer any question unless he/she wis hes to do so, to intervene in the investiga- tion process by submitting evidence and to appeal against unfavourable rulings. Similarly, the accused may appoint a technical consul tant of his/her choice to assist with (and ob- ject to) any expert assessment to which he/she is obliged to submit by the court (CPP Art. 155-1). One important right is enshrined in the principle of the proportionality of the law: a security measure (e.g., internment) cannot be imposed in judicially in significant cases, must be related to the seri- ousness of the offence and the extent to which it constitutes a danger to society, and can be im- posed only when there is a danger that the offence may be repeated in the future. Similarly, the more serious security measures can only be imposed when there is no other way of ensuring the protection of legal rights, and ev en then the period of internment cannot exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed for the same type of crime, had it been committed by a non- mentally ill person (CP Art. 92-2). Review of an offender's situation is obligatory ev ery two years after a period of internment has be- gun or has been extended (CP Art. 93-2). Before the latest revision of the law, when an offence was considered serious or very serious, the CP r equired the imposition of a security measure of a Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Po rtugal 202 minimum of three years' internment, which had to be completed, even if the offender had ceased to be dangerous or had become capable of returning to the community sooner. Knowing that in a large number of cases an offender could be releas ed after less than three years of internment without running any significant ri sk, psychiatrists strongly disappr oved of this provision and argued against a mandatory three-year security measure when the objective was to treat the offender. The 1995 revision retained the three-year minimum, but added the following text to the Article in ques- tion: \"... unless release should prove com patible with the defence of lawful order and a peaceful societ y\" (CP Art. 93-1). In cases where there is a reason that would justify ending the interment measure because there is no longer any danger, the court can and must immediately reassess it and is not bound by any mandatory period of internment. Epidemiology - General Trends Between 1992 and 2001, crime increased in Portugal and this increase progressively led to a cor- responding rise in the number of court cases and the number of people sentenced. The proportion of the population who were found guilty in c ourt rose from 836/100,000 (1998) to 1,003/100,000 (2001), mainly due to cases involving male offenders (see table 52).

The growth in both the number of crimes and pers ons found guilty in court was responsible for a rise in both the absolute and the relative (from 96/100,000 to 131/100,000 population) numbers of prison inmates throughout the 1990's. One particularl y significant element in this trend throughout the decade was the number of people who were hel d preventively before being formally accused and brought to trial, which, although it did not increase, represented a very high proportion of the total number of people held (see table53).

Annex 1: Courts in Portugal The judicial sector in Portugal includes a set of different Courts: Tribunal Constitucional Constitucional Constitutional Court) - assesses the constitutionality of laws, over- sees referenda, hears appeals in cases in which a Member of Parliament is deprived of his/her seat for disciplinary or other reasons, receives declarations of assets and hears cases involving the regime governing the compatibility or otherwi se of persons holding political office. Tribunais Judiciais (Courts of Law) - (in ascending hierarchical order) the Courts of 1st Instance, the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Ju stice: hear both criminal and civil cases, appeals against rulings in lower courts, petitions for habeas corpus , criminal cases with an international scope and cases in which the accused holds senior political office. Tribunais Adm inistrativos e Tribut\u00e1r ios (Adm inistrative and Tax Courts) - includes the Circuit Ad- ministrative Courts, the Tax Courts and the Suprem e Administrative Court (STA). The Circuit Ad- ministrative Courts (courts of 1st instance) hear appeals against acts taken by the central public administration, petitions for the recognition of ri ghts that are protected by law and cases involving contracts with the public administration or the st ate's contractual or civil responsibility. The Tax Courts (1st instance) hear appeals in fiscal cases, includi ng those against levies or other measures imposed by the customs authoritie s. The Supreme Administrative Court hears appeals in cases that have already been judged by the lo wer administrative or tax courts. Tribunal de Contas (The Court of Accounts) - are responsible for inspecting public income and expenditure and assessing the financia l management of the state purse. Tribunais militares (Military Tribunals) - judge crimes of a strictly m ilitary nature, but only during a state of war (the Constitution precludes them from sitting in peacetime). Tribunais com unit\u00e1rios (Com munity Courts) - the Court of Justice of the European Communities is responsible for interpreting and applying Community Law.

It is still codified in today's Penal Code, approved by Organic Law 10/1995 of November, 23 (CP 1995). The CP ( C\u00f3digo Penal or Penal Code) of 1848 stipulated that those exempted from responsibility for mental reasons should be hospitalised \"in one of the hospitals designated for the ill persons of that class\" . During the 19th century it was common that \"criminal lunatics\" were imprisoned as often as they were sent to asylums. Finally, the Royal Ordinance of September 1st, 1897 provides that mentally ill criminals should be separated from health y prisoners, so that it became necessary to build specialised penitentiaries for mentally ill. Ho wever, the lack of sufficient financial means has always been a constraint to the prov ision of appropriate facilities. At present, three forensic fac ilities are provided for Spain, lo cated in Alicante, Seville and Barcelona. The selection of patients follows t he criteria of proximity to their homes. The Penal Law of 1995 introduced improved and modernised security measures for imprisoned mentally ill patients (including t he mentally retarded and patients suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction) such as a) a maximum time-frame of the meas ure, which had not been regulated before, b) the continuing judicial control over the execution of the measure, and c) the powers assigned to the judicial authorit y regarding the termination, substitution or suspension of the measure. Fundamental changes also took place on the general penitentiary level, mainly by the Organic General Penitentiary Law 1/ 1979 (LOGP) from September 26th, 1979, which was promulgated after the approval of the Spanish Constitution of December 28th, 1978. This m eant a radical change in penitentiary norm s and standards within the Spanish panoram a. The LOGP was developed further by means of Regulation of 1981 (RP 1981). Following this, the current P enitentiary Regulation was approved by Royal Ordinance 190/1996 (RP 1996), which introduced for the first time important regulations of forensic detention. It determines the implementation of \"Psychiatric Units\" in penitentiary centres to complement Psychiatric Penitentiary Hosp itals. It further regulates t he implementation of so-called \"Multidisciplinary Teams\", which are the key-gr oups responsible for the treatment, supervision and reporting on the execution of forensic detention. On a procedural level, the Law of Criminal Pr osecution from 1882 (LECrim) has not been modified in this respect. For that reason, the expert testim ony prior to and during court trials is governed by obsolete and insufficient norms. Modifying this basic procedural law, the Organi c Law 5/1995 from 1995 on the Tribunal of the Jury (LTJ) constitutes a jury as the deciding authorit y in many trials against mentally ill offenders. The rights of offenders suffering from a mentally illness have been regulated only very recently. A first step has been made in 1986 with the General Law of Health (LGS). In 2002, the Law of Autonomy of the Patient 41/2002 (LDP) entered into force. It is mandatory to apply these laws in all public and private health facilities. Therefore these laws are also applicable to the facilities within the penitentiary system. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Sp ain 208 Procedures The Phase prior to the Judgement A person suspected to suffer from a mental illne ss and of having committed a crime is usually sent to a penitentiary facility, either to a general pr ison department or a medical ward, according to his or her state. Health care or medical treatment of these persons corresponds to the health care standards of the Penitentiary Admi nistration or, in their case, to the appropriate service of the Health Administration (207 RP 1996). It is possible to admit patients to hospital treatment due to mental disorders (209.2.2 RP 1996), but in practice they are cared for by liaison psychiatrists or the regular physician of the respective penitent iary centre (288.2\u00aa RP 1981, effective). During the investigation, the responsible ex amining judge can name one or two experts for psychiatric assessment. This depends on whether a r egular or shortened proc edure is exercised. A shortened procedure can only apply for offences punishable by a maximum of nine years of deprivation of freedom (785.7\u00aa 459 LECrim). It is al so at the discretion of the examining judge to order the admission of the suspect to a psychi atric penitentiary hospital or a psychiatric penitentiary, which happens rather frequently. This is allowed for the purpose of observation and issuing an expert report (184.to RP 1996). All involved parties, the suspect or his defence, the plaintiff or the prosecution can name an expert at their own expense (471 LECrim). The expert might be a psychiatrist, psychologist or forensic doctor, since the procedural laws do not provide any specification on the expert's professional backgr ound. In practice, the assessing expert is most often a psychiatrist or a forensic doctor. The latter can be specialised in psychiatry but does not necessarily have to be so. Court Trial and Expert Assessment The Spanish legal system knows three types of trial procedures with consequences for the expert assessment and testimony. First, a shortened procedure applies to crimes punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to nine years (779 LECrim). Here, one single expert is required to issue a written expert's report (793.5 LECrim). Second, the regular trial procedure, applicable to crimes punishable by imprisonment of nine or more years, includes an additional oral examination by the experts during the trial (724 LECrim). Third, a Jury Tribunal (usually mandatory in ca ses of homicide, threats or forest fires and comprising a total of nine randomly selected citizens ) is entitled to submit written questions to the experts (1.2 LTJ). The Fiscal1 as well as the defence or the plaintiff are allowed to forward questions to the experts (46.1 5 LTJ). An expert report is never binding, but any verdic t or sentence is supposed to be appropriate (120.3 CE), should be based on proven facts (248.3 LOPJ , 142.2\u00aa LECrim and 52.1.to LTJ) and reflect conditions or circumstances that might modify or diminish the cr iminal responsibility of the person concerned (142.4\u00aa. Third LECrim and 52.1.B LTJ). Generally, during the time of the trial the def endant assumed to be mentally ill remains in the penitentiary centre closest to the to wn where the trial takes place. The verdict can consider the lack of criminal responsibility or extenuating circumstances. It also may occur that only after a sentence had been impos ed, is a serious mental disorder of a defendant detected. This is us ually termed \"happened insanity\". To exempt an individual from criminal responsibilit y requires the presence of at least one of three major causes: an anomaly or alteration of mind that prevents the individual from understanding the illicitness of an action or from acting acco rding to this understanding. This includes transitory mental states unless it was caus ed purposely for the commission of a crime or the subject should have been able to fores ee the criminal action (20.1\u00ba PC); the syndrome of abstinence pr eventing the individual from understanding the illicitness of an action or from acting according to this understanding; or full intoxication due to the 1 Within the Spanish legal sy stem, the Fiscal or \"Public Mini stry\" acts as the public and o fficial advocate before the judge and, eventually , before the Court if his/her assessment does not agree w ith the judge. It is more or less equivalent to Public prosecutor (England), Government atto rney (USA) or \"Staatsanw alt\" (Germany ). Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Sp ain 209 intake of alcohol, toxic drugs, narcotics, psychot ropic substances or the like, in case it had not been taken with the purpose of offending (20.2\u00ba PC); alterations in perception from birth or childhood that gravely alter the person's awareness of reality (20.3\u00ba PC). A diminished criminal responsibility due to these c auses can be decided (20.1\u00ba. 2\u00ba 3\u00ba PC) when not all requirements are met to exempt one fully from re sponsibility (21.1\u00aa PC). This is also possible in cases in which the person concerned suffers fr om severe addiction and acted under the influence of substances mentioned in code 20.3\u00ba PC (21.2\u00aa PC). When a delinquent who had been assessed as fully criminally responsible and been sentenced under that assumption is diagnosed with a mental disorder during imprisonment, he will be cared for by either the health care se rvices of the respective penitent iary or, in cases in which the condition is considered transitory, by the general health care services. Whenever the disorder seems to be serious and probably enduring, the prisoner will be subjected to observation, and the director of the Penitentiary Centre will include a physician for examination (991 LECrim). If a mental illness is confirmed, the nature and severity of the disorder will be reported to the tribunal that has issued the verdict (992 LECrim). After a hearing including the Fiscal, the prosecutor, and the defence of the prison inmate, an official investigation on the facts will be opened (993 LECrim ) which usually is closed by a judgement (994 LECrim). In the case of a judicially confirmed severe and enduring mental disorder , the execution of the sentence will be suspended and medical care will be guaranteed (60.1 PC), which means the order of secure placement in a Penitentia ry Centre or in a Psychiatric Penitentiary Unit (184.C PC). After recovery, the remaining sentence has to be serv ed, unless the judge or tribunal order a reduction or a remission (60.2 PC). Measure of Psychiatric Penitentiary Placement Mentally ill offenders whose criminal respons ibility has been declared lacking can be placed under security arrangements, which could differ according to the cause: Persons whose criminal responsibility was dec lared fully lacking according to code 20.1\u00ba PC can be detained in \"a facility adapted to t he confirmed type of anomaly or psychological disorder\". This placement can not exceed the period an imprisonment would have lasted, when the person concerned would have been declar ed responsible for the act (101.1 PC). Persons whose criminal responsibility was dec lared fully lacking according to code 20.2\u00ba PC can be detained in a \"public specialised c entre for drug-addiction treatment, or in a private centre, if it is proper ly accredited\" (102.1 PC). Persons whose criminal responsibility was dec lared fully lacking according to code 20.3\u00ba PC can be detained in a \"special educ ational centre\" (103.1 PC). In all cases, any termination of the placement, disc harge, transfer or leave of the facility is subject to authorisation by the responsible judge or tribunal (101.2, 102.2 103.2 PC). Since the \"Psychiatric Penitentiary Units\" have not ye t been implemented, the only availabl e facilities are the Psychiatric Penitentiary Hospitals of Alic ante and Seville and a new one recently opened in Catalonia, which is privately managed, but contracted for and supervised by the Catalan government. For mentally ill offenders whose criminal re sponsibility has been declared as being diminished according to article 21.1\u00aa or 2\u00aa PC, the judge or tribunal could impose in addition to a deprivation of freedom a (forensic) placement according to arts. 101 to 102 PC. In that case, the duration of the placement could not exceed the period of prison punishment (104 PC) and the length of placement counts towards the imprisonment (99 PC). In the case of a good outcome of a finalised forensic placement, remaining imprisonment might be suspended (99 PC). The Spanish penitentiary system has not developed its own specif ic educational or treatment centres for drug-addicts referred to in the arts . 102.1 103.1 PC. Only Psychiatric Penitentiary Hospitals are available. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Sp ain 210 As soon as a subject is admitted to a Psychiatric Penitentiary Hospital under a measure of security, the physician in charge later decides on the basis of his own preliminary evaluation and available reports, whether the person conc erned has to be treated and classified further (186.1 RP 1996). A Multidisciplinary Team (EM) of psychiatrists, psychologists, general physicians, nurses and social workers will be assigned (185.1 RP 1996), forwarding to the judicial authority an initial report on the diagnosis, developmental process, prognosis and r ehabilitation programs. The report will also assess the necessity of prolonging, terminating or substituting the measure of forensic placement, and will propose a transfer to other facilities or addi tional specialised measures, in case they are pertinent (186.2 RP 1996). The EMs review the personal situation of each patient and write a report on the mental state and development of the person concerned at least every six months. T he reports are forwarded to the Tribunal of Penitentiary Supervision and to the Fiscal (187 RP 1996). On the basis of the reports from the treating prof essionals or from other appropriate sources, this Tribunal or the Judge of Penitent iary Supervision is eligible to propose a modification of the placement measure to the judge or tribunal that issued the sentence or ordered the measure (98 PC). In view of this proposal, the judge or tribunal that set up the sentence is able to (97 PC): a) order the termination of the measure due to no longer enduring threat by the patient; b) order a more appropriate measure. This in cludes measures without deprivation of freedom, which can not be imposed for periods longer than five years, as - outpatient treatment in medi cal or psychosocial centres, - restriction of residence to a certain place, - prohibition of taking residence in designated places or territories, - prohibition of visiting certain places, lic ensed bars or other establishments serving or selling alcoholic drinks, - family custody or participation in formative or educational programs; c) suspend the execution of the security measure for the rema inder of the sentence. This suspension remains conditional pending any re -offending during the fixed term or a prognosis of new crimes (95.1 PC). Annually, the Judge of Supervision proposes the maintenance, termination, substitution or suspension of the security m easure of deprivation of freedom. Aftercare For persons discharged from forensic placemen t, general health care resources are available which are provided by the 17 Autonomous Regions in Spain. Usually ps ychiatric departments at general hospitals will offer treatment when readmissi on to psychiatric inpatient care is necessary (20.2 LGS). Practice Some psychiatric associations are questioning t he current institutional model for mentally ill offenders, suggesting instead the suppression of the specialised penitentiary centres and integration of the patients into the general health care system. It has been criticised that the closur e of psychiatric hospitals with half- and long-stay units has been at the expense of transferring many patients into psychiatric penit entiary centres. The lack of specialised centres for addiction disorders and m ental retardation poses additional disadvantages. Patients suffering from these disorders are pl aced in the general prison system (when a prison sentence has been ordered) or in psychiatric penit entiary centres (when a placement measure has been ordered and an additional mental illness has been confirmed). Psychiatric penitentiary centres are completely lacking in specific treatm ent programs for sex offenders. Such programs are available only at general prisons. The three psychiatric penitentiary facilities which are currently implemented differ considerably. The service in Alicante (340 beds) provides severa l modules, an acute unit and an infirmary. It has large sport facilities available and offers cultur al and outdoor activities. The Seville psychiatric penitentiary (150 beds) developed from an infirmary ward within a high-security prison which Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Sp ain 211 eventually was transformed into a psychiatric hospita l still located inside the high-security centre. It lacks appropriate conditions for inmates. One of the greatest problems concerns the cont inuation of care following finalisation of the originally ordered placement measure. General hos pital services are often reluctant to admit persons whose state requires ongoing hospital treatment. Leaves during placement measures are hardly regulated, thus making room for sometimes arbitrary decisions by the jurisdictional organs. With some modifications (e.g., the provision of multidisciplinary teams), psychiatric penitentiary facilities are more or less organised along the lines of the general prison centres. However, it is astonishing that no direction of the Spanish psychiatric penitentiary centres includes psychiatrists. Patient's Rights The general statutes applicable to any ill person in Spain are also in force for patients admitted to psychiatric penitentiary facilities. This incl udes especially law 41/2002 from November 14, 2002 (basic regulation of autonomy of the patient and of rights and obligat ions as regards information and clinical documentation) and law 14/1986 from April 25, 1986 (General Sanity). Informed consent is guaranteed in consequence (8.1 LD P and 210.1 RP 1996), excluding those cases bearing a public health risk (9.2.to LDP and 210.2 RP 1996) or immediate severe danger for the physical or mental integrity of the person concerned (9.2.B LDP and 210.1 RP 1996). In both cases, the judicial authority will be informed (210. 1 2 RP 1996). Similarly, the confidentiality of clinical information and data is guaranteed (10.3 LGS and 215.1 RP 1996). The same health care as that provided to the general population is also guaranteed (208 RP 1996). During a placement measure the penitentiary legislation rec ognizes the following rights in particular: The personality of confined persons will be respected and their rights and legitimate interests will not be affected by the pl acement measure (3 LOGP and 10.1 LGS). The patients may make use of their civil, po litical, social, economic and cultural rights, unless these are incompatible with security measures (3.1 LOGP). Restrictions may only be executed when necessary for t he state of health or the su ccess of treatment (188.2 RP 1996). The penitentiary administration is supposed to l ook after the life, integrity and health of the confined (3.4 LOGP). Coercive means are to be applied only as a measure of last resort and only when medically indicated and for a minimum indis pensable length of time. The dignity of the person has to be respected in any event. The judicial authority has to approve the application (188.3 RP 1996). General disciplinary regimes of penitentia ries are not to be applied (188.4 RP 1996). The patients have the right to forward complaints or petitions to the Judge of Penitentiary Supervision (72.2.G LOGP), who regularly visits the respective facilities (76.2.H LOGP). In practice, these visits take place weekly. Public Opinion and Mass Media Public opinion in Spain exhibits an ambivalent feeling towards offences committed by mentally ill persons. Immediately after spectacular crimes, usually positions of a not always well-founded rejection or for stiffer punishments are expressed. More compassionate feelings may arise later on, increasing with the passage of time. As in most countries, the Spanish media pay gr eat attention to serious offences committed by mentally ill persons (especially cases of homicide and arson). Usually, their attention lasts from the time the criminal acts were committed unt il the judgement. Once they have been judged, only punctual references might be made to particular cases. Periodically broadcasted reports on crimes by ment ally ill persons (e.g., on Spanish serial killers) usually generate a special impact, although the bi ographical reconstruction of the respective mentally ill offender's personality might be highly sele ctive. Media access to penitentiary centres for these purposes is generally restricted.

Nine million inhabitants populate a surface of 450,000 square kilometres. Given its surface, it is s parsely populated with 20 inhabitants per square kilometre. The distanc e between the northernmost and the southernmost point in Sweden is 1,600 kilometres. The opening paragraph of the Swedish Health Care Ac t states that the co mmunity should provide high quality care on equal terms in co-operation with the patients and their families. This is in line with one of the major goals for the welfare state: to build a good soci ety for all, and for the care of the exposed groups. A basic social standard (su fficient daily food, clothing and housing) is considered a fundamental right, ensured by the social welfare authorities. A major goal of Swedish mental health care policy is to meet the needs of the mentally ill in a de- institutionalised community setting, where they can be integrated and obtain a larger degree of autonomy and a higher quality of life. In Sweden, forens ic psychiatry is a s peciality of its own. Each of the 21 county councils is responsible fo r providing the total psychiatric care, including forensic psychiatry. Six regional forensic hospitals are responsible for the treatment of the most dangerous of those sentenced to fo rensic psychiatric care, which correspond to about one third of all forensic patients. Another third is treated in hospitals at the county level (several sectors go together) and the remaining one third in general hospitals. Structure of the Legal System In the Penal Code of 1965, the concept of a ccountability was abandoned and the concept of mental illness and thus comparable mental abnormality in troduced. The mentally ill became responsible for their acts and psychiatric care became a sanction as opposed to the mentally ill not being accountable and thus free from sanction. After more than 20 years of debate about the treat ment and care of mentally ill offenders, the previously unitary coercive legisl ation on psychiatric care in 1992 was divided into two Acts that are separate from the Penal Code and from the gener al Health Care Act. The Acts are: the Compulsory Psychiatric Act and the Forensic Psychiatric Act. The distinction implied notable changes with regar d to mentally disturbed offenders. The legal concept of \"mental illness and thereby compar able mental abnormality\" was changed to \"severe mental disorder\". The purpose of the new legislation was to strengthen the legal safeguar ds for the patients, to restrict the use of compulsory care and coercive measures, and to improve safeguards for next-of-kin and the community. Another aim was to expand opportunities for detai nees, persons remanded in custody, or for prison inmates to obtain psychiatric care on a vo luntary basis in medical institutions. The forensic Psychiatric Care Act applies to the following categories of patients: those committed to forensic psychiatric care by a court of law, those who need forensic psychiatric care while detained or remanded in custody, Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Swed en 216 those who come from the prison and probat ion sector and are in need of forensic psychiatric care, and those who are remanded in custody and undergo for ensic psychiatric examination by court order. The laws were continuously evaluated during the 1990s. The length of the period for leave was not reduced as expected so that in 2001, some minor changes were made to the Act and the regulations concerning leaves for fo rensic patients were tightened. Offenders with Severe Mental Disorders According to the Penal Code, (Chap. 30, Section 6) nobody should be sent to prison if he due to a severe mental disorder has committed a crime. \"S evere mental disorder\" is a legal concept and is defined in the general recommendations to the Psychi atric and Forensic Acts that are issued by the National Board of Health and Welfar e. \"Severe mental disorder\" acco rding to the Section 4 of the Forensic Care Act should include mainly psychosis , but also severe personality disorders with psychotic outbreaks, as well as depression with a risk to commit suicide. In certain cases pyromania, kleptomania and sexual pervers ions can be included in the concept. Pre-charge Medical Assessments A person who has committed a crime under the influenc e of a severe mental disorder can not be sent to prison. If the person who shall be sentenced is in need of psychiatric care, instead of sending the person to prison, the c ourt can sentence him to forensic care. Before such a decision is taken, the court is obliged to have the pers on medically assessed. This can be done either by means of a major or by means of a minor forensic investigation. The court then sends the documents of the case to the unit in charge of the assessment. In a minor investigation, the physician looks through the documents and makes his assessment after examination of and an interview with the suspected person. The assessment is presented to the court in a so-called \u00a7 7-certificate. In a major forensic investigation, a team consis ting of a forensic psychi atrist, a psychologist, a social worker and nursing staff participates in t he assessment. The physician is responsible for the final document. The assessment must be terminated within four weeks. If the suspected individual is not under arrest, the time limit can be up to six weeks and the suspected person may in that case be in his home or in another hospital or nur sing home and come to the team for examination and tests. The National Board of Forensic Medicine is responsible for the forensic investigations. Sanctions According to Chap 30, Section 6 of the Penal Code, a person who has committed a crime under the influence of a severe mental disorder may not be sentenced to prison. According to Chap. 31, Section 3, a person w ho has committed a crime under the influence of a severe mental disorder may be sentenced to for ensic mental care with an order for special assessment for discharge if there is any risk, on account of the mental disorder which occasioned the order for special assessment for discharge, of a patient's relapsing into criminal behaviour of a serious nature. A patient can only be released or have permission after a trial in a county administrative court If there is no such risk, a patient may be sentenced to forensic care without special assessment for discharge. Since 1991 approx. 80% of the patient s cared for require a special assessment. Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Swed en 217 Fig. 39 Conditions for Sentencing to \"Forensi c Mental Care w ith an Order for Special Assessment for Discharge\" in Sw eden (Kullgren, 1996 ) A t the time of A t the time of Sentence th e crimin al act o f the assessmen t Prison prohibition Prison prohibition Forensic mental care possible* Forensic mental care possible *If risk of relaps e into severe criminality Yes Yes No No Yes Yes Severe mental disorder Care Medical institutions authorised by the government to provide fo rensic psychiatric care for detainees, persons remanded in custody and pris oners can be engaged for the care of patients who wish to receive voluntary psychiatric care but who for security reasons cannot be treated in general psychiatric practice. Six regional clin ics (\"maximum security \") throughout the country provide care to one third of the forensic patients. The remainder are cared for in general psychiatric clinics. The decision to sentence a person to care or to pr ison is taken by the cour t. If a care sentence is handed down, a message is sent to the senior c onsultant in the area where the offender is registered and he then decides in what kind of institution the offender shall receive his care and the degree of security needed. The offender is therefore admitted to a psychiatric or forensic facility depending on the degree of illness and dangerousness. T he senior consultant can decide about leaves and release without being obliged to consult t he court if the sentence is to forensic care without special assessment for discharge. If the s entence is to forensic care with an order for special assessment for discharge, the county admin istrative court has to decide on both leaves and releases. The opinion of the prosecutor should al so be obtained before the leave or release can be put into effec t. When the court commits a patient to forensic ca re with a special pre-discharge assessment, the prosecutor is entitled to make a representati on when either a leave or release is planned. The treatment of sex offenders consists of psychot herapy and anti-hormonal ther apy. The treatment of drug abuse is dependent of the nature of the abuse. The court supervises the use of forensic care by means of a system of fixed-term committal so that at least every six months an assessment has to be made as to whether or not the care shall continue. The care is also supervised by the National Board of Health and Welfare. Problems w ith the Current Sy stem - Care Issues There is an ethical conflict built into the care system. This is mainly due to the difficulties in satisfying the need to provide effective care for t he mentally ill offender. M any of the patients have Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Swed en 218 a dual diagnosis problem which is difficult to trea t, especially if it is combined with a personality disorder. With the system of special review of remission, t he patient can be retained in custodial care despite the fact that such care is not needed for medical r easons. This is another sour ce of ethical conflict. There is a risk that continued forensic care will ev olve into a form of hospitalisation for purposes other than treatment. Some of the persons in forensic psychiatric ca re have been sentenced for minor criminality. Some of them have been cared for over very long periods and at great expense. It can be questioned whether this level of care is appropriate for the purpose. In penal institutions there are inmates with ment al health problems. However, the capacity of the prison and probation service to provide care is limited. It is also difficult to satisfy their need for care within the public health care service. The aftercare, regardless of whether the person has been cared for in a penal or in a medical institution, is almost nonexistent, partly due to a lack of motivation by the patient and partly to relapse into drug abuse. There are great difficultie s to attract and to maintain competence for the care. Criminal Law Issues If someone has committed a crime under the influence of a severe mental disorder, the sanction of imprisonment may not be imposed as mentioned above. Bu t, if at the time of the judgement there is no longer any severe mental disorder present, the sanction can not be determined to be forensic psychiatric care. In this situation it can be di fficult to find a suitable and sufficiently intervening sanction, especially if a severe crime has been committed. If, for example, a murder has been committed, it is unsatisfactory that the only sanc tion that may come into question is a conditional sentence or probation. With the current prohibition of imprisonment, a m entally disordered person is excluded from certain sanctions or forms of enforcement, i.e., conditi onal sentences or probation in combination with community service, probation with so-called cont ract care or submission to monitoring with electronic controls. Thus the curr ent system can result in a more severe penalty being dealt to a mentally ill offender than to other offenders, becaus e a mentally ill offender is excluded from some of the less intervening forms of enforcement. Public Protection Issues If an offender has been found guilty by the court and t he sanction determined is forensic psychiatric care, this can be combined with a special review of remission to satisfy the need for public protection. A person who has committed a severe crime and has been sentenced to forensic psychiatric care, may, after a short period of inpatient care, be declared healthy and discharged out into society. From the point of view of public protection, th is can be unsatisfactory. Several evaluations have shown that that the lengths of st ay for care for offences of a le ss serious nature are longer than the lengths of stay in prison for the corresponding offence. Instead, the lengths of stay for more serious crimes are longer in case of imprisonment. Patients' Rights Patients' rights are guaranteed by t he laws, independent of the step of the process the individual is currently in. Some of the most important rights are: Concepts an d Procedures in the Memb er States - Swed en 219 the right to information concerning compulso ry care and its implications, particularly regarding the measures of restraint, medi cation and other measures taken against the consent of the patient, the right to communicate with the exterior, which cannot be restricted for medical reasons, the right to take an active part in the treatment plan, the right to a supportive person whose duty it is to assist the patient in court sessions or otherwise help him with matters concerning compulsory care, and the right to appeal against orders concerning the care. The patient has no right to refuse treatm ent, but his opinion shall be considered. Ethics In Sweden a person can be sentenced to forensic care even if in some special cases there is no effective medical treatment to offer. For a judicial community this is unsat isfactory. If a person is sentenced to care there are no means for him to re fuse treatment. It is considered unethical to offer care without offering treatment. A person sentenced to forensic care with an order for special assessment for discharge can not be released until there is no longer any risk, on account of the mental disorder which occasioned the order for special assessment for discharge, of a rel apse into criminal behaviour of a serious nature. The patient can only be released or have permission after a trial in a county administrative court. This means that a person has to stay in compul sory care even if his tr eatment has been successful in the sense that he no longer has a severe mental disorder.

We have no idea of the extent of w hat should have been - but has not been - reported. There is no spec ific network for the exchange of data. Public Opinion and Mass Media There are daily discussions in the mass media conc erning aspects of mental illness. The focus is generally on the negative aspects of the care or living conditions. As soon as a serious and violent crime has been committed, the mass-media proclaim t hat \"it must be a mentally ill person\" or \"the care has collapsed\". When after investigation it then turns out that the offender was not mentally ill, the media stay silent. One of the problems this gives rise to is a stigma tisation of the group of mentally ill as such. It is difficult to explain to the media that most of t he mentally ill are not violent. The media do a lot to create negative \"myths\" regarding the care of the mentally ill. In Sweden the care of the long-term mentally ill underwent a legal reform in 1995. To date the media have mostly reported on the \"failure\" of the reform, not taking into account all it s positive effects. Examples of some of the myths created include: \"It is better for patients to stay in mental hospitals than to be out in the society.\" \"The number of suicides has increased due to the reform.\" \"There is more deadly violence due to the reform.\" \"More people are homeless due to the reform.\" This became very evident following the murder of the Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh in 2003. The mental health care system was heavily blamed for not having been able to prevent a crime of this dimension. The court has not found the offender to have a severe mental disorder and has thus sentenced him to prison. Need for a New Reform As mentioned above, the current system has several shortcomings. A new reform is planned whose aim it is to establish a system whereby l egal offenders with severe mental disorders who are criminally legally liable can be sentenced to a s anction that satisfies both their need for care and the public need for a safeguard. In other words, the time spent in the mental health care system should not be any longer than what is justifiable to provide the care needed.

This chapter summarises, in a descriptive manner, the major findings of this report, as detailed in the results section. The main focus of the report and of this summary is on the availability of basic information or data, and on identifying common patterns and approaches in legal frameworks, gen- eral policies and routine practice across the Member States. Such patterns, as well as major short- comings or advantages of national policies, are described wherever the information gathered for this study allows it. Thus, this chapt er may be used as an executive summary. Overall, the shortage of evidence in this much debated field is surprising, given the high level of public awareness and the wide mass-media coverage of the issue. The shortage of evidence may be compounded by methodological obstacles in anal ysing the complicated structures and varied systems for regulating forensic cases in the di verse legal and health care systems of the European Union Member States. The judicial, health and crim e reporting systems of t he Member States have currently not sufficiently incorporated forensic i ndicators into their routine practice. Standardised European indicators are completely absent. Neverthel ess, cross-national research in this field would seem to merit encouragement and stimulation. The issue seems to suffer from its position at the interface of criminology, jurisprudence and psy- chiatry, all of which are closely interconnected fi elds. However, these disciplines have not yet de- veloped common methods of assessing and analysing the various aspects of, and problems in the field, in a multidimensional approach. So this study breaks new ground by including fifteen countries in structured overviews of legal and care procedures for mentally disordered offender s. This has not been attempted before in a com- prehensive manner. Despite the considerable methodol ogical and definitional problems, this study has succeeded in providing many standardised co mparisons and follow-up data that have never before been published. Legal Framew orks & Key Concepts Forensic legislation in the Member States is not incorporated into a single, specific code, but is contained in a variety of codes, laws or acts regulating the multifold aspects of forensic cases. Fo- rensic legal provisions may be spread among penal c odes or in health or mental health laws. The distribution follows no clear pattern, thus not allo wing conclusions to be drawn as to whether Mem- ber States place more stress on medical or punitive considerations in the judicial handling of foren- sic cases. In most Member States, these laws are relative ly new or were revised during the last decade. Forensic regulations are subjec t to constant change, a process which is additionally influenced by continuing developments and advances in forensic psychiatric treatment. On the one hand, such change contributes to the complexity of the problem, but on the other it offers opportunities for the revision, improvement or harmoni sation of legal frameworks. Summar y and Conclusions 226 Mental disorders The basic terminologies for addressing the mental state of mentally di sordered offenders vary widely in the laws of the Member States. Most terms as used in codes or acts are non-specific, descriptive in nature and to a large extend outdated. The legal terms have little relation to medical concepts or to modern international classification systems for mental disorders (e.g., DSM-IV or ICD-10). This vague terminology makes it hard to draw conclusions as to which mental states are specifically covered by or excluded from forensic legislation. It embr aces all kinds of mental disor- der and is open to broad interpretation. It does not further the equal treatment of those concerned within or across the Member States. However, routine practices in the majority of t he Member States show a common pattern, at least in including within the scope of the relevant legisl ation the major mental disorders such as schizo- phrenia (most often termed \"psychot ic state\"), affective disorder s and organic mental disorders, although arrangements for trial procedures and post-trial placements may differ. However, there is extreme variation as regards the inclusion or exclusion of addiction disorders, personality disorders or paraphilias. For instance, fo rensic legislation in the Netherlands makes it possible to impose TBS-detention orders on offenders who are partly criminally responsible. This results in a particular focus on offenders with personality disorders, whereas England & Wales considers them as eligible for forensic treatm ent only in cases where the condition is judged to be treatable. The laws in most of the remaining Mem ber States do not clarify to what extent personal- ity disorders are included or not. Even more variable is the handling of alcohol-relat ed disorders. The wide r ange of mental states connected to these syndromes - from simple into xicated states to severe addiction or even psy- chotic states - prevents the el ucidation of common approaches or typical judicial procedures for offences committed under the influence of alcohol. With the absence of legally-defined guidelines, the consideration of individual circumstances may influence legal outcome in alcohol-related cases,. This may result in rather varied court rulings, even where the mental states or offences committed may be similar. Only a small minority of Member States (e.g., Germ any, Austria) provide specific codes for alcohol- related cases. The shortage of specific services for addicted offender s in most Member States may be a consequence of this. Differing cultural attit udes towards alcohol consumption may complicate the case further. In short, vague definitions or terminologies mean that the basic forensic laws of the Member States do not qualify as guidelines for decision making in routine practice (e.g., assessment procedures during pre-trial or trial stages). The variable or non-specific inclusion of alcohol-re lated, addiction or personality disorders marks a clear shortcoming in the forensic legislation of the Member States and prevents the harmonisation of legal frameworks or routine practice s within or across the Member States. Criminal responsibility The forensic legislation of a Member State ma y be categorised according to the legal tradition which that Member State has adopted. The majori ty of the Member Stat es whose systems have developed out of a Roman law tradition apply the concept of criminal responsibility as a basic judi- cial and philosophical framework for assessing and deciding on the cases of mentally disordered offenders (see table 59). Assessing criminal responsibility in a suspect or defendant requires an extens ive evaluation of the motives for committing the offence and the offender's state of volition or ability to act of his own free will. Where a suspect's res ponsibility is considered to be dimi nished or absent due to a mental disorder and where he additionally presents a public threat, Member States applying this approach would usually order defendants into forensic ca re. Additional prison terms may applied, depending on a variety of specific conditions. Member States whose legal frameworks are rooted in the Common Law tradition (England & Wales, Ireland and to a certain extent some Sc andinavian countries whic h have included features Summar y and Conclusions 227 from both legal traditions) do not apply the concept of criminal responsibility and follow a more pragmatic approach instead. For instance the criteria for the hospital disposal of a mentally disordered offender in England & Wales can be seen as almost wholly medical in nature. For most people put on such an order, their position becomes almost exactly the same as if t hey were a civilly-detained patient. The patient in effect passes out of the penal syst em and into the hospital system. The courts retain no powers of any kind. Discharge is determined principally by medical outcome. However, patients may be de- tained in low, medium und high security hospita ls, according to the danger they may represent. A potential disadvantage of this approach (which is reported for instance from Sweden) is the lack of relation of treatment to severity of offence. As a consequence, patients could be kept in hospital for longer periods than they would have served in prison; or on the other hand, patients might be discharged from hospital after a short stay, alt hough they may have committed serious offences. Although the concept of criminal responsibility ma y determine different pathways to forensic deten- tion, all Member States generally separate ment ally ill offenders from mentally non-disturbed of- fenders and from non-offending psychiat ric patients, according to t he individual needs for treatment and the level of dangerousness, no matter whether the concept of criminal responsibility is applied or not. So it may be that the application of the concept of criminal responsibility serves as a distinguishing criterion in theory only, and that it has less relev ance to characterising the Member States' policies at the level of routine practice. Pre-Trial & Trial Procedures Placement options during the pre-trial phase are so mewhat similar in the Member States. When a suspect is thought mentally ill before trial, placement in a general psychiatric facility is possible in twelve Member States, the exceptions being Belgium, Luxembourg and Portugal. All Member States other than Belgium provide for placements in a specia lised forensic facility before a trial has started. In eleven Member Stat es, a mentally ill suspect may also be placed in a remand prison, the exceptions being England & Wales, Ireland, Portugal and Sweden. In the case of minor offences, suspects can also be bailed to their home address for outpatient treatment in nearly all Member States. The maximum length of pre-trial placement is specified by law in only five Member States, this ranging from a legally- defined maximum of 28 days in Ireland up to twelve months in Germany or Portugal. Considering the mental health care provision in prisons, which in most Member States fails to reach the standards of general psyc hiatry, many mentally disordered suspects may be worse off when placed in prison during pre-trial stages, co mpared to non-disturbed defendants. This problem might be compounded by the absence of a limit on t he duration for pre-trial placements in a strik- ing number of Member States. A similarly controversial question in forensic psychiatry concerns the sequence of forensic place- ment or treatment orders and prison sentence in ca ses where both are imposed. In Member States which do not categorically exempt mentally disordered persons from prison placement, the se- quence is legally regulated only in seven (Austria , Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Por- tugal and Spain). In all others states where joint disposals can be imposed, the sequence is determined in each individual case at sentence. This might be considered problematic from a securi ty point of view. On the other hand, there are strong medical arguments for flexible individual r egulations which allow the length of forensic placement to be adapted to the actual needs of the person concerned. A satisfactory solution to this tension is currently not in sight. If both psychiatric treatment and a prison sentence are imposed on the mentally ill offender, several Member States provide for the opt ion of counting the duration of ps ychiatric treatment towards the period of the sentence. It is variable, however, how much of the time spent in treatment can be counted towards the time to be served in prison. There is no consistency across the 15 Member States in this regard. Summar y and Conclusions 228 It remains debatable to what extent individual regulat ions get the right balance in terms of the basic right for equal treatment. However, flexible pr ocedures may again be useful in cases where the prognosis is poor or a reoffending likely, enabling longer periods of detention both from a medical and from a public safety point of view. In all Member States, court tria ls of mentally disordered offenders do not differ appreciably from those against mentally non-disturbed suspects, as far as basic right s or major constitutional fea- tures are concerned. There are no special courts or distinct procedures likely to weaken the legal status of persons concerned, to threaten human ri ghts or to evade major constitutional principles. Assessment The forensic psychiatric assessment is considered a crucial element in the judicial process, point- ing the way for all subsequent decisions on the sent ence, detention, placement or treatment of the person concerned. Role and tasks of the assessing expert It is the basic task of an expert in charge of a forensic assessment to examine and describe the overall medical condition and the mental state of a suspect or defendant. More than two-thirds of the Member States legally require a psychiatrist a ssess the mental state of a suspect assumed to be mentally ill. In Member States lacking a legal regulation in this regard, psychiatrists are also usually responsible for c onducting forensic assessments in routine practice. An inclusion of more than one expert may increas e the quality of an assessment. This is most flexibly regulated in Sweden by distinguishing a so -called \"minor forensic assessment\", which does not even require the participation of a psychiatrist, from a \"maj or forensic assessment\" conducted by a team of psychiatrists, psyc hologists, social workers and nurses. This obligatory contribution of four experts from different professional backgr ound is unique in the Member States, of which only one-third legally define the number of specialis ts participating in a forensic assessment. Commonly, a forensic assessment may be extended by the inclusion of a consideration of addi- tional medico-legal issues, principally the ability to control one's actions, the capacity for insight, level of dangerousness and the likelihood of re-offendi ng. The examination of these aspects, which is common practice in all Member States exc ept Denmark and England & Wales, tends to extend the role of the psychiatrist beyond his or her medical expertise in diagnosis and treatment. Never- theless, legal regulations in most Member States expect psychiatri sts or medical experts to report on medico-legal issues . Thus, assessments of the medico-l egal state of a defendant may be subject to much greater varia- tion than is the case when simply reaching a diagnos is for the underlying mental disorder, a proc- ess aided by well-established and internationally acknowledged structured procedures and scales. In at least two-thirds of Mem ber States, the assessing expert is expected in addition to reach a conclusion as to how far an offence might have been influenced by or committed as a direct con- sequence of a mental illness, although there is scant overall evidence as to the nature of such a relationship and there are no defined criteria for asse ssing to what extent a mental disorder might be connected to offending behaviour. Although a variation of strategies has emerged in rout ine practice to deal with this dilemma, it is unknown, whether the much clearer medical approach by Denmark and England & Wales (whose regulations do not require evidence for a connec tion between offending and mental disorder but specify a hospital order in lieu of any other puni shment if a defendant is mentally ill and found guilty of a criminal offence), simplifies the judici al procedures or yields better outcomes. It would be worthwhile to examine whether the court' s surrender of all power over a case as in Eng- land & Wales has any influence on security issues or standards. However, the variability of what might be considered as outcome data across the Member States prevent s any comparative analy- ses at present. Summar y and Conclusions 229 Selection and training of experts for assessment Different qualifications, professional training, experience and specific skills may all influence the assessment procedure and its outcome. Thus, the authority to appoint the expert and the associ- ated selection criteria play an important role. It is the court which is authorised to select and appoint the assessing expert in more than two-thirds of Member States. Only in Finland, Portugal and Sweden is this the responsibility of other national agencies or authorities. Only in Denmark and England & Wales is the choice of expert determi ned by the defendant's home address, similar to the common position in general psychiatry, and th is may indicate a more community-oriented ap- proach.. There is no question that the quality of an asse ssment - and the far reaching consequences - vary with the experience of the assessing person and the quality of his training. Professional training in forensic psychiatry is incorpor ated into the university curricula or medical schools of several Mem- ber States, but intensity and standards are highly va riable. The most elaborated forensic training is offered in Finland (six years subsequent to gener al psychiatric training) and England & Wales (three years after a three year education in general psychiatry). Germany is about to introduce an additional three-year forensic training c ourse into the psychiatric curriculum. Overall, experts from most Member States partici pating in this study complained of insufficient or absent quality standards in forens ic psychiatry and were of the view that quality standards needed to be defined, standardised and formally implemented. Reassessment and Discharge Procedures Most mental disorders are characterised by rather variable courses, requiring regular re- assessment of the mental state in general mental health care, but even more so in forensic cases, where fundamental restrictions on personal liber ty may be connected to a worsened or improved state of health. Consequently, it is of major importance to underst and how detailed national forensic laws regulate psychiatric re-assessment during forensic detentions, as well as t heir time-frames, comprehensive- ness and scope or other crucial conditions. Time frames for reassessment of the mental state Regulations regarding time frames for reasse ssment are strikingly variable across the European Union, ranging from every six months to annually or bi-annually and up to every five or six years. In most Member States, the reassessment of t he mental state of a detained person is the responsibility of the treating psychi atrist, thus allowing the closes t knowledge of treatment progress and the broadest background of information to be inco rporated into the evaluation of the mental state or the prediction of future progress . However, one disadvantage might be t hat security considerations c ould be given less consideration in a close doctor-patient relationship. To entru st third parties (independent psychiatrists or other experts) with the responsibility for re-assessing the m ental state of forensic patients might diminish such a risk, as is practiced to varying degrees in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Lux- embourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. Discharge from/termination of a forensic placement Overall, conditions or criteria for the terminati on of forensic placements seem to be much less for- malised in some Member States than are the criteria for initiating placement or treatment. This is surprising when considering the difficulties in predi cting the risk of recidivi sm of persons discharged from forensic care and the increased public awareness of this crucial stage of the whole process. Moreover, in only two Member states (Austria and Germany) are discharges of forensic patients always conditional, although this could be consider ed as an appropriate and flexible means to bal- ance patient rights and interests (e.g., to the shor test possible restriction on liberty) with public safety. However, the majority of the Member States seem to favour a medical perspective, emphasising the treatment needs of the patient and safety issues as criteria in discharge decisions. One major disadvantage of this approach is its tendency to neglect equivalence. It could, for instance, con- Summar y and Conclusions 230 demn a schizophrenic patient ordered in forensic ca re because of a minor assault to detention for as long as his illness prevails. Time-frames for discharges on licence/conditional discharges differ within the Member States. Al- though there are studies suggesting diminishing recidivism-rates as a consequence of forensic treatment, the evidence on the risk of re-offending after removal of restriction orders should be increased. Future research on recalls to hospital of restricted patients may help to decide whether to put more emphasis on this legal instrument. Patients and Human Rights The issue of patients' rights and human rights in the context of m entally ill offenders is a delicate subject. It is a contentious issue in most Member States and it receives considerable public atten- tion, reinforced by spectacular cases with intens e media coverage. These tend to intensify discus- sion as to whether the needs of the patient for tr eatment and reintegration into society are suffi- ciently balanced with the need of the public for safety . It is particularly in this context that the dou- ble role of a mentally ill or disordered offender becomes evident, his being on the one hand a pa- tient in the mental health care system and on the other subject to the criminal system. Thus, forensic legislation as a whole can be c onsidered as an attempt to balance the human rights of offenders with their right to adequate treatment and with the interests of public safety. Right of appeal/right to a second opinion The most crucial right of a suspect or defendant concerns mechanisms of appeal. The overall right to appeal is granted in all Member States for ment ally disordered offenders, thus satisfying basic human rights principles. The question here is at what stages of the process appeal mechanisms are open to a mentally ill offender. The variable and complex procedures in the Member States result in multiple starting points for appeals during the various stages of the process. Whereas the right to appeal against sentence is unquestioned throughout the European Union, not all Member States consider pre-trial assessment or placement procedures as being eligible for appeal. Another crucial right during trial procedures c oncerns the defendants right to a second expert opin- ion in order to participate in, and have a certain level of control over, the assessment process and thus the long-lasting consequences that may arise. Th is right is explicitly stated in several Member States (e.g., England & Wales, the Netherlands or Sweden in case of a so-called \"major forensic assessment\") and at least addressed in the respective codes or laws in others. It is likely that Mem- ber States that do not explicitly stipulate this option by law, do in fact provide such an option in practice. However, an obstacle here might be that in these countries the government will not cover the cost of a second opinion. Defence counsel In only four Member States is the option to pr oceed with a trial without a defence counsel open to a defendant, namely in England & Wales, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. However, it should be kept in mind that in most Member States there are no special regulations regarding men- tally ill defendants. Therefore, the case of a ment ally ill defendant standing trial without a defence counsel is rare and more of a theoretical option. And, as it is the case in England & Wales, courts are cautious about letting mentally ill defendants defend t hemselves and grant this option only after psychiatric expert evidence proves the defendant's fitness to plead and capability of representing himself. Basic human rights In some of the Member States, there is special reference in national legislation to restrictions on the basic human rights of mentally ill offenders, mostly for reasons of safety. In the Netherlands, specific civil rights may be more restricted in for ensic facilities than is the case for mentally ill non- offenders, e.g. regarding communication with t he outside world or the care of children. A different picture can be seen in Austria. Here , prisoners with sentences of more than one year lose their right to vote. By contrast, mentally ill offenders found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" are Summar y and Conclusions 231 permitted to vote. However, mentally ill offenders who are criminally responsible and who receive a prison sentence plus a commitment for an indefinite period of time do not have the right to vote, even after finishing their prison sentence. Apart from the above-mentioned exception of Austria, there are no long-term restrictions on men- tally ill offenders following release from prison and/or the completion of forensic treatment in any of the Member States. Leave conditions One question which receives a lot of public and medi a attention and is frequently a topic of contro- versial discussion concerns the issue of leave condi tions for mentally ill offenders. This issue high- lights the special and sometimes contradictory nature of the forensic-psychiatric care of mentally disordered offenders. On the one hand, it has to aim at re-integrating the patient into society, which requires treatment conditions \"as normal as possi ble\" including leaves, on the other hand it must protect the public and help prevent reoffending in those concerned. Although it is such a controversial issue, leave regulations are only addressed in national legisla- tion in about one-third of all Member States, namely in Austria, Denmark (for patients with a place- ment order), England & Wales, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden. In England & Wales, for example, \"leave of absence from hospital\" is explicitly dealt with in the Mental Health Act which, in addition, contains an advisory code, which gives more specific details as to good practice in certain leave types. Howeve r, the Code does not have the force of law. The Dutch law specifically refers to unaccompanied and accompanied leave as we ll as overnight stays and group leave. In Germany, federal enforcement la ws provide for regulations which differ from Federal State to Federal State. A highly controversial issue conc erns decision-making about leave requests, since this is perceived by the general public and the media as an indicator as to what extent the need for public security is considered. In most Member States, it is the medical institution which decides on leave requests from mentally ill offenders, including various fo rms of unaccompanied leave. Naturally, the court plays a more prominent role when it comes to mo re extended forms of leave, such as over-night stay outside the premises. Treatment against a person's will A highly disputed issue concerning the rights of ment ally ill patients is that of treatment against a person's will. Treatment against a person's will is possible in twelve Member States. It has to be kept in mind that, in most Member States, the re levant regulations are laid down in the national health acts and concern both forensic and civilly committed patients, such as for example in Den- mark and in Finland. In most Member States, treatment of mentally ill offenders differs from treatment of mentally ill non- offenders suffering from the same mental disorder only in terms of security measures. Additional differences can be found in Austria and Finland w here there are specific legal conditions for instituting or terminating treatment. In Germany and the Netherlands, the treatment aims may vary. Treatment for mentally ill offenders may have as a target reduction in dangerousness or in the risk of recidivism, which may affect treatment strat egies. As reported by the experts from Belgium and France participating in this study, treatment standar ds in these countries are generally lower for mentally ill offenders than for civilly committed patients. So, with the exception of Germany and the Nether lands, there are no specific indicators to be found which reflect the dual function of forensic care for mentally ill or disordered offenders, which encompasses crime-prevention. On a judicial basis, the majority of Member States seem to take it on trust that psychiatric treat- ments will automatically diminish the risk of future offending. This is a particular medical concept which appears to be supported in some countries by good evidence, alt hough the application of well-established criminal-therapeutic approac hes seems to be rather scarce. Several experts contributing to this study declar ed standards of forensic care in many Member States to be lower than in general mental health care, although they ought to be considerably Summar y and Conclusions 232 higher in this sensitive and controversial field. Ho wever, in some members states, such as England & Wales, patients do not receive the best availabl e care until they enter the forensic system.

Service Provision All Member States use specialist forensic facilities, general mental health care services and the prison system to place and treat mentally ill or disordered persons who have committed minor or serious offences. The degree of involvement of eac h of these sectors and their individual patterns of usage differ widely throughout the EU. In addition, within each of these sectors, different Mem- ber States provide a variety of service-types which differ consi derably with regard to organisation as well as to quantity or intensity of care. In England and Wales, for example, there is no absolut e division of hospitals or wards into forensic and non-forensic, and there are no forensic hospitals within the pris on service. Local psychiatric hospitals and secure \"forensic\" hospitals treat both general and forensic patients and do so on the same wards. On the other hand, in Germany, all forensic hospitals are clearly separated from gen- eral psychiatric inpatient services. The responsibility for forensic care and even the designation of forensic facilities differs across the Member States, complicating any attempt to def ine categories for cross-national overviews or comparisons. A consistent, Europe-wide system of classification for forensic facilities based on Summar y and Conclusions 233 functional criteria would be preferable for a num ber of purposes, including research or health- reporting. Unfortunately, no such system currently exists. Facilities Specialist forensic facilities are the most co mmon type of service in which criminally non- responsible mentally ill offenders are placed and treat ed. As an overall category, this includes spe- cialist forensic hospitals, specialist forensic wards in psychiatri c hospitals or even - as a rare option - specialist forensic departments or wards within general hospitals. Although such placements are used most frequently post-trial, they may also be used for mentally ill or disordered persons who have yet to c ome to trial. All fifteen Member States included in this study pr ovided data about their forensic facilities, with respect to admission criteria, organisational features, quality of care, bed numbers and patient characteristics. There were wide variations. So me of the less populous Member States (e.g., Lux- embourg, Ireland and Austria) have one central forens ic hospital that serves the whole country and which might be supplemented by minor forensic ca re capacities in general psychiatric hospitals, whereas more populous Member States (e.g., Germany ) are characterised by a diversity of foren- sic provision Clientele and patient selection Mentally ill offenders who have committed serious offences and who are being held as criminally non-responsible (in so far as this concept is applic able in individual Member States) constitute the core clientele of forensic facilities, although there ar e some exceptions to this rule, most often for reasons of bed availability or security. A substantial proportion of Member States (Denm ark in parts, Finland, France, Ireland, England & Wales, Sweden) admit aggressive, violent or \"hi gh risk\" non-offending mentally ill individuals to forensic facilities, also. This is done most o ften under civil detention or ders, but this is not necessarily so in all cases. Amongst these count ries, Finland, in not requiring an offending history as a major criterion for admission, has adopted one of the most straight-forward approaches, taking illness-related dangerous or destructive behaviour as the major criterion for admission to forensic care. This variety of approaches for detaining and caring for violent mentally ill patients has not been examined further by international research. Thus, it is unknown whether one approach is more effective than, or superior to, others. From a theor etical point of view, it could support crime preven- tion to place and treat for aggressive or violent ment ally ill patients in forensic facilities, even when their crime record is blank. In Member States doing so, there is currently no evidence for signifi- cantly increasing forensic placements. On the other hand, a considerable rise of forensic pat ients over time could also indicate insufficient treatment arrangements in general mental health ca re for violent mentally ill, who are adequately cared for only after having committed a crime and being placed under forensic regimes. This mechanism - for which there is some indicati on at least in some Member States (e.g., Austria or Germany) - would mark an inappropriate shift of care burden from general mental health care to forens ic care. Overall forensic capacities Any valid indicator for comparing forensic care capacities across the Member States would provide a very useful tool for research or service-planni ng purposes. However, variations in definition of forensic beds and considerable, yet unknown number s of undeclared beds for mentally ill offenders in general psychiatry or the prison system are se rious methodological obstacles to calculating fo- rensic bed rates or any such indicators. Consequent ly, recent efforts for compiling sets of Euro- pean mental health indicators do not include any esti mates of forensic care capacity, although such indicators would be highly preferable and are greatly needed. So this study is the first attempt to quantify and com pare specific capacities fo r the care of mentally ill offenders across the fifteen European Union Member States included in the survey. Despite all Summar y and Conclusions 234 problems of definition and calculati on (as pointed out in the chapter \"Service Provision\"), the identi- fied estimates suggest a north-south divide within the European Union, with marked differences between similarly populous countries in Sc andinavian, Central and Southern Europe. With overall forensic bed figures varying consi derably with population size, lowest forensic bed rates (forensic beds per 100, 000 population) were found in Spain (1.4), Portugal (1.8) Italy and Ireland (2.2 each). The highest rates were detect ed in Belgium (10.3), the Netherlands (9.8) and Germany (8.6). The case of France, which is providing 0.8 specified forensic beds per 100, 000 population, may exemplify the problems in cr oss-boundary comparisons of non-standardized indi- cators, as French mentally ill offenders are most often detained under ci vil detention regimes. Thus, France tends not to label capacitie s for these persons as forensic beds. Whether low forensic capacities in South European Member States do reflect the overall mental health care standards in those countries (low numbers of hospital beds in general psychiatry, home-based care and a considerable burden on the families) remains to be analysed. Outpatient forensic facilities Although outpatient care is today an integral part of general mental health care, specialist outpa- tient care for forensic patients is underdeveloped. Follow-up may be usual in many Member States or indeed mandatory in the case of probation order s, conditional discharge or as a general after- care measure, but specialist services are usually lacking. Only Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands currently provide forens ic outpatient services as a spec ific post-trial measure. In Aus- tria these services are only for treatment during leaves, after discharge or in case of conditional criminal commitment. The Netherlands are the most well-provisioned Member State in this regard, equipping each forensic hospital (\"TBS facility\") with an outpatient unit to provide forensic outpa- tient and aftercare, in addition to such highly spec ialised services as for ensic home-treatment or forensic sheltered accommodation. In some countries, informal types of forensic outpatient care ar e implemented, when criminally non- responsible mentally ill offenders representing no public threat are cared for on a voluntary basis by community mental health services. Currently there is a debate among experts in Engl and and Wales, with some considering forensic outpatient treatment as preferabl e, whilst others see a strengthening of general psychiatry services as a more effective alternative. Similar debat es may occur among experts from other Member States. In terms of reintegrati on and rehabilitation, this is considered to be a major area for future reform of forens ic care systems. Outcome (Epidemiology ) Across the European Union, information on outcomes of legal interventions or judicial procedures against mentally ill offenders, such as prevalence or incidence, rates is scarce. Additionally, avail- able data bears numerous methodological pitfalls. Even such simple indicators as the number of c ourt trials or court orders on mentally ill offenders are rarely provided regularly by the reporting systems of the Mem ber States. Usually there is no national register linking the forens ic psychiatric sector with judi cial authorities or national health services. Even Member States renowned for their case-registers in general psychiatry (e.g., Den- mark) seem to be inconsistent in their entries on the legal status of regi stered patients. Only Swe- den and the Netherlands run officially nation-wide data bases which could be classified as forensic case regist ers. Although technical prerequisites for the linkage of data-bases holding information on mentally ill offenders might already exist, there are legal obstacl es to establishing such linkages in most Mem- ber States. This may prevent easy access to simple epidemiological indicators, such as prevalence or incidence, but there is also a variety of prac tical applications of more far-reaching relevance, which raise strong ethical and human-rights argum ents against the unrestricted combining of po- lice, court or psychiatric records. Considering such technical developments as genetic fingerprints, Summar y and Conclusions 235 there is an urgent need for defining adequate and co mmon regulations for information linkage and access to this most sensitive data. Total number of forensic cases in the M ember States On the current legal basis, data on prevalence and incidence of forensic cases in the Member States - as a most basic indicator for the outcome of legal procedures - was taken from a variety of sources. When available, official statistics were used, which were cross-checked by results from national studies in some cases. Due to numerous methodological or definition probl ems (as described above), the reliability of fig- ures from these sources may be reduced. From a number of Member States, figures cannot be taken as exact information, but must be considered as an approximation instead. Time series for the annual number of cases in for ensic care from 1990 onwards were available for more than two-thirds of the Member States. Originating from variably populous countries, total numbers not surprisingly differ widely across the Me mber States. So comparing these estimates across national boundaries does not make much sense, but time series of total numbers of forensic cases at least allows conclusions to be drawn regarding trends or tendencies within each country. Throughout the 1990s, the annual number of cases ( point-prevalence) in Germany, the most popu- lated country in the European Union, rose hi gh above the levels in other Member States. Total frequencies from Germany and other countries (e.g., Denmark, the Netherlands) show either a fast growth or a less steep but consistent incr ease (Austria, Belgium). Time series from other Member States show a U-shaped prevalence (e.g ., Italy) or even decreasing numbers (Portugal, Greece). So the annual point-prevalence does not suggest a common trend for the Member States during the 1990s. National estimates seem to be influenc ed by a diversity of external factors, which must be analysed separately for each country. Prevalence rates Prevalence rates (forensic cases per 100,000 populat ion), which allow for cross-national compari- son, also vary widely (from 21.7 cases in Denmark in 1999 down to two cases per 100,000 popula- tion in Greece in 1996). This variety supports the hypothesis of specific nati onal characteristics as a dominating influence on legal outcomes. By way of example, the striking Danish prevalence rate, which is the highest of all Member States (annual growth approx. 6-7%), was concluded by Dani sh experts not to be an effect of changes in legislation or diagnostic routines, but of national de-institutionalis ation policies, supporting a rising criminal behaviour in schizophrenic patients. Howeve r, there are countries with a similar steep in- crease, although on a lower overall level. The doubli ng of prevalence rates (Germany, Austria) or even an three-fold increase (the Netherlands) during the 1990s may have been influenced by dif- ferent fac tors. Lowest prevalence rates are found in Southern Eur opean Member States (Greece, Italy, or Portu- gal; time series for Spain not available), suggesti ng a need for further investigation as to whether this is related to the reduced capac ities in forensic service provis ion found in these Member States. So, all in all, a common European trend is hard to discern, although a tendency towards slowly rising forensic prevalence rates (court decided ca ses) during the 1990s may be observed in most Member States. Incidence (new ly admitted cases per y ear) Time series on incidence (newly admitted forensic cases per year) or on incidence rates from the Member States show a more variable pattern than prevalence rates. In most less populated Mem- ber States, the incidence hardly exceeds 100 case s per year. Again Denmark marks an exemption here, with incidence figures mirroring the steep incr ease of prevalence rates. Rising incidence rates over time (indicating more admissions to forens ic care than discharges) may suggest security as- pects are being accorded more attention in forensic care and/or trials against mentally ill offenders. To what extent this is justified by a real increase in the dangerousness of forensic detainees or in the number of severe crimes committed by menta lly ill requires further examination, as does the Summar y and Conclusions 236 issue of whether the increases hint rather at a growing public f ear of mentally ill offenders inde- pendent from the actual offence rate . Length of stay Data on the duration of episodes in forensic institutions are scarce throughout the Member States, although this is a most crucial indicator in ev aluating forensic placements against the background of a decreasing mean length of stay in general psychiatry all over Europe. However, a high proportion of new admissions into forensic care in a given year may allow conclusions to be drawn as to discharge frequency and thus as to whether t here is an increasing or decreasing mean length of stay under forensic care regimes. According to this rather rough indica- tor, Belgium seem to experience the fastest turn -around of mentally disordered offenders in foren- sic facilities. England & Wales and Sweden also show a high proportion of annual admissions, suggesting a shorter mean length of stay for menta lly disordered offenders than most other Central European and Scandinavian Member States (Austria , Germany, Denmark, Finland, the Nether- lands) which have similar proportions of new cases per annum (between 15 to 30 % annually). However, in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sw eden and England & Wales, the proportion of new ad- missions seem to decrease during the 1990s, indi cating a trend towards longer forensic place- ments. Re-offending No routine data seem to be available for re-offending in mentally disordered offenders discharged from forensic facilities, although this would prov ide essential information for the effectiveness of legal procedures or forensic care in terms of pr evention. Conclusions as to the need for forensic aftercare could be drawn from such estimates. It is strongly recommended that indicators for re- peated offending or recidivism be incorporated into national health or judicial reporting systems. Characteristics of mentally ill offenders Details on the psychiatric diagnoses of forensic pat ients are also not a primary concern for the re- porting systems of the Member States. Collect ing and recording diagnostic data would not encoun- ter cross-boundary definition or standardisation problems in contrast to most other indicators dis- cussed here, given the widespread use of ICD-10 or DSM-IV diagnostic schemes. Available diagnostic data suggests considerable differ ences in key patient groups in forensic care in the Member States. Schizophrenic or other psyc hotic states seem to be the most frequent disor- der that patients in forensic care suffer from. The proportion of patients with addiction disorders and personality disorders varies the most between Mem ber States, personality disorders being the core group in forensic care in the Netherlands, wher eas being only a minority in most other Member States. The share of females among mentally ill offenders in forensic care is low and does not exceed 15- 17% in those Member States which were able to pr ovide information. This is not surprising, since violent or criminal behaviour is known to be much more prevalent in male mentally ill. There is no information available as to whether forensic service provision in the Member States is adapted to the specific needs of female patients. Only a minority of criminal statistics from the Mem ber States provide inform ation as to what propor- tion the mentally ill comprise of all offenders w ho commit serious or minor crimes, although this is of major interest to the public and to the mass m edia which give extensive coverage to spectacular crimes by mentally ill. When data is available, definitions are usually not harmonised, so that a European overview as to how far mentally disor dered persons contribute to national criminality must inevitably lack reliability. Nevertheless, according to figures contributed by experts collaborating in this study, proportions seem to be low, and there are Member States like Ireland where none of the persons indicted for murder (n=26), robbery (n=678), assault (n=2058) or sex offences (n=715) in a given year (2001) were found to be mentally disordered or unfit to plead. However, when focussing on on murder alone, the proportion of mentally ill among the perpetrators seems to be considerably higher than for serious offences in general. According to data provided for this study, in 2001, six out of 38 murders in Austria (15.8%) were committed by non-responsible Summar y and Conclusions 237 mentally ill offenders. In Sweden, it was as high as 35 out of 135 (25.9%) in 2002, and in Belgium 34 out of 176 (19.3%) in 1999. Acco rding to studies from Germany, the proportion of the mentally disordered among murderers may have doubled since the 1960s. Definitions may vary here also, especially concerning the inclusion of manslaughter into this category. These findings are out of line with some studies from the UK, the US or New Zealand which report much lower, constant or decreasing proportions of mentally ill among murderers. However, it is likely that changing legal criteria or assessment routines may considerably bias such long-term comparisons. Major Findings The legal frameworks for the processing and pl acement of mentally disordered offenders vary markedly across the fifteen European Union Member States included in this study in line with variations in their legal systems . The complexity of judicial or procedural regulat ions reflects the complexity of the problems that have to be addressed when assessing, trying, detaining or sentencing offenders with mental disorders. Codes or acts in the Member States conc erning mentally disordered offenders are spread amongst health laws, mental health laws and penal codes in a non-systematic way. Many of the currently applicable rules descend from ancient laws for mentally disturbed criminals, frequently revised and adapted over decades or centuries to reflect the constantly evolving national legal or penal systems. Due to th is, significant cross-boundary patterns did not evolve in the European Union. Court procedures are particularly variable and provide numerous differing pathways pre- or post-trial into the mental health care systems, specialised forensic systems or the prison- and other penal systems. There are different discharge procedures for forensic patients, and in some Member States discharge procedures incorporate obligatory conditions or re- lease on licence. It is difficult to identify obvious categories into which the various legal concepts of the Member States for placing and treating menta lly ill offenders can be characterised. A dif- ferentiation is visible according to whic h legal tradition each Member State has adopted (e.g., common-law countries vs. roman-law countri es) in that a greater medical role is seen in the post-trial phase in Member States influenced by common law traditions. However, this is of minor importance in the overa ll challenge to achieve appropriate treatment and safety standards for detained mentally disor dered offenders. There is no evidence for the superiority of one of these two basic legal traditions over the other. There are no uniform concepts as to which ment al disorders are covered by forensic legis- lation across the Member States. Legal definit ions of mental disorders are vague and do not relate to modern psychiatric classificati on systems, thus providing no practical guide- lines for assessment or decision procedures. Part icularly variable is the inclusion of addic- tion and personality disorders into the legal frameworks. There are no clearly defined national or European indicators as to the effectiveness of legal concepts or of current practices for detaining or treating mentally disordered offenders. Re- offending rates in people discharged from for ensic detention would probably provide the most useful information, along with psychiat ric estimates for treatment success. Informa- tion on this is currently available only from a minority of Member States, however, and is in need of international standardisation and implem entation, which is to be strongly recom- mended. Generally, a set of European indicators should be developed, covering and standardising the most basic data in the field (service prov ision, outcomes, preval ence, incidence, length of stay, disorders, types of crimes, reoffending rates). Plans should be made for their im- plementation in all Member States. Additionally, international research on the issue should be encouraged. This would be likely to focus the development of adequate inte rdisciplinary working and could contribute basic evidence to the field of a ty pe which is currently lacking. Summar y and Conclusions 238 Forensic service provision varies markedly acro ss the Member States. Number of facilities, beds or places, diversity of fo rensic services and quality of care are extremely variable, sometimes even within Member States. Regardi ng forensic bed provision, there is a dis- tinct north-south divide in the fifteen included c ountries, with particular low capacities in South-European Member States. There are different ideas around the inclusion of forensic care and the detention of men- tally ill offenders in the general mental health care system, ranging from strict separation to full inclusion. The overall quality of forensic care seems to be poor compared to current standards in general mental health care, although clear quality indicators are lacking. Outpatient foren- sic care and forensic aftercare seem to be particularly underdeveloped. Only a minority of Member States consider forensic psychiatry as a medical speciality. Standards in forensic trai ning are extremely varied. Underprovision for mentally disordered offenders appears the case in many Member States. Due to capacity problem s, the post-trial placement of (criminally not responsible) mentally disordered offenders in prison occurr ed in some Member States, although not le- gally encouraged. This is likely to add to the al ready increased stigmatisation of mentally ill offenders. The role and responsibility of psychiatrists in the process is complex and variably defined across the Member States. It often exceeds basic medical expertise (in assessing the men- tal state and applying psychiatric treatments) and may extend to predicting the criminal prognosis and guaranteeing the safety of detainees and that of the public. There is no indication that the Member Stat es' legal frameworks for placing and treating mentally disordered offenders violate basic human rights principles as laid down in the various human right conventions. There are variable definitions of the role of mentally disordered suspects or defendants during court procedures, for instance regarding attendance, legal representation. The pro- vision of an independent expert or representati on by an additional counsel is in some Member States dependant on the defendant's ability to pay for it. Although epidemiological figures are hard to compare across boundaries, there seems to be a tendency towards slowly rising forensic prevalence rates (court decided cases) in most Member States during the 1990s. However, it is unknown to what extent the available estimates or time series on which this c onclusion is based are methodologically biased by variations in case definitions, recording routines etc. No correlation could be detected be- tween changes in forensic legislation and the out come in terms of prevalence or incidence rates. Currently, a cross-boundary harmonisation of legal concepts or basic features (diagnostic criteria; terminology; time frames; plac ement, re-assessment and discharge procedures) appears hard to achieve.
