The attached paper outlines the work being undertaken by the FSA in relation to the spreading of organic waste on agricultural land and the microbiological safety of fruit and vegetables. 2. A programme of research has been underway since 1999 and draft guidance has recently been produced for farmers on the use of manures, aimed at minimising the risks of microbiological contamination of ready to eat crops. Member are invited to comment on the guidance. 3. The paper will be introduced by Dr Jonathan Back. Secretariat March 2002FRUIT AND VEGETABLES : FSA WORK ON MANURES AND SLURRIES 1. Over the past few years there has been increasing concern over the potential risk of the transfer of pathogens to food via the spreading of organic waste on agricultural land. The House of Commons Select Committee for the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs and the Commons Agriculture Select Committee on Food Safety both examined the disposal of organic wastes in 1998. In response to their reports, the Government stated that it intended to set in place a structured programme of research and risk assessment into the use of all organic wastes on land. DETR, Water UK and the Environment Agency subsequently began a programme of research on sewage sludge and MAFF (later the Food Standards Agency) began a programme on manures and abattoir waste. 2. Very little information was found to exist on levels of pathogens in manures and abattoir waste. The research programme was therefore aimed at providing a significant body of data from laboratory and field experiments as well as surveillance. 3. Two projects were commissioned to obtain this data: A major project (BO5003) on pathogen levels in fresh and stored manures and survival during storage and after application to land. A smaller project (BO5008) on pathogen levels in abattoir waste (blood, gut contents and lairage) 4. The results of the research would then be used in a risk assessment. The outcome of which should enable the Food Standards Agency to assess whether further action is required to ensure the microbiological safety of fruit and vegetables. Details of the research projects commissioned under this programme can be found in Annex 1. 5. It was felt important that action should be taken to ensure food safety before the outcome of the risk assessment. Sufficient knowledge on good practice was believed to exist to be able to produce guidance for farmers on the use of manures in relation to the highest risk crops. Therefore, before any experimental work was undertaken, a report was commissioned entitled 'A study of farm manure applications to agricultural land and an assessment of the risks of pathogen transfer into the food chain' (FS2526). The report highlighted best practice in relation to manure/slurry storage and spreading and was used (in conjunction with the initial results of the research) to develop guidance for farmers on minimising the risks of microbiological contamination of ready to eat crops (Annex 2). 6. The FSA is shortly to carry out a public consultation on these guidelines in order to obtain feedback, particularly from parties involved in the fruit and vegetable industry, on the implications and practicality of the proposals. A stakeholder workshop is also being held as part of the consultation process.7. In addition to the work being carried out on manures and abattoir waste, a review was commissioned on the potential risks to food safety from the use of water in agriculture. This may point towards where further research is needed and/or where guidance to farmers on best practice is required. 8. A programme review will be held once all the projects have finished in early 2003. A decision will then be taken on whether there is a need for further research. The outcome of the risk assessment may also point to areas where more data is required.ANNEX 1 Project codeProject Title Contractor Start date End date Cost FS2526 A study on farm manure application to agricultural land and the risks of pathogen transfer into the food chainADAS 1.6.99 30.11.99 \u00a352,000 BO5003/4 Pathogens in animal manures: their levels and survival both during storage and following application to agricultural landADAS University of Southampton1.7.99 28.2.03 \u00a3887,828 BO5008 The levels of University of Bristol 1.11.99 31.5.02 \u00a3293,847 B17001 A review of the use of water in UK agriculture and the potential risks to food safetyADAS 1.5.01 28.2.02 \u00a357,563 B17002 Assessment of the risks to food safety associated with spreading of animal manure and abattoir waste on agricultural landWRc-NSF 1.5.01 30.4.02 \u00a348,753ANNEX 2 DRAFT MANAGING FARM MANURES FOR FOOD SAFETY Guidelines for Growers to Minimise the Risks of Microbiological Contamination of Ready to Eat CropsINTRODUCTION Farm manures (both solid manures and slurries) are applied to agricultural land to meet crop nutrient requirements and to improve soil fertility. Around 90 million tonnes of farm manures are applied to approximately 4 million hectares of agricultural land each year in the UK. These manures can contain pathogenic microorganisms (e.g. Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and may cause food borne illness. The number of microorganisms in manures is affected by factors such as the age, diet and management of animals, as well as regional and seasonal influences. The management and handling of farm manures, particularly the length of time they are stored, are important factors in the survival of microorganisms. The method and timing of manure applications to land can affect the length of time that pathogens survive in the soil, and the likelihood of their getting onto food crops. In order to reduce any risks of food borne illness resulting from the use of farm manures, there is a need for due diligence in the growing, harvesting and packing of ready to eat crops. Scope This booklet provides practical guidance on ways of reducing the risks of food borne illness resulting from the microbiological contamination of ready to eat crops by farm manures. It is equally applicable to both conventional and organic growers. The best way to minimise the risks of food borne illness from ready to eat crops is to prevent contamination. Four key stages in reducing the risks of microbial contamination are outlined in this guidance note. What Crops Pose the Greatest Risks? The microbiological contamination of crops that are unlikely to be cooked before they are eaten is a risk to human health. Such crops include salads, fruit and some vegetables - commonly referred to as ready to eat crops. Crops with a short growing season, such as salads and strawberries, are particularly vulnerable. Up to 10% of the area growing ready to eat crops may receive farm manures prior to planting. Washing crops thoroughly after harvest will significantly reduce the risks of food borne illness. However, not all crops are routinely washed so other precautions must be taken.Sources of Microbial Contamination Contamination by farm manures may occur through :- \u00d8 Application to land before a crop is established \u00d8 Application to growing crops \u00d8 Runoff from solid manure field heaps \u00d8 Leaking or overflowing solid manure stores and slurry lagoons \u00d8 Transfer via contaminated equipment and vehicles \u00d8 Aerosol or windborne contamination \u00d8 Contamination of surface and irrigation water by livestock or manures. \u00d8 Livestock having access to cropped areas What Kills Pathogenic Microorganisms ? Pathogens can be killed either in the manure itself or after application to land. The main factors that will lead to a reduction in numbers are :- \u00d8 Temperature - in general, the higher the temperature the greater the level of kill, with temperatures above 55oC being particularly effective .Freezing can also reduce numbers. \u00d8 Sunlight - exposure to sunlight and in particular ultra violet radiation will significantly increase die off. \u00d8 pH - microorganisms generally survive best at a neutral pH. A low pH (acid) or high pH (alkaline) environment will speed up the rate of kill. \u00d8 Drying - microorganism numbers are generally reduced by drying. \u00d8 Time - pathogenic microorganisms die out over time. The rate at which this happens depends on environmental conditions. In some conditions they can survive for several months.STAGE 1 - M INIMISING RISKS BEFORE CROP ESTABLISHMENT Pathogens such as E.coli O157 can survive in soil for several months following the spreading of farm manures or deposition during grazing. They may also be present in dirty water, yard runoff and leachate from stored manures. Site Selection You can minimise the risks of microbiological contamination by careful choice of where you grow the crop. Where possible :- Avoid fields that have recently received manure or have been used for livestock grazing. This may be difficult where the nutrient supply and soil conditioning benefits of manure are fundamental to the system. Consider if you can adopt a rotational manuring policy and apply manures before a lower risk crop, such as a cereal. Minimise the risks of airborne contamination, by choosing fields that are not adjacent to livestock units. Avoid fields where there is a risk of surface runoff from yards or manure storage areas. Use of Fresh Manure You should NOT apply fresh manure to land where you intend to grow ready to eat crops, unless there will be at least a 6 months period between the manure application and harvest. Dung deposited by livestock should also be considered as a potential source of pathogens. You should leave at least a 4 months gap between livestock last being in the field and harvest of a subsequent ready to eat crop Use of Stored and Treated Manure The batch storage of solid manures and slurries for at least 3 months (i.e. no additions of fresh manure are made to the store during this period) or 'active' treatment, are effective methods of killing pathogens. Composting is a particularly effective method of controlling pathogens in solid manures, but for best results needs to be actively managed. Turn the manure regularly (at least twice) either with a front-end loader or preferably a purpose built compost turner. This should generate high temperatures over a period of time (e.g. >55o C for 3 days) which are effective in killing pathogens. Other forms of 'active' treatment, which are particularly suited to the treatment of slurries and can result in a significant reduction in pathogens are:- anaerobic digestion (typically at 30-35o C with 12 days retention for pig slurry or 20 days for cattle and poultry slurry). lime treatment (addition of quick lime or slaked lime to raise the pH to 12 for at least 2 hours). You should NOT apply batch stored or treated manures to land where you intend to grow ready to eat crops, unless there will be at least a 2 months period between the manure application and harvest Land Application and Soil Incorporation To make best use of manure nutrients and to minimise air and water pollution, you should follow advice in the relevant Codes of Good Agricultural Practice (see Sources of Information and Advice). Design and locate manure storage areas to ensure that water pollution risks are minimised. This should include adequate containment measures. Apply manures uniformly and with due regard to the environment. Observe any no spreading zones (e.g. next to watercourses or boreholes) identified in a Farm Waste Management Plan. This will minimise the risks of runoff and indirect contamination of nearby crops. Keep a detailed record of manure application date, type and rate. Although pathogens can be killed by exposure to sunlight, you should incorporate manures into the soil as soon as is practicable, as this will reduce the potential for direct crop contamination and also reduce odour and ammonia emissions. STAGE 2 - M INIMISING RISKS AFTER CROP ESTABLISHMENT AND DURING THE GROWING SEASON Manure Applications Manure should not come into direct contact with ready to eat crops during the growing season. Do NOT apply manure to ready to eat crops during the growing season Field Operations Avoid spreading manure on neighbouring fields if runoff will be a potential source of contamination of growing crops. Spreading is a potential source of wind borne contamination. Use low trajectory equipment and do not spread manures on windy days upwind of ready to eat crops. Whenever working in ready to eat crops ensure that equipment is clean. Do not drive vehicles through any manure or effluent on the way to the field.Irrigation and Water Use Water used on the farm is a potential route of microbiological contamination. It is very important that manure storage areas and field heaps do not contaminate watercourses or sources of irrigation water. Keep Livestock out of Growing Crops As far as possible, you should prevent livestock from having access to ready to eat crops. Where necessary, check that fences and hedges are stock proof. Ask the public to keep dogs on leads where footpaths run through cropped areas. STAGE 3 - M INIMISING RISKS AFTER HARVEST The following guidance should be read in conjunction with other advice on good worker hygiene, packing and storage protocols and maintenance of temperature regimes. Harvesting Ensure that all harvesting machinery and equipment are clean. Do not drive vehicles through any manure or effluent between the field and the packhouse. When you harvest ready to eat crops, make sure that containers and packaging are clean.Take particular care if the crops are packed in the field and will not be washed. Keep all animals and birds out of packhouses and storage areas. Produce Washing The main risks of contamination after harvest relate to the possible contamination of water used for washing or transporting produce. Use only potable water for washing produce and transporting produce in flumes. STAGE 4 - G ENERAL MANAGEMENT You should include the handling, storage and application of farm manures in your assessment and control of microbiological hazards, and in your Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) assessment. Record all manure applications on a field by field basis detailing the type, rate, date of application, source and management of the manure before spreading. Always follow Good Agricultural Practice and guidance in the relevant Codes (see Sources of Information and Advice) You can obtain further guidance on worker hygiene and ways to minimise the risks of microbiological contamination from amongst others, the Fresh Produce Consortium.Sources of Information and Advice Available free from DEFRA Publications, Tel: 08459 556 000 or www.defra.gov.uk/environ/cogap/cogap.htm The Water Code (Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water) -PB0587.
