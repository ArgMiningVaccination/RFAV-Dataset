This view assigns students whom identify as two or more races to one racial category based upon an institutionally defined trumping order (African American, Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islander). Other outcomes data (i.e. retention and graduation rates) do not use a disambiguated view. Viewing disambiguated data is important because it allows the university to gain a more accurate representation of the diversity of our student body. It also provides a method to approximate the single race categories that pre-date the 2010 federal change in race/ethnicity definitions allowing for historical comparisons.OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17 The inaugural OVPDEMA Distinguished Inclusive Excellence Award was presented to Gerry Stroman, former chief diversity officer at IU Kokomo, and Karen White, associate vice chancellor of student services and dean of students at IU South Bend. Stroman and White are two longtime IU employees who are not only wonderful people and deserving of recognition for their stellar careers, but are also individuals who have made a tremendous impact in diversity and inclusion on their respective campuses. T wo new OVPDEMA initiatives, the Black Philanthropy Circle and the First Nations Leadership Ambassadors Council, were created. I'm very excited about the work of both efforts. The Black Philanthropy Circle will enhance the culture of giving among IU's African American alumni and the First Nations Leadership Ambassadors Council will enable IU to forge a deeper connection with the Native American community. Y ou can learn more about these programs in this report. IU Bloomington honored its historically black fraternities and sororities with a dedication of plots\u2014limestone markers\u2014outside of the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center in April. Earlier that month, IU dedicated a historical marker to Bill Garrett, the first African American basketball player at IU and in the Big T en Conference, outside of IU Bloomington's School of Public Health. OVPDEMA celebrated the career of Professor Emerita Iris Rosa, the first director of the African American Dance Company. Rosa was a member of the first class of the Groups Scholars Program and upon graduation embarked on a 43-year tenure as the director of the dance company, which culminated with international trips to China this past December and Cuba in July. IU expanded its relationship of more than three decades with the Indiana Black Expo, one of the largest African American cultural events in the country, by sponsoring the Indiana University Education Conference at July's 47th annual Indiana Black Expo Summer Celebration in Indianapolis. In addition to the conference, which added a higher education track this year and featured IU faculty as workshop presenters, IU participated in the week-long event as the presenting sponsor of the annual Pacers Sports and Entertainment Corporate Luncheon, hosted a booth for IU representatives to give information to prospective students, and held 21st Century Scholars Days as an opportunity for qualified in-state residents to learn more about IU's four-year, full-tuition scholarship. Again, this is just a small selection of the many achievements that took place over the course of the 2016-17 academic year. This year's diversity annual report provides a glimpse of additional successes happening on each of IU's campuses. As you read through the pages that follow, you will learn about some of the programs and initiatives, positive trends, and people who contribute to the tapestry of ideas and experiences that define our diversity and inclusion work at IU. James C. Wimbush, Ph.D. Indiana University Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs Dean for The University Graduate School Johnson Professor for Diversity and Leadership 3 2A Message From Vice President James C. Wimbush, Ph.D. When I first moved into my current role at Indiana University's Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs (OVPDEMA) in 2013, one of my immediate priorities was to develop the office's infrastructure in a fashion where consistent gains would be evident. Though we still continue to make adjustments to the structure of OVPDEMA, progress has started to manifest itself in the 2016-17 academic year in the ways that we initially hoped. For example, I am extremely proud to note that in 2016-17 , IU's population of underrepresented minority students reached 23.1 percent. This is higher than Indiana's population of underrepresented minority residents. There is a reason that diversity and inclusion are critical components of IU's efforts to provide the ideal college experience for undergraduate and graduate students. Diversity matters at IU because we truly are an inclusive academic community of students, faculty, and staff from many backgrounds and perspectives. Our goal at OVPDEMA is to create a campus environment that welcomes people from all walks of life, while providing the tools and resources they need to reach their full potential. Over the past year, we have made important strides in our diversity objectives, both across the university system and on individual campuses. This was evident in the fall semester of 2016 when senior leadership at IU\u2014including IU President Michael McRobbie, IU Bloomington Provost Lauren Robel, IUPUI Chancellor Nasser Paydar, and myself\u2014participated in forums on the IU Bloomington and IUPUI campuses following the presidential election. We attended these events as part of our commitment to foster inclusive excellence for all. For myself, the gatherings served as one of the many moments occurring during the 2016-17 academic year that filled me with optimism about the climate of diversity on IU's campuses. Highlights of additional diversity achievements and milestones can be found below. These efforts represent only some of Indiana University's work to build a campus community of respect and a place where every student, faculty, and staff member finds support to reach their potential. Through a generous contribution from Lacy Johnson, a prominent Indianapolis attorney, IU established the Johnson Professorship for Diversity and Leadership. Johnson's gift will support IU's senior leadership and their work on issues in diversity and leadership. Specifically, this funding will help foster greater cultural understanding among faculty and staff and benefit underrepresented and first-generation students, LGBTQ+ students, and students of color, and ensure the continued development of academic, leadership, and training programs within OVPDEMA.Our Vision We strive to be a globally diverse university community where inclusive excellence is embraced, fostered, and celebrated and faculty, staff, and students are inspired to achieve their full potential.Our Purpose The Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs serves as a partner with each of IU's campuses to create a learning environment that advocates access, success, respect, equity, inclusiveness, and community for all. State of Diversity at IU The Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs Indiana University Highlights 73% 2005 - 2015 Increase in total domestic minority student enrollment 44 % Increase in minority facultyOFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Postsecondary education has become the gateway to social and economic mobility. Research shows college-educated people experience higher career earnings, are more likely to vote, and lead healthier lives. Individuals with college-level training, degrees, or credentials also bring much-needed skills and competencies into America's workforce, helping the economy grow, thrive, and remain competitive. Many students, however, never make it to the college finish line. Financial barriers, lack of academic preparation, and family obligations force millions of individuals to drop out of school every year. Some non-completers may later re-enroll only to become discouraged and again repeat their drop-out scenario. According to a 2014 report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, more than 31 million students have enrolled in college and left without receiving a degree or certificate over the past 20 years. Almost one-third of this population had only a minimal interaction with the higher education system, having enrolled for just a single term at a single institution. These realities are causing more colleges and universities to take a deeper look at their campuses and, specifically, at the data associated with students who are at risk of failing to complete their educational journey. Institutions are then using this information as a catalyst to improve students' academic experiences, provide better advising, establish intervention programs, connect students to resources, and engage learners at a more personal level. Collecting data about students is not new to postsecondary education institutions. But a noticeable shift has transpired in the kinds of data being captured and the ways in which colleges and universities are leveraging the information they glean to inform improvements in educational quality and equity, boost student persistence, and increase on-time degree completion. The information presented in this report offers further insight into Indiana University's data and, most important, how leadership is using this information to motivate meaningful change on its campuses through programs, policies, and practices that improve student outcomes. Using Data to Drive Sustainable Improvement in Equity, SuccessData for Change 4Interpreting the Data 2016-2017 Diversity Annual Report Enrollment Fall, August 31, 2016, total domestic degree-seeking student census data. For IU-specific data, the individuals in the official census category of 'T wo or More Races' have been assigned to individual race categories according to the following \"trumping\" rule: African American, Asian, American Indian or Pacific Islander. These assignments do not affect the Hispanic/Latino and minority total figures. T otal, domestic known: all minority plus White. Excludes international and unknown in both the numerator and the denominator. Source for state and service regions: U.S. Census Bureau, 2014 Census by state, population aged 18-24. The T wo or More Races category in the official census data cannot be assigned to individual races, as IU-specific data are. Retention Rates Retention reports track full-time first-year or beginners from the first to the second year. Does not include transfers. Includes degree-seeking undergraduates who enrolled in the fall term and either matriculated in that fall term or in any one of the previous summer sessions. Campus average includes all students who were re-enrolled in the subsequent fall semester or had received a degree. Both IU and campus data is based on Domestic Minority\u2014African American, Hispanic, Asian American, American Indian, Pacific Islander, T wo or More Races. Academic unit data is based on student record flags for these programs, e.g. Hudson & Holland Scholars Program, Groups Scholars Program, etc. In order to protect student privacy, retention rates are not shown if there are 10 or fewer students in the initial cohort for any specific category or subcategory. Retention race/ethnic groupings do not include the re-assignment of \"T wo or More Races\" to the single race category. Graduation Rates Graduation rates for full-time undergraduate students based upon their year of entry into the university. Cohorts are \"tracked\" for six years (up to August 31 of the sixth year). Degree completions are measured by the accepted federal guideline of 150 percent of program length (1.5 years for certificates, three years for associates, and six years for baccalaureates). The graduation rate population is defined as full-time beginner, degree-seeking students who began in the fall semester or either of the preceding summer sessions. The graduation rate data covers the cohort years of 2006-2010. Academic unit data based on student record flags for these programs, e.g. Hudson & Holland Scholars Program, Groups Scholars Program, etc. In order to protect student privacy, graduation rates are not shown if there are 10 or fewer students in the initial cohort for any specific category or subcategory. Graduation rate race/ethnic groupings do not include the re-assignment of \"T wo or More Races\" to the single race categories. Tenured and Tenure Track Faculty The data for each year comes from the university census file for that academic year which is collected on October 1 of each year. As employment data is changing daily this is the only way to ensure the use of consistent numbers for longitudinal analysis. The faculty numbers include all tenure track faculty regardless of their administrative appointment. Based on full time designation only. Faculty who identify as two or more races are assigned to one racial category based upon an institutionally defined trumping order (African American, Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islander). 5OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL Bend IU Southeast 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 6Indiana University Diversity by the Number s Faculty Development and Diversity Indiana University values the contributions and inherent worth of all faculty members, and works hard to develop initiatives that support diversity and inclusion. These initiatives include institutional investments in diversity recruitment, professional training and support, hiring programs, and collaborations and community partnerships.

This growth is, in part, a result of IU's Bicentennial Strategic Plan, which prioritizes a commitment to student success. This includes keeping tuition and fees low, providing financial assistance, helping students stay on track to graduate, and enrolling more students from diverse backgrounds.IU 2016 Minority Enrollment 23.0 % State of Indiana Minority Population 22.8 % African American 104 145 Native American 9 14 Hispanic 86 112 Asian/Pacific Islander 309 461 Total Minority Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Minority Total 2012 2013 Bend IU Southeast 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 7Enhanced Support for Student Success, Persistence T oday's postsecondary classrooms are more assimilated than ever, as education for all becomes a 21st century reality. University-wide efforts to ensure more minority students persist and succeed resulted in IU achieving a 77 .4 percent minority retention rate in 2015. Using Tools and Data to Improve Completion Moving the needle on degree completion remains a top priority for Indiana University. While on-time completion for minority students is improving on some IU campuses, more work needs to be done. T o that end, the university has adopted several programs to improve the pathway to graduation for students. One of these efforts is a new partnership with Civitas Learning that allows the university's system of more than 100,000 students to develop the most optimal and personalized course schedule and pathway to a degree.

When students see themselves reflected in the individuals who impart learning in the classroom, they are often inspired to reach higher and achieve more. IU Bloomington continues to expand its efforts to build a pool of diverse faculty talent through outreach, mentoring, and training programs. As a result, the total number of minority faculty has increased by 47 percent since 2005, while non-minority faculty decreased by 3 percent.IU Bloomington Enrollment of Minority Students IU Bloomington Minority Campus Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Two or More Races Campus Average 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2010 CohortIU Bloomington Minority 6-Y Latino/Hispanic Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Two or More Races Campus Average 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2010 CohortRetaining Minority Students One of the keys to increasing the country's degree attainment rate lies in improving access, retention, and degree completion for minority students. IU Bloomington's focus on programs such as 21st Century Scholars, Groups Scholars, and Hudson & Holland Scholars is instrumental in this process, helping the campus achieve a 90.6 percent minority retention rate in 2015.IU Bloomington OVPDEMA Academic Program Retention Rates IU Bloomington T enured and T enure Track Faculty IU Bloomington OVPDEMA Academic Program Average 6-Y ear Graduation RatesCompletion is the Goal A college degree is the gateway to a good-paying job.

In 2010, the cohort graduation rate for minorities was 69.6 percent. OVPDEMA's academic programs also are having a positive impact on completion. Students in the 2010 cohort of the Hudson & Holland Scholars Program experienced an impressive 84.1 graduation rate.Minority Enrollment Focus Higher education is a vehicle to upward mobility and IU Bloomington is committed to leveling the playing field for all students. Since 2012, the IU Bloomington campus has steadily increased its minority enrollment from 17 percent to 21.3 percent in 2016.

IUPUI approaches this from many fronts, including financial, programming, mentoring, and more. For example, the Degree Completion Office (DCO) at IUPUI is a student services office designed specifically to meet the needs of adult students who have chosen to return to complete their college degree. The DCO guides these adult learners through a career development process, with the goal of ensuring they fulfill their higher education aspirations.Expanding Entry Points to College IUPUI has built a learning environment in which access and success are prioritized throughout the entire campus.

Specifically, the school employs several core strategies to encourage its undergraduate students to finish their education in four years. One of these strategies is a flat-rate tuition that became effective in the fall of 2016. Already, the campus is seeing positive results. The 2010 cohort graduation rate for minorities is 37 .9 percent, up from 17 .4 percent in 2009.Delivering on the Higher Ed Promise College-educated individuals bring training and much-needed skills into America's workforce, helping the economy grow, prosper, and remain competitive. IU East continues to ramp up its efforts to increase the minority make-up of its student population. This sharpened focus on diversity has led to an increase in its minority enrollment rate of 11.4 percent in 2016, which is well above the campus goal of 7 .5 percent. * Scholars 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Minority Total 2012 2013 Scholars 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort Century Scholars 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2005 2015 African American 1 3 Native American 1 2 Hispanic 0 1 Asian/Pacific Islander 5 11 Total Minority 7 17 White 46 41IU East T enured and T enure Track Facult yIU East 2016 Minority Enrollment 11.4 % Service Region Minority Population 7. 5% 13* In order to protect student privacy, retention and graduation rates are not shown if there are 10 or fewer students in the initial cohort for any specific category or subcategory.

College-educated individuals not only tend to have higher earnings than those without degrees, they are more likely to be healthier and experience career and personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, too many people remain stuck in limbo; they have completed some college, but not enough to earn a degree or certificate. Looking ahead, IU Kokomo is making concentrated efforts to drive degree completion for traditionally underrepresented students.A Culture of Intentionality Increasing numbers of colleges and universities are looking for ways to serve today's changing student demographics and provide the support necessary to open doors for more underrepresented student populations. IU Kokomo is no exception. The campus has embraced a number of strategies designed to improve college access, including the T ransitional Pathways Program for individuals with disabilities. These efforts have assisted IU Kokomo in improving enrollment rates of minority students.

Through academic programs, one-on-one advising, scholarships, and other support services, IU Southeast works diligently with students from the moment they set foot on campus until they graduate. Education is Key T oday's student demographics are changing. Non-traditional students have become the majority of the postsecondary student population. These students are more racially diverse and more likely to be employed and raising a family. IU Southeast has developed a number of initiatives and partnerships to address the needs of these and other students. Such strategies are producing positive results: in 2016, minority enrollment reached 15 percent, up from 14. 5 percent in the previous year and 12.9 percent in Scholars 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort Scholars 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2012 2013 2014 2015 IU Southeast T enured and T enure Track Facult y African American 5 7 Native American 0 2 Hispanic 1 2 Asian/Pacific Islander 11 16 Total Minority 17 27 White Scholars 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort Latino/Hispanic Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Minority Total 2012 2013 Minority Other Campus Average 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2010 CohortIU Southeast 2016 Minority Enrollment 15.0 % Service Region Minority Population 12.4 % 21 IU Southeast's minority enrollment goal is to mirror its service region goal for the minority population of citizens 18-24 Latino/Hispanic Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Two or More Races Campus Average (All) 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2010 Latino/Hispanic Asian American Indian Pacific Islander Two or More Races Campus Average (All) 2006 Cohort 2007 Cohort 2008 Cohort 2009 Cohort 2010 CohortOFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17OVPDEMA Academic Support Supporting Student Success OVPDEMA's academic support programs provide a meaningful learning foundation for IU Bloomington students, giving them resources and guidance through caring staff and peer mentors and structure as they embark upon their educational journey. Most important, these programs provide students with a true sense of community. 22 23 Hudson & Holland Scholars Program The Hudson & Holland Scholars Program, IU's largest merit-based scholarship and support program, enrolled 1,525 students during the 2016-17 academic year. Despite the program's size, it has a 98 percent retention rate from participants' first to second semester, a 93 percent retention rate from the first to second year, and a 72 percent graduation rate. This success demonstrates both the influence of staff and the positive effect of targeted resources and support. Students who become Hudson & Holland Scholars are required to meet Leadership, Engagement, Academics, and Diversity (L.E.A.D.) requirements. The concept of L.E.A.D. is to create multiple points of contacts with scholars, particularly those in their first year at IU Bloomington, and create a network of support that assists them with academic, social, and personal obstacles. L.E.A.D., which was developed through student development theory and best practices, is highlighted by an intentional approach to advising and interactions focused on the holistic development of students. Each student is provided with one-on-one interaction with an advisor, opportunities for tutoring, leadership development, and a first- year seminar course. Hudson & Holland Scholars also must take part in Wellness and Retention programming, a partnership with the IU Bloomington School of Public Health and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). In this program component, students meet with the Wellness and Retention program manager, their advisor, and if necessary, CAPS staff, in addition to participating in a variety of programs and services intended to help build emotional and situational intelligence, leadership skills, life skills, and coping strategies for stress and other emotional concerns.21st Century Scholars Program For more than two decades, the 21st Century Scholars Program at IU Bloomington has been committed to preparing all students for lifelong success. The program is the largest academic support department in terms of student enrollment (3,378 scholars). During the 2016-2017 academic year, 812 scholars from the Bicentennial Class of 2020 enrolled at IU Bloomington. Since 1990, more than 20,000 students have used funding from the 21st Century Scholars Program to attend IU Bloomington. During the 2015-2016 academic year, the Indiana 21st Century Scholars Program awarded $25,776,763 full-tuition scholarships to approximately 2,588 low-income 21st Century Scholars at IU Bloomington. The 21st Century Scholars Program at IU Bloomington boasts the highest four-year graduation rate in the state of Indiana. Moreover, 21st Century Scholars are enrolled in every school/ department, working on degrees in virtually every major offered. Indeed, participation in the 21st Century Scholars Program affords students the opportunity to get involved in several unique programs and events at IU Bloomington and beyond. The 21st Century Scholars Program represents the greatest number of IU Bloomington students who took part in OVPDEMA's Office of Mentoring Services & Leadership Development's Faculty and Staff for Student Excellence (FASE) peer-mentoring program and who studied abroad through OVPDEMA's Overseas Studies & Scholarship Program. Because of its growth, the 21st Century Scholars Program added an additional academic advisor in the 2016-17 academic year. This expansion resulted in improved career programming for students and advising capabilities. The program received further exposure at the Indiana Commission for Higher Education's 2017 Next Steps College Conference, held in April in Indianapolis, where one of the program's advisors presented on behalf of IU.The 21st Century Scholars Program also collaborated with campus and external partners for various events, including those with OVPDEMA's Community & School Partnerships and the Indianapolis chapter of the Indiana Black Expo. This particular gathering entailed approximately 200 Indianapolis- area high school students visiting the IU Bloomington campus. Additionally, the 21st Century Scholars Program partnered with IU Bloomington's Office of Scholarships on two initiatives\u2014the Successful Scholars Day for high school students who have been accepted to IU and recognition of current 21st Century Scholars through the IU 21st Century Scholars Program Scholar Success Fund. Academic Support Center Many students arrive on a college campus without a thorough understanding of what it takes to succeed in the next phase of their education. They may not know who to talk to or where to go to get the academic resources and support that they need. The Academic Support Center is designed to put students on a path to success from the first day of classes. The Academic Support Center offers a comprehensive system of free tutoring resources and other support to help students build a foundation for academic and personal achievement to persist and succeed in college. This support\u2014which includes tutoring, spaces for learning, technology, peer coaching, workshops, and more\u2014is easily accessible, free to students, and offered at cultural centers, in three campus residence halls (Briscoe, Forest, and T eter), and in OVPDEMA academic units. Thousands of students benefit from the Academic Support Center's support services. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2015, the center experiences more than 10,000 visits by students each year.Groups Scholars Program Established in 1968 to increase college attendance among students who meet certain income requirements at Indiana University Bloomington, the Groups Scholars Program provides financial support and other resources to ensure students have what they need to succeed in college. In addition to financial assistance covering tuition and fees, books, and room and board for scholars' undergraduate education for four years, the Groups Scholars Program offers tutoring, academic advising, social support, and mentoring to help students stay on track to their degree. More than 350 students are admitted yearly to the Groups Scholars Program, and the effort has an alumni roster of close to 12,000 individuals. A program of OVPDEMA, the initiative is now fully funded by Indiana University. Sixty-five percent of Groups Scholars also are 21st Century Scholars, and many are part of the Hudson & Holland Scholars Program. All three programs are designed to help foster the success of scholars. As the Groups Scholars Program approaches its 50th anniversary, the program's continued growth over its long history is evidence of its effectiveness and the opportunities it has provided to scores of students since its inception. For example, in 2015, the incoming freshman class for the Groups Scholars Program experienced a remarkable 93 percent retention rate, a record for first-year students in the program. Moreover, 44 scholars were inducted into the Chi Alpha Epsilon Honors Society, another record number for the Groups Scholars Program. The strong pool of applicants can, in part, be attributed to the Groups Scholars Program's recommenders. Recommenders are individuals across the state of Indiana\u2014including high school counselors, administrators, and community leaders\u2014who identify high school students they believe are good matches for the program. Recommenders walk potential applicants through the application process and remain in touch with students long after they enroll at IU Bloomington. The number of recommenders for the Groups Scholars Program reached a record 189 individuals in the 2016-17 academic year, with 74 additional recommenders to be added in the 2017-18 academic year.Annual Report 2016-17 ANNUAL REPORTMentoring Services & Leadership Development OVPDEMA's Mentoring Services & Leadership Development is best known for a peer mentoring program called Faculty and Staff for Student Excellence (FASE). In the 2016-17 academic year, FASE served nearly 900 IU Bloomington students, and 42 percent of the incoming class of FASE peer mentors graduated from its Mentor Apprenticeship Program. Among the highlights Mentoring Services & Leadership Development experienced in 2016-17: Participation by FASE in the 2016 IUPUI National Mentoring Symposium; the FASE Business Etiquette Program Dinner, which attracted 125 participants; and the Spring Career Dinner Symposium. More than 120 individuals participated in the symposium in which peer mentors guide their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s as part of the effort's career preparation and support components. Mentoring Services & Leadership Development also incorporated a new program component in the 2016-17 academic year with the launch of the Faculty Mentoring Initiatives. The effort matches returning IU Bloomington undergraduate students with faculty members who serve as mentors to students, offering encouragement and insight to help students complete their degree. More than 100 IU faculty and nearly 150 students, many of whom were participants in other OVPDEMA programs, volunteered to take part in the program's inaugural year. OVPDEMA Academic Support Overseas Studies & Scholarship Program Created through a partnership between OVPDEMA and the IU Bloomington Office of the Provost, the Overseas Studies & Scholarship Program has awarded nearly 445 scholarships to IU Bloomington students since its inception in 2013. Approximately 80 percent of these students are underrepresented minorities. In addition to scholarships that enable students to study abroad for a semester or during the summer, the program provides group trips to places such as Brazil, Dominican Republic, Ghana, and India. Participants are accompanied by IU faculty and staff who help guide students as they learn about new cultures and experience different sights and sounds. For many students, these trips are often their first visit outside of the United States. In the fall 2016 semester, the Overseas Studies & Scholarship Program held its inaugural Study Abroad Fair in conjunction with IU's International Education Week. Approximately 270 students attended the event, which featured international-themed performances and presentations, giveaways, funding for U.S. passports, and a resource fair. 24 OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Asian Culture Center The Asian Culture Center (ACC) is designed to promote awareness, understanding, and acceptance of Asian and Asian American cultures. In 2016-17 , the ACC saw a year of engaging and diverse activities, programming, and events for students, faculty, staff, and members of the community. For example, on homecoming weekend in October, IU Bloomington alumna Judge Lorna G. Schofield was presented with the 2016 Asian Pacific American Alumni Award. She also was named a recipient of IU's Distinguished Alumni Service Award. Upon returning to her alma mater, Schofield, who presides over the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Y ork, spent time with fellow alumni, faculty, staff, and IU students at a reception hosted by the ACC at the Indiana Memorial Union. During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month in April, the ACC collaborated with various campus partners to lead an array of programming. This included an opening reception at the Mathers Museum of World Cultures, a film series at the IU Cinema, and an evening of cultural performances for Asia Night at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater in Bloomington. Along with the Asian American Association, a student organization, the ACC also coordinated IU's hosting of the third annual Indiana Asian American Conference. First Nations Educational & Cultural Center Marked by both new initiatives and new spins on longstanding traditions, the First Nations Educational & Cultural Center (FNECC) experienced an impressive 2016-17 academic year. Celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2017 , the FNECC received visitors of all backgrounds and ethnicities who had an interest in contemporary Native American culture. This enthusiasm was evident in April for the sixth annual Indiana University traditional Powwow.OVPDEMA Culture Centers Held in Dunn Meadow for the first time\u2014both for the weather factor and because of the ever-increasing number of spectators\u2014the FNECC enlisted several partners and guests from Native communities nationwide for the event. The gathering entailed an array of activities, including traditional Native American dance sessions, exhibitions, singing, informational booths, craft vendors, and food. The weekend of the powwow also served as the first meeting of the newly established IU First Nations Leadership Ambassadors Council. The council, which was formed to help IU strengthen the connection to and gain insight from the Native American community, consists of individuals with deep ties to the Native community who will advise IU on important issues such as recruiting and retaining more Native American students. The FNECC also hosted Native American Heritage Month in November. Among the activities that took place: a film series, lectures, and craft workshops. La Casa/Latino Cultural Center Established in 1973, La Casa/Latino Cultural Center provides advocacy, support, educational programming, and a central hub for students on the IU Bloomington campus. More than the programming it provides, La Casa is a haven for those who enter its doors. It is a community where students of all backgrounds can fully embrace the Latino culture, while finding access to the resources they need to succeed in school and beyond. The 2016-17 academic year was a period of tremendous growth for La Casa, which recorded nearly 15,000 visits and the implementation of several new initiatives. One of these initiatives is the Luis Davila Latinx Thematic Learning Community. Named after the late IU Bloomington professor, the learning community offers students a supportive space where they can immerse themselves in the history of the Latino community in the United States and abroad. Providing a Home Away From Home Located on IU's Bloomington campus, OVPDEMA's cultural centers\u2014the Asian Culture Center, the First Nations Educational & Cultural Center, La Casa/Latino Cultural Center, the LGBTQ+ Culture Center, and the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center\u2014serve as vital spaces for students, faculty, and staff, and the local community. Beyond their physical environment of providing students of every race and ethnicity a welcoming place of support, the cultural centers are an essential part of the educational experience at IU Bloomington. Students are able to learn about their own heritage and history, the cultures of other people, receive the resources they need to complete their education, find mentors, and much more. 27 26Recurring activities featuring guest speakers and events with student organizations are the norm at La Casa, but so too are collaborations with other organizations and campus entities. These partnerships and events include the National Hispanic Heritage Month, the LGBTQ+ Culture Center, and the FNECC for October's Day of the Dead celebration. The three culture centers also joined together for the traditional Latino celebration to honor deceased loved ones, with each center hosting activities for students, faculty, staff, and the community. LGBTQ+ Culture Center In the 2016-17 academic year, IU Bloomington's GLBT Student Support Services office became known as the LGBTQ+ Culture Center. The name change symbolizes the evolution of society, reflecting not only how students identify themselves, but the fact that the center is a place where the entire IU Bloomington community can learn about LGBTQ+ culture. This new-found transparency was made clear through many events over the course of the academic year, from working with students associated with the Jacobs School of Music, to holding a benefit concert honoring the victims of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, to collaborating with the Indiana Memorial Union (IMU) Board to host \"The Legacy Wall, \" an interactive display exhibited at the IMU highlighting the contributions of notable LGBTQ+ figures. The LGBTQ+ Culture Center received several honors for its work in 2016-17 , including recognition on the \"Best of the Best\" list as one of the nation's top-30 LGBTQ+-friendly campuses by Campus Pride and as one of the 50 best colleges for LGBTQ+ students by College Choice, an independent online publication.Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center The Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center (NMBCC), the oldest of IU Bloomington's cultural centers, continued to be a hub of activity on campus during the 2016-17 academic year. Programming such as the popular monthly Mid-Day House Party and November's First Friday Poetry Slam, which focused on sexual-assault prevention, were both well received, as students used the events to take a break from their studies. At the same time, the NMBCC continued to provide a space where individuals of all backgrounds could find cultural education and support of their development as scholars. Events such as the fall semester's Neal-Marshall Freshman Pinning Ceremony and the inaugural Neal-Marshall Leadership Academy demonstrate to new students that they have a community to lean on throughout their time at IU Bloomington. Meanwhile, culminating ceremonies such as the Fall Congratulatory Banquet for December graduates and May's Black Congratulatory Ceremony illustrate to new alumni that they will always be part of the university. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17African American Choral Ensemble Led by director Dr. Raymond Wise, the AAAI's African American Choral Ensemble continued its proud history of preserving the legacy of African American choral music\u2014including spirituals, folk forms, and traditional and contemporary gospel music. Following its 40th anniversary and a tour to Germany\u2014its first to Europe\u2014in spring 2016, the African American Choral Ensemble kicked off IU Bloomington's monthly First Thursdays event (the African American Dance Company and IU Soul Revue would perform in subsequent months) with a performance on the Fine Arts Plaza in September. The event provided exposure of the ensemble to a campuswide audience. The ensemble received high marks for its performance at the annual \"Potpourri of the Arts\" and the spring concert held at Bloomington's Buskirk-Chumley Theater. But perhaps its finest moment was April's \"Extensions of the T raditions\" concert, an annual showcase of the work of African American composers. At this performance, the piano of the late Camilla Williams, a world-renowned opera performer and the first African American member of the faculty in the vocal department in IU Bloomington's Jacobs School of Music, was dedicated by OVPDEMA Culture Centers AAAI alumna Janet Williams. The piano was later restored and is now permanently housed in IU Bloomington's Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center. Professor Emeritus Dr. James Mumford, who directed the African American Choral Ensemble and the IU Soul Revue, delivered a speech at the performance celebrating Williams' legacy. After the 2017 spring semester, Wise returned to Europe to teach gospel music in Germany and the Netherlands.Bringing IU's Diversity Center Stage The African American Arts Institute (AAAI) is the only institute of its kind in the country. Since 1974, it has provided opportunities for thousands of Indiana University students to explore their talents in performance, teaching, and arts management, while pursuing degrees across the university's expansive curriculum. A program of OVPDEMA at IU Bloomington, the AAAI remains committed to its mission of promoting and preserving African American culture through the performing arts. The AAAI is made up of three performing ensembles\u2014the African American Choral Ensemble, the African American Dance Company, and the IU Soul Revue\u2014that are offered as credit-bearing courses through IU's Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies. The 2016-17 academic year was an eventful period for the AAAI, featuring a number of exciting opportunities for students, faculty, and staff. Through its efforts to educate students about African American culture and, in some cases, prepare them for professional careers as performers, the AAAI continued its legacy as a unique, nationally recognized program in the performing arts. From the annual \"Potpourri of the Arts\" performance to the individual shows on campus and across the state, nation, and even other continents, the AAAI has earned a deserved reputation for sustained excellence. 28 29African American Dance Company The 2016-17 academic year served as the last for Professor Emerita Iris Rosa, the first director of the African American Dance Company. For more than 40 years, Rosa, who came to IU from Gary, Indiana, as a student in the Groups Scholars Program, taught generations of students about the art of dance from the perspective of the African diaspora. In her final year with the African American Dance Company, Rosa led her students on a trip to Beijing, China, in December for a cultural exchange with the School of Law and Humanities at China University of Mining and T echnology Beijing. While in China, the African American Dance Company held lectures and demonstrations, in addition to visiting cultural landmarks and interacting with their Chinese counterparts. They later shared their experiences with the campus community as part of IU Bloomington's \"China Remixed\" initiative in February. In July, shortly before her retirement, Rosa and the dance company visited Santiago, Cuba, for the Festival del Caribe, an international dance and festival. The visit came at the invitation of the Cuban Ministry of Culture. On their second international excursion of the academic year, students not only performed, but participated in classes with Cuban professional dancers and attended performances and lectures on the social, historical, and cultural aspects of the performing arts. On the Bloomington campus, the dance company hosted its 20th annual African Dance Company Dance Workshop and the ensemble's annual spring concert. A partnership with OVPDEMA's LGBTQ+ Culture Center provided a Vogue Lecture Demonstration. The dance company also performed at Stone Belt, a local service provider for individuals with developmental disabilities. Replacing Rosa as the director of the African American Dance Company is Stafford Berry, an accomplished artist, educator, activist, and scholar of African-rooted dance and theater. Berry, who comes to IU from Denison University in Ohio, serves as a professor of practice in AAADS and IU Bloomington's Department of Theater, Drama, and Contemporary Dance.IU Soul Revue Crystal T aliefero, an alumna of the ensemble, led the IU Soul Revue in the 2016-17 academic year. A native of Gary, Indiana, T aliefero is a world-renowned performer who has worked with artists such as John Mellencamp, Billy Joel, and Bruce Springsteen. Utilizing her vast connections in the music industry, T aliefero and the IU Soul Revue students traveled to Nashville, T ennessee, in April for a two-day trip featuring a studio recording session and a nightclub performance. The studio experience, in which students wrote and recorded a song in one day, gave them an education in the music business, while their performance\u2014in front of a packed house at a popular venue\u2014was favorably reviewed and provided exposure for the African American popular music ensemble in one of the nation's top music hubs. IU Soul Revue also held its annual spring concert at the Buskirk- Chumley Theater in April, as well as Camp S.O.U.L. The free, week-long camp for high school students was directed by Ignoisco Miles, an IU Bloomington graduate who now works professionally in the music industry. The campers, all aspiring performers who must send in an audition to be admitted into Camp S.O.U.L., stayed on the IU Bloomington campus throughout the week to rehearse for a show performed on the camp's final day. T aliefero stepped down as director of the IU Soul Revue in July 2017 to focus on her professional career. Former IU Soul Revue member and Herman C. Hudson Alumni Award recipient James Strong now oversees the program. Strong, an IU graduate and Indianapolis native who was mentored by Mumford, has had a successful professional career in the music industry for more than 20 years. Strong has recorded for top labels, performing in front of sold-out crowds at venues such as New Y ork City's Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden, and working with artists such as En Vogue, LL Cool J, New Edition, T oni Braxton, and the late T upac Shakur. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17 OVPDEMA Community Partnerships & Engagement A Place Where Y ou Belong A college experience at Indiana University means many things. T op-ranking academics. A diverse campus culture. A welcoming learning environment that supports faculty and student success. Innovative degree programs. Schools that evolve with changing job markets. Community & School Partnerships (CSP), a program of OVPDEMA, is dedicated to helping students, especially those from minority and underrepresented populations, take advantage of all the opportunities that a postsecondary education has to offer. Part of this commitment includes connecting pre-college students and their families to various programs and experiences that help make the college transition to IU as smooth as possible. From pairing junior high and high school students with current IU students for \"near-peer\" perspectives of IU to campus tours that focus on a specific area of study, these initiatives are designed to inform and inspire. 30 31Dr. James Holland's Legacy in STEM Dr. James P . Holland's passing in 1998 left a long legacy at Indiana University, the institution where he received his master's and Ph.D. degrees, taught for 30 years, and made an impact on countless students. Holland's influence continues to live on through the Hudson & Holland Scholars Program (also named for Dr. Herman C. Hudson, another legendary IU Bloomington professor) and a trio of programs for high school students: The James Holland Summer Enrichment Program (SEP), the James Holland Summer Science Research Program (SSRP), and the James Holland Research Initiative in STEM Education (RISE). Holland established SEP to give promising and high-performing underrepresented minority students an opportunity to explore the STEM fields and take a deeper dive into the world of science. He later tapped one of his former IU students, Mary Ann T ellas, to help him run the program. The summer science camps have become a highly successful CSP initiative in partnership with the Department of Biology. A total of 75 students in the programs receive hands-on research experience from IU professors, under the direction of Dr. Armin Mozcek, while residing on the IU Bloomington campus at no cost. Other CSP Programs Another CSP summer program, July's Integrated Program in the Environment's Summer Experience in Sustainability and the Environment (SESE), provided 14 underrepresented minority high school students with the opportunity to explore the environmental and sustainability disciplines while residing on the IU Bloomington campus. CSP also partnered with IU Bloomington's Office of Admissions and the First Nations Educational & Cultural Center, an OVPDEMA program, to meet with the Red Cloud Indian School in an effort to increase Native American representation at IU. The Red Cloud Indian School boasts the highest number of Gates Millennium Scholars Program recipients per capita in the country. In a partnership with another OVPDEMA program, the Asian Culture Center, CSP began researching opportunities for student engagement and social activism for underrepresented minority students in OVPDEMA programs. This initiative included a presentation at the IU Southeast Diversity Research Symposium that involved several campus partners. In terms of other community outreach, CSP met with 14 leaders of Bloomington-area faith-based organizations to discuss partnerships with IU to expose local youth to pre-college opportunities. In addition, CSP earned a \"Champion of the Community\" designation by Northwest Community High School.Community & Student Engagement Community & Student Engagement (CSE) also is a program based on the IU Bloomington campus. CSE works within the community through civic organizations and nonprofit groups using volunteerism and leadership development to help educate underrepresented minority students on the tenets of social justice. Inclusion is one of CSE's core principles, as evidenced by its work on initiatives such as the Noah's Ark Interfaith Project. This project created a gathering space for 85 individuals to have in-depth discussions about religion in small-group settings. The individuals and entities included the Baha'I faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, St. Mark's United Methodist Church of Bloomington, the Beth Shalom Congregation of Bloomington, and IU faculty and staff. As part of a statewide initiative by the Indiana State Commission on the Social Status of Black Males, CSE collaborated with the Bloomington Commission on the Status of Black Males and the IU Bloomington School of Public Health for a Black Barbershop Health Fair in April. More than 50 participants were screened for diabetes, hypertension, body/mass index (BMI), colorectal cancer, HIV, and spinal health. Health-related providers included IU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), the City of Bloomington's health education programs, the Monroe County Health Department, the Osmon Chiropractic Center, and the South Central Community Action Program. CSE's involvement in additional community initiatives include the City of Bloomington's Community Health Fair in April; Bloomington United, a coalition of local social justice groups; a successful campaign to ban school lunch shaming in local schools; a diversity advisory team focusing on the Monroe County Community School Corporation; the Commission on the Status of Children and Y outh; and the Martin Luther King Jr. Commission.Community & School Partnerships During the 2016-17 academic year, CSP interacted with more than 1,300 pre-college students through a variety of programs and initiatives. One of these efforts included outreach at the 2016 Indiana Black Expo and Indiana Latino Expo events. Nearly 1,200 students from greater Indianapolis school districts pre-registered for each event's \"21st Century Scholars Days\" programming. In September, CSP launched the IU Bound program. A partnership between OVPDEMA, the Indianapolis Public Schools, and the Center for Leadership Development, the program selects 15 underrepresented minority high school students who are registered as 21st Century Scholars to build relationships with IU through monthly meetings over the course of the year. The program provides these individuals with an academic pathway from high school to college, with the goal of obtaining an affordable education at one of the state's top public universities. The initiative's initial success resulted in it receiving a $15,000 grant from the Women's Philanthropy Leadership Council to increase programming efforts. In collaboration with the Bloomington-based Crestmont Boys and Girls Club, CSP created the Visit IU Program. Small groups of high school students toured the IU campus, visited residence halls, and learned about many programs and resources on campus. Presentations were provided by the Office of Admissions, the Office of Financial Aid, the School of Public Health, the Maurer School of Law, the School of Fine Arts, and the Media School, as well as programming from the First Nations Educational & Cultural Center, La Casa/Latino Cultural Center, the LGBTQ+ Culture Center, and the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center. Other experiences provided by CSP to pre-college students included the annual Spring Shadow Program in which students visited the IU Bloomington campus for three days and two nights. Guests who visited in April shadowed current IU Bloomington students, observing them in classes, at work, and in extracurricular activities, while receiving information about the IU admissions process and scholarship opportunities. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17OVPDEMA Development and Sponsorship An Investment in the Future While maintaining a welcoming environment for students of all backgrounds and providing the resources and support needed for their academic success are central to OVPDEMA's mission, two aspects are equally critical: development and sponsorship. By serving as a partner for the programming taking place on all IU campuses and investing in the future of current and prospective IU students, OVPDEMA is active in both creating co-curricular opportunities that benefit students and impact the future growth of the university. 32 33Student Focused Though every initiative that occurred during the 2016-17 academic year isn't highlighted in this report, we are pleased to highlight a few examples of how OVPDEMA is prioritizing the needs of IU students through its development and sponsorship efforts. In addition to the 8,500 students at all IU campuses who are supported by OVPDEMA's scholarship programs\u2014including the 21st Century Scholars Program, the Groups Scholars Program, and the Hudson & Holland Scholars Program\u2014need-based scholarships totaling approximately $675,000 were awarded by OVPDEMA in the 2016-17 academic year. An example of OVPDEMA scholarship support is the Adam W. Herbert Presidential Scholars Program. The effort is funded by a $10 million grant from the Lilly Endowment and is administered by OVPDEMA's Community & School Partnerships program. The scholarship program was created by IU President Emeritus Adam W. Herbert during his tenure at the university. Originally called the Hoosier Presidential Scholars Program, it was renamed in 2007 by the IU Board of T rustees to honor Herbert and his commitment to recruiting and retaining talented young Hoosiers. The Adam W. Herbert Presidential Scholars Program targets some of the most distinguished high school students in the state of Indiana. Up to 40 incoming freshmen are designated Herbert Presidential Scholars across all IU campuses each year. Many of these recipients have gone on to establish a wide range of successful careers, proudly representing their alma mater throughout the world. Another OVPDEMA scholarship program is the Carrie Parker T aylor Scholarship. Established in 2015, the scholarship is named after IU's first African American female student, Carrie Parker T aylor. T aylor wasn't able to complete her studies at IU Bloomington due to financial need, so the scholarship bearing her name is earmarked for low-income, first-generation students who are a 21st Century Scholar, Groups Scholar, or Hudson & Holland Scholar. Now in its second year, the first Carrie Parker T aylor Scholarship was awarded to Stacy Hardy. Hardy, who left school after her freshman year because of financial hardship and other challenges, persevered to return and excel as an IU Bloomington student. IU also reconnected with members of Carrie Parker T aylor's family and, in 2017 , T aylor's portrait was unveiled in the Indiana Memorial Union. A new OVPDEMA development initiative designed to promote IU's culture of giving is the Black Philanthropy Circle (BPC). Created in the spring of 2017 , the BPC strives to improve the higher education odds for black students with academic and career support, scholarship opportunities, and programming. Specifically, the effort will drive funding to build a leadership pipeline for students attending IU through learning experiences and opportunities addressing essential access and attainment priorities, as well as develop efforts to promote success for and diversity among faculty and staff. While still in its early stages, the BPC is poised to be a transformative initiative that supports diversity and inclusion at IU and generates additional opportunities for students, faculty, and staff.Partnerships Create Opportunities OVPDEMA is committed to serving as a collaborative partner and sponsor for an assortment of programming throughout IU and in the community. This long-standing commitment was evident in the 2016-17 academic year, with OVPDEMA's involvement in 72 programs and an investment of more than $100,000. The focus of these efforts included campus climate, retention, outreach, and advocacy. One of OVPDEMA's sponsorships took place in March. The event, \"Violent Intersections: Women of Color in the Age of T rump, \" included Amrita Chakrabarti Myers, IU Bloomington's Ruth N. Halls associate professor of history and gender studies and a recipient of one of OVPDEMA's 2017 Martin Luther King Jr. Building Bridges Award. The event served as a \"teach-in, \" featuring a panel presentation, town hall-style discussion, and a social justice fair open to the campus community and local residents of Bloomington. OVPDEMA also served as a sponsor for the Dance Theatre of Harlem's 2017 residency at IU, which reached the Bloomington, IUPUI, and South Bend campuses. Nearly 500 students, faculty, staff, and members of the community attended performances by the famed African American dance company. When the resident troupe arrived at IU Bloomington, not only did students in the IU African American Dance Company have the opportunity to interact with their professional peers, but OVPDEMA sponsored a trip for IU Northwest students to enjoy the event, as well. Inclusion for All When people think of OVPDEMA, there's a tendency to focus on diversity as it relates to race and ethnicity on Indiana University's campuses. But inclusion also is a critical aspect of OVPDEMA's mission. For instance, OVPDEMA is a vocal supporter of various efforts that take place at IU during National Disability Employment Awareness Month in October. This period of time is dedicated to celebrating the contributions of workers with disabilities and generating awareness about the value of a workforce inclusive of their skills and talents. OVPDEMA believes this focus on fostering a more inclusive workforce\u2014one where every person is recognized for his or her abilities every day of every month\u2014 is paramount to building a campus community that embraces everyone. Accessibility gives employees the opportunity to maximize their talents. This in turn benefits everyone. Potential employees with disabilities shouldn't feel dissuaded from working at IU. Support is the rule, not the exception at IU. This includes understanding obstacles facing people with disabilities on a daily basis and attempting to go above and beyond to address any issues. This same approach applies to students who are military veterans. The Division of Student Affairs' Veteran Support Services and its offices on each IU campus excel when it came to serving student-veterans. The university as a whole offers a range of services for veterans, including IU's Student Veterans of America group, a student organization, healthcare, counseling and psychological services, disability and rehabilitation programs, adult student resources, tutoring legal services, community resources, and access to military networks. Looking ahead, IU will continue its commitment to educating those who have served our country and helping them use their Veteran Education Benefits to transition from the military to campus life. IU Veterans and Individuals With DisabilitiesOFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17IU Bloomington 35The Ideal College Experience IU President Michael A. McRobbie is fond of saying that great public universities educate students for what lies beyond the horizon. As the world around us changes, what we teach and the manner in which we teach also must evolve. As the flagship campus of Indiana University, IU Bloomington exemplifies innovation, creativity, diversity, and inclusion. It believes in creating a truly welcoming academic environment that supports faculty and student success, embraces all cultures, and increases the contributions of everyone who walks through the Sample Gates at Indiana and Kirkwood Avenue. That focus is reflected in IU Bloomington receiving a 2017 Institutional Excellence in Diversity Award from the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, an honor that recognizes institutions in higher education for \"demonstrating measurable progress in promoting and sustaining innovative diversity efforts within their campus community. \" IU Bloomington also was honored for the second time with a 2016 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the oldest and largest diversity-focused publication in higher education. The magazine recognized IU Bloomington for its \"strong commitment to diversity and inclusion through innovative programs, hiring practices, training, curricula, and on-campus support systems. \" Additionally, IU Bloomington was named to Campus Pride's 2017 \"Best of the Best\" list of the top-25 LGBTQ-friendly colleges and universities in the U.S. The Bloomington campus also received recognition as one of the 50 best colleges for LGBTQ+ students by the independent online publication, College Choice, for its resources and services dedicated to LGBTQ+ students.Growing a More Diverse Faculty A true campus community should represent all types of individuals from all walks of life. IU Bloomington's leadership embraces this vision and is committed to developing a more diverse faculty on campus. IU Bloomington continues to make inroads in this area, increasing its minority faculty members by 47 percent from 2005 to 2015. This progress is the result of hard work and continued effort on the part of IU Bloomington's administration to bring individuals on board who mirror the students they teach. Initiatives to improve faculty diversity include a workshop held in the fall 2016 semester in which 120 faculty members, department chairs, and deans of schools learned about the effects of implicit bias in hiring practices for prospective faculty from an external group representing ADVANCE, a National Science Foundation program. Led by IU Bloomington's offices of the vice provost for educational inclusion and diversity and the associate vice provost for faculty development and diversity, the mandatory workshop targeted every faculty hiring committee on campus. This meant at least one member was required to attend the session in order for the committee to receive approval to hire any new faculty. In addition to educating faculty on ways to widen the pool of applicants for openings and giving them the tools to bring about change, each of the schools on the IU Bloomington campus developed a comprehensive diversity plan focusing on faculty. These plans included a mission statement describing how diversity is fundamental to the work they do, best practices to ensure they adhere to that mission, measures and accountability such as a survey quantifying whether the school's faculty has increased in diversity, and an annual report on diversity.\"The impact of the training has been phenomenal, and the best diversity plans came from the deans conducting stakeholder outreach to make faculty feel invested in the process, \" says John Nieto-Phillips, IU Bloomington's vice provost for diversity and inclusion, associate vice president for the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs, and chief diversity officer. \"The fact that there's even a conversation about diversity signals to people that the campus administration is taking the issue seriously. \" A Focus on Recruitment Indeed, IU Bloomington has nearly doubled the number of underrepresented minority faculty members in disciplines and departments where they are underrepresented from eight in the 2015-16 academic year to 15 in 2016-17 . This is only the beginning, however, and part of a sustained initiative funded by the IU Bloomington Office of the Provost and OVPDEMA. While IU Bloomington continues to experience growth in the number of underrepresented minority students enrolling on campus, recruiting and retaining faculty with diverse cultural points of view will only contribute to the university's mission of serving students of all backgrounds from Indiana, the United States, and worldwide. \"Recruiting and retaining underrepresented faculty helps recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, \" explains Nieto-Phillips. \"Non-minority students are being immersed in subjects they weren't necessarily familiar with before, while students of color have access to role models who look like them. \" For most doctoral students, losing a parent and becoming the guardian of two younger siblings might affect one's studies. But not for Stephanie Huezo. After her mother's tragic death in 2015, the Bronx, New Y ork, native brought her two brothers to live with her in Bloomington while continuing to pursue a Ph.D. in history and a minor in Latino Studies. She not only kept up with her academic work, but thrived. Huezo, whose family hails from El Salvador, has made a significant impact on the community, both on campus and in Bloomington by participating in events at La Casa/Latino Cultural Center and becoming a member of the Latino/a Graduate Student Association and the Emissaries for Graduate Diversity Program. She joined a local Catholic church (where she sings in the choir and has become the godmother to the daughter of another member of the congregation), and volunteered with local organization Escuelita Para T odos. Among the honors she's received since coming to IU Bloomington: the 2016 John H. Edwards Fellowship, the 2016 Won Joon Y oon Scholarship, the 2017 Rev. Ernest Butler Humanitarian Scholarship, and the Bloomington Volunteer Network's 2017 Be More Award. Although Huezo made some sacrifices to care for her brothers\u2014one of whom will be an IU Bloomington freshman in the 2017- 18 academic year\u2014she wouldn't change a thing. \"I chose IU because of the community, support, and financial stability. At first, being in Bloomington was hard, \" says Huezo, who spent the summer of 2017 in El Salvador and Washington, D.C., to conduct research for her dissertation on Salvadoran history. \"But by the end of my first year, I felt like I found my community inside and outside the university.\"If it wasn't for my Bloomington community, I don't think I would have been able to accomplish all that I have, \" adds Huezo, who already has a position lined up after graduation as a fellow at Washington, D.C. 's Smithsonian Museum. \"People say it takes a village to raise a child. I've learned here that it indeed does. \" Resilient Ph.D. Student Embodies IU Bloomington's Spirit of Generosity Increase of minority faculty from 2005 to 2015. White faculty decreased by 3% during the same period.47% IU Bloomington is honored by the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education for demonstrating measurable progress in promoting and sustaining innovative campus diversity efforts.2017 Institutional Excellence in Diversity Award 34OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17A Foundation of Diversity America's workforce is more diverse than ever, with the percentage of the working-age population comprised of members of minority groups expected to increase from 34 percent to 55 percent by 2050. Diversity is woven into all aspects of the IUPUI culture. Students, staff, and faculty reflect not only the surrounding community, but also the global community at large. Based in the state capital and the largest city in Indiana, IUPUI leadership believes that it is not enough to simply build a diverse campus culture. Everyone within the institution must commit to its sustained progress. T o that end, IUPUI offers a variety of programs designed to benefit all members of its academic community, including a wide range of learning support services, leadership and cultural training, and scholarships. As a result of its work, IUPUI has been honored with the Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT into Diversity magazine five years in a row. The magazine, the oldest and largest diversity-focused publication in higher education, recognized IUPUI for its strong commitment to diversity and inclusion through innovative programs, hiring practices, training, curricula, and on-campus support systems. IUPUI is indeed making major strides when it comes to diversifying its student population. The overall percentage of minority students rose to nearly 26 percent in the 2016-2017 academic year, with enrollment of first-year, beginning African American students increasing by 40 percent over the previous year and by 13 percent for Latino/Hispanic students. Some of this minority enrollment growth can be attributed to new staff in the admissions department and state-of-the-art on-campus residential housing. Improved recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students play a role as well, along with need-based scholarships and in-depth, holistic support for students through programs such as the Diversity Enrichment and Achievement Program (DEAP).IUPUI 37 36Nearly 400 DEAP students were enrolled at IUPUI in the 2016-17 academic year, including more than 200 freshmen. Originally created as the Office of Student Success to improve the graduation rates of IUPUI's underrepresented minority students, DEAP is a cohort experience that provides students with a two-week summer bridge experience before their first year on campus. When IUPUI Chancellor Nasser Paydar instituted pledge grant awards, which are given to students with unmet financial need, DEAP became one of the programs they could turn to for extra financial support. DEAP staff members include a program director and three coordinators who help students transition to college, provide peer mentoring, advise IUPUI student organizations, and offer academic and career support. In the fall semester of the 2017- 18 academic year, DEAP will have a residential-based learning community in North Hall, IUPUI's newest residential dormitory. Thirty-six students and a graduate assistant will coordinate cultural and academic programming. \"One of the main of factors of success for students of color is creating a sense of community and maintaining an environment that they feel is their own. At DEAP , we start very early through the summer bridge program, \" explains Eric Williams, DEAP program director. \"That supportive community consists of their peers in the same cohort, their upperclass peer mentors, and our staff, and lasts until they graduate. Students develop a bond with staff and with one another, which makes it much easier to provide services that benefit them. \" Represents increase of minority faculty from 2005 to 2015. By comparison, white faculty decreased by 6%.40% Inspiration Found IUPUI introduced the IUPUI Diversity Speaker Series in the 2016- 17 academic year, bringing in notable guests from a variety of backgrounds to engage both the campus and local communities as a part of IUPUI's campus diversity plan. One of the speakers was Wes Moore, author of the bestselling memoir, \"The Other Wes Moore. \" The book is based on Moore's life growing up in Baltimore, his career as a U.S. Army veteran and aide to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and his current work as a youth advocate and business leader. Moore's appearance in November coincided with the conclusion of the book and lecture program for students in IUPUI's University College first-year seminar classes. Students in these courses read and discussed Moore's book prior his visit. When he arrived on campus, they were inspired by the author's poignant journey. Dr. Pamella Shaw, the IU School of Dentistry's associate dean for diversity, equity, and inclusion, is passionate about issues involving students, particularly students with disabilities. One of three recipients of IUPUI's Advocates for Equity in Ability Award, Shaw makes it a priority to ensure that accommodations are provided to students who need them. \"Students with a disability may have a fear of doing certain work, \" says Shaw, who has a child with a disability and a disability herself. \"Sometimes, students may feel their requests for more time or a quiet place to take a test are an imposition to faculty. There's still a fear that their peers and others in the profession may look down on them because they can't do something because of their disability, but we are making a difference. \" Shaw, who became the dental school's chief diversity officer in 2013, has implemented a process where after identifying a need, students are directed to her office, then to IUPUI's Office of Adaptive Education Services (AES). AES provides Shaw's office with the necessary information, including the student's accommodations, and a member of Shaw's staff communicates with a faculty member who instructs the student. When An Advocate and Mentor for Students With Disabilities the student has to take an academic assessment, the faculty gives Shaw's office a password, and the student can take his or her exam in a computer lab established by Shaw without having to be in the classroom. \"We handle it all, so the student doesn't have to worry about going into the classroom and making the faculty feel like they have more to do, \" explains Shaw, who also is a member of the Down Syndrome Indiana board. \"Being an advocate for these students is so important because our curriculum is challenging and students don't always know how to advocate for themselves. \"It has nothing to do with a student's intelligence. If we can make it easier for them to get through a program and to be able to practice dentistry, then why not?\" she continues. \"As long as I'm here, I'm going to do as much as I can. \"Moore listened to students share their own experiences and how they could relate to elements of his upbringing. He also spent time talking to students and members of the community about his path at a post-lecture reception. Audience members at the event not only typified the diversity of the IUPUI campus, but also the city of Indianapolis and even other regions of the state, as some attendees made the trip from outside of the metropolitan area. \"It's important for our students to have these conversations, \" says Dr. Karen Dace, IUPUI's vice chancellor for diversity, equity, and inclusion. \"But it's not just us, and it shouldn't happen in this little vacuum. That is why we wanted to create a series that would also engage the community. This is one of many ideas to come from our diversity plan. \" IUPUI 2016-1 7 First-Y ear Students 40 % African AmericanLatino13%OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Diversity is Everyone's Responsibility Located in Richmond, Indiana, IU East is an inclusive and welcoming campus that recognizes, celebrates, and embraces differences to ensure every group is validated, represented, and supported. Its diversity efforts have grown considerably in the past decade, evidence of which can be seen in the increased diversity of each incoming class of new students. Indeed, the diversity of IU East's student population on campus now outpaces the surrounding community. But statistics alone can't explain the growth of IU East. Programming geared toward diversity and inclusion and the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students attest to the progress of the institution's diversity efforts. Thanks to its Diversity Events Coordinating Committee, IU East has created a myriad of activities designed to both emphasize diversity and inclusion and educate the campus community. But perhaps no event during the 2016-17 academic year has been better received than Martin Luther King Jr. Day programming. IU Bloomington graduate Shawn Harper, now a renowned diversity scholar, came to the IU East campus in January to deliver a lecture for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day community breakfast. His presence served to inspire students, as did his discussion of topics that included personal responsibility, rising to the occasion, hard work, and making an impact on the world. Harper's personal story of overcoming learning disabilities struck a chord with many of those in attendance. The event garnered the IU East \"Wolf Wave, \" which is an honor of recognition named after the campus mascot, the Red Wolves.IU East 38 39Other efforts to promote diversity include the restructuring of IU East's Diversity Events Coordinating Committee. Starting with the 2017-18 academic year, schools or departments at IU East will host a semester or an entire academic year of diversity and inclusion programming. The initiative will launch with the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). For the fall semester, HSS has selected the theme of immigration; in the spring, the focus will be on Native American culture. \"This strategy benefits our campus in a number of ways. It addresses our Carnegie Engagement Classification application and Higher Learning Commission requirements, but it also gives us a streamlined focus regarding events, \" says Latishea Varnesdeel, IU East's chief diversity officer and special assistant to the chancellor. \"We understand that diversity needs to extend into the classroom, so this helps us reach a bigger audience. Diversity is everyone's responsibility on this campus. \" Supporting Student Success While the IU East campus mainly serves students from its service region, a substantial number of students are not from the area. They are both student-athletes and underrepresented minorities. Recruiting underrepresented minorities and international students to campus is only part of the job, as IU East makes sure students feel welcomed and supported once they arrive by providing resources to help inside and outside of the classroom.Growing up in Richmond, Indiana, T aylor Webster envisioned leaving her hometown to attend college. But after becoming a 21st Century Scholar\u2014Indiana's four-year, full-tuition scholarship program\u2014Webster decided to stay close to home. Now, after two years at IU East, she's never regretted her decision. \"I applied to more than 20 colleges out of high school, but IU East gave me the best financial-aid package. Coming from a really small high school\u2014I graduated with eight other students in my graduating class\u2014I didn't really know how I was going to fit in at a huge school. \" Webster recalls. \"I wanted to go to law school and I didn't want to take out too many loans as an undergraduate. After I allowed myself to get involved and opened my heart to the campus, I quickly realized that coming to IU East is the best decision I ever made. \" A political science major, Webster is drawn to both diversity issues and community organizations. Getting involved at IU East was a given for her. The junior is a participant in IU East's honors program, an intern in the athletic department (in addition to occasional scorekeeping duties), an admissions ambassador, and a peer mentor in IU East's first-year seminar. Heading into the 2017-18 academic year, she will serve as vice president of the Student Government Association. As a child, Webster attended a camp hosted by IU East's multicultural affairs office for students of color and wanted to become involved as a college student. After learning, however, that the office no longer existed, she attended a meeting of IU East's diversity commission committee and spoke to the chancellor and other campus officials about starting a student organization for diverse student populations on campus. Webster's suggestion was eagerly embraced by the administration. Since then, Webster has located a faculty advisor for her group and attended the National Conference On Race and Ethnicity (NCORE) annual national conference in Fort Worth, T exas. The experience left her with even more ideas. \"NCORE was extremely eye-opening. At NCORE, I got to be around people from all different backgrounds. It really helped push me along my path and see what's out there, \" she says. \"What I really want out of the club is for us to come up with ideas about what we want to see changed, and for me to be able to get those ideas to the administration. I've put myself in an interesting role and position to be a liaison between people of color on campus and the administration. I think every college campus benefits when there's diversity, and you have people with different experiences and different backgrounds on campus. \"Creating Change on Campus \"I meet with the first-year student-athletes throughout the first semester, sometimes into the second semester, every other week. The first thing I try to do is establish a relationship of some sort and make sure they understand my role as an extra support system on campus for them, \" says Roxie Deer, an IU East University College student success coach and a Richmond native. \"We talk about grades, mapping out study schedules, their lives, their teammates, time management\u2014just very honest conversations about having academic success, \" \"Y ou're not just seeing Richmond High School graduates at IU East, \" she says. \"Y ou're seeing people from all over the country coming in, and now even students from outside of the country. It feels much more diverse and accepting. It's great to see students hanging out on the quad, and there's just a good vibe. \" 11.4 % Minority Students Enrolled2016 Minority Student Enrollment$ $7. 5 % Campus Goal Minority faculty has more than doubled between 2005-2015.OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17A Campus Commitment to Change IU Kokomo's strong push to recruit students from diverse backgrounds is yielding positive results, as evidenced by its increasing number of underrepresented minority students on campus. IU Kokomo faculty and staff are committed to serving students, and the campus offers a breadth of services and programming to demonstrate this commitment. A variety of new programming has helped to advance diversity and inclusion during the 2016-17 academic year. Shortly after the fall semester, the campus hosted its second annual Culture Bash. This international festival is designed to celebrate different nationalities comprising the IU Kokomo community. More than 300 people attended the September event of food, fun, and entertainment, while also learning more about their fellow students, faculty, staff and Kokomo-area residents. The Equality Project, now in its third year, is another IU Kokomo initiative that brings together the entire campus. A collaboration with the campus media and marketing team, the Equality Project is a photo exhibition that displays black-and-white head shots of students, faculty, and staff accompanied with their answers to the question, \"What does equality mean to you?\" Inspired by a previous traveling art exhibit, \"A Peace of My Mind, \" the Equality Project is a unique way for members of the campus community to see firsthand the diversity of race, ethnicity, opinions, and ideas within their own community. IU Kokomo also held a diversity training series for faculty and staff, including LGBTQ+ Safe Zone training and certification. Approximately 30 faculty and staff attended the session, which was facilitated by an IUPUI employee. Attendees are now registered nationally, enabling prospective and current students to know who on campus is certified. \"Our campus diversity committee and Office of Campus Diversity have helped coordinate many of these events. These groups have wide representation throughout campus, so I think it shows how eager IU Kokomo is to continue broadening our horizons, in terms of diversity and inclusion, \" says Sarah Sarber, IU Kokomo chief of staff and chief diversity officer. Increased Diversity Cultivated Through Sustained Efforts At 13.3 percent of the student population, IU Kokomo has reached its highest level of underrepresented minority students on campus in a decade. This growth is on pace to continue when examining the number of admitted Latino and African American students for the upcoming 2017-18 academic year. The progress is a result of hard work and a continued push to recruit and enroll more student populations. For example, as a result of the campus diversity planning process and the feedback provided by the university-wide comprehensive study conducted by external firm Halualani and Associates, IU Kokomo started hosting targeted campus visits for prospective Latino students and their families. When sending invitations for campus tours, IU Kokomo gives students the option of having a Spanish-speaking tour, an initiative that's been received enthusiastically. IU Kokomo also started family nights in the surrounding communities with higher Latino resident populations. One of these events occurred in Frankfort, Indiana, with a bilingual admissions representative and a bilingual student among the campus representatives. Admissions materials were handed out, and discussions took place regarding the IU Kokomo campus, its services, and activities. IU Kokomo also is the host site of the Indiana Latino Conference in the spring of 2018, giving the school another opportunity to showcase its welcoming and diverse campus. \"We've been working on these initiatives for a while, following the Halualani study, \" says Sarber. \"And it's nice to see the hard work and ideas from faculty, staff, administrators, and students finally coming full circle. \" IU Kokomo 40 41Dr. Rosalyn Davis, a clinical assistant professor of psychology, wears many hats at IU Kokomo. There's her teaching, where she integrates diversity into the curriculum. Then there is her role as a mentor for students. She's also heavily involved in numerous diversity efforts on campus. These and other initiatives were behind her nomination for the Chancellor's Diversity Excellence Award in the 2016-17 academic year. One example demonstrating Davis' diversity commitment is a course she taught on multicultural issues, counseling values, and cross-cultural interactions. The goal was to help students become more aware of biases. The first time she taught the class, she gave students the project of being diversity experts and working in groups to support an initiative to increase diversity messaging and outreach. The students decided to support their LGBTQ+ peers on campus. As part of their project, they created a flyer highlighting resources and information for LGBTQ+ students, as well as donated materials to the IU Kokomo Student Life office. They also took it a step further, relaunching the then-disbanded campus Gay/Straight Alliance, now named Spectrum. \"When I teach, I make a habit of trying to incorporate a lot of different perspectives on why something may exist the way it does and what opportunities or lack of opportunities may be present for different communities or different groups of people, \" says Davis. \"I want to encourage students to look beyond the initial source of information they receive because there's usually a back story that they are not looking into. \" Davis shares her own experiences as an underrepresented minority in higher education and the community, something that has endeared her to the students who seek out her guidance. Whether it's through her work with the Community- Academic Consortium for Research on Alternative Sexualities, the American Psychological Association's Division 17 , or the African American women who view her as a role model, Davis gives her heart and soul to students. Davis is equally passionate about using An Example to Students and Peers her voice to help IU Kokomo in its quest to continue improving its campus climate. She is a frequent attendee at academic conferences, bringing back innovative practices to share with colleagues. Between contributing to the campus diversity plan, serving as the affirmative action liaison for the IU Kokomo faculty senate, leading the charge on issues like faculty diversity, and participating on several committees, it's clear Davis is determined to help IU Kokomo reach its potential when it comes to diversity and inclusion. \"I think the campus has made a big effort to make sure we're looking at things more broadly, who we impact, and what we're doing. People are willing to listen. They are thinking about how to network with the community in different ways. I think we're making key inroads, \" notes Davis. IU Kokomo has experienced its largest enrollment of minority students in a decade. 13.3 % Number of students who are 21st Century Scholars.521 OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17to serve in whatever capacity that I could, whether it was just volunteering or in my most recent role as student body president, \" says Anokwute, who is a member of the council's Diversity Strategic Priority Sub-Committee. \"Making sure that everybody on our campus was able to see somebody successful who looked like them was important for me. That was one of the main points we were looking at, making sure that our student population can see faculty and staff who look like them and are successful in their fields. \" Anokwute clearly practices his ideals. This can be seen in his efforts to establish a prayer and/or meditation quiet space on campus. This idea had initially been requested by several of IU Northwest's Muslim students.Bringing Out the Best in Students, Faculty From day one on the IU Northwest campus, students learn to appreciate the differences and the perspectives of others\u2014and to integrate those experiences into their studies and lives. Located in northwest Indiana, known locally as \"The Region, \" the commuter campus has become a progressive example of diversity and inclusion. IU Northwest is the most diverse of Indiana University's campuses: its 2016 minority student enrollment reached 44.6 percent. While located only a few miles from Chicago, the campus is fully ensconced in IU tradition with its own flavor and personality. For instance, the first-year experience initiatives at IU Northwest are undergoing a period of tremendous growth and development. This includes creating an advising center for first-year students and those with undeclared majors; hiring advisors and training faculty on coaching sessions to help students find solutions to their challenges; participating in the university-wide commitment to implementing degree mapping; and establishing four summer bridge programs, one of which is designed to help new students of color adjust to college life. Efforts to increase recruitment, retention, and graduation rates are an essential part of IU Northwest's plan to promote a culture of faculty engagement, in addition to other high-impact practices designed to meet the needs of students and help them reach their educational goals. From the moment students arrive on campus, they encounter a welcoming environment via IU Northwest's new student orientation. The initiative has been enhanced by emphasizing the use of student ambassadors so that the program is more student-friendly. And, once students begin their classes, IU Northwest's academic advisors are available to support any challenges they may face in the classroom.\"It's been encouraging to see the amount of support faculty members have been giving to our diversity programs in the past academic year, \" says James Wallace, IU Northwest's director of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs (ODEMA). \"From offering students extra credit to attend the events ODEMA hosts to participating in an opportunity we've developed called Diversity Fellows, we are creating ways to encourage faculty to insert diversity into the curriculum. Many of these events are well attended, with people stopping by to have conversations. There's just been a lot more activity within the past year. \" One Book Program Unites a Campus During the 2016-17 academic year, the literature selected for IU Northwest's annual One Book program was the acclaimed \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. \" Given the national debate concerning health care, conversations about the issues in the book began happening organically. The book's focus on diversity and inclusion, health and financial disparities, ethics, and racial inequality captured the attention of students. Moreover, films about similar medical procedures were shown to students. The highlight of the effort entailed an on-campus visit by the Lacks' family for a lecture in March. This event, which occurred shortly before the premiere of the movie adaptation starring Oprah Winfrey, garnered regional media attention. \"Some people hadn't thought about the issues as deeply as we had an opportunity to think about them, so they certainly became more aware of the importance, \" notes Wallace. \"The book touched so many interests and topics that it made it ideal for our campus to select. \" IU Northwest 42 43A Community of Learning Chiamara Anokwute describes his three-year experience at IU Northwest (he graduated a year early) this way, \"It is a community. \" For some students, this might seem a bit scripted. But for Anokwute, who followed in the footsteps of five older siblings at IU Northwest, the sentiment is heartfelt. Born in Nigeria, Anokwute moved to Merrillville, Indiana, as a five-year-old child. He chose IU Northwest not only because of the recommendations of his siblings, but also after meeting the dean of the campus' medical school at IU Northwest's Freshman to Physician event during his senior year of high school. Anokwute participated in a myriad of activities at IU Northwest, such as serving as president of the Student Government Association, serving on the IU Northwest Council as a student representative, and even running for the school's cross-country team. He also prepared for his future profession by conducting microbiology research at the School of Medicine, working as a Minority Opportunity for Research Experience fellow, and participating in the medical school's International Human Cadaver Prosection Program. \"At IU Northwest, I fell in love with being part of the community and being able The percentage of Latino/ Hispanic students enrolled at IU Northwest. 21.6 % 44.6 % Minority Students Enrolled2016 Minority Student Enrollment$ $ 38.3 % Campus Goal\"As a student government member, we researched prayer rooms and meditation spaces at other universities in the United States. We decided the best way to approach it was to make it inclusive for anybody, not just looking at necessarily one religious point of view, \" says Anokwute, who also championed a sexual-assault awareness campaign during his time on campus. \"I put a committee together, we wrote some legislation, and brought it before student government. After voting on it, I was able to take it to the IU Northwest Council, \" he adds. As he prepares for life after IU Northwest, Anokwute will take the lessons he's learned as an undergraduate and apply them to his future. \"My experience has given me the platform I need to make sure I'm looking out for the best interests of those around me\u2014not just those who look like me, but also those who look different from me, those who are in pain, those who are hurting, those who have needs, \" he explains. \"I think it all starts with listening and getting to know your neighbor. That's what IU Northwest has taught me\u2014to get to know the people around you. \"OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Taking a Look in the Mirror The \"traditional\" college student of an 18- to 24-year-old is a thing of the past. T oday's students are increasingly diverse. Many are older and earning degrees while raising families. They may come from traditionally underserved and lower-income communities. And often they are first-generation college students. With the changing demographics of the northern Indiana region, IU South Bend is becoming a viable college option for students of many backgrounds, ethnicities, and income levels. In the face of these demographics, campus leadership has focused their energies on recruitment efforts targeting students and faculty of color, as well as creating a wide range of cultural services and academic programs. The goal behind each effort is to develop a campus environment in which people are inspired to learn, grow, and innovate together. One of the school's initiatives to create a more inclusive campus community is a new student-led effort called \"Stage for Change. \" The idea behind Stage for Change is to celebrate diversity by using the stories of students as a strategy to build inclusion. After visiting classrooms, promoting the project at campus events, and engaging with other student organizations, Stage for Change collected 41 anonymous stories from the campus communities about topics such as race, immigration, gender, sexuality, mental health, class, and religion. A group of 22 students comprised of diverse racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds attended Stage for Change trainings throughout the academic year. The result of their work culminated with a performance in March entitled \"Hear Me Out. \" The gathering was attended by more than 180 individuals and received critical acclaim from the local media. More important, the performance achieved the group's goal of facilitating a campus climate where students of all backgrounds can flourish. Stories included a Muslim woman's feelings about wearing a hijab and the experience of an African American student being pulled over by a police officer while driving. Many of the students whose stories were featured stayed after the performance for a post-show discussion. \"Stage for Change made a change in the climate on the IU South Bend campus by bringing stories to the campus community that all of us might not necessarily hear, \" says Marty McCampbell, IU South Bend director of campus diversity and affirmative action. \"The stories got the word out to a very diverse group of students who wanted to participate in an ecumenical, intersectional project. \" Differences Matter IU South Bend continues to improve its recruitment of underrepresented minorities. Some of the strategies the campus is utilizing include inviting minority students from the surrounding communities and participants in the 21st Century Scholars Program to take part in the school's Leadership Academy. Administered by IU South Bend's Making Academic Connections office, the Leadership Academy is a free, six-week program held every summer for incoming freshmen to take two classes before their first semester at IU South Bend. The curriculum focuses on advocacy, leadership, and civic engagement, with courses covering the history of African American and Latino civil rights movements and concluding with a tour of important African American and Latino landmarks in South Bend. The experience has inspired many participants to go on to hold leadership positions in student organizations, including those in student government at IU South Bend. The program also has had a positive impact on retention rates\u2014so much so that there are plans to expand the effort. Other IU South Bend activities designed to explore cultural differences and celebrate diversity include poetry slams, musical performances, a lecture series held at the IU South Bend Civil Rights Heritage Center, and faculty leading groups of students to important sites of the Civil Rights Movement in Memphis, T ennessee, and Birmingham, Alabama.IU South Bend 45 44\"There's always more work to be done when it comes to recruitment and retention, but I think our improved diversity numbers empower students to have a voice. Looking around the classroom and seeing other people who look like them give students a sense of camaraderie and a shared experience, \" McCampbell explains. \"We are primarily a commuter campus. But instead of sitting in their cars in the parking lots during breaks between classes, I've noticed that diverse groups of students are spending more time together in open spaces like the University Grill or on the first floor of the administration building. They are interacting together. Progress is being made, attention is being paid, and I think we have created a campus that communicates to students we truly care about diversity and inclusion. \" Building Community When Cynthia Murphy-Wardlow attended an IU Bloomington overseas study trip to Lima, Peru, in 1982, she never imagined where it would lead her. Not only did the Nappanee, Indiana, native become bilingual, but she launched a career working in Elkhart County's Latino community. And, eventually, she became the recruitment and retention counselor for Latino and other underrepresented students in IU South Bend's Making Academic Connections office. \"I was raised in a family where both my mother and father were first-generation college students. My parents instilled in me the importance of education, \" says Murphy-Wardlow. \"Coming from a family where few had a college education, I knew there was a lot of misunderstanding and confusion, and I always wanted to be a part of making sure that students had access to get their questions answered. I know people are often intimidated or frightened to ask questions. That is the case in immigrant communities, where many don't know who to trust. I want to be that person who helps people get the information they deserve to further their education. \"Having worked in the Latino community for nearly for 30 years, Murphy-Wardlow has deep ties to the local families. She has gained the trust of students by meeting key stakeholders, and is instrumental in helping IU South Bend continually increase underrepresented minority enrollment. \"When you're working with Latino and other underrepresented minority populations, you have to be their recruiter, their counselor who helps them stay in school, and their advocate who enables them to speak out against perceived and actual systemic injustices. Then you have to be the motivator and the person who has the difficult conversations to help them make choices that allow them to reach their goals, \" she explains. \"It's a holistic process. \" Murphy-Wardlow also spearheads IU South Bend's Multicultural Showcase Day, a partnership with the campus Office of Admissions. Initially, the initiative brought local African American and Latino students to the IU South Bend campus for a one-day event in which faculty and students participated in a panel discussion about social justice and diversity issues from the perspective of underrepresented minorities. But the demand to participate became so high that multiple days and individualized high school tours were added to the program. \"Latino student numbers are rising. If we can provide a welcoming environment where students feel they can make a difference, I think that we will be doing good work on behalf of the community, our graduates at IU South Bend, and especially our students, \" says Murphy- Wardlow. \"Recruitment, then cheering at the graduation stage, brings it full circle. \" Stage for Change serves as a student-led effort to celebrate diversity and build inclusion.During the past five years, IU South Bend has experienced a steady increase in Latino/ Hispanic student enrollment.Latino/Hispanic Student Enrollment 6.6%7.4%8.4%9.1%10.3 %OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Embracing Diversity at IU Southeast Diversity should be a thought, never an afterthought. It is an action, not a reaction. IU Southeast's commitment to creating a campus that embraces diversity, inclusion, and equality for all is the hallmark of its recruitment goals. Campus leadership believes that access to higher education, preparation to enter the workforce, and the ability to function in a diverse and globalized society is critical for student success. T o that end, IU Southeast continues to strengthen and improve diversity in its programming, hiring, student recruitment, business practices, and community initiatives. IU Southeast's location in New Albany, Indiana, is only 15 minutes away from downtown Louisville, Kentucky. The setting attracts a unique mix of students from southeastern Indiana, the Louisville metropolitan area, and a growing international population. For more than two decades, Louisville has been a major destination for resettled refugees. With this population in mind, IU Southeast has, since 2015, participated in the Super Saturday College and Career Readiness Program for local middle school, high school, and adult students from refugee backgrounds who have recently come to the United States. The event is the brainchild of the Louisville-based Kentucky Refugee Ministries as part of its Rise Up program, which educates students about the American college process. Students from Catholic Charities, another resettlement agency, and the Backside Learning Center at Churchill Downs, a program that serves the children of the famed racetrack's employees, many of whom are immigrants, also participate.IU Southeast was one of several colleges and universities in the Louisville metropolitan area to host students for the college visit portion of the program in the 2015-16 academic year. The visit has been so successful that the campus served as the site of the fall kickoff event this past September. Lisa Hoffman, an assistant professor in IU Southeast's School of Education and a past board member for the Kentucky Refugee Ministries, helped lead the session. She says Kentucky Refugee Ministries decided to kick off its 2016-17 program at IU Southeast because of the campus' unique relationship with its first-generation students. \"Our admissions department, financial aid process, first-year experience programs, and even advising are tailored to be user-friendly to first-generation college students, \" explains Hoffman. \"IU Southeast didn't specifically design these programs and practices for immigrant students or refugee students; our service area has a high number of first-generation college students in general. Over the years, I have seen how the entire community is enriched by so many international families raising their families and starting businesses in this city. So I'm thrilled that IU Southeast is increasing our outreach to international communities on both sides of the Ohio River. \" Because of this supportive culture, the number of students attending the Super Saturday College and Career Readiness event continues to grow each year. The event enables the students to spend a full day exploring the campus on a guided tour hosted by the director of admissions. T en faculty members from three IU Southeast schools and several School of Education students are on hand to welcome their guests. One of the students who attended the event already is enrolled for the 2017-18 fall semester at IU Southeast. \"The campus is committed to working with diverse students. The real change is within our communities. They are becoming more culturally diverse and more linguistically diverse, so we have new opportunities to welcome the refugee and immigrant populations, \" Hoffman says. \"The campus is well-positioned to do that, because we already have the services in place and are accustomed to new groups coming in. Recruiting refugee immigrant students is important and positive for all of our students. \"IU Southeast 47 46Recruiting Diverse Faculty In order to give students\u2014and the entire campus community\u2014 the benefit of diverse perspectives, IU Southeast recruits faculty of all backgrounds. The idea is to find and hire individuals who can enhance students' educational journey and contribute to the IU Southeast experience. \"We strive to maintain an environment that is welcoming and supportive of faculty diversity, \" says Darlene Y oung, IU Southeast's director of staff equity and diversity, Title IX deputy coordinator, and chief diversity officer. \"I believe the most important aspect we offer is a culture in which people feel valued, respected, and supported. \" A few years ago, IU Southeast developed a recruitment guide tailored to the southern Indiana and Louisville metropolitan areas. The guide is used by campus search committees, so candidates can understand the benefits of both sides of the river. Leading by Example As a doctoral student, Lisa Hoffman was advised by her professors to narrow her interests and specialize in one area. T o the benefit of IU Southeast, she didn't heed their guidance. \"Some people find one thing and that's their baby. But I tend to dip into a lot of different interest areas, \" Hoffman says. \"I think the common theme for me is that our teachers coming out of the School of Education have got to be able to have empathy and an understanding of the students they will serve. \" Now an assistant professor in IU Southeast's School of Education, Hoffman is involved in everything from programs with resettled refugee students to presenting research about assessing cultural proficiency in educators at national conferences. In January 2017 , students from the schools of education, nursing, and social sciences, plus members of the local community took part in a two-hour exercise focused on simulating the lives of the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The students had to experience poverty for a month, paying their bills and meeting other family obligations. Funded by a grant from the Horseshoe Foundation of Southern Indiana, the poverty simulation exercise encouraged students to have empathy for the disadvantaged people they may encounter in their profession. \"The effort has been very powerful. There are so many stereotypes about people who are struggling financially. One of these stereotypes is that people are poor because they're lazy, or they don't make good budget choices, or there's some other personality flaw, \" explains Hoffman. \"The poverty simulation exercise increased empathy in that it helped to shed many of these stereotypes. For anyone to build respect for others, it begins by understanding their struggles. \" Increase in minority faculty from 2005-2015. 59% \"Candidates are able to see our close proximity to a large metropolitan area, and we can also introduce them to southern Indiana. Prospective candidates are better able to make more informed choices regarding the advantages of living in Indiana and Kentucky and have a better understanding of the advantages associated with each area, \" Y oung says. 15.0 % Minority Students Enrolled2016 Minority Student Enrollment $ $12.4 % Campus GoalOFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS ANNUAL REPORTAnnual Report 2016-17Leadership OVPDEMA Senior Leadership James C.
