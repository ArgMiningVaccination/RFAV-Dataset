Largest CBD study to date There is no lack of CBD studies as cannabinoids continue to reveal their anti-inflammation, pain management and healing properties, and now the largest pain study to date is showing how CBD is impacting quality of life for patients. Large-scale trial organization Radicle Science announced the completion of \"history's largest human clinical trial studying the effects of cannabinoids on pain management,\" as reported by Nutraceuticals World. The study included more than 1,600 participants. Each participant was administered one of six different CBD formulations once a day for four weeks, reporting their pain relative to specific benchmarks (severity, anxiety, sleep quality, etc.). Reports from the yet-to-be-published study include roughly 50% of participants reporting clinically- meaningful improvements in pain. \"Rare cannabinoids are present in a variety of health and wellness products containing cannabis and hemp, but there has been virtually no clinical data on their effectiveness for any medical condition, including pain,\" said Jeff Chen, MD, Radicle Science's chief executive officer and UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative's founder and former executive director. Similar large-scale, blinded, randomized-controlled trials are planned for rare cannabinoids, including THCV, CBN, CBG and CBC. The hope is that the addition of rare cannabinoids will augment the healing properties of CBD, including more research into the \"entourage effect,\" where multiple compounds work together to speed healing.

Booth #201SMART CHIROPRACTORS are constantly looking for new service lines to expand their practice beyond just chiropractic and reach the remaining 90% of America. Weight loss is the absolute best way to engage this massive demographic which currently has no clue that you and your chiropractic office even exist. Many chiropractors fall into the trap of investing in unnecessary rehab equipment/service centers to improve patient outcomes and increase case averages. However, this does not expand your patient base. All this does is upsell your existing patients. Adding modalities that the majority of America is not familiar with does not attract new patients. To grow as a business and become a successful entrepreneur you need to reach new audi - ences. If you're not bringing in a high volume of new patients every month, you're constricting your business' growth. This is why adding weight loss is a necessity for chiropractic offices around America. Weight loss is a $5 billion industry and 71.6% of American adults are overweight or obese. Being overweight leads to injuries, increased inflammation and pain. So, if you're looking to fix bad backs and knees \u2014 the weight loss community has no shortage . As a chiropractic office you can help these patients, but you'll never reach them marketing only chiropractic services. These patients are not aware that they even need a chiropractor yet. To reach them you have to market weight loss (with a device classified and proven for weight loss \u2014 not an LED inch-loss device) and educate them on the importance of chiropractic once they become your weight loss patient. Seeing the connection between weight loss and chiropractic is why, since 2014, invisa-RED has focused on helping chiropractors nationwide elevate their practices to the next level. This is done by implementing a weight loss business system that is designed to integrate seamlessly into the chiropractic office. The device is an unattended service. Anyone on your staff can perform treatments on patients once they've been trained, allowing you to add a productive service line with very little overhead. The invisa-RED Business System includes all the device training, sales coaching, marketing, and customized graphics at your disposal. The device training focuses on ensuring all staff members know how to properly utilize the device, apply the paddles to the patient, and track patient results. The sales coaching is focused on helping your case manager/office manager (OM) become comfortable selling the weight loss programs to your patients. By focusing on the sales and conversion training with your OM, invisa-RED can get you one step closer to having a practice that allows you as the business owner to replace yourself in the business while increasing revenue. What truly separates the invisa-RED system is the marketing. invisa-RED's two-step marketing approach includes internal campaigns designed to engage your former and current patients. The external campaigns drive in new patients, introducing you to the 90% of America you've been missing. invisa-RED Business System Testimonials \"I really was so skeptical, but they had a marketing plan ; I was like OK, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna plug-in and go full throttle and do exactly what they say, so that's what we did. We followed the plan, did exactly what they said , and they came out and in two and a half days we smashed the record, we did $70,000 in sales \u2014 cash .\" \u2014 Laura & Dr. Justin Dempsey, Waco, TX \"We never had much success with weight loss [or] our weight loss program until we implemented the [invisa-RED] laser. People are seeking us out , we did their Facebook ad on it, I had to turn the thing off, we got just flooded with patients .\" \u2014 Dr. Eric Codner, Columbus, GA \"Mike from invisa-RED did our demo day ... what a success , the guy was so helpful in training all of our employees to run the machine, to consult with the patients and to do the closings .\" \u2014 Dr. Randy Curtis, Longview, TX \"invisa-RED has provided for us the missing link through the ultimate fat-loss recipe ... a very easy thing to operate, it's very simple, we recommend everyone does go through and follow through with the correct training . It is a remarkable, revolutionary device that is absolutely worth its price ... you actually get more than you pay for . Great team, great support and outstanding technology; we'd recommend it to anyone.\" \u2014 John Pace, Kennesaw, GAIF ONLY 8-10% OF AMERICANS ARE SEEKING CHIROPRACTIC CARE Why are you ignoring the other 90%?

ChiroEco.com/nbce-resignSound reduces pain in mice An international team of scientists has identified the neural mechanisms through which sound blunts pain in mice. The findings, which could inform development of methods to treat pain, were published in Science. The study was led by researchers at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research; the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei; and Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China. NIDCR is part of the National Institutes of Health. \"Human brain imaging studies have implicated certain areas of the brain in music-induced analgesia, but these are only associations,\" said co-senior author Yuanyuan (Kevin) Liu, PhD. \"In animals, we can more fully explore and manipulate the circuitry to identify the neural substrates involved.\" ScienceDaily.com TRENDING STORIESYOUR ONLINE CHIROPRACTIC Favorite us on Apple News Webinars Podcasts Resource Centers Videos Job Board Buyers Guide Surveys Industry Research School Guide Students Products & Services Current News MISSED THE LAST ISSUE?

Here are a few ways you can repurpose that webinar content to strengthen your message, discover new audiences, and create engagement that leads to further ROI (return on investment). 1. Automated webinars. Turn the recording of a great webinar into a scheduled webinar that runs several times a year. 2. Get it transcribed. Have a transcription service turn your recorded webinar into text. Use portions of the transcript to create engaging blog content. 3. Create e-books. Offer an e-book or handbook of a webinar event. 4. Make a podcast. With permission from participants, turn the webinar audio file into a podcast. 5. Use clips. Edit and clip the recorded webinar, then post one-minute shorts on Facebook or other social media sites. Use basic video editing software to add a catchy headline and subtitles. 6. Use it as social content. Did your webinar answer some frequently asked questions? Pair the questions and answers with a short clip (15-60 seconds) or a still from the webinar and post on your social media sites. 7. Watch the birdie. Ask attendees to Tweet-out unique hashtagged comments during your webinar. Then search the hashtag and retweet the best of the best. Reuse and restructure past webinars in as many ways as possible to gain more ROI and build your practice. \u2014 Michele WojciechowskiEach month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

The findings of the study address the chronic worldwide issue of lower back pain, its financial burden on health care systems, and faster diagnosis and treatment for patients. Lower back pain comprises a significant source of health care use and cost, with low back and neck pain amounting to health care costs of more than $135 billion in the United States alone. According to a study published in the Annals of Translational Medicine: National Library of Medicine (NIH): \"Globally, lower back pain (LBP) is the leading global cause of years lived with disability (YLD). Greater attention is urgently needed to mitigate this increasing burden....\" Gregory Cramer, DC, PhD, and NUHS dean of research, added, \"Our preliminary evidence indicates that zygapophyseal joint (Z joints, facet joint) crepitus (sounds/vibrations originating from the joints) may be a biomarker for spinal joint function. However, it takes a human observer approximately 24 working hours to assess the recordings of just one patient, which is too long to be practical in a large clinical study or in clinical practice. Consequently, we have been working to automate the assessment of the recordings; this project evaluated the automated method. We found that the automated method was as accurate as humans in assessing crepitus and took dramatically less time (seconds vs. hours).\" The ultimate goal of this line of investigation is to provide practitioners and their patients with an objective measure of facet joint dysfunction.

Mayer Hunt was honored for her long history of leadership in advancing basic and clinical research in the field of upper cervical chiropractic. Her latest published study, \"Secretory Immunoglobulin A and Upper Cervical Chiropractic: A Preliminary Prospective, Multicenter, Observational Study,\" breaks new ground in expanding understanding of the effect of upper cervical adjusting techniques on the immune response. \"Dr. Mayer Hunt is such a gift to our profession and to the ICA,\" said Selina Sigafoose Jackson, DC, and ICA board president. \"Having such a mind on our board and in our profession allows for the opportunity to advance our profession in ways that we always knew could happen but now is happening. Thank you, Dr. Mayer Hunt for your dedication and discipline to the rigors of science and documentation that is proving what we all know \u2014 chiropractic works!\" The objective of the study was to observe changes in secretory IgA (SIgA) after providing an adjustment to the craniocervical junction, using an upper cervical adjusting technique. Five different techniques were used: Atlas Orthogonal, Blair, Knee Chest, NUCCA, and Orthospinology, and all adjusting doctors had extensive experience in their technique, achieving either a diplomate or fellow status in the ICA's Chiropractic Craniocervical Junction Procedures program. SIgA was measured in saliva samples. Participants were recruited from five chiropractic practices between January and June 2019. Measuring SIgA was selected because it is a key component of the innate immune system, which provides a nonspecific, first-line defense against numerous pathogens. SIgA is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the human body and plays an important role in protecting mucosal surfaces in the intestines, respiratory tract, and urogenital tract from microorganisms. As microorganisms typically enter the body via these mucosal surfaces, the role of SIgA is crucial in preventing illness. \"This project answers several of our questions, while raising new questions that can be explored in future studies,\" Mayer Hunt said.

Our Sun radiates all these same electromagnetic wavelengths and more unseen to provide the energy that sustains all life here on earth. Red light comprises roughly 20-25% of the Sun's visible radiation so therefore we are exposed to the properties of broad spectrum of red light daily. The Sun however also radiates electromagnetic energy that we cannot see, some in the ultraviolet spectrum that we now know can be harmful to our health, so we therefore recommend limiting unprotected skin's exposure to direct sunlight. Red light truly is not such a harmful spectrum of the Sun's radiation and it is sound to assume light emitting devices that employ broad spectrum red light are not harmful to anyone at the energy levels they normally operate. Therapeutic red light is healthy in many ways but it is very limited in its role in aesthetics due to it's ability to affect only the outer most layers of a subjects dermis. This limitation is due to the high coefcient absorption of red light by the chromophores in the cells of our dermis that create an impenetrable barrier to the light after only a few millimeters of penetration. As a result red light alone only increases skin tone and may aid in healing of the epidermis but this is the extent of its effects. Aesthetic changes in a subject's appearance are almost wholly due to a tightening effect of the subjects skin without any change to the deeper adipose layers. The Unique Science of As we previously discussed, basic red light is rapidly absorbed and scattered in the outer dermis of a subject. In order to create a natural sculpting response from the body, all the dermal layers and the underlying adipose tissue would require an elevated level of sub-atomic energy or quantum state be imparted to the inter-cellular mechanisms, specically the cellular \"power plants\" or mitochondria that create cellular respiration for all activity in the body. By stimulating the adipose's mitochondria a subject would release the stored fats from the adipose layers under the skin just as if extended and strenuous exercise had been undertaken. So the challenge is, how do you impart that level of energy into the deep cells of the adipose layers? This is where invisa-RED's proprietary delivery method of photobleaching with coherent infrared and red laser frequencies excels. The 680 nm of red laser is absorbed by the dermis allowing the infrared at 980 nm to bypass the dermal tissue and absorb into the adipocyte cells. Without using infrared, it is not possible for any spectrum of light energy or laser to absorb into the adipose tissue, as infrared's 980nm has the highest coefcient energy absorption into adipose tissue. The pulsed infrared delivers the maximum level of energy density to stimulate cellular respiration, increase cytochrome c oxidase production and ATP Dual Coherent PulsedVSinvisa-RED's unique scientic and evidence based advantage over non invasive red light/laser based devices is apparent when we compare the clinical trials of the devices. The Red light only devices are only able to achieve circumferential differences (inch loss) as seen in the following clinical trials NCT02167867 and NCT02867150.

All Competitors Unproven Claims inches lost during their respective studies, however neither study attempted to prove Fat Reduction or Weight Reduction because it is known that red light alone is not able to absorb into the Adipose tissue and stimulate fat loss. What makes invisa-RED's clinical trial (NCT03811093) different is that by using both infrared and red lasers invisa-RED was able to not only help participants lose an average of 10.16 inches off of their body, but also 4.53 pounds of body fat resulting in 1.75% reduction in body fat over the course of only nine treatments without the assistance of diet or exercise. (2) Red light only devices have no clinical evidence to support their claims of fat reduction, making Red light only lasers bad for business, your reputation and your patients.

VORWALLER TIME TO READ: 12-14 MIN. TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO CHANGE AT A RAPID RATE as we constantly upgrade and trade in the old for the new, from cell phones and laptops to big-screen TVs. This is also true in health care as new products are developed and launched on a regular basis. These products often show great promise for improving health, while others overpromise and fail to deliver their hyped results. Many new products, especially \"digital health\" products that are in the news frequently, are not providing the clinical outcomes they originally projected. A study released June 20, 2022, provides an analysis indicating this shortcoming: \"Assessing the Clinical Robustness of Digital Health Startups: Cross-sectional Observational Analysis.\"1ADOPTING AND LEVERAGING NEW TECH CHIROECO.COM AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 21HOW DOES A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL CUT THROUGH THE CLUTTER of an increasing barrage of new medical products and sales pitches? There are a number of key considerations to use when evaluating and purchasing new medical products. Time spent properly researching and eval - uating each product can save a practice from future losses of time, money and unforeseen liabilities. Medical practices should include this criteria in the overall risk management program of their practice. Plusses for adding new tech Some of the positives for adding new technology products include: Better Outcomes \u2014 Properly implemented in a chiropractic practice, new technology will not take away the core business of providing chiropractic adjustments but will actually position and support it synergistically. Patients will benefit from better and longer-lasting treatment results and clinical outcomes. Patients are seeking the best results, and the combination of technology and chiropractic can provide this. Technology can provide \"evidence-based medicine,\" as many products were involved in clinical research and published studies. Recommendation: Ask the product manufacturer for the clinical research and published studies their product was involved in. Make this information available to staff and patients. Practice Differentiation \u2014 Adding new technology can posi - tion a practice to be cutting edge. Marketing new technology can be a powerful tool to not only attract new patients who come to experience the new technology, but can also provide an opportunity to learn about the benefits and advantages of chiropractic care, resulting in exposure to a broader group of patients in the community. Recommendation: Request the product manufacturer to provide marketing tools and resources that can be customized to your practice and be used to both retain existing patients and to attract new patients. Early Adopter \u2014 Often when new technology is launched publicly, there is a limited window of time to purchase and become an early adopter, where the practice may be the only location with the new technology for a period of time. Failure to purchase at this stage may mean that other types of medical professionals will purchase and promote the new technology. Recommendation: Discuss with the product manufacturer opportunities to be the first and only provider in your area or community, and how long you can have this status. Empty Space \u2014 Many new technologies are \"unattended\" and ideal to use in rooms that are empty space or acting as a storage room. There may also be open areas in the office. Technology can be added to these rooms without adding staff. Recommendation: Repurpose one or more rooms or remodel an empty space, creating room for new technology that can become a new source of revenue. Passion \u2014 Many new technologies are exciting to use, operate and see results with, especially when combined with chiro - practic care. Practitioners often have a personal interest in a specific type of technology and can turn that interest into a passion by becoming an expert in a specific technology or medical application. Recommendation: Find a technology you believe in and can be passionate about. As you become an expert, you will find new patients who are seeking your expertise. Personal Health and Career \u2014 Practitioners will benefit from personally using new technology to become healthier. When combined with their patients using the same new technology, it can offer a real solution to the physical wear and tear from doing daily manual adjustments. Technology can actually extend the personal health and career of a chiropractor. Recommendation: Create a plan for scheduling time to receive treatments personally, and also include staff and family members (where needed). New tech pitfalls Some of the pitfalls to avoid when adding new technology to a practice include: FDA Registration \u2014 All companies that sell medical products must register their company and products they sell on an annual basis with the FDA.2 Any company currently registered with the FDA can be found in their database.3 Recommendation: Ask a company for their FDA registration status or search the FDA database. Do not purchase products from companies if they or their products are not currently registered with the FDA. 'FDA Approved' versus 'FDA Cleared' \u2014 If you see a medical product that advertises that it is \"FDA Approved,\" you can know that it is not, as the FDA does not approve any medical product. Medical products are cleared for specific indications FEATURE STORY Patients are seeking the best results, and the combination of technology and chiropractic can provide this. 22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMYOU NEED TH IS EXPER IENCE!

MIKE & & VP PROFESSIONAL RELATIONS ARE YOU ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND?for use that are stated in an FDA document called a \"510k.\" For example, a product may be \"cleared to provide temporary relief for the symptoms associated with arthritis.\"4 Any product that has a 510k with the FDA can be found in their database.5 There are medical products that are exempt from a 510k; these are listed in a database with the FDA.6 Recommendation: Ask a company for their 510k clearance number, or, if their product is exempt, search the FDA data - base. Do not advertise medical claims for a product that are outside the indicated uses of the product's 510k. There can be serious consequences for doing this. Consumer versus Professional \u2014 Many products have consumer and professional models. The consumer models intended for home use are often less powerful or have reduced features and will not generate the clinical outcomes a medical professional needs in their practice (example: treating a migraine headache with baby aspirin). These products may be classified with the FDA as \"OTC - Over the Counter\" medical products.7 Products for medical profes - sionals are classified with an \"Rx\" designation under one of three classifications.8 Recommendation: Always ask a manufacturer for the profes - sional model. The professional model is usually much stronger than the consumer model and will generate better clinical results. The costs may be higher, but well worth the increased clinical performance and outcome. USA versus International \u2014 Many products are listed for sale on the internet from a growing number of countries. They may be listed on websites that include eBay and Amazon (USA), and Alibaba (China). It is important to determine if the company selling the product has a location in the USA with on-site inventory and a direct customer service center. A product from China may be listed for sale at a fraction of the price of competing products in the USA. However, purchasing these products can be a gamble regarding quality and performance (usually low quality). In addition, products shipped from other countries (that are often mis-labeled to bypass U.S. Customs) can result in seizure and forfeiture at the U.S. Customs borders when they enter the USA. The FDA monitors these companies and will issue notice of placement on the FDA Import Alert List when they are in violation. Companies on this list can be searched on the FDA link.9 An important fact when purchasing products from outside the USA is that it can be challenging and almost impossible to get these products serviced or repaired when they break down, and often any warranty they issue will not be supported. Recommendation: Do not purchase a product that will ship to you from outside the USA, despite their email claims that \"We ship to the USA all the time without any problem.\" Most of these products are not currently FDA registered and lack required FDA 510k clearances, in addition to other required reports (example: electrical safety testing reports). Residential versus Commercial \u2014 Medical companies are required to meet an extensive and expanding list of quality control and safety requirements, referred to as \"current good manufacturing practices (cGMP),\"10 and are listed on the FDA website.11 Despite these requirements, there are some medical companies that operate from a private residential home versus a commercial location. There is no federal requirement against this \u2014 however, it is challenging for these companies to operate without proper warehousing for product manage - ment and offices with full-time staff. Any address can be web searched, showing it to be a residential or commercial address. Recommendation: Exercise caution with purchasing prod - ucts that are not located at a commercial address. It is best to purchase products from a company with an established office, warehouse, full-time staff, product and clinical training, marketing support and a comprehensive warranty. Scope of Practice \u2014 Some technologies may be outside the scope of practice of a state's licensing board requirements. Recommendation: Check with your state's licensing board if you are questioning a specific technology or product. Some states have not kept current with all of the changes happening with medical product technologies. Federal Trade Commission \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monitors the advertising, promotions and claims of all businesses, including medical products and medical practices. Violations can result in severe fines and penalties. Recommendation: Review all content of your website, social media, advertising and print items on a regular basis regarding FEATURE STORY 510K ASK A COMPANY FOR THEIR 510K CLEARANCE NUMBER, OR, IF THEIR PRODUCT IS EXEMPT, SEARCH THE FDA DATABASERequest the product manufacturer to provide marketing tools and resources that can be customized to your practice... 24 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMWhy subject your practice to a life sentence?

Remember to review the list of plusses and pitfalls and the specific recommendations. Discuss with the manufacturer their specific products sold only to medical professionals or for use in clinical settings. Inquire regarding opportunities for first- product rights or exclusivity within your zip code or community. Virtual Reality Systems (VR) \u2014 Virtual reality is moving quickly into many aspects of medicine. The FDA has cleared a VR system for low-back pain. Multiple published studies have been completed for VR showing efficacy for a growing number of therapeutic applications for home and clinic use. Progressive VR companies are incorporating complementary technologies with their VR System. An example is the integra - tion of VR with static- and motion-plate technologies for use with balance training programs. Cryotherapy Full-Body Chamber Systems (unattended) \u2014 Many communities already have a number of businesses offering full- body cryotherapy, often owned and operated by non-medical professionals. New technology using electric-based systems are entering the market and will replace the existing nitrogen gas systems of all current cryotherapy businesses. The electric units are much easier to install and manage, and are more cost-effec - tive. Options for purchasing include product-only purchases or turnkey cryotherapy franchise opportunities in some areas. Photobiomodulation (Light Therapy) LED Full-Body Systems (unattended) \u2014 Full-body systems, sometimes referred to \"light beds\" or \"light pods,\" are now available with advanced innovations of multiple power levels (low to high), multiple wavelengths and multiple frequency (hertz) settings. New advancements in light-emitting diode (LED) technology are providing improved treatment options and outcomes. These systems are superior to lower-cost and less effective \"red light (only) therapy panels.\" Treatments are synergistic with targeted laser therapy and also full-body cryotherapy or full-body hyper - baric treatments. The unattended aspect of this technology provides high usage and a quick return on investment (ROI). Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBOT) Full-Body Systems (unattended) \u2014 There are a wide range of product models to choose from, and new advancements include multi-space units that can handle more than one person. Additional developments include vertical systems.

There's no better way to increase patient satisfaction - and practice revenue. Laser therapy is safe, non-invasive, drug-free, and efficacious. The extensive research into laser therapy shows that laser light at the 635 nanometer and 405 - nanometer wavelengths effectively stimulates photochemical healing at the cellular level. Based on the evidence, Erchonia lasers utilizing these wavelengths have attained FDA clearance for treating overall nociceptive musculoskeletal pain, chronic lower back pain, plantar fasciitis, and chronic neck/shoulder pain. Ongoing research suggests that laser therapy has enormous poten tial for treating inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases, gut issues, and other common chiropractic maladies. I believe lasers are the most versatile health care tool we have today. Here's why: Low-intensity lasers have been in therapeutic use for more than fifty years. They've been proven e ffecti ve for decades - the first Erchonia FDA clearance goes back to 2002. The effect is photochemical, not thermal, so treatment is painless, safe, and fast. Laser therapy is highly effec tive for treating a range of pain ful conditions, parti cularly osteoarthritis, lower back pain, neck pain, peripheral neuropathy, foot pain, and tendonitis. The studies back up the claims. In one important double-blind placebo study-the gold standard for clinical trials - laser therapy (eight treatments in one month) reduced pain by an average of 49% even when no other treatments were administered. Most importantly, laser therapy using the Erchonia FX series is the first and only non-invasive technology to receive FDA clearance for overall nociceptive musculoskeletal pain. 635 nm: Laser light in the red spectrum at 635 nm relieves pain, reduces inflammation, increases lymphatic flow, stimulates cell metabolism, and accelerates wound healing. It's particularly effective for reducing pain and muscle spasms while increasing strength and ROM. 405 nm: Laser light in the violet spectrum at 405 nm improves immunity by helping the body eliminate pathogens and is the modality of choice for vagus nerve stimulation. In my practice, I use both the Erchonia FX635 and the FX405 \u2014 the world's most advanced and versatile lasers. The FX635 has three red diodes at 635 nm, while the Erchonia FX405 has the red diodes with an additional violet diode at 405 nm. The FX series of stand-alone laser devices from Erchonia can be used in an unattended setting as a treatment protocol. This approach to laser therapy can generate passive income and increase schedule flexibility. The addition of the FX series has revolutionized my approach to treating musculoskeletal injuries. The laser's effectiveness has improved my clinical outcomes substantially and works synergistically with my chiropractic treatments. I recommend the FX series to be a part of every chiropractor's armamentarium.

Scan to r eveal (844) 960-72 46 TECH TALK THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE to the effectiveness of addressing the vagus nerve in chronic health conditions. Poor vagal tone has been implicated and noted in various diagnoses including irritable bowel syndrome, autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis and SLE, metabolic conditions including Type 2 diabetes and obesity, and inflammatory conditions including asthma and fibromyalgia. Chiropractors are more aware than most with regard to the functions of the vagus nerve. Let us review and understand the nerve's pathway, innervation, and the bidirectional flow of information between the viscera and the central nervous system via the \"wandering\" nerve. We will then dive into methods and tools to measure vagus nerve activity, and how we can support our patients in practice, to help them achieve more positive health by activating their vagus nerve. Reviewing the anatomy and physiology of the vagus nerve The vagus nerve is the 10th cranial nerve, arising from four nuclei in the brainstem: the dorsal motor nucleus the solitary tract nucleus the spinal trigeminal nucleus the nucleus ambiguus The left and right roots of the vagus nerve exit from the brainstem at the medulla oblongata, then converge and exit the cranial cavity via the jugular foramen located between the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. It then passes through the neck adjacent to these important blood vessels within the carotid sheath. Within the neck, there are sensory branches sent to the skin of the ear (auricular branch) and motor branches sent to the pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles which make up the airway and the muscles around the vocal cords. These branches are important when it comes to supporting vagus nerve function and elevating vagal tone. As it enters the thorax, branches are sent to the pulmonary plexus and carotid plexus. As you may infer, these branches send afferent and efferent signals to and from the lungs and heart, monitoring breath rate, monitoring and regulating TECH TO ACTIVATE THE VAGUS NERVE Function and activation to battle chronic health conditions BY NAVAZ HABIB, DC TIME TO READ: 10-12 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Improper vagus nerve function can impede the rest, digestion and recovery functions of the body, but chiropractors can apply measurement and corrective stimulation technology. 30 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMDiscover even more innovation at euromedicausa.comThe Supplement's Supplement. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

The nerve then continues into the abdominal cavity, coursing through the diaphragm alongside the esophagus, to innervate virtually every organ in the abdomen. Branches are sent from the vagus nerve to the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas and gallbladder. Functions of the vagus nerve There is an astounding amount of regulatory information passing through the branches of the vagus nerve, but only 20% of the data passed via vagus is efferent. Approximately 80% of the information passing through the nerve is afferent, signaling to the brain with regard to inflammation levels in the gut, satiety reflexes, blood pressure, and relaying information from the gut microbiome, amongst other functions. The efferent signals sent via the abdominal branches include but are not limited to regulate digestion, liver detoxification, bile production and release, regulate insulin and pancreatic enzyme release, managing blood pressure via the kidneys, and regulating inflammatory reactions via the spleen and intestinal lymphoid tissue. The majority of the parasympathetic signals to the body are passed via efferent vagus signals, activating the rest, digest and recovery functions of the body. One of the more important functions of the vagus nerve is control of our inflammatory response in the gut and throughout the body, via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system. The vagus nerve utilizes TNF-, IL-1, IL-8, inflammatory cytokine production in the macrophages (Lerman, 2016). When this response is effectively regulated, inflammation is effectively controlled, allowing for recovery of damaged or affected tissues. We all know what can take place when the inflammatory cascade is unregulated. Conditions associated with vagus nerve dysfunction Chronically-elevated cytokine levels are known to cause depression, explained by the fact that longer-term cyto - kine overexpression leads to a reduction in levels (Felger, 2013; Schiepers, 2005). Dysfunction of the vagus nerve plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which also have a strong link to inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome (Breit, 2018).Autonomic function is critical in the stress response and exposure to traumatic stress can result in autonomic dysfunction and alterations, allowing for inflammatory dysregulation. Over the longer term, these changes can alter brain circuits involved in the stress response, causing anxiety or PTSD to be diagnosed (Gurel, 2020). The vagus nerve also can limit histamine release from mast cells using the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system. Parasympathetic nerves express histamine receptors on branches in the lungs, helping to signal with regards to histamine-induced bronchoconstriction \u2014 the route of asthmatic reactions and mast cell activation (Hoffman, 2009, 2012). Potential symptoms and conditions associated with low vagal tone and targets for therapy include, but are not limited to: Obesity and weight gain (Karason, 1999) Irritable bowel syndrome (Coss-Adame, 2014) Depression (Felger, 2013) and anxiety (Breit, 2018) Chronic fatigue syndrome (Vanelzakker, 2013) Fibromyalgia (Martins, 2021) Tachycardia (Buschman, 2006) Gastroparesis (Lindeboom, Autoimmune diseases (Bellocchi, 2022) Long COVID (Proal, 2021) Many of our patients are dealing with these conditions without any assessment of the root causes or pathophysiology of these conditions. A well-functioning vagus nerve is heavily involved in the optimal function of our organs and the control of inflammation, making it a perfect target for therapy when these conditions have been diagnosed.TECH TALK HRV VAGAL TONE IS BEST ASSESSED BY HEART RATE VARIABILITY, A DIRECT SIGN OF VAGUS INNERVATION TO THE HEART AND A SIGN OF RESILIENCEVagus nerve stimulation is a growing area of research and therapy for nearly all of the conditions for which vagus nerve dysfunction has been identified. 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COM1.800.532.6337 | www.LEANDERCARE.com The FIRST NAME in Chiropractic Tables! 950 SeriesDirect from the Hands of our Craftsmen to the Hands of the Healers....

Measurement of HRV can be very beneficial to the assessment of vagus nerve dysfunction. Patients can use wearable technologies to track this number throughout the day or night to learn more about their resilience and vagus nerve function. Once they are ready to make positive changes, activation of the vagus nerve can begin. Exercises and therapies to support optimal vagus nerve function can be provided quite easily in the chiropractic office setting. Most of the therapies can be focused on a few branches of the vagus nerve that have specific functions: 1. The auricular branch of vagus relays sensory information from the skin of the auricle and can be targeted with sensory-focused therapies including acupuncture and acupressure (Wang, 2022). 2. The pharyngeal branches of vagus send motor signals to the pharyngeal musculature at the back of the throat, preserving airway integrity, maintaining the gag reflex, and allowing for swallowing to occur effectively. a. Gargling with salt water and triggering the gag reflex are effective exercises to support tonality in the vagus nerve. 3. The laryngeal branches of vagus send motor impulses to the laryngeal musculature, also preserving airway integrity, as well as creating tension at the level of the vocal cords. a. Humming, chanting and singing are wonderful exercises to support vagus nerve function. 4. The diaphragm \u2014 although there is no direct branch of vagus nerve that innervates the diaphragm, slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing has been shown to be the most effective way to support vagus nerve function in acute and chronic stress circumstances. This is due to the intimate relationship between the vagus nerve, the esophagus, the lungs and the diaphragm directly. a. Slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing exercises prescribed to patients dealing with chronic health diagnoses will surely support vagus nerve function and allow for a shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic. New technologies In circumstances where these exercises are just not strong enough, there are new technologies being developed that can support vagus nerve function using electrical stimulation. Vagus nerve stimulation is a growing area of research and therapy for nearly all of the conditions for which vagus nerve dysfunction has been identified, listed above. Many of the associated conditions have been positively affected by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at the auricle and cervical region along the cervical trunk of the vagus nerve. Devices that apply stimulation to the cervical region appear to be more effective, and have been cleared by European regulators, the FDA, and Health TECH TALK Branches are sent from the vagus nerve to the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, spleen, kidneys, liver, pancreas and gallbladder. 34 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMHalf the size.

Devices stimulating the cervical trunk of the vagus nerve appear to be more effective as stimulation of these fibers provides access to a greater quantity of fibers along the vagus nerve. Stimulation to the auricular branch fibers on the ear only provides access to 1% of the vagus nerve fibers found in the cervical trunk. Some cervical trunk devices have even been shown to significantly improve cognitive performance under sleep deprivation stress, and are used by the U.S. Air Force for their pilots (McIntire, 2021).

LEADERSHIP MATTERS. It doesn't happen by accident \u2014 this is really about creating leaders inside of your practice and inside of your organizations. I love the quote from Tom Peters, who said, \"True leaders don't create followers, they create leaders.\" There are individual contributors, the \"worker bees\" \u2014 they're the people who are carrying out the tasks every day to move your organization forward. But the idea that we can turn many of those individual contributors into leaders who can actually drive results through others that can truly create exponential change and growth in your company, is where great leadership really evolves to. We're going to cover four really important concepts: 1. Locker room culture \u2014 Do you have a well-defined mission statement and core values? 2. The draft \u2014 First who, then what. It's like quarters of a football game, right? First quarter is about locker room culture; the second quarter is going to be about the draft. 3. Training camp \u2014 How do you onboard and train people the right way to turn rookie players into real players? 4. Creating leaders \u2014 Game time is the fourth quarter and turning these players into all-stars. And that's where you're really focused on taking an all-star-grade player, an individual contributor, and evolving them into a leader.BEING A LEADER BY DEVELOPING LEADERS Are you creating leaders who drive results in your practice?

While not my favorite college football team, the University of Alabama football team led by coach Nick Saban is one of the best examples of culture building. Prior to his arrival, there were five coaches in 25 years at Alabama after legendary coach Bear Bryant retired. In those 25 years, Alabama only won one national championship (note: Bear Bryant won five national championships). In 15 years, Nick Saban has won six national championships. He's built a culture of winning. He's definitely not everyone's favorite guy, but he is one of the most respected coaches in the game. If you want to achieve excellence, if you want to do what no one else has done, or can do, your culture is the secret sauce to success. So how do you create the culture you want? You set the expectations about what \"great\" looks like very, very clearly, by having a well-defined mission statement and core values. It informs why you exist (mission), and then who you are (core values), and what you believe. Building a mission statement This is how our companies have done it throughout the years, and it's been very, very successful for us. You get your group in a room, you have a meeting, and you have paper, and you've got a pen, you've got a big whiteboard, and you have each participant write down as many words as they can think of on a sheet of paper as to why your practice or your organization exists. Start creating version one of your mission statement. From those words, you want each person to write a statement on the whiteboard or paper easel as to why your practice exists. Then you're going to group statements with same or similar meanings, or the same or similar statements into one or combined statements. Then each person is going to go back by themselves and then create their best version of what's left on the board. Those may be 4-5 statements that are left on the board that encompass the most commonly-agreed- upon statements. And then you're going to have your staff, again, write their best version \u2014 those individual sentences on why the practice exists or why the organization exists, back on the board. You're going to have a discussion around the sentences and then decide which one, or which combination, exemplifies the practice's mission. It is an interactive process. It starts from words, to statements, to groupings of statements, to then going back and having people write down their favorites, or versions of their favorites. You put it back on the board again, and then coalesce all that information to identify one specific statement that says, \"This is why our practice, our organization, our division exists.\" You want to be very, very concise. I've seen mission statements go on ad nauseum; you really don't want that. You want something that's going to be short, concise, a true picture of why your practice exists and memorable . Our mission statement \u2014 \"Inspiring and empowering a healthier, happier world\" \u2014 is simple, easy to remember, and it's truly our DNA. It is inward-facing for our organization, but it's also outward-facing for our community and our patients. Your core values, again, ultimately come down to the owner of the practice or the leader of the organization. So, what's most important to you as the leader or owner of your organization, or your practice, or your division? What do you align with? What behaviors are you expecting from yourself and from the team? Organizational alignment can really only occur when those values are true and honest, and are a transparent reflection of the leaders.PRACTICE CENTRAL PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING LEADERSHIP TRAINING IMPROVED THEIR LEARNING CAPACITY BY 25% AND THEIR PERFORMANCE BY 20% (SOURCE: RESEARCHGATE)Constantly reinforcing the mission and values of the organization has been transformational for our companies.

And when there is a behavior that doesn't align, and it does happen every now and then, it is addressed in the context of our mission and values immediately. You want a great locker room culture? Time to get real with who you are, what you believe and how you behave! 2 The draft (or hiring process) I want to ask you to step back for a second and ask your - self this question: What is your hiring process? Do you have a foundational process you go through? Because it's really, really important. You as the leader are expected to bring on the best talent for the benefit of the team and the patients/customers you serve. One of the most important things you have to do after you've been clear about your mission and your core values is you've got to bring on the right people. So, you've got to have a really clear, efficient and effective hiring process. Here's our process: When our candidates come through, there's a quick phone interview. With non-doctors, it's done by our recruiter; with doctors, it's done by me. Then we bring them in for an in-person interview and/or a working interview. Our doctors and staff are asking questions that tie to their role, their values, what they're looking for, how that aligns with our core values and our mission, and how it aligns with our culture. All that is done in about a 3- to 4-hour period. And then I, or the departmental hiring manager, will do a follow-up interview. We then do reference and background checks \u2014 you've got to do background checks (it's so critical). Same thing with references; you learn so much through that process. And then ultimately, we hire. Our hiring process is not fast. We put people through an extensive process. And why do we do that? Well, what's one of our core values \u2014 tenacity. We want people to have to work through a process in order for them to be accepted into our culture. That aligns with our culture \u2014 you've got to work hard to get into our company because once you are part of our company, we will embrace you, we will support you, but you're going to work your ass off. You are going to be challenged mentally to be your very best self, and you're going to be challenged to really use that brain of yours probably more than you've ever used it in your life. We want people who are ready for that experience, and we find them through the hiring process. Our organizational chart is actually an accountability chart. At a very high level, we want each role to be defined as, \"What are the key things that need to get done in this role?\" For me, as the visionary of the organization, I set the vision, the culture, leadership development, strategic partnerships, and the result of that is a dominant brand. At a very high level for each role in your company, you should have the top 3-5 things that define the role, and also what your expected result is. Once you have the right person, and you've identified that they are in the right seat because they get the role, they want the role and they have the capacity to do the role (thank you, Gino Wickman!), you've got to onboard and train them well, so that they do the right work, the right way, at the right time, with the right results. 3 Training camp (onboarding) This is all about turning rookies into players. You really want to have an organized system for training. That's HIPAA and OSHA compliance, company organizational information, making sure you've got job-specific training information, all of the technology platforms that you use \u2014 it could be Google, or it could be Microsoft Outlook, or could be PowerPoint, it could be Office 365, it could be your EHR \u2014 you can divide it up into components to make sure it's a really organized system, but it all should be done electronically. You also need to make sure you have training checklists. The training checklist for us is signed off on by both the trainer and the trainee that says, \"Yes, I've been trained.\" The trainer says, \"Yes, I agree, this person has been trained on this core competency.\" And the trainee says, \"Yes, I believe that I've been trained on this core competency as well.\" This is really, really important to make sure the person is literally ready to go out and play the game, ready to be in front of patients, or referral sources, or whatever you have them doing. Now, how do you actually help them develop? It's about turning players into all-stars. There are so many different elements to this conversation, but in my conversations with LEADERSHIP QUALITY IS VIEWED AS HIGH BY 48% OF LEADERS IN THEIR CURRENT ORGANIZATIONS, UP FROM 34% IN 2011 (SOURCE: GALLUP)PRACTICE CENTRAL We then do reference and background checks \u2014 you've got to do background checks (it's so critical). 42 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMchiropractors from around the country and when I speak, and people are coming up to me afterward and just talking, asking me questions about their practice or talking to me about their challenges, it's amazing when I ask some of these questions: Do you have weekly team meetings, same time, same day, same agenda? Are you keeping track of your scorecard? Are you really clear about how your organization is moving forward? The majority of doctors are saying no. This is a fundamental concept, a business construct where you've got to have productive, efficient and effective weekly team meetings. Reviewing scorecard metrics When we have a scorecard metric that's below goal, many times we'll put it on what's called the \"issues list.\" If we've got an issue where, let's say, we've had too many no-shows that week and the week before \u2014 so what are we going to do about that? Then there's a task, or to-do, that's assigned to an individual that they're going to do something this upcoming week to help address that particular issue. Maybe it's checking text confirmations, or doing some phone confirmations, or email confirmations, or following up with patients who have no-showed two appointments in a row. There is literally always something that you can do. I don't care what problem it is; there is always something you can do. Why do you think, in terms of success, there is the upper 1% of the 1/10 of 1%? It's because those people will do what it takes to be successful. They have the patience to endure and to do the right things longer than the people who give up. And so, I implore my team, as a personal development skill- building initiative for them, not for me, not for the company, not for the practice, but it's for them. I want them to learn how to achieve a goal, especially when they're coming in front of obstacles and don't know what to do next, this is the education, this is your personal and professional development. By the way, when we meet some of these goals, you get a bonus, there's financial opportunity as well. But that's not really the motivating factor, it's got to be, \"I want to learn how to achieve a goal.\" That is a life skill, and I can't implore that enough, you've got to share that with your teams. 4 Creating leaders (game time!) My job as the leader and supporting my team, and my leaders' job to support their teams, is really to help them solve their challenges, to help them overcome those obstacles, and that's where we're providing ongoing support for our team. And as I help my leaders become better problem solvers for their team, they're becoming better leaders. As they become better leaders, that provides them with more opportunity. As they help their team drive better results, and they're building their skill set, then they get to move into a leadership position as well. It is this rising tide that raises all boats, and it becomes exponential throughout the organization. Team meeting prep and facing performance issues I never go into these meetings blind. Every single one of my direct reports does a weekly status report. At the end of the week, I get an email or a series of emails, because we do it on Microsoft Planner, for the most part. Some people do it by email; I give a little bit of leeway there. But I get an email or communication that tells me very specific things about very specific elements of the business that I need to know. They do it for me, but I tell them and it's true, most importantly, they do it for themselves. Having that information going into a meeting, it's empowering for both parties because my direct report can say, \"Hey, I'm sure you saw my status report, X, Y, Z.\" And I'll be like, \"Yes, I saw that, that's great,\" or, \"Yes, I saw that, so what are we going to do about this? What are your thoughts around how do we solve this particular issue?\" It expedites the communication. And with performance or other issues, what happens when poop hits the fan? What are you going to do then, because not everything is always roses? When you have performance issues, this is my framework. When something is not going well, I will sit down with a member of my team and say, first and foremost, \"Help me understand X,\" whatever X is. Now, if I really feel like it's a behavioral issue, I will ask the question, \"How does this behavior align with our core values? How does it align with synergy?\" If a staff member is coming in late, tell me how ORGANIZATIONS IN 2022 THAT REPORT THAT LEADERSHIP IS LACKING (SOURCE: GALLUP)PRACTICE CENTRAL Our hiring process is not fast. We put people through an extensive process. And why do we do that? Well, what's one of our core values \u2014 tenacity. 44 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMThe best got better.

Invariably, they know the answer to that question, and it doesn't help the team. And then the question is, \"How do you think this impacts the business? How do you think it impacts the teammates? How do you think it impacts the patients, whatever the situation actually might be?\" And then they have to answer and think through that question. And then, \"What must be true for this to be resolved, for this to change, for this to get better, for you to make improvements?\" And then the last question is, \"What are you going to commit to?\" After talking through the solutions with them, what are they going to commit to for improvement? I'm ashamed to admit this, but I used to walk into a meeting and be like, \"This can't continue.\" What is my direct report going to do with that? They know it can't continue, they know the result is not good, I'm just basically telling them that they're doing a crappy job and they better figure it out on their own. For terrible bosses, I was the poster boy for that. But you learn and you evolve. Over time I've reached out to as many resources as I can regarding leadership. I'm constantly learning and reading, watching great videos of leaders; you learn to do it differently. And what you learn over time is that when you really get in there, and you're there to help your people, and dig in, and really support them identifying performance issues, you can do it in a way where you're providing support. Then you're going to get a much better result. It's a focus on progress, but we're not perfect. If you focus on progress over time, and the goal is perfection \u2014 we'll probably never be perfect, but at least we're always focused on progress. Your culture is critical Be clear about who you are, what you believe, and how you behave by having a very clear, concise and authentic mission statement and core values. First who, then what \u2014 bring the right people into your organization who align with your core values and your mission. Make sure you onboard them correctly. Spend a tremendous amount of time on training, as it's an evolving process. Again, we're not perfect at training. Sometimes we've had to throw people into roles, but do your very best to evolve the training process over time. Lastly, support your team to the very best of your ability as a leader and you will see these people rise to the occasion. Support their people, as again, a rising tide raises all ships.

As chiropractors, we should be thinking digital laser foot scan, digital X-ray, MRI, cold laser therapy and spinal decompression. These are the technologies that will help any chiropractor become a better diagnostician and healer. I've lectured for years that the chiropractic scope of practice in every state is far broader than that of any other profession, both diagnostically and therapeutically. Many chiropractors who are practicing today, however, fall victim to the restrictions and guidelines of their academic teachings, insurance guidelines, and a totally mis-educated public who is taught to take a pill because they haven't got time for the pain. The opioid crisis is the result of that thinking. New guidelines for the chiropractic practice Let's create new guidelines. Let's set our goals and objectives to use the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that are clin - ically, emotionally, physically and economically best for your patients regardless of insurance coverage or medical opinion.The digital laser foot scan The human being is an architectural structure and the feet are the foundation. Ask any architect if they're comfortable with an imbalanced foundation. The human being must be looked at the same way. The feet are a critical part of the exam as most people have moderate to severe pronation of the feet.\u00b9 The kinetic chain will compensate to find balance. If we don't correct the feet/ foundation when collapse is present, we'll never correct the compensations. An adjustment may temporarily alter the mechanics; however, the abnormal loading will cause fixations and subluxations to quickly return starting when the patient stands upright. Digital X-ray The industry today discourages the importance of X-rays. This has much to do with the fact that medical opinion doesn't see the benefit of X-rays for musculoskeletal prob - lems and biomechanics is not part of their concern \u2014 it's primarily-only pathology. NEW TECH GUIDELINES FOR CHIROPRACTIC Let's create new diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that are best for patients BY TIM MAGGS, DC TIME TO READ: 6-8 MIN. THE TAKEAWAY Technology such as digital X-ray, foot scanning, cold laser, decompression and more make it much easier to influence proper patient decision-making. 52 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMSupport the chiropractic profession by donating to the Foundation for Chiropractic Progress at the 2022 ChiroThon.

ATTEND VIRTUALLY! www.F4CP.org/ChiroThonThat's why most of the time medical doctors take X-rays, the patient is told the X-rays are negative. They are never negative for biomechanics, and it's the biomechanical information that is most likely causing the condition that brings the patient to the provider. Findings such as abnormal centers of gravity, vertebral rotation or wedging, femoral head height difference (fhhd), sacral base angle, Ferguson's center of gravity line, bone quality and disc integrity are seen on X-ray. I do a two-view cervical and two-view L-S standing while barefoot as the baseline series for every patient, even the uninjured 12-year-old. Research shows that 64% of the population have fhhd >3mm when X-rayed barefoot, while 42% have >5mm fhhd.\u00b2 You can't know this without X-rays. MRI, the other 50% X-rays show 50% of a patient's musculoskeletal system and MRI shows the other 50%. Most chiropractors are guessing at what the actual diagnosis is, and then are not equipped to provide the proper care for the actual diagnosis. Case in point: a 38-year-old athlete with right-sided sciatic pain. The chiropractor doesn't do a foot scan, doesn't X-ray and doesn't order an MRI. The patient comes in for adjustment after adjustment after adjustment and always goes home hoping to feel better. The problem is, they are missing the root of the problem. When the appropriate tests are done, the findings might show a moderate collapse (pronation) of the feet, and 47% weight distribution on the right and 53% weight distribution on the left. On X-ray, a femoral head height difference of 12.4mm is shown. On MRI, there is a disc extrusion at L5. This diagnosis requires so much more than 12 adjustments, and chiropractors have the scope to both diagnose and treat this condition better than anyone else. Custom 3-arch orthotics Chiropractors fail to understand the magnitude of importance in recommending custom orthotics to their patients. Increased Q angles, unlevel knees, unlevel femoral head heights, pelvic rotations, uneven weight distribution, fixations and subluxations all originate with collapse of the feet. You must recommend custom orthotics as the very first step in correcting any of the above and more.TECH TALK 1/2 X-RAYS SHOW 50% OF A PATIENT'S MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM AND MRI SHOWS THE OTHER 50% Report of findings example A patient undergoing decompression therapyMost chiropractors are guessing at what the actual diagnosis is, and then are not equipped to provide the proper care for the actual diagnosis. 54 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMAMPLIFY RECOVERY TRADESHOW SPECIAL BOOTH #207 The first 50 clinicians to sign up for a wholesale account will receive a free KT Recovery+\u00ae WAVE .with KT Recovery +\u00ae products Cold laser therapy Cold laser therapy, in my opinion, is the therapy of the future. Light therapy has gained a very high level of awareness and understanding, and from a clinical perspective and patient satisfaction perspective, I can't imagine any office not having laser today. From pain to injuries, bruises to fractures, bone marrow and soft tissue edema, and many other patient complaints, cold laser is the treatment of choice. It's easy, it's safe and it's unattended. I have seven lasers in my clinic. Spinal decompression When you realize that almost all humans develop MRI find - ings from the age of 30 on, findings such as degeneration, desiccation, stenosis, edema and disc injuries, you realize this modality is invaluable to help patients reach their highest level of potential. We live a compressed existence with aging and gravity, so decompression makes sense for virtually everyone. This computerized traction and release therapy allows many of the conditions to heal, not just provide symptomatic help as medications, cortisone shots or surgeries do. I have three systems in my clinic and we use decompression on 40% of all patients. Patients absolutely love it and respond extremely well. Utilize technology for better care When you do an examination that provides visual evidence on a patient, including a digital laser foot scan and standing digital X-rays, you have a much greater influence over appropriate decision-making by the patient. In my office, it doesn't matter whether they have insurance or not. When your exam has visual evidence and it makes sense, people will gladly pay to get well. Every human wants a high quality of life until the day they die, and this technology reigns superior to all other exams and treatments available today.

I have always joked about this for years with my wife to the point that when she asks me what I want from the grocery store, I will respond with \"new patients.\" It's our little inside joke. While I agree that new patients are the lifeblood of most practices, this should not be your only metric. Unfortunately, most practice owners spend more effort on finding new patients while ignoring conversion and retention stats. Pay attention to collections After new patient stats, most chiropractors obsess about weekly visit totals. Still, if your goal is more revenue, you should also track your collection-per-visit average. This is a simple calculation of total revenue divided by total visits, which is not perfect. Still, if you must calculate it by hand, this is the easiest way to arrive at a number. It won't be ideal if you take insurance, personal injury or prepay. This is because you collect revenue on a prepay for visits you haven't delivered and will deliver insurance and personal injury (PI) KPIs AND YOUR EHR Key performance indicators every practice should look at BY NAOTA HASHIMOTO, DC TIME TO READ: 8-10 MIN.

You may have performed a service without collecting that revenue for months or years afterward with insurance or med-legal cases. Some doctors get hung up on that being a problem. Still, statistics should give feedback about trends. One statistic on any given day shouldn't be critical when making business decisions. For example, trends of collection/visit dropping combined with declining new patients, revenue and office visits tell a story about a dying practice. Still, a high collection- per-visit average for one month doesn't make your practice desirable or undesirable. Because some large PI checks could significantly affect that number. Utilize your EHR and software That's why I prefer to use software to calculate this collection- per-visit average. It can get a more accurate number by looking at revenue collected on each patient visit, and it creates an aggregate average of all those visits. It allows you to view that number by type of insurance, provider and more. If you have a heavy insurance practice, you can also look at older data to determine an accurate number. Another number I like to look at is the patient drop-off analysis in practice. I know many doctors who like patient visit average (PVA), which is a good number to provide a general idea of patient longevity. Still, it doesn't show you the specific area to fix in your practice. To calculate patient drop-off, you would create a bar graph indicating when patients drop out of care. For example, you would tally up a total of patients who dropped out after a single visit, a total of patients who dropped out after two visits, a total of patients who dropped out after three visits, etc. If you can determine when patients drop out of care, you can put measures in place to increase the average amount of visits you see a patient. Remember, if you want to increase your net revenues, you can: \u00b7 Increase your collection-per-visit average \u00b7 Increase your volume \u00b7 Reduce your accounts receivable \u00b7 Reduce your operating costsTECH TALK Are there pieces of education you could drip on the patient after they some of the most powerful lasers made.

Yochum Terry R. YochumFEATURED SPEAKERS: Sports Chiropractic Women in Chiropractic Animal Chiropractic Neuroscience Techniques & Best Practices in Patient Care And MoreIncreasing your volume We discussed how new patients increase your volume, but increasing the average amount of visits is an easy way to improve your volume. If you notice that most of your patients are dropping after six visits, getting them to stay on average for three more visits would potentially increase your revenue by up to 50%. Think about going from six to nine visits on average. If you notice that most of your patients drop off before their subsequent re-examination, it may be time to start scheduling a re-examination before that dropout point. During your re-evaluation, you can look at their functional progress and revisit their treatment goals on that visit. Their symptoms may be reduced, but they probably don't have functional improvement, which would warrant more visits. In addition, this would be an excellent time to remind them why they started the treatment in the first place. Utilize all patient education avenues Are there pieces of education you could drip on the patient after they start? These could be emails, texts, videos or handouts to help educate the patient about the importance of spine health. When I was in practice, I used to have regular workshops where I discussed the importance of daily spinal hygiene exercises. It was my posture, pain and wellness workshop where I educated my patients about functional movement, fascia, posture and what the exercises accomplish. If I was a subluxation-based practice, this would be a great forum to discuss subluxation. The beauty of practice is that it's called a practice for a reason, and you can improve it if you wish. Your practice today is the one you built, and if it's not where you want it to be, it's because you tolerated the problems for too long \u2014 but you could start changing that tomorrow if you wish. Patient drop-off analysis, in my opinion, is a great way to measure when patients are dropping off, so you know where to put your time, energy and focus. PVA and type of visits I would also look at the patient visit average (PVA), which can be calculated in two ways. Still, I always preferred the method of total office visits divided by the total number of patients who started a treatment plan. That way, if you had an influx of new patients from a spinal screening or Facebook that may be of lower quality, it wouldn't lower this number dramatically. I always looked at the type of visits with my weekly patient visits.

Since we collected on 100% of our office visits, I could afford to bonus my team on office visit statistics. If you're not bonusing your team on stats, you are missing out because it's one of the easiest ways to boost production. If you don't want to commit to a long-term bonus structure, you might consider doing a quarterly team bonus. For example, if we reach 180+ visits for five out of the next 12 weeks, the entire team will get a new pair of shoes, and every week they hit their goal, you can buy the team lunch. Measuring your success EMR/EHR systems are great for many things. Still, billing, ledgers, documentation, record storage and scheduling are the focus. Obscure reports like these, plus patient management reports and practical reactivation campaigns, are an afterthought. However, that's not a dig on the EMRs. They have a long list of things to do, like all of us. Unfortunately, sometimes the government gets involved with something like the CURES Act that hijacks the road map with new regulatory changes. Now you must figure out how to find these metrics in your system. Look at the trends in your practice. You can make sound business decisions based on actual trends rather than a gut feeling, which is how a business should operate. I prefer using software to generate these reports over hand calculations because they are consistent, so you have real trends. Further, if you are wasting hours of staff time gathering stats, they could be spending their time growing your practice.

These live, web-based seminars can help build relationships with your existing patient base and expand your reach to attract new patients to your prac - tice community. They encourage audience participation through real-time interaction. Webinars have grown in popularity due to the explosive use of online communication platforms such as Zoom, GoToMeeting and Facebook Live. Let's review some of the reasons webinars are such a great marketing strategy. Establish yourself as an expert You can use webinars to educate your patients about the services you provide and the conditions you treat. This strengthens your position as an industry leader and expert. When people register for your webinar based upon the information you will share, they are demonstrating that they are interested in what you have to say. You can use your webinar attendance as a gauge of the demand for the topic you are discussing. Low attendance could mean that your audience doesn't have the particular problem you are hoping to solve. Webinars can also function as a focus group to test the demand for services you are considering offering in your practice in the future. Maximize the use of visuals Most webinar platforms allow you to use your webcam, so use it! Your webinar will have more impact when people can see you presenting.

Avoid copy text smaller than 28 points and limit the use of bullet points to a maximum of 3-4 per slide. Even better, avoid bullet points altogether, and focus on creating slides with graphic images that help tell your story and communicate your main points. If you are not the creative type, hire a designer to help give your slides the impact they need. It will be worth your investment. Invite guest speakers to increase interest Do you have multiple providers in your practice, such as a massage therapist or acupuncturist? Consider inviting them on your webinar for an interview-style conversation. This will help promote their services within your practice. You can also spotlight other practice team members for their unique contributions to your practice. Do you have a relationship with any local influencers in your community, such as athletes, business owners or celebrities? You can grow your audience by leveraging their popularity and asking them to promote the webinar to their following. You can grow your audience substantially through cross-promotion. Generate new leads When someone registers for your webinar, they provide you with their contact information. This gives you the opportunity to follow up with an offer to opt-in to receive more information about products or services they are interested in in the future.

Studies show it can take between 7-10 interactions before someone decides to take action. Gaining someone's interest and attention through a webinar may be the first step in completing the sale. Follow-up marketing Once you've completed your webinar, post it on YouTube or Vimeo and send a link to the recording to those who regis - tered but couldn't attend the live event. People may have forgotten about the webinar, or the timing didn't mesh with their schedule. It is not unusual for more people to watch the recorded webinar than those who attended the live one. Webinar attendance is not a determining factor in lead quality. People who didn't attend your webinar can still be good leads. Don't make the mistake of assuming that people who didn't attend your webinar aren't interested in your services. In fact, they may even be better leads since they have a busy schedule and may be more likely to need your services. Practice makes perfect If you are not used to presenting or haven't done a webinar before, it's essential to take some time to practice your presentation. Do a practice run in front of a friend or colleague. Record a video of yourself giving the webinar and then play it back to identify areas that need polishing. Focus on quality, not quantity. One well-done webinar per month is better than four mediocre webinars. Finally, promote your webinars with email, Facebook ads, in your practice newsletter and with in-office signage. Sending an email reminder the day before the event can increase attendance from 20-33%. There are numerous benefits to using webinars to grow your practice. Although we've only discussed some of them, it should be clear that webinars are an excellent tool to build patient engagement and grow your practice. Think about how you can use webinars for lead generation and to increase patient retention. Who knows? Maybe you'll end up being the next internet sensation.

THE TAKEAWAY Consider the plant-based ingredient that not only improves the absorption of sometimes-difficult fat-soluble nutrients but has health-promoting properties all on its own. WHETHER IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY YOUR COLLEAGUES OR PATIENTS, you may have had to contend with the belief that supplemental ingredients are too difficult for the body to absorb, and therefore of little use. And to be fair, there is some truth there; nutrients do have to be absorbed in order to be useful. To make natural medicines of any type more effective and consistent, they may require an extra boost. Sometimes, nutrients that have already shown promise just need a little help to make them better and easier to take. Curcumin from turmeric is a great example. It is considered one of the plant's most valuable compounds, but to get much benefit from it, large doses \u2014 up to 12 grams in some cases \u2014 were previously recommended. That's why I prefer curcumin blended with turmeric essential oil for better absorption and bioavailability \u2014 compared to standard extracts, it is 700% better absorbed.1 But what about nutrients that don't have analogous absorption systems, like turmeric oil is for curcumin? How do you get fat-soluble ingredients, which are by their very nature tougher for the body to absorb, into the bloodstream so they can provide your patients with real, noticeable benefits? 72 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMGamma cyclodextrin for absorption Gamma cyclodextrin is an oligosaccharide \u2014 a plant-based ingredient \u2014 that improves the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients by enveloping them in an open-ended microscopic structure, sometimes described as \"bucket shaped\" or as a \"truncated cone.\" The exterior of this molecule is water-soluble, which allows it to escort ingredients through intestinal walls for better absorption. But however you want to think about it, the important thing to remember is that gamma cyclodextrin makes nutrients that may be difficult for the body to absorb and use into much more beneficial, efficacious and consistent natural medicines.2 Berberine, for example, is a compound many practitioners recommend to help their patients regulate blood sugar levels, reduce triglycerides and protect DNA. But large doses of berberine have become the standard for many practitioners, because the absorption rate is normally so low. But paired with gamma cyclodextrin, this absorption-resistant nutrient could do its good work much more efficiently.3-5 Other nutrients that become even more useful when paired to gamma cyclodextrin include CoQ10, quercetin, propolis and red ginseng. In fact, the case for combining CoQ10 with gamma cyclodextrin is an especially strong one: it's been shown to boost absorption by as much as 800%.6WELLNESS APPROACH GAMMA CYCLODEXTRIN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE LEVELS BY 47%Gamma cyclodextrin is an oligosaccharide \u2014 a plant- based ingredient \u2014 that improves the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients... 74 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMClinical examples Recent clinical work shows that the addition of gamma cyclodextrin to a proprietary, hydroponically-grown red ginseng (HRG80) improved the energy, stamina and mental clarity effects of the botanical in individuals dealing with post-viral fatigue. It appears that simply adding gamma cyclodextrin meant that people could experience the same benefits at an even lower dosage level of red ginseng compared to an encapsulated version that didn't include the compound (although, it should be noted that both forms reduced symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and post-viral states). Other work with caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a component of propolis, found that the compound's anti-tumor activity was greatly enhanced when it was combined with gamma cyclodextrin \u2014 most likely because this pairing made the polyphenol-rich ingredient more stable and bioavailable. And quercetin, a natural ingredient that moderates allergic reactions and bolsters viral immunity, has extremely variable bioavailability.9 Combining it with gamma cyclodextrin, along with vitamin C to help recycle the nutrient in the body, could be a key to delivering consistent levels of compounds to the bloodstream, making it a much more reliable option for your patients who struggle with allergies or who want to strengthen their immune responses.

For example, research shows that the compound lowered post - prandial glucose levels by 47%.10 If you've noticed patients struggling with their weight or blood sugar, that's one more good point in favor of recommending a supplement that includes it in the formulation. Bioavailable and bioactive forms of botanicals, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients are already incredibly valuable for their inherent healing abilities and their practicality for any patient's regimen. After all, if a given nutrient is better absorbed, it requires fewer dosages, and that generally means better patient compliance. Gamma cyclodextrin can greatly assist compliance and, as a result, efficacy as well.

THE TAKEAWAY In addition to chiropractic care and a multi-modal treatment approach, support the heart and lungs for long-haul patients and do everything you can to increase oxygenation to the cells, including this nutritional advice. LONG-COVID PATIENTS, or post-acute COVID-19 cases, are defined as the presence of symptoms extending beyond three weeks from the initial onset of symptoms. Long- Haul Syndrome is reserved for chronic COVID-19 symptoms extending beyond 12 weeks.1 The most persistent symptoms I hear from long-haulers include (in no particular order): \"I'm just tired,\" to severe \"fatigue\" or \"exertion of has breath\" to \"I get I have heart problems;\" \"Pins and needles sensations in the arms and legs;\" \"Tingling in my arms and legs;\" \"Headaches\" (from mild to severe); \"Everything gets worse when I am fatigued;\" \"I had to stop participating in sports\" (or other activities); \"Feeling faint\" from Other common symptoms are pain or tightness in the chest, chills or sweats, brain fog, palpitations, light-headedness, concentration challenges, and confusion and memory problems. I'm used to treating the \"good-day, bad-day feeling\" patients, but long-haulers exhibit a new level of this. CDC long-haul symptoms The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says people commonly report experiencing different combinations of the following symptoms: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; tiredness or fatigue; symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities (also known as post-exertional malaise); difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\"); cough; chest or stomach pain; headache; fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart or muscle pain; pins-and-needles mood changes; change in smell or taste; and changes in menstrual period cycles. 80 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMThe chiropractor approach to long-hauler rehabilitation Coronavirus can stymie any organ and tissue in the body, especially the lungs. Chiropractors must support the heart and lungs, and restore healthy breathing. Spend time teaching patients powerful breathing methods; use your hands and modalities that improve circulation and movement of lymph in the body, and help clear toxins and carbon dioxide from the body. I look for procedures and methods to improve oxygenation to the cells. This may include: Stress reduction: Prioritize rest and relaxation; avoid pushing yourself; balance activity and breaks; use meditation and breathing. Sleep: I insist patients get more sleep and I will do everything I can to help these patients improve deep and REM sleep. Monitor this with various wearable devices. Energy optimization: Blend together mitochondrial nutritional support (see below) and movement, and limit the hours of work per day. Exercise: The best thing is to listen to your body. If you know that something's pushed you over the edge in the past, then don't repeat it. Do something active, but for less time or less strenuously. I start my patients with marching in place and moving the arms overhead. This allows patients to do this at home or outside but certainly stay close to home. I literally start with two-minute bouts. If that goes well, they increase the two-minute march in place to several times a day. I talk about \"strategic pacing\" and stacking exercise throughout the day rather than doing it all at once. This is a concept to help conserve energy. I monitor movement steps on smartphones. Detoxification: Sweat, use saunas, light therapy, hot showers, etc. I encourage patients to try and mobilize the body enough to sweat and excrete toxins. My long-haulers therapy approach has been going after key components of a post-viral syndrome. I look to include the following treatment in my overall program: 1. Mitochondrial support with key micronutrients. Ensuring that the mitochondria are well-supported nutritionally will enable every other aspect of a healing program to work more effectively. 2. Microbiome support guided by comprehensive stool testing. COVID-19 viral particles are frequently found in fecal samples. Further, several gut commensal organisms with known immunomodulatory potential, including bifidobacteria, are underrepresented in COVID-19 patient samples. It is important to engage patients in making dietary changes and in the use of supplements aimed at improving microbiome health. Avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics is also key. 3. Adrenal support with micronutrients, botanicals such as ginseng and ashwagandha, and even hormone replacement. It's important to check cortisol levels and achieve optimal physiological ranges. 4. Deep, restorative sleep is an absolute necessity. 5. Avoidance of excessive stress . 6. Environmental testing to rule out the possibility of mold exposure and chemical toxicity that can contribute to a patient's lack of immune resilience. Chiropractic treatment and modalities What can the chiropractor do in these cases? Targeted chiro - practic treatment, including: Anything chiropractic: For me this includes hands-on therapy (mobilization, manipulation and modalities), photobiomodulation laser light treatments, PEMF, frequency therapy, vibration/percussion, therapy, TECAR therapy and SCENAR therapy. Diet: High-fat whole foods and a plant-rich diet (ketogenic, intermittent fasting). Nutrient optimization: In addition to the supplements below, eating lots of green leafy vegetables throughout the day; include arugula, lettuce, beets, celery, broccoli and turmeric, etc., at every meal. These are rich sources of nitrates and will help create less arterial stiffness. Topical cream: Every patient gets CBD with a menthol base. This can help aches and pains and work on a microvascular level. WELLNESS APPROACH POST-EXERTIONAL MALAISE A LONG-HAUL SYMPTOM THAT GETS WORSE AFTER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ACTIVITIES Look into the Mast Cell Diet for patients who seem continuously inflamed, especially with lung and heart problems. 82 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMCognitive optimization: Get the brain active. Hormonal optimization: Check the thyroid, adrenal and sex hormones. Gut optimization: Heal leaky gut, include probiotics and eat more diverse (fermented) foods. Immune/inflammation optimization: Check off everything above and use specific herbs/nutrients the patient might need. I follow and recommend the Front Line Critical Covid-19 Care Alliance recommendations. For specific supplementation these are: Vitamin C, 500-1,000 mg twice a day Zinc, 100 mg/day Quercetin, 250 mg twice a day Vitamin D, 4,000-5,000 IU per day Melatonin, 10 mg before bed Omega-3 fatty acids, 4 grams/day In addition to the above, my clinical and research experience has identified several key mitochondrial nutrients that, when combined, yield synergistic and clinically These nutrients are even more effective when administered with therapeutic dosages of key cofactors including Look into the Mast Cell Diet for patients who seem continuously inflamed, especially with lung and heart problems. Fasting may not be for everyone, but try a 1- to 3-day fasting protocol to help with monocytes on the list. Long-Haul Syndrome and testing Some Long-Haul Syndrome patients are able to monitor measures of blood. Testing can help explain persistent symp - toms, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Clotting markers have been significantly elevated with long-haulers compared with healthy controls. All comorbidities associated with virus are nitric oxide (NO) deficient states. I can easily test NO levels in the office with a simple saliva test strip. Nitric oxide governs circulation and micro-circulation, modifies platelet activation/aggregation aka clotting , and is inhibits deposition, is anti-atherogenic, inhibits platelet adhesion molecules, inhibits leukocyte adherence and migration, and inhibits microvascular inflammation. By age 40, endothelial NO (eNOS) functions around 50%; by the time we are 60, only around 15%. When eNOS is dysfunctional or uncoupled it becomes a superoxide, generating enzyme instead of NO generating enzyme, and increasing oxidative stress. Many factors increase eNOS uncoupling including age, SAD (Standard American Diet), lack of exercise, meds such as antibiotics, antidepressants, birth control pills, NSAIDs, in toothpaste, mouthwash, EMF, pollution, glyphosate, genetic SNPs and stress. A key therapy for me is to optimize NO for prevention, recovery from virus, as well as vax shots and boosters. Supporting the nitrate/nitrite/NO pathway not only increases NO directly, it helps recouple NOS, increasing NO through that pathway, and decreasing superoxide production and oxidative stress. I show my patients a list of vegetables that increase nitrate and/or offer them a clinically proven nitrate supplement. Supporting long-hauler patients If the heart and lungs are not able to adequately respond to the physical stress of exercise, support the heart and lungs. Try to restore patients with less efficiency at exercising. Those with brain fog or cognitive issues will also have lower measures of oxygenation (even at rest) and will be especially poor at exercise efficiency. Look to recommending hyberbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for patients with reduced oxygen uptake, reduced cardiac performance and inefficient pulmonary ventilation. Again, do everything you can to increase oxygenation to the cells. Some long-haulers do have organ damage and/or muscle conditions. Chiropractic manual therapy and a multi-modal treatment approach is helping my patients improve the mitochondria dysfunction. Medical doctors have rest and medications to offer. We can provide manipulation, sound nutritional advice, fascial therapy, and modalities that are improving the lives of these patients.

The more testing, the more you know.MARKETING MATTERS THE RISE IN DIGITAL MEDIA CONSUMPTION has chiroprac - tors all-in on switching from traditional outreach methods to modern tactics like email marketing, email testing, and taking advantage of all forms of digital outreach. Email marketing is one of the most reliable methods to introduce new services or staff members, ask for feedback, provide health tips, share success stories or announce events. To actually see what's working and what's not in your newsletters and optimize the relationship with your patients, though, you should invest in email testing. Don't be intimidated by A/B email testing Many marketers and business owners fall into the trap of following their instinct when they create emails, build their website or design a landing page. Guessing what will make your patients open your emails and interact with them will get you nowhere. This is where A/B testing comes in.TEST, AND RE-TEST How to master your email testing strategy for maximum return BY MARIA FINTANIDOU TIME TO READ: 9-11 MIN. 86 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMBut what does that mean? When we say, \"We Take Care of Our Own,\" it means providing our policyholders with the best malpractice policies possible. It means personal customer service from folks who understand your practice. It means helping the profession grow by funding research, supporting students, and working with state and national associations. In other words, it means everything.Learn more about how We Take Care of Our Own. ncmic.com WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN\u00ae We Take Care of Our Own is a registered trademark of NCMIC Group Inc. and NCMIC Risk Retention Group, Inc. \u00a9 NCMIC 2022 NFL 3256-10386A/B testing (or split testing) in email marketing is the process that allows you to create different campaign variants, send them to equal parts of your target audience, determine which of them performs better, and finally, dispatch the winning version to the rest of your recipients. Email testing is based on the fact that an element making an impact on a certain audience group won't do the same on a different one. So, you can monitor different newsletter components and make decisions based on data, not assumptions or case studies. Here are some of the elements you could perform A/B testing on: Email copy and design Subject lines Images Calls to action Senders In case you're wondering if it's worth the resources, bear in mind that split testing is a cost-effective method; furthermore, you can find various affordable email marketing services that allow you to run A/B tests without losing valuable time. Even a small change makes a difference; that's why performing email testing on different segments of your patient database will get you trustworthy results. In this article, we will analyze the best practices to create an effective email testing strategy. Set your goals As with everything in email marketing, defining your overall goal is vital. Is your priority to build trust between your practice and your active patients? What channels of communication does your audience prefer? Do you need to improve your customer referral rates? Now, how can email testing help you reach your objectives? Opt for versions that provide potential patients with information on how to take certain actions. Offer insight into how they can improve their health through chiropractic care and remind them of the benefits your services offer. If you're only trying to sell, they'll be disappointed. Think about which metrics are key for your business goals, such as open rates, click-through rates or new patient calls. Then, measure the performance of the two variants against each other, but make sure that the A/B winner is also doing better than your current results. Defining the key performance indicators (KPIs) should never come as an afterthought. Plan your testing goals beforehand to ensure you can monitor how different newsletter versions affect your audience's behavior. Otherwise, your email testing strategy could fail, given that you might set up the wrong kind of tests to begin with. Select the correct sample size Getting as much information as possible regarding your audi - ence sample is a factor you shouldn't underestimate. That data allows you to form your testing hypothesis and offer a frame - work for evaluating test results. To acquire them, enrich your website or email design with elements like surveys and polls. After doing so, you'll have a clear picture of patients' profiles \u2014 and more control over them. Test two equally sized, randomly-selected groups to get consistent results. But how can you know you picked the correct sample size \u2014 especially since you probably have thousands of emails in your patient database? The answer depends on the split testing you wish to perform, your current conversion rates, and the percentage of revenue increase you're going after. In email campaigns, your sample size should be large enough to produce statistically significant and qualitative results. There are no standard figures, but you definitely need to calculate your sample size ahead of time to draw reliable conclusions. When your tests are completed, you will have an A/B winner to send to the rest of your list. Test one element at a time As mentioned, there are multiple elements to put to test. To measure the effectiveness of each test, it's crucial to isolate MARKETING MATTERS 541% SIMPLE SUBJECT LINES GET 541% MORE RESPONSES THAN CREATIVE ONES (SOURCE: MARKETING SHERPA)Include precise and inspiring phrases like: 'Check out these self-care tips' or how-to guides to describe your email's value and intrigue recipients. 88 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMNOT available in 67,000 Pharmacies Nationwide When you're retailing topical analgesics in your practice, providing all three can be challenging.

For instance, you might choose to test different wording in your subject lines to pinpoint the version with the highest open rate. Include precise and inspiring phrases like: \"Check out these self-care tips\" or how-to guides to describe your email's value and intrigue recipients. Another example would be to test different types of high- quality images inside your newsletters. Adding images of you or your team might prove to be more effective than a generic image since patients prefer to see the people who will treat them in a potential visit. Even something small like changing the CTA copy or color, adding testimonial videos, placing social share buttons for recipients to share your tips on their social media, or replacing an image can boost your newsletter performance. Split tests will give you all the answers you need and help you discover what content resonates with your audience. Form your hypothesis Once you set your priorities, it's time to come up with a hypoth - esis and run an experiment. If you start testing without a clear hypothesis such as \"Version A will outperform version B,\" you're just wasting time. A hypothesis is an idea about which variable to test \u2014 and why \u2014 and what changes you expect after applying the winning variant.

Has the winning variant led to more appointments? If so, consider implementing the changes needed to enhance your newsletter effectiveness and sending the winning variant to the rest of your audience. If not, then you'll know that the variable tested didn't produce the desired impact or that your results are inconclusive. In that case, you can either use your original email version or change your hypothesis and run a different test. Email testing: give it time Last but not least, we strongly recom - mend that you don't stop email testing. Failed data offer lessons to be applied in future testing efforts. Keep testing even if you had the desired outcome. As the saying goes: Repetition is the mother of learning. Your patients' needs and pref - erences keep evolving, so there's always room for optimization. Email testing is an essential method to showcase what type of email marketing content generates qualified leads and enhances patient engagement. There are many tools that enable you to test, but you need patience and thorough research to make it work.

However, this triune is the perfect foundation to prepare for your next opportunity as an associate doctor. There is a clear science to prepare and excel during a job interview. The basics behind the science of interviewing that consistently convey your level of skill and professionalism can help you land the best chiropractic associate job available. Arrive early Punctuality is perhaps the most obvious but often the most frequently overlooked aspect of interviewing. \"It's amazing how common it is for candidates to show up a few minutes late,\" says Adriana Loya, director of placement for Chiro Matchmakers. \"It is always frustrating when a perfectly qualified associate job candidate is immediately rejected because they showed up a couple of minutes late for their first interview. This is an easy pitfall to avoid.\" Arriving early for an interview immediately shows that you are interested and provides a grace period in the case of unexpected events. Traffic and parking issues can easily add 10-15 minutes or more to your travel time. People are rarely late for things they regard as essential and a high priority; therefore, arriving early to your interview immediately sets a high standard. Ditch the casual attire Another basic science to improve your odds of landing your dream job is how you dress. The bottom line is your interview outfit must be professional. After all, you are a doctor, and even though the attire used in chiropractic offices has become more casual in recent years, still showing up in professional dress shows you care. You can always show up casually to match the work culture after the job is yours.

STUDENT DC a second chance to make that first impression, so take full advantage of it by dressing for the job you want. \"I have a hard time taking a candidate seriously when they come into the interview with sports attire on,\" says Adrian Velasquez, DC, director of Health Quest Chiropractic in Albuquerque, N.M., who recently went through a round of interviews looking for an associate doctor for his growing practice. \"Because so few people wear suits today, it immediately sets those candidates apart from the rest of the pack.\" A quick tip is to visit the practice website or even drive by the location before your interview. You can get a feel for how the team dresses when taking care of patients and how they like to be seen by the community. Use what you see as a baseline for what you choose to wear to the interview. Your communication, verbal and non-verbal The science of communication is where you have an oppor - tunity to wow the interviewer. We are well aware that communication is more than simply our words. Your body language, eye contact, posture and hand gestures communi - cate interest and engagement. Typically, the interviewer has a list of questions they are working on, but your level of engagement often differentiates you from your competition for the position. Take the pressure off yourself by knowing there is no perfect answer to any given interview question. Often, your answers convey excitement or can relate your past experiences directly to the given question that gets the most respect. It's important to be completely honest during your interview. Trying to sneak something by a potential team member can start the relationship on the wrong foot. Most often, this occurs when describing techniques or experiences. If you're a newer chiropractor, you may feel as though you need to stretch the truth regarding experience or technique certifications. Resist the urge and remember, you're not just looking to get a job. You're looking for a place where you can spend years of your life improving the health of the people in that community. The key actions to communicate your interest and enthusiasm are maintaining comfortable eye contact, leaning forward and giving thoughtful examples that directly address your answers from your past experiences. \"If you bring a genuine energy and excitement to your answers, it will have a major impact on how you are perceived,\" Loya says. Your outlook, or philosophy as a chiropractor, is an area that allows you the opportunity to differentiate yourself from your competition. Find your philosophical fit There is a wide range of approaches to the practice of chiro - practic. Understanding a practice's preferences, adjusting techniques and philosophy can help you decide if that role is a good fit for you. The happiest associate doctors practice in clinics that match their philosophy and approach to health. Think of it this way \u2014 practices that align with your philosophy are more likely to have an abundance of your ideal patients. Nothing is more fun and energizing than providing care for a practice full of your ideal patients. And nothing is more challenging and disheartening than showing up to a practice filled with patients you are not excited to treat. This perspective will help you immediately discern which opportunities can be a great long-term fit for you and jobs that will likely not be the best cultural fit for you to spend your time, energy and focus working for. And, of course, there is the art of practicing chiropractic in our triune. Applying this to interviewing extends beyond your preferred technique of choice and into the philosophy with which you approach patient care. $$$ BEWARE AN UNCLEAR JOB DESCRIPTION OR SLOPPY SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES THAT COULD IMPACT SALARY RANGEThe key actions to communicate your interest and enthusiasm are maintaining comfortable eye contact, leaning forward and giving thoughtful examples ... 96 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS AUGUST 14, 2022 CHIROECO.COMGAME-CHANGING THERAPIES 541 Village Trace NE, Bldg 11, Suite 102, Marietta, GA 30067 (770) 612-8245 Info@KinasMedical.com www.KinasMedical.com 1Below are the clinical studies showing the therapeutic & biological effects using STORZ EMTT\u00ae devices: 10.1053/j.jfas.2017.06.014.medical technologies EMTT - Extracorporeal Magnetotransduction Therapy is one of the most innovative, evidenced-based1 technologies to treat chronic musculoskeletal diseases and is an excellent complement to Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy.

EMTT\u00ae Radial AWT Focused SWT Benefits FCA Booth #210 STUDENT DC \"We see the best long-term satisfaction ratings for our associate doctor placements when we can find a strong match between the philosophy, technique and behavioral match between a clinic owner and a chiropractor looking for the right job,\" says Nick Lancaster, COO of Chiro Matchmakers. Some techniques can be learned on the job, while others require specific certification. Be mindful of the techniques you are qualified to use and those you are excited about. Matching the technique set of a practice with the passions of an associate can create a big win-win-win. That's a win for the practice, the associates, and most importantly, the patients receiving care. Create clarity if need be Another thing to consider when preparing for an interview is the clarity of the job description. If the job description is unclear, it can signify that the practice's office systems and proce - dures may also be a bit sloppy. There is a direct correlation between the success of an office and its systems and procedures. Therefore, the salary range they are willing to pay an associate doctor may be linked to how well the office's systems, procedures and job descriptions are defined. Based on this, remember that you too are interviewing the office along with them interviewing you for the job. Having a crystal-clear understanding of yourself (also known as self- awareness) as a chiropractor will help you determine if a job is right for you. When an office can clearly define the work that is expected of you through job descriptions, training and an onboarding program laid out for you, you can take solace in knowing you have likely found a great match. ALLEN MINER , DC, is a 2003 Parker College of Chiropractic graduate and has been practicing in Albuquerque, N.M., since 2003. He co-founded Chiro Matchmakers, which has placed thousands of DCs around the world. He is also the co-author of \"The Chiropractic Code,\" published in 2014.
