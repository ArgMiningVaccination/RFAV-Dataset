I work with people of all ages, but most typically with clients who want a healthy quality of life for their children and/or for themselves. I find my style of practice is ideal for those who are looking for not only improved health (physical, emotional, mental), but also accompanied with a deeper understanding of self that often adjoins the healing process. There is really no limitation to the scope of my practice since the focus is on the individual health of each person, and not exclusively on any physical condition or diagnosis. Each person has a unique set of needs and challenges and strive to provide individualized treatments and strategies that are tailored to your unique situation. OM Homeopathy offers absolute compassionate, holistic, individualized and complete care for each and everyone. Although I have set a consult fee, my practice is built upon the basis of true care and compassion. My \"no client left behind\" policy applies to clients with low income and financial difficulties. If you want to commence homeopathic treatment, but your financial circumstances make it difficult, please contact me to discuss available payment plans. Are you ready to dive deep into the world of homeopathy? Not sure if homeopathy is for you or not? If you aren't sure if homeopathy can help you, you're not alone.
