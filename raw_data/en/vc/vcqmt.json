One reason is to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. Alternative or renewable energy sources help to reduce the amount of toxins that are a result of traditional energy use. These al ternative energy sources help protect against the harmful by - products of energy use and help to preserve many of the natural resources that we currently use as energy sources. There are many alternative energy sources: wind power, solar power, geotherma l power, and hydroelectric power are some examples. Wind Power. Wind power is the ability to capture the wind in a way to propel the blades of wind turbines. When the blades rotate, this movement is switched into electrical current with the help of an electrical generator. In older windmills, wind energy turned mechanical machinery to do the physical work like crushing grain to make bread or pumping water to get water. Wind towers are built on wind farms, and usually there are several towers buil t together. In 2005 , the worldwide use of wind -powered generators was less t han 1% of all the electricity use combined. There are several advantages of this energy source: there is no pollution, it never runs out, farming and grazing can still take place on the same land as the wind turbines, and wind farms can be built anywhere. One disadvantage is that you need a consistent wind to get enough power. If the wind speed decreases, less electricity is produced. Large wind farms can also have a negative visual effect for people who live nearby. Solar Power. Solar energy is used for heating, cooking, making electricity, and even taking salt out of saltwater so the water can be drinkable and used for additional purposes that do not need the salt. Solar pow er uses sunlight that hits the solar thermal panels to convert the sunlight to heat either air or water. Other methods of using solar power include simply opening up blinds or shades and letting the sunlight pass into the room or using some type of mirror to heat water and produce steam. One advantage of solar power is that it is renewable. As long as there is sunlight, you will be able to harness the power from it. There is also no pollution and it ca n be used efficiently to heat and light things. You can see the benefits of solar energy in heating swimming pools, spas, and water tanks in many cities across the country. Geothermal Energy . Geothermal means \"earth heat\". This energy captures the heat energy under the Earth. Hot rocks under the ground help to heat water to produce steam. If holes are dug in this area of the ground, then the steam shoots up and is purified and used to drive turbines, which in turn gives power to electric generators. The advantages of this type of energy is that there are no harmful by -products, it is self-sufficient once the geothermal plant is built, and the plants are generally small so there is no negative visual effect on the area surrounding the plant. Hydroelectric Energy. The power that comes from the potential energy of water that is dammed up supplies energy to a water turbine and generator. Ano ther example of this energy is to make use of tidal power. Today, electric generators can be powered by hydro power that can run backwards as a motor to pump water for later use. An advantage is that you can control the use of the energy by controlling the water. You can also generate water all the time as there are no outside forces that prevent this from happening. Furthermore, there is no pollution in using this type of energy. In fact, you can reuse the water that is used for hydroelectric power. The di sadvantages are that dams are expensive to build and maintain. There also needs to be a powerful enough supply of water in the area to produce energy. In Conclusion. In your lifetime, there will be more advances made in the field of energy. Your generat ion will need to value the natural resources that human life needs on this earth. You will need to be part of the ongoing and individual application of alternative energy sources, so the Earth stays healthy and our resources stay renewed. 1.
