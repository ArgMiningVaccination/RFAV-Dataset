Health care -associated infections (HAI s) are one of the frequently encou ntered patient safety incidents in care delivery and poses a major public health challenge impacting on morbidity, mortality and quality of life. The prevalence of HAI s in mixed patient populations of low to middle income countries is approximately twice that of high- income countries These infections also present a significant economic burden at the societal and health facility level. Effective infection prevention and c ontrol (IPC) programmes have be en proven to be one of the cornerstone s for combating HAIs and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) . The National IPC Strategic Framework (2019) was aligned with the World Health Organization's (WHO) core components for IPC (2016 ). The strategic framework gives guidance to public and private health facilities and health workers on compliance with standards relating to IPC practises . To further assist health facilities to implement th e IPC strategic framework, this practical implem entation manual h as been developed in parallel to accompany th e document. I believe and trust that this practical manual for implementation of the National IPC Strategic Framework will strengthen evidence -based IPC practices at health facility level towar ds combating t hreats posed by epidemics , pandemics and AMR, achieving the WHO Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 6 in compliance with the International Health Regulations. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT My sincer e gratitude to the chairperson of the technical working group, Prof. Shaheen Mehtar, who led the development of the IPC strategic framework and implementation manual. Her dedication throughout the development of the document is highly commendabl e. I sinc erely thank the members of the technical working group - Ms Ronel Steinh\u00f6bel (co -chair), Ms Makhafola and Dr. Shaidah Asmall - for their invaluable expertise. A word of thanks to the National Hand Hyg iene work ing group lead by Ms Reshma Misra who develope d the draft Hand Hygiene Guideline that informed the section on hand hygiene. A special word of thanks is also extended to members of the various national committees, such as the National District Health Syst ems Committee, National Hospital Coordinating Committee , the Senior Management Committee , and the Ministerial Advisory Committee for Antimicrobial Resistance who provided valuable inputs on the first draft . My gratitude to the represen tatives of the priva te and public health sector and clusters withi n the National Department of Health (Primary Health Care and Hospital systems, HIV, Maternal health, TB) , academic institutions, professional bodies, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) who attended the National consultative meeting . The valuable inputs made during the workshop were used to refine the final document. Lastly but not the least, I express special appreciation to the World Health Organization for the technical support provid ed throughout the development of the document, especially Dr Rajesh Narwal from country office -South Africa, Dr Gertrude Avortri from regional office Africa and Mr Anthony Twyman from WHO -Headquarters. WHO -South Africa's support for the final lay -out and t echnical editing of the document and hosting of the National consultative workshop is also much appreciated.

This manual is aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO ) Core Component IPC programme1 recommendations and highlights the essentials for developing and improving IPC at health facility level in a systematic, stepwise manner for South Africa. It supports the Framework for the Prevention and Containment of AMR in South African Hospitals (2018) .2 TARGET AUDIENCE This manual is aimed at health workers at both public an d private health facilities , non- governmental and faith based organisations rendering health c are, including provincial/district / national level IPC practitioners/ managers responsible for implementa tion and governance of IPC programme at health facilities. This manual will be used as a basis for training of health workers . MULTIMODAL IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES TO IMPLEMENT INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL Using multimodal strategies (MMS s) will facilit ate the IPC process, involve and engage various stakeholders, will d efine and allocate responsibilities towards ensur ing commitment and sustainability of a national and health facility level IPC programme.1 All IPC activities should be contextually ground ed and driven by a multi modal approach which allows implementation in an integrated manner. This facilitates a group / team effort towards improving IPC practice , patient safety and reducing HAI and AMR . The IPC team supported by the IPC committee, is respon sible for applying a multimodal approach to various aspects of their work. Bundles of care and checklists should be incorporated into M MS. Leaders shou ld provide both political and financial support increasing accountability via monitoring and feedback, 1 World Health Organization.

Successful MMS include the involvement of champions or role models at national , provincial, distr ict and health facility level . WHO has identified five elements of an effective MMS towards ensuring th at IPC is visibly practiced throughout the entire health system. 1. System change ( Build it ): availability of the appropriate infrastructure and supplies to enable the implementation of infection prevention recommendations ; 2. Education and training (Teach it ) of health workers and key role -players; 3. Moni toring and feedback (Check it) infrastructure, practices, processes, outcomes and providing feedback based o n interpretation of data; 4. Reminders and communication (Sell it) improvements in the workplace ; 5. Culture ch ange (Live it ) within the health facility or the strengthening of a safety climate. See Figure 1 .1 Figure 1: MMS and the five areas that it addresses1 All five areas should be considered , and the necessary action tak en based on the local context , which is informed by periodic assessments .3 3World Health Organization.

Targeting only ONE area (that is, unimodal) at the expense of the others is highly likely to result in failure. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 11 STRUCTURE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL This manual is structured into nine sections with subsections giving specific guidance to implement the National IPC Strategic Framework . Where national documents already exist, reference s or links will be provided. The manual consist s of the following nine parts: Part A: Standard precautions hand hygiene ; appropriate use of personal protective equipment ; patient placement ; appropriate us e of antiseptics, disinfectant s and detergents; decontamination of m edical devices ; safe handling of linen and laundry ; health care waste management ; respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette ; environmental cleaning ; principles of asepsis ; injection safety, prevention of injuries from sharp in struments , post-exposure prophylaxis and medical surveillance ; Part B: Transmission -based precautions Part C: Built environment and infrastructure for IPC Part D: Surveillance of HAI s Part E: Antimicrobial stewardship Part F: Outbreak response Part G: Reporting of notifiable medical conditions Part H: Education and training of staff and IPC staff Part I: Monitoring and evaluation The key terms and definitions use d in the manual is listed in Appendix A PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 12 Part A Standard Precautions PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 13 PART A: STANDARD PRECAUTIONS Standard precauti ons (SP) are aimed at reduc ing the risk of transmission of microorganisms including blood borne pathogens , from recognized and unrecognized sources. Patients and staff may serve as reservoirs for microorganisms, even if only colonised and not exhibiting an y signs of infection.4,5 SP are the basic level of infection prevention measures which apply to relevant health care delivered to all patients. The key elements of SP precautions are: hand hygiene ; appropriate use of personal protective equipment ; patient placement ; appropriate use of antiseptics, disinfectant s, and detergents ; decontamination of m edical devices ; safe handling of linen and laundry ; health care waste management ; respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette ; environmental cleaning ; principles of asepsis ; injection safety, prevention of injuries from sharp instruments and post -exposure prophylaxis .6 4World H ealth Organization [Internet].

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 14 HAND HYGIENE Effective hand hygiene (HH) is a critical component of SP and ensures patient and staff safety7; it is the simplest, and most cost-effective measure to reduce HAI.8Although the link between HAI and HH was made in the mid -1800s by Dr Ignaz S eimmelwei ss9, a systematic review by Erasm us et al, 2010, found HH compliance rates to be only 30-40 %.10 Multimodal implementation strategies (see sections on MMS ), a core component of effective IPC programmes11,12 has improved HH compliance.13. In order to ensure successful implementation and susta inability of HH strategies, commitment by management at all levels is critical. 1. Why Hand Hygiene? Skin f lora: Transient skin flora is found on the surface layers (epidermis) which are easily transmitted through physical contact between patients, health wo rkers and the health care environment and has been implicated in HAI . Transient flora can be easily remov ed by good HH practices14 Resident flora live in the deeper skin layers (dermis) and, being part of normal flora, are more difficult to remove.13,15 2. Infection transmission via hands Transmission can occur either by direct contact with the patient , or indire ctly via contact with medical equipment or patient surrounding . This occurs in five sequential steps as follow , see Figure 2 . 1. Organisms are present on the patient's skin or in blood and body fluids or have been shed onto inanimate objects immediately surr ounding the patient, 7Haley RW, White JW, Morgan WM, Emori G, Munn VANP, et al.

Barriers to hand hygiene When developing HH improvement strategies, the following should be addressed 16,17,18 HH agents that cause skin irritation and dryness . The perception that patient activities take priority over HH especially when ther e is a heavy workload and understaffing . Lack of resources (water, soap and paper towel) Infrastructure limitations: Plumbing and hand wash basins inc onveniently located and/or not available .

Unavail ability and inadequate knowledge of guidelines, protocols or technique for HH. Lack of positive role models an d social norms . Lack of recognition of the risk of cross -transmission of microbial pathogens . Simple forg etfulness and lack of attention to detail (many wash hands but not adequately ). Use of gloves Gloves should never be used as a substitute for HH. The perception that glove s eliminate the need fo r HH is also a barrier to HH compliance; Pinhole perfora tions have been reported in gloves prior to wearing them and these perforations increase with use.19 HH must be practiced before and after the use of gl oves . Failure to remove gl oves and disinfect hands after use constitutes non -compliance with HH. Alcohol should never be applied directly on to gloves as it will damage them . Hands must be thoroughly dried before donning gloves to reduce the risk of skin irritation . Dermatitis: This is a general term used to describe inflammation of the skin characterized by redness, itchiness, dryness and swelling.21Health workers with contact dermatitis may remain colonized with potentially pathogenic microorganisms for prolonged time periods.20 Causes of dermatitis21 o Allergy to latex and related products . o Frequent use of certain HH product s such as soap . o Application of ABHR to wet hands. o Donning of gloves while hands are still wet from eithe r washing or ABHR . o Use of powdered gloves concurrently with alcohol -based products . 22,23 o Use of products not tested for tolerance or sensitivi ty. 19Gessler A , St\u00e4rk A .How risky are pinholes in gloves?

Available from: http://www.who.int/gpsc/en/ \\nhttp://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597906_eng.pdf DO NOT wash hands and immediately apply ABHR to wet hands as this may damage the skin . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 17 4. Recommendations for the protecting hands of HCW All cuts and abrasions must be covered with a waterproof dr essing. ABHR should contain emollients that assist with maintain ing skin integrity, and when applied regularly , will protect hands from dry ness. Avoid communal jars of hand cream as the contents become a source of cross infection. Provide alternate HH products for health workers with confirmed allergies . Where ABHR is available in the health facility for hygienic hand antisepsis, the use of antimicrobia l soap is not recommended .21 5. Best Practice for HH Nails: Nails should be kept short and clean24 and n ot show past the end of the finger.25 Long nails can pierce gloves.26 Nail polish should not be allowed as organisms can survive under the nail polish an d in the nail bed and cuticle .27 No acrylic nails, artificial nail or nail enhancements to be worn 27 Jewellery: The wearing of rings or other jewellery when delivering health care is strongly discouraged . For religious or cultural reasons , the wearing of a simple wedding ring (band) during routine care may be acceptable . However, in high-risk settings, all ri ngs or other jewellery should be removed.25,28 Religious or cultural wrist ad ornments which are difficult to clean should be removed during hand hygien e. Generally, short sleeve clothing is appropriate in most clinical settings except when used as PPE for EMS . 6. Consumables and e quipment required for hand hygiene Hand Washing 6.1 Liquid soap - non-medicated Liquid soap for wash ing hands must be availab le at each basin. Clean running water should be available 24HSE South(C ork and Kerry). Guidelines on Infection Prevention and Control. 2012 p. 1 -7. 25Josephson D. No Title.

Available from: http://www.who.int/infection -prevention/publications/hand -hygiene -2009/en/ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 18 It should be provided in a closed container that is either manually or elbow -operated with a pump action or an automated dispenser Closed container s must have single use disposable sachets. Liquid soap must have a surfactant to allow good lather. The product should be hypo -allergenic and be well t olerated. 6.2 Bottles for liquid soap Liquid soap must be supplied in disposable 500ml pump top bottles (no top ping-up or decanting allowed) However, if facilities are still using container s that have to be refilled , ensure that a heat stable product (which can withstand temperatures of 80o C) is purchased so that the bottles can be thoroughly cleaned and heat disinfected between each use (microwave or heat washer disinfector) . Plungers/ pump must be disposable since they are difficult to clean and disinf ect. Note : most disposable bottles and pump tops supplied by HH companies are not robust enough for reprocessing . Reprocessing of these bottles are no t recommended. Heat disinfect ion of liquid soap container s as follow s: Step 1: Wash used containers with soap and lukewarm water in a designated sink ensuring all traces of soap has been removed . Step 2: Fill a bowl with 250 to 500 ml of clean water and p lace it in a microwave. This will act as a heat sink to ensure the liquid soap container s do not over hea t or melt during the microwaving process. Step 3 : Place the bowl with the liquid soap containers in the microwave and run for at least 3 minutes on th e highest setting. Remove carefully when completed, DO NOT TOUCH THE INSIDE OF CONTAINERS . Step 4 : Inspec t the liquid soap container to ensure integrity. Discard if damaged . Step 5: Bottles must be thoroughly dried by inverting upside down on a drainer or using an air- dryer . Step 6: Each liquid soap container should be labelled with a date when refilled . NOT E: Bottles should never be topped up with liquid soap. 6.3 Alcohol -based hand rub ABHR must be available at all points of care .

Must be suitable in shape and design for the pump top bottles used in the health facility . Have adjustable cla mp to fit on to over-bed tables or brackets to fit onto, wall, trolleys, or other fixed surfaces in the pa tient zone , see Figure 3. Figure 3: Bracket for ABHR to fit over -bed tables and on the wall If a lever arm is necessary , the length of the l ever arm must not obstruct work flow. 6.5 Types of ABHR dispensers There are two types of dispensers , i.e. automated and manual (Table 3 ). Table 3: Types of ABHR dispensers Type of dispenser Adva ntages Disadvantages Automated Dispensers Aesthetically pleasing Fast Non-touch Closed system that minimise contamination of the content Unusable when require replacement of batteries Standardized amount of product pre -set and usually < 2- 3ml.(dependi ng on hand size) Costs of maintenance and batteries PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 21 Type of dispenser Adva ntages Disadvantages Manual Dispensers Manual ly operated dispensers Not dependent on batteries Wall or work surface mounted Closed system that minimise contamination of the content Robust to use Can be contaminated if incorrect technique is used Amount of ABHR required per HH action Size of hands differs and therefore an exact or pre -set amount of ABHR dispensed may be difficult to predict. The rule is the amount of ABHR that fills the palm of a cupped hand without spilling and this is usually approximately 2-3 ml (depending on hand size) . Pouring from the ABHR container ABHR containers, especially those which are small volume bottles carried by the health worker , may be poured into a cupped hand for HH. This is accept able practice since the hands will be disinfected prior to touching patien ts. Positioning of ABHR dispen ser 30 The maximum size of an individual ABHR dispenser should not exceed 500mls . ABHR should be placed at the entrance of every clinical are a and fixed to the wall . Wall-mounted brackets should be placed at a convenient height (avoid placing at eye level to prevent splashing ). Dispensers should be installed according to manufacturer's recommendations and to minimise leaks or spills . Dispensers must also be located at the point of care , preferably between the health worker and the patient (at arm's length) , e.g. at foot of bed, on the over-bed, procedure trolley or ICU chart trolleys. Dispensers should be monitored daily for content cleanliness and functi on. Regular maintenance of dispensers and brackets should occur in accordance with manufacturer's guideli nes. Product usage signs should be clearly visible and laminated or framed . Regular monitoring of each area is recommended . 30Ryan K, Havers S, Olsen K, Grayson PML. Hand Australia [Internet]. 2017 p. 46. Availab le from: www.hha.org.au PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 22 Placement of each dispense r should ensure protection of vulnerable populations, for example in psychiatric units, drug and alcohol units, paediatric units and units caring for cognitively impaired patients . Here, smaller ABHR bottles (50 -60ml) carried by the HCW is preferred . Place ment of dispensers in the EMS setting must consider ease of access at the point of care while also consid ering that vulnerable populations (paediatric and mental health care patients) are transported by EMS. Dispenser could for example be p laced at the side or rear doorway to the patient compartment, farthest from the stretcher. This may also promote use when entering and exiting the compartment. Site-specific instructions should be developed to manage adverse events, such as ABHR ingestion, eye splashes or allergic reactions . 6.6 Paper towel dispensers Paper towel dispensers should be wall mounted close to the hand wash basin where soap dispensers are available. No-touch paper roll dispenser for automatic dispensing of a paper towel is best however single use pull out paper towels are also acceptable . If single use pull out paper towels are used, care sh ould be taken to load the dispenser correctly to prevent contamination of the paper towels. Paper should have adequate strength to withstand contact wi th wet hands . Warm air h and dryers are not recommended for health facilities.31,32,33 7. Principles of hand hygiene 7.1 Indication for hand hygiene (WHEN ) The activity and associated risk of transferring microbes to or from a patient will dictate when hands need to be cleaned (5 Moments of H H). HH should be performed when entering or leaving 31 Mayo clinic. C Huang, W Ma, S Stack.

Figure 4: Illustratio n of patient zone and healthcare area34 Understanding the critical moments WHEN HH should be practi ced and adhering to these critical moments of when hand hygiene has to be performed is key to prevent ing transmission. The \"Five Moments for Hand Hygiene\". (Figure 5 a,b,c.d) identified by the WHO for when HH should be performed by health worker s and mothers of infants admitted to healthcare , and are applicable to both inpatient and outpatients settings . Training should focus not only on technique , but also on the practical implementation of these 5 Moments of HH e.g. scenario - based training and to ensure that HH opportunities are not missed . (Figure 5 a,b,c .d)). Applying these principles , it is possible to develop similar moments for specific scenarios in your facility. 34 World Health Organization.

For e xample, shaking hands, physical examination, checking the patient's vital signs, personal care activities, before preparation and administration of ora l medication, feeding . 35 World Health Organization. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. Geneva. 2009 36 World Health Organiztion. WHO Hand Hygiene in Outpatient and Home -based Care and Long -term Care Facilities PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 25 Moment Two: Immediately b efore carrying out a clean/ aseptic procedure WHY : To pr otect the patient from potential pathogens (including their own) from entering their body during a procedure . Examples are just before carrying out an invasive procedure such as insertion of an intravenous catheter, administration of parenteral medication, suctioning of a patient, performing wound care , and preparation of a sterile field . Examples for EMS are before : o an invasive procedure (catheter inser tion, IV/IO start, suctioning), o moving from a dirty task to a clean task on the same patient (e.g. removi ng their shoes and then performing wound care), o preparing and giving medications (includes oral and subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravascular inject ions, eye drops), o prior to donning PPE including gloves to contact the patient or the patient's environme nt. Moment Three - After a body fluid exposure risk WHY : To protect yourself and the healthcare surroundings from transmission of potential pathoge ns from the patient such as after carrying out an invasive procedure, or any potential body fluid exposur e. For EMS it will be after - suctioning secretions, contact with blood and/or bodily fluids, wound care/dressing changes, an invasive procedure (e. g. catheter insertion, BGL testing, IV/IO start), contact with linen covered in blood and/or body fluids, doffing PPE that has come into contact with blood and/or bo dily fluids . To prevent c olonisation/Infection in health workers , contamination of the hea lthcare environment, and transmission of microorganisms from a colonised site to a clean site on the pati ent. Note: wearing gloves alone does not protect you from contamination; hand hygiene is essential after removing gloves! NOTE: Always perform hand hygiene before donning (putting on) gloves! PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 26 Moment 4 - After touching a patient WHY : To protect yourself and the health care surroundings from potential pathogens carried or shed by the patient. . This indication is determined by the occurrence of the last contact with intact skin or the pa tient's clothing or a surface in the patient's zone, after direct patient contact . EMS only apply if the re has been contact with the patient/patient environment after contact or procedures have been completed. To prevent c olonisation /infection in health workers and contamination of the health care environment. Moment 5 - After touching a patient's surroundings WHY: To protect yourself and the healthc are surroundings from potential pathogens from the patient's surroundings. Examples after touching the pa tients immediate surroundings such as bed rails, curtains, monitor, overbed table, bedside locker , call bell, table , clinical notes and surfaces, even if the patient has not been touched . To prevent c olonisation /infection in health workers , and contaminat ion of the healthcare environment . After touching the patient's environment, the health worker has microorganisms on their hands; these microorganisms can be transmitted to the next patient/surface the health worker touches. This includes after carrying ou t environmental cleaning. For EMS, Moment 5 would be after contact with the inside of the ambulan ce particularly where the patient is lying - the entir e cabin should be considered part of the patient's surrounding 7.2 Types of hand hygiene method s Table 4 summarises the methods of HH, the aim thereof, what product is to be used and the main indications for each. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 27 Table 4: Summary of HH methods Method Aim Products Main indicators HH using ABHR Destroy transient microbes Use ABHR Before patient contact Before clean or aseptic technique After contact with the patient After contact with the environment Before wearing gloves After having remov ed gloves - no visible contamination seen HH using soap and water Remove transient microbes Wash with plain liquid soap and water and dry thorough ly with a paper towel When visibly soiled After personal hygiene processes After contact wit h blood and body fluids Before and after wearing of gloves - if hands are visibly soiled C. difficile cases Surgical hand preparation technique Destroy transient and reduce resident microbes on the skin for prolonged periods of time Surgical \"scrub\": Three- minute washing with antiseptic agents (4%chlorhexidine gluconate) No rub: ABHR (85.5% Ethyl alcohol) between theatre cases Starting operating sessions or between procedures when contact with patient's blood o r body fluid has occurred and hands are visibly soiled Use ABHR between theatre cases when hands are not visibly soiled 8. Hand hygiene technique (what, how) The three HH techniques are described in detail in section 8.1 to 8.3, see Figures 6 to 8 . Preparat ion for all HH methods : Ensure availability of all necessary hand washing facilities and supplies before starting the process. Remove all hand, wrist jewellery and accessories (only plain wedding band allowed). Arms must be bare below the elbows (except wh en us ing PPE for EMS for example rescue jackets) . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 28 8.1 Alcohol hand rub technique HH, using ABHR is reg arded as the gold standard .37,38 When practiced correctly it is highly effective in preventing transmission of microbes. It is more efficacious than soa p and water as it rapidly and effectively inactivates a wide array of potentially harmful microorganisms found on hands. WHO recommends ABHR based on the following:39 Rapid and broad -spectrum microbicidal activity with a minimal risk of generating resista nce to antimicrobial agents; Suitability for use in resource -limited or remote areas with lack of accessi bility to sinks or other facilities for HH (including clean water, paper towels, etc.); Capacity to promote improved compliance with HH by making the p rocess faster, available at t he point of care and thus , more convenient; Economic benefit by reducing ann ual costs for HH and HAI .40 The area s on the hands most often missed are the finger tips, which are the most contaminated, and traditionally the last s tep in the technique . It is also the part of the hand that is most frequently in contact with patients. T he technique for using ABHR, has thus been modified to start with the finger tips .41 Method: Duration of the entire procedure: 15 seconds minimum . See Figure 6. 37World Health Organization (WHO).

Surgical hand preparation should reduce resident flora from the hands of the surgical team for the duration of the pr ocedure , to minimise the possibi lity of bacterial contamination from hands into an open wound . Pre-operat ive surgical hand preparation process : Pre-operative surgical hand preparation with soap and water. 43Infection Control Society of Southern Africa (ICSSA). https://www.fidssa.co.za/ICSSA PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 31 WHEN: On arrival in the operating theatre and afte r having worn theatre clothing (cap/hat/bonnet and mask) . Pre-operative surgical hand rub WHEN: Can only be performed on clean hands and between surgical procedures . a. Pre-operative surgical hand preparation with soap and water \"Scrub\" does not involve usin g a nailbrush or any other coarse material to remove skin. It is carried out by vigorously rubbing the ha nds and forearms with the other hand continuously for a given period of time . This is a two -stage process. i) Steps before starting surgical scrub with antiseptic soap that aims to remove transient flora : Remove all jewellery (rings, wedding bands, watches, b racelets, traditional or religious strings or skins [before entering the operating theatre ). Wash hands with plain soap and water. Wash the wrists and forearms to the elbows as well. Pay attention to the areas underneath the nails . Nailbrushes should not b e used as they may damage the skin and encourage shedding of cells and bacteria . Rinse the arms, wrists and forearms with te pid water . Dry hands and ar ms with paper towel . ii) Surgical scrub with antiseptic soap aims to reduce the resident microbial load . During surgery, inadvertently releas ing microbes and expos ing the patient to infection can happen. Use antimicrobial soap (4%chlorhexidine gluconate ) for t his stage . Scrub each side of each finger, between the fingers, and the back and front of the hand. This should take a minimum if two minutes . Continue as above b. Pre-operative surgical hand rub technique After the first hand wash, ABHR may be used between cases if the hands are not visibly soiled Method: See Figure 8. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 32 Figure 8: Surg ical hand rub technique44 9. Patients and visit ors Patients should be given health education on HH to encourage good practice . Patients should have acc ess to both ABHR and HH facilities with running water and soap as well as paper towels to dry the hands . Bed bound patients should be offered the means for hand -cleansing after bedpan/urinal use for example, offering them wet wipes , soap and water or ABHR (if hands are not soiled visibly) . 44Infect ion Control Society of Southern Africa (ICSSA). https ://www.fidssa.co.za/ICSSA PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 33 10. Hand hygiene for mothers who are breast feeding Breast feedin g mothers are encouraged to express breast milk for their infants in paediatric and neonat al units. An increase in MDROs in paediatric and neonatal uni ts requires meticulous HH for all those who come in contact with infants. Recommendation for mothers : Before entering the unit or ward, wash hands and dry . ABHR may be used as follows : o Before touching the baby or the cot . o Before expressing breast milk . o Before breastfeeding o After changing the diaper (if hands are not soiled). If soiled, wash hands . o After ho lding the baby , or tidying the cot . o When leaving the Neo natal Unit or paediatric ward . 11. Posters (sell it) Hand rub methodology poster s must be plac ed at strategic places and above alcohol dispensers in the health facility. HH posters serve as reminders in the workplace and can be strategically placed throughout the health facility . These should be ro tated and/or replaced to keep the message fresh. HH posters must be laminated or framed and checked regularly to ensure integrity . HH posters must be displa yed: o In all clinical areas for health workers . o In toilets and bathrooms for patients and visitors . 12. Hand hygiene campaign (live it) HH awareness ca mpaigns should be conducted according to the Health Awareness Calendar , such as the 5th May World Hand Hy giene Day to create awareness and enhance compliance to HH. Reports thereof should be compiled and kept as evidence. Patient involvement in HH campaign s have proven to be effective in promoting compliance amongst health wor kers. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 34 13. Hand hygiene education (teach it) , compliance and monitoring (check it) (see section on education) All new staff must receive training in IPC practices including HH. Encoura ge partnerships between mothers, patients, their families , and health workers to promote HH in the health care setting and at home. Establish the health facility overall HH compliance rate (baseline) by directly observing health workers during routine clini cal care . The WHO Observation Tool hand hygiene self-assessment framework (HHSAF) should be used to condu ct the audits. This tool can be downloaded from https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/tools/en/ . Quarte rly audits (200 observations per quarter) must be conducted and results communicated to staff members and facility managers at the IPC Committee meetings . Annual audits results can be compared with the baseline, to document improvement . It is recommended t hat each ward, department or clinical area identify a HH champion . The HH champion should be the role mo del and monitor HH practices . Indirect monitoring method can also be used , for example, by recording and tracking consumption of HH supplies during the period of a month . Total litres issued can be divided by average number of bed days and then expressed as a rate: litres (or ml) per 1000 bed days. There should be evidence that the WHO Hand Hygiene Self-assessment Framework tool is completed annually an d improvements made where gaps were identified . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 35 USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Personal protecti ve equipment (P PE) is specifically used to protect clinical and non-clinical health workers (including cleaners , ancillary staff and food service worke rs) from exposure to body fluids or from droplet or airborne pathogens , chemicals or heat. PPE includes, but is not limited to gloves, aprons, gowns, caps, face covers, and protective eyewear (goggl es). The use of PPE is based on risk assessment of each si tuation and discarded immediately afterwards , see Figure 9 . The following principles are used to do a ris k assessment and to establish what type of PPE should be used: Identif y the hazard/problem/threat e.g. likelihood of exposure to blood and body fluids/ pathogens when inserting an intravenous line Evaluate th e risk associated with the hazard e.g. contact wi th a blood borne viruses (e.g. Hepatitis B) Determine appropriate ways to el iminate or control the hazard (e.g. worn gloves when in contact with blood and body fluids ).45 Figure 9: Risk assessment for PPE 45 Dramowski. A., 2014. Infection Prevention and Control A guide for healthcare workers in low -resource settings. Bettercare Risk of exposure PPEReduced risk PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 36 1. Rules about the use of PPE PPE serves a very specific purpose and when contaminated, can be a transmitter of microbes. PPE provides some, but not total, protection to the user . PPE is only effective if used as part of an IPC process and has little or no value as a sole m easure for containing pathogens , therefore hand hygiene is essential after removing gloves . The use of PPE without indication (to allay personal prejud ice or fear ) may increase the risk of infection. PPE is not a substitute for poor infection control pract ice (including lack of administrative or engineering controls ) or indeed healthcare procedure s. All PPE ha s a finite or limited life and must be disca rded after use as indicat ed, preferably after each procedure or after each patient use PPE must be of goo d quality and be fit for purpose .46 2. Types of PPE 2.1 Hand protection Gloves are used to protect the health workers' hands from direct contact with bl ood, body fluid, secretions or excretions. If such risk is possible, gloves should be worn and discarded after each procedure or patient use. Gloves come in a variety of materials , but the common ones used in health facilities are listed below. Each type o f material has advantages and disadvantages. Table 5 sets out the different types of gloves and the ir recommended use .47 Materials used in gloves Latex is commonly used in gloves designed to prevent contact with blood and body fluids. These are available in different sizes, lengths and can be sterile or non -sterile. Their popularity is based on their elastic ity and good fit. However, latex allergy is becomin g increasingly common and there is a move away from latex gloves to other equally effective ones. 46 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa The same PPE should nev er be used between patients. Discard after each patient contact. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 37 Nitrile is a popular material for gloves. It is less elastic than latex but does fit well and can prevent p enetration of blood and body fluids. As it is latex free, it is often recommended in cases of latex allergy. It is not ideal for use in surgical proced ures but may be used in other minor operations and aseptic procedures. Initial diminished dexterity with nitrile gloves is quickly overcome with practi ce. Nitrile gloves are more puncture -resistant and more resistant to chemicals than latex gloves . Vinyl gloves are usually not sterile. These are adequate for carrying out non clinical activities . Plastic (Hamp shire) gloves are no longer recommended for healthcare purposes but may be used in catering. Domestic gloves are made of reinforced latex and should be used for manual cleaning such as the environmental cleaning, kitchen or decontamination areas in SSD. Heavy-duty gloves should be used for handling waste ; heat -resistant gloves should be used when removing items from the steam sterilisers in the SSD.47 Table 5:Glove types and indication s for use Type Type of material Recommended use Latex, short cuff, non - sterile examination glove Routine use for non -sterile procedures where gloves are indicated Latex ,sterile , cuff (individually wrapped) All surgical procedures Sterile (aseptic) procedures Latex - long cuff, non - sterile Maternity SSD 47 Western Cape Department of Health.

Face (surgical) masks should cover the nose and mouth for surgical or ot her procedures. Respirators are designed to prevent the inhalation of noxious substances or particles inc luding biological hazards such as microbes. Where masks or respirators are not available, for example in the community, PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 39 covering the mouth and nose wi th a cloth or tissue is an acceptable alternative and should be encouraged (cough etiquette). Face covers serve two purposes : To prevent or reduce the transmission of droplets and aerosols between health workers a nd patients. To prevent splashing of mucous membranes during procedures. Face masks are made of several layers of paper. They protect the health wo rker against fine to medium splashes of blood and body fluids. They create a short -term barrier against dispersal of large droplets and most aerosols d uring coughing or sneezing ; masks become inefficient after 15 minutes of use. The types of face covers a re shown in Table 6.48 There are many more types but the most essential types are covered here. Table 6: Types of f ace covers a nd indication s for use Types Recommended use Surgical f ace mask For use in theatres , outpatient settin gs, sterile procedures PPE for: airborne for visitors & patients : measles, varicella, drug-sensitive PTB (see transmission -based precauti ons) droplet precautions e.g. influenza or within1 meter from a patient Face masks should be discarded af ter a single use. DO NOT use a surgical face mask with the lower ties either u ndone or cut off! Goggles Goggles protects the eyes f rom splashes PPE for: Droplet precautions when invasive procedures are performed Goggles do not provide splash or spra y protection to other parts of the face. 48 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tyger berg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 40 Face mask with visor Face masks with visors protect mucous membranes against splashes and replace a goggle and mask combination. These are indicated in any risk prone procedure which involves light to moderate s plashes from blood or body fluids. N95 respirators - without valves Indicated for: Pulmonary TB MDR -/ XDR -TB airborne precautions. Prolonged care of a patient with MDR -/ XDR -TB, Healthcare worker contact with patients with varicella (chickenpox) and mea sles For high -risk procedures: Bronchoscopy Open or closed suctioning of patients with TB Dental procedures on patients with known TB especially MDR/ XDR - valve: Flat or coned shape Expiratory valves are used when prolonged contact with the patient (over one hour) is expected. For use with patients with MDR - and XDR -TB. These are preferable to the non -valved respirato rs and are more comfortable for the user. Paper mask (Queen Charlotte) Not recommended for use in health facilities as it offers no protection aga inst inhaling microorganisms. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 41 Face masks should be discarded after a single use . Face masks with attache d visor offers limited protection, mainly against minor splashes. N95 Respirators have been introduced into healthcare practice, mainly because of the risk from MDR -and XDR -TB. The N95 respirator is not resistant to oil , but is moderately water resistant. It is designed to filter out 95 % of noxious substances carried in the air, including biohazard ous pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Fit test for respirators (Table 7) Fit test ing is recommended to ensure an adequate fit and maximum protecti on and to prevent air leaks around the edges of the respirator . Face type s and shapes differ, as do design s of respirator s. Once the correct N95 respir ator has been selected, further fit testing is not necessary if the same type of respirator is used and t he wearer's face has not changed due to significant weight loss or gain . However, respirators are only e fficient if they are correctly mould ed to the p erson's face and there is no air leakage around the edges of the respirator during an intake of breath. Table 7: Fit test for an N95 respirator PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 42 N95 respirators must correctly ( Table 8) Table 8: N95 Respirator donning Release the lower headband from your thumbs and position it at the base of your neck. Position the remaining headband around the crown of your head Seal checks: A seal check is a procedure conducted by the health worker that wears the respirator to determine if the respirator is properly worn. Seal check must be performed every time the respirator is worn . The seal check can either be a positive pressure or negative pressure check (Table 9). - Negative seal check : Coned shape respirator: Cup hands over respirator without excessive pressure. Breathe in sharply. A lig ht collapse of the respirator should be felt with no air leaking in around the face to -face piece seal. Table 9.a. Duck - bill type respirator: Breathe in sharply. The respirator should collapse inwards. Table 9.b. + Positive seal check: Coned shape respi rator: Cup hands over respirator. Blow out. A buil d-up of air should be felt with no air leaking out around the face -to-face piece seal edges of the de vice. Duck -bill type respirator: Breathe out forcefully; the respirator should expand on the exhale. Table 9.c. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 43 Table 9: Seal check a. Seal check for coned shaped respirator b. Negative seal check for duck -bill respirator c. Posi tive seal check for may be re -used (Table 10)51 Limite d reuse depending on the local conditions has been recommended and widely used as an option for conserving respirators during previous respiratory pathogen outbreaks and pandemics . Reuse refers to the practice of using the same N95 respirator for multiple encounters with patients but removing it ( 'doffing') after each encounter. The respirator is stored in between encounters to be put on again ('donned' ) prior to the next encounter with a patient. For tuberculosis prevention, CDC recommends that a respirat or classified as disposable can be reused b y the same worker as long as it remains functional and is used in accordance with local infection control pr ocedures . There is a limit to the number of times the same N95 respirator is reused, often referred to as \"limited reuse\". 49,50 If the respirator is to be reused it should be type -fitted to the face of one healthcare worker who uses it over a period of not more than one week or until damp and mis - formed . The N95 respirator should be removed carefully using a paper towel and place d in a paper (not plastic) bag, labelled with the health care worker's name, to avoid damage . Deterioration of respirator efficie ncy occurs with humidity, dirt and crushing.51 49IOM: Reusability of facemasks during an influenza pandem ic: the flu.

Do not crush the respirator when storing it. 2.3 Aprons Plastic aprons should be available in all health facilities and should be used as recommended Aprons are worn to protect clo thes from splashes during a clinical procedure or during contact precautions (Table 11).52 Plastic aprons a re water resistant but can become contaminated and may transmit pathogens if used between patients. Aprons are single patient use only and must be disc arded at the end of each procedure. The re -use of plastic aprons after cleaning with a disinfectant is no t recommended Routine use of aprons is not recommended . Plastic aprons are available in different colours if colour coding is in place.

Discard in a biohaz ardous waste container. 2.4 Gowns Cloth or cotton gowns are not recommended for IPC purposes since these are not water resistant. Sterile cotton gowns are used in the operating theatre and labour ward , but should be used in conjunction with a plasti c apron underneath to prevent soaking of clothes. Commerc ially available non-woven water -resistant gowns and coveralls with a layer of waterproof mater ial for the front and arms are usually expensive and are used in selected indications such as when treat ing a bleeding patient with viral haemorrhagic fever (Table 12).53 Table 12: Gowns Type Recommended use Cloth or cotton g owns: Reusable; laundered and sterilized .

Note: T hese are very uncomfortable to wear for prolonged periods of time especially in hot and humid situations . 2.5 Headgear The routine use of head covers has been abandoned since there is no scientific evidence for their use - and it is an extra expense. Headgear is recommended when working in a sterile environment or where clean items are processed. Head gear i s indicated for use in : operating theatres for both st aff and patients ; clean section of the SSD; process ing of sterile feeds ; and sterile fluid production in the pharmacy. Under exceptional circumstances, head cover s are recommended when attending severe ly immune compromised patients such as patients having had a bone marrow transplant.54 54 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual: Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 47 2.6 Shoes /boots and overshoes /shoe covers a. Overshoes/shoe covers Overshoes/shoe covers should not be used in the general healthcare environment. By touching the shoes when putting on overshoes, hands become contaminated. Overshoes can result in creating an aerosol while walking and can transmit microbes from the floor t o the environment and patient surrounding area. 55,56 Overshoes may be issued to visitors to the opera ting theatre who do not have dedicated \"inside shoes\". Although their use is not recommended, if these ar e to be used, care must be taken to decontaminate hands using ABHR after donning and removing overshoes . Disposable, knee -length overboots or gumboots should be worn when caring for patients with viral hemorrhagic fevers. b. Theatre footwear Dedicated fo otwear, e .g. closed shoes or clogs with heel support straps , should be used in the operating theatre. Theatre footwear should: have closed toes; be clean and well maintained (it is recommended that a designated washer -disinfector be used. In the abse nce of a washer -disinfector, theatre shoes must be hand was hed); be easy to clean; be non -slip/ with good traction; support the foot; enclo se the foot. (Table 13) c. Footwear in non -theatre settings Footwear in non -theatre settings should: be s oft-soled and have closed toes; have low heels; be non -slip with good traction; be clean and well maintained; support the foot. 55Patient shoe covers: Transferring bac teria from the floor onto surgical bedsheets.

When to put on/remove dedicated footwear Where dedicated footwear is used, for example, SSD, clean rooms or minor surgery, it should be removed before leaving that area. e. Cleaning of footwear It is the responsibility of the wearer to ensure that theatre footwear i s washed and disinfected appropr iately (using manufacturer recommended procedure/solutions) in a designat ed washer - disinfector when visibly contaminated. There is no cleaning requirement for footwear used in non-theatre settings unless they become contamin ated with blood or body fluids; in which case they should be cleaned appropriately. Table 13: Shoes/boot s Type Recommended use Shoes with c losed toe s and heel protection should be worn when protection from splashes and dropped sharps is required . Boots should be worn: by staff handling health care risk waste ; when treating pa tients with viral haemorrhagic fevers, if disposable overboots or coveralls with attached booties are not available , gumboots should be white in colour to show any contamination. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 49 USE OF ANTISEPTICS, DISINFECTANTS AND DETERGENTS Disinfectants, detergents and other cleaning materials are chemicals. Some of these can have a detrimental effect on the users, patients and visitors. More importantly, disinfe ctants share common mechanisms of resistance with antibiotics which increases th e risk of AMR especially in healthcare facilities. The role of biofilms is increasingly recognised in encouraging persistence of MDROs and AMR and therefore disinfectants must be limited to essential indications only. Disinfectants must be used specifically when indicated accordin g to SOPs and guidelines of the facility or national guidelines . Health workers should understand the difference between detergents, antiseptics and disinfectants and follow their appropriate indications in health facilities. Definitions Detergents are water -soluble cleaning agents used for cleaning porous and non -porous surfaces ; they have no disinfection properties . Antiseptics are used to reduce microbial levels on the skin and liv ing tissue. Disinfectants are used for reducing microbial contaminat ion on surfaces and inanimate objects. Humans must never be sprayed with chemical d isinfectants such as chlorine because it is toxic and can cause seri ous harm to the health worker .57Surface disinfectants should not be sprayed directly onto surfaces as this causes aerosolization , but should be applied using a clean cloth and the surface wiped systematically and carefully. 1. Detergents These are chemicals which attract dirt and organic matter and bind them. Most of the detergents used in healthcare are pH ne utral and are specifically designed for use in health facilities. The majority of routine cleaning should be done with clean water a nd a neutral deterg ent. The detergents should be compatible with the material they are used to clean. Detergents usually have no killing ability but do remove organic matter which contain microbes and thereby redu ce environmental contamination. 57Mehtar S , Andre N. H.

Skin preparation for surgery . Aseptic procedures such as insertion o f intra venous devices . Types of antiseptics The recommended antiseptics for tissue are: Chlorhexidine: strength: Alcohol ( Isopropyl , propyl, ethanol) - in ISO or EN specified concentrations or WHO minimum standards with an emollient is re commended for HH.58 Chlorhexidine -containing preparations must never be used for cleaning environment al surfaces. 3. Disinfectants Surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned before applying disinfectants to further reduce bioburden and should be used accordin g to the manufacturers ' instructions .Disinfectant s and detergent -disinfectant s must comply with the stand ards as set out in the Compulsory specification, for disinfectants a nd detergents -disinfectants published under R529 of 14 May 1999 (VC 8054), in terms of the Specifications Act of 1993, with regards to the disinfecting and cleaning efficacy of detergents disinfectants, corrosiv eness, water insoluble -water matter content and rinsing properties. Indications for the use of disinfectants in environmenta l cleaning The routine use of disinfectants in the environment is not recommended for several reasons: There is no added benefit of using disinfectants routinely especially since good cleaning removes up to 8 0% of organic contamination 58 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual: Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa Note: Chemicals which are used as antiseptic as well as disinfectant may be harmful to living tissue (except 70% alcohol) Note: ALWAYS CLEAN FIRST THEN DISINFECT PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 51 Disinfectants cannot improve more than cleaning on reducing the level of environmental contamination with microbes Disinfect ants contribute to increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents among pathogens There are ecological reasons for not over using disinfectants especial ly those that are no biodeg radable -these accumulate in the waterways and promote antimicrobial resistanc e They have little or no direct effect on biofilm s Disinfectants are expensive. Health workers and patients can develop allergies to some disinfectants . Disinfectants must be comp atible with the detergents and soaps used for cleaning. Currently, the following disinfectants are recommended for environmental disinfect ion following thorough cleaning : Chlorine releasing agent - compounds (QAC) and other chemicals are available on the market for use in healthcare . Non-touch disinfection technologies such as v aporised hydrogen peroxide has been introduced to add f urther disinfection after terminal cleaning following MDRO outbreaks particularly for high dependent and isolation units. This technology should always be used as an addition to cleaning with a detergent and water and disinfection and do not replace these two processes . UV disinfection: has been recently introduc ed to deal with terminal cleaning following MDRO outbreaks , particularly for high dependent and isolation units. This technology should always be used as an addition to cleaning with a detergent and water and disinfection and do not replace these two proce sses . Any application of a dis infectant must be with a cloth and the surface wiped ca refully covering all areas in a systematic technique. It should never be sprayed. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 52 Use of disinfectants Terminal clean ing after : o contact precautions ; o droplet precautions ; o airborne precautions . Decontamination of high dependency or isolation units following outbreaks of MDROs . Main kitchen surfaces before and after preparing cooked food . Operating theatres - after excessiv e blood spillage has been cleaned up . Burns Unit - baths after each patient use. Sterile fluid and medication preparation areas .59 The IPC Team at the health facility should be consulted for instruction on the choice of disinfectant to use for particular infectious diseases during terminal cleaning. Disinfectants have also been implicated in cross resistance with antibiotics, heavy metals and other medi cation. They promote the acquisition and persistence of healthcare associated pathogens and therefore s hould be used with great care and recommended and at effective dilutions . Disinfectants used for heat sensitive medical devices are shown under the section on reprocessing medical devices . Recommendations for the use of detergents and disinfectants are set out in Table 1 4. 59 Western Cape Department of Health.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 62 DECONTAMINATION OF MEDICAL DEVICES Decontamination is a general term used to d escribe processes that include cleaning , disinfection and sterilisation. 1. Level of decontamination The WHO Decontamination Guidelines (2016)67 clearly o utlines and emphasises the need for optimal cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of reprocessed medic al devices that are used for patient care. Table 19 provides an overview of the levels of decontamination and description . Table 19: Level of decontamination and description Level of decontamination Description of decontamination Cleaning Cleaning refers to the physical removal of body fluids, tissue, dust or foreign material. It will reduce the number of microorganisms as well as the dirt, there by improv ing contact with the surface being disinfected or sterilized, reducing the ris k of dirt being fixed to the surface. Rem oval of dirt will also limit the risk of inactivation of a chemical disinfectant and the multiplication of mic roorganisms. The removal of contamination from an item to the extent necessary for further processing or for intended use. [ISO/TS 11139] Disinfe ction Disinfection refers to the destruction or removal of microorganisms at a level that is not harmful and renders the item safe to handle by health workers . This process does not necessarily include the destructi on of bacterial spores. Sterilization Sterilisation refers to a validated process that renders a product free from microorganisms. It is the complete destruction or removal of microorganisms, including bacterial spores. 2. Spaulding's classification69 Spau lding's classification, categorises medical devices into three (critical, semi -critical and non - critical), based on the r isk of infection to the patien t (Table 20). 67World Health Organization. Decontamination and Reprocessing of Medical Dev ices for Health -care Facilities. Geneva; 2016. http://www.who.int/inf ection -prevention/publications/decontamination/en/ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 63 Table 20: Spaulding's classification for decontamination Risk classification Category Type of decontamination required Critical high risk Critical Any re -usable medical device (such as surgical instruments, rigid endoscopes) used to enter a sterile body cavity (e.g. abdominal cavity, cranium, joint cavity)will require sterilisation either by steam (if heat stable) or by chemical means (if heat sensit ive). Semi -critical medium risk Semi -critical Medical devices that come into contact with non -intact skin and mucous membranes require high level disinfection and seldom, sterilization. Examples include endoscopes (gastroscopes, bronchoscopes) and respira tory devices. Non-critical low risk Non-critical Devices that come into contact with intact skin, environmental surfaces or other areas which pose a low risk will require t horough cleaning and drying, with low level disinfection if indicated. Examples include blood pressure machine cuffs , stethoscopes and thermometers.

General recommendations Provision for hand hygiene must be available in each section of the Decontamination Unit A separate gowning area for each sectio n with appropriate PPE must be available All reusable medical devices must be reprocessed in a Decontam ination Unit or a Sterile Services Department . No cleaning or packaging of medical devices should take place in clinical areas . Medical devices should be rinsed off to remove gross soiling at point of use. Medical devices should be transported safely (in suitable containers and on trolleys) to the area for decontamination . All health workers handling used m edical devices must be immunised against hepatit is B, have proper protective equipment and be trained in applicable decontamination processes . All health workers handling used medical devices must always wear appropriate PPE (long gloves, mask, goggles, ap ron, safety shoes) The Decontamination Unit mus t: o Have segregated dirty and clean areas for reprocessing medical devices, with regulated ventilation to reduce transmission and provide comfort to the staff . o Ensure that the workflow is from dirty to clean with no crossover of staff or equipment . o Have separate areas for cleaning, inspection/ assembly and packaging, sterilization and storage which do not allow recontamination of sterile items . o Be well ventilated, light and airy , easy to clean . o Ensure the equipment used for decontamination and sterilization is functional , the processes are validated (with records) and is regularly maintained (log books) . o Sterile storage area must be airy, bright and dry with ambient temperatures not exceeding 27o C PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 67 SAFE HANDLING OF LINEN AND LAUNDRY Used linen may be heavily contaminated with a wide range of organisms including scabies mites and therefore should always b e handled with care to prevent their dispersal or transfer. Therefore guidelines must be in place and followed to ensure the safe hand ling of linen and laundry to: Prevent clean (general/theatre) linen from becoming contaminated before it is used in patien t care; Prevent dirty ( used/soiled/infectious/infested ) linen from contaminating patients, staff, the environment, and clean linen. Health facility sh ould have:72 A standard operating procedure for the management of linen including colour coding Adequate r esources must be provided to ensure effective laundering of linen, including for proper maintenance of buildings and equipment. A quality management sy stem must be established incorporating: o work instructions and procedures; o process control procedures; o quality control procedures; and o control of linen (clean/soiled) procedures. A procedure specifically for infection/contamination control must be made avai lable to staff handling linen. The procedure should include control measures through differentiation betw een categories of soiled linen, i.e. of high -risk to normal soiled linen: containers must be colour coded in accordance with SANS 1024 -1 (as amended): o Category A (red bag ) = high risk infection for immediate incineration; o Category B (yellow bag ) = sealed b ags of high -risk/potentially infectious (blood/body fluids contaminated or sluiced) for direct loading into washing machines; and o Category C (white /transparent bag) = normal used linen of no risk during handling. A clear standard operating procedure (SOP) on health and environmental p rotection must be documented and communicated to all laundry staff. A trained designated staff member for the control of la undry and he/she must ensure that the requirements regarding pollution, occupational and environmental hy giene are 72National Departmen t of Health. National Environmental Health Norms and Standards for pr emises and acceptable Monitoring Standards for Environmental Health Practitioners, 24 December 2015. Government Gazette; 2015 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 68 complied with, including appropriate action in respect of any risks associated with infection or other hazards. Procedures for the use of pro tective clothing and personal hygiene where staff is in contact with high risk areas or linen should be d ocumented to include precautionary measures. 1. The Laundry Cycle The movement of clean and dirty linen from the point of use to the processing area and back is shown in Figure 11. The red and green sections denote used or dirty areas and clean areas respect ively. Figure 11: Laundry cycle 2. Laundering process All healthcare linen, irrespective of where it is processed (in-house or outsourced) , must go through a laundering process (see Figure 1 2) that meets the following IPC standa rds: The pre wash (sluice) cycle should not exceed 50o C. This is to avoid coagulation of proteinaceous material on the linen Use of an approved deterg ent and bleach in the correct concentrations . 3. Use of linen in patient care 4. Collection of dirty linen 5. Storage of dirty linen in a dedicated room for dirty linen separate from clean linen 6. Removal of dirty linen from temporary storage ( ward dirty linen room ) through the outside exit.7. Transportation of dirty linen separate from clean linen8. Washing and appropriate disinfection of linen (at the laundry )1. Transportation of clean linen separate from dirty linen 2. Storage of clean linen in dedicated room for clean linenDirty Clean PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 69 Approved temperature and duration of the wash cycle as per manufacturer recommendation . Washing of heat-sensitive patient clothing and uniforms at a temperature of no more than 40\u00b0C .73 Figure 12: Linen processing 73 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tyger berg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 70 3. Transportation and storage of clean linen Clean linen must be transporte d from the laundry to the user area in clean, closed containers. Clean linen, pillows, duvets and blankets must be stored on slated shelves in a design ated clean storage area (clean linen room or cupboard ) that is kept closed AND NOWHERE ELSE. When beds a re being made, the clean linen that will be used must be stacked on a linen trolley and the trolley parked outside the patient room. The clean linen m ust not be left on these trolleys since the linen will become contaminated in busy and open areas like th e passages. In order to prevent contamination, linen should not be stored at floor level. Wash or use ABHR before handling clean linen. 4. Storage and tr ansportation of dirty linen Dirty linen must be stored in closed bags in a designated area (dirty linen r oom) until it is collecte d from the unit/ward/clinic/operating theatre to be taken to the laundry. The door of the dirty linen room must be kept closed and access to the room must be restricted. The storage period must not exceed 24 hours except over weeke nds. The frequency of col lection of linen depends on the volume of laundry: o Once a day in the mornings from the wards o Three times a day from the trauma and labour ward o Up to four times a day f rom the operating theatres Dirty linen must be transported to the laundry in closed con tainers. Linen handlers must wear heavy -duty rubber gloves for their protection and wash their hands after removal of the glo ves. The service provider is responsible for: o Washing the reusable linen bags ; o Cleaning the linen trolley s on a regular basis ; o Cleaning and disinfecting the dirty linen transportation containers and transportation vehicle before they are loaded with clean linen ; o Cleaning up a spillage from the linen immediately. There must be no contact between clean and soil ed linen at any time.74 74 Western Cape Department of H ealth. IPC Manual: Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 71 EMS may keep dirty linen in a closed, colour -coded bag on the ambulance until shift change if more frequent drop -off is not poss ible. Drop -off of dirty linen must take place at least at shift change . 5. Frequency of changing bed linen and towels a. Hospitals The bed linen and towels of patients must be changed : o daily in critical care and high care areas ; o between patients and at regular intervals depending on whether the linen is soiled or every two to three days . In all cases the bed linen and towels must be changed immediately when they become visibly soiled. b. PHC facilities and EMS Due to a high turnover of patient s in PHC and EMS, a change of fresh bed linen between each patient is neither practical nor cost effective and most of these pa tients are dressed . Two options are offered here: Use a linen saver /paper roll to cover the bed, and discarded after each patient. This maybe expensiv e but is practical , alleviat es the need for laundry and might be more cost effective in the long run . o Linen has to be changed at the end of a shift and when visibly soiled. Ensure the mattresses and covers are intact. Wipe the mattress over with a damp cloth and then detergent to remove all visible organic matter. Once dry, wipe with a disinfectant wipe. This method is dependent on meticulously wiping down between each patient and a supply of disinfectant wipes. o Mattresses that are visibly soiled should be cleaned with a detergent and water and disinfected. 6. Handling of dirty linen Take the following steps to handle dirty linen safely: Wear gloves and a plastic apron when handling soiled, infectious or infested linen. There is no need to wear gloves when handling used linen. Move the dirty linen trolley to the patient bedside / examination table / operating table and transfer the linen directly from there into the bag on the trolley. Do not carry dirty linen to the dirty linen room or place it on the floo r or on the bedside table or other PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 72 surfaces. The dirty linen will contaminate the staff clothing or the s urfaces onto which it is placed. Do not shake dirty linen and handle it as little as possible to prevent the dispersal of skin scales carrying potentia lly harmful microorganisms . Roll the linen inwards to enclose the most contaminated areas. Hold dirty l inen away from the body to preven t contamination of the uniform/scrub suit. Choose the appropriate colour of bag for different categories of linen All dirty linen bags must be labelled with the date and the ward/unit/clinic name. Ensure that no additional items (used dressings, sticky tap e, instruments) are placed into the linen bags and especially that no sharps inadvertently end up in the linen. Use AB HR after handling dirty linen, including when moving from one patient's bed to another when making beds . For PHC and EMS, clean the mattre ss between patients or use a paper roll to cover the surface or wipe over with a disinfectant. Carry out HH after proc edure is completed and/ or after removing of gloves.75 Patients should not be allowed to bring their ow n linen to health facilities . Linen in isolation rooms has to be changed more frequently to reduce the bioburden . 7. Handling of Infested linen In ad dition to measures mentioned above (wear gloves and plastic apron when handling infested linen; place lin en in transparent plastic bag while at the bedside of the patient; close and label the bag with the unit /health facility name and date), the following procedure must be followed: Put an additional label on the bag that states \"infested linen\". Put the clos ed bag in the sluice room and c ontact the pest control department to treat the linen. The Pest Control Department will treat the linen according to the ir standard operating procedure . 75 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa No linen should be washed or sluiced in clinical areas. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 73 Request the houseke eper to send this linen to the linen sluice area of the health facility . 8. Curtains A record must be kept to keep track of when window and bed curtains are changed. Window curtains must be changed every three months or immediately when they become visibly soiled. Inter -bed/privacy curtains are considered a s part of the patient's linen because they are handled often and can easily become contaminated. Change bed curtains: o After disc harge of an infectious patient ; o Every four weeks if the patient(s) are non -infectious ; o Immediately when they become visibly soil ed.76 76 Western Cape Departmen t of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospita l, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 74 HEALTH CARE WASTE MANAGEMENT Health care waste include s Health Care Risk Waste (HCRW) and general waste. HCR W requires sound management through proper collection, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal in order to prevent and control poten tial infections of health workers, patients and the environment as a result of poor management. Healthcare waste management (HCWM) is governed by var ious national and provincial legislation set out to protect the health workers, the public , handlers of w aste and the environment and to manage waste effectively .77,78 The legislation requires that a ll health facilities that generate health care waste: have a duty to manage waste safely; are legally and financially responsible for the safe handling and environ ment ally sound disposal of the waste they produce; must always assume that the waste is hazardous until shown to be safe; and remain the responsibility for the waste from the point of generation until its final treatment and end-disposal.77 1. HCWM plan and committe e Legislation stipulates that every major health care waste generator must have a cost effective HCWM plan that is signed of f by the CEO/accoun ting officer of the facility and have a waste management committee in place . Minor generators may prepar e HCRW management plan s as a self -regulatory measure but must have a Standard Operating Procedure in place to guide the management of HCRW. The HCWM plan must include information relating to: facility information relating to workload, contact details of pe rson in charge such as the health care waste officer, categories of health care waste generated, classification of waste streams, description of waste management systems (generation, segregation, containment, transportation, treatment, and disposal ), contr acting systems for transportation and end point disposal, and details of an on -going training pro gramme including IPC and Occupational Health. 77 National Department of Health.

Occupational Health and Safety in HCWM Health facilities must ensure that: All persons who manually handle containers of untreated HCRW , must wear clean overalls or uniform , full length heavy duty aprons, protective heavy duty domestic gloves and closed toe shoes or water -resistant boots and a respirator/appropriate mask. Additional PPE must be provided in accordance with risk assessment, see section on PPE. A health and safety guideline/ policy and strategy in place to guide occupational health and safety matters as they relate to waste manageme nt.80 Occupational health and safety incidents are immediately reported to the responsible staff member if any if the following occur: o Exposure to blood and body fluids either due to a sharps injury or spillage ; o Exposure to chemicals, radiation and other no xious substance ; o Back injury or physical injury during transportation of waste. 5. Seven steps are identified in the cradle -to-grave management of health care waste, and appropriate measures must be taken at each step for IPC purpose . Step 1: Healthcare waste generation Step 2: Segregation and containerisation of waste Step 3: Interim storage of waste in a health facility Step 4: Internal transport and collection of waste in a health facility Step 5: Centralised storage and weighing of waste in a health facil ity Step 6: External collection of waste and removal off site by a service provider Step 7: Treatment and final disposal of waste by a treatment f acility. 6. Segregation, and containerisation colour coding and labelling of health care waste a. Segregation Segregation and minimization of health care waste are the most important steps towards success fully manag ing health care waste . Health care waste shoul d be segregated by category into the appropriate colour bags/bins at the point of generation , e.g. wards, consultation room s in primary health care facilities , and ambulances .. There should be clearly visible posters displayed at the point of waste generat ion to indicate what types of waste goes into which colour bag or container. 80National Department of Health. Regulations relating to health care waste management in health establishments, 23 May 2014.

Waste transportation a. Internal transport ation Once the waste has been segregated , the plastic bag should be tied, the container s labelled and stored in a clean dry room in the clinical area ready for collection. Storage in the sluice is not recommended. The waste should be collect ed everyday from wards and consultation rooms . The waste should be transported in closed lockable containers/trolleys/carts which can hold the waste ba gs in place during collection and can be unloaded easily. These transport trolleys should be washed with detergent and water every day at the end of the collection cycle and allowed to dry. No disinfectant is necessary unless spillage has occurred (see bl ood spillage) Clinical waste should be stored in a dry, se cured space free from vermin, and protected from the elements , ready for collection (by in house or private contractors ). Non-clinical waste can either be stored or dropped directly into a compactor which will reduce the bulk of the domestic waste before i t goes to land fill. b. External transportation As the waste generator, the health facility is responsible for: Adequate labelling of HCRW to be transported off site, ensuring that clinical waste is t ransported safely in closed containers for final disposal, registering , weighing and logging of waste bef ore transportation, signing the consignment over to an authorised service provider who in turn signs over the consignment to the treatment facility. 11. Disposal of health care risk waste It is the responsibility of the management of the health facility to ensure that the final disposal of health care risk waste is safe, permanent and not hazardous to the public . The disposal method must be clearly specified in the contract between the facility and contracted service provider. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 82 Infectious waste must be treated and disposed o f only at a facility that is licensed and conforms to the provisions of the N ational Environmental Management : Waste Act, 2008 as amended.86 Only licensed waste management contractors must be contracted to render treatment and disposal services for the health facility. Contracted service provider must adhere to the terms of the con tract with the health facility . Table 2 6 indicates th e recommended treatment and disposal methods for HCRW . Table 26: Recommended tre atment and disposal methods for HCRW Treatment/ disposal method Description of treatment/disposal Examples of waste types Shredding and Autoclaving (primary treatment technologies) Waste is shredded and sterilised using a dual process to convert health ca re waste into non -category, general waste which can then be disposed using the regular waste disposal system.

All waste exce pt anatomical and pharmaceutical waste Encapsulation Containment is used w hen there is no need to remove the waste material and/or the cost of removal is prohibitive. The main purpose of containment is to prevent or control liquid or semi -liquid contamina ted wastes from leaking or leaching into surrounding areas. Mainly recommen ded for hazardous liquid waste. Radioactive waste an highly toxic waste Electro thermal deactivation Non burn treatment method All categories of waste, except anatomical and pharmaceutical waste Incineration (primary treatment technology) Waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in w aste materials. Incineration and other high-temperature waste treatment systems are described as \"thermal treatment\". Incineration of w aste materials converts the waste into ash, flue gas and heat. All categories of waste 86National Environmental Manag ement: Waste Act (No. 59 of 2008) . Government Gazette; 10 March 2009. The facility waste contract must specify which treatment and health care waste disposal method will be used by the contractor. It is recommended that the health care risk contract should include transfer of waste and transportation to the central waste storage areas from EMS and surrounding clinics . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 83 RESPIRATORY HYGIENE AND COUGH ETIQUETTE Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette are infection prevention measures designed to limit the transmission of respiratory pathogens spread by droplet or airborne routes. To prevent the transmission of all respiratory infections in healthcare settings the following infection control measures should be implemented at the first point of contact wit h a potentially infected person. Rapid triage of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms is strongly recommended 87 1. Visual alerts (sell it) Post visual alerts at the entrance s, waiting areas and wards at health facilities instructing patients and persons who accompany them (e.g., family, friends) to inform health workers of symptoms of a respiratory infection when they first register for care a nd to practice respiratory hygiene/ cough etiquette.88 2. Respiratory hygiene/ cough etiquette posters (sell it) The following measures to contain respiratory secretions are recommended for all individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; Discard tissue in the nearest waste re ceptacle after use; Perform HH after having contact with respirator y secretions and contaminated objects/materials .86 Health facilities should ensure t he availability of consumables for adhering to respiratory hygiene/ cough etiquette in waiting areas for p atients and visitors. Provide tissues and no -touch receptacles for disposal of used tissue s. Provide conveniently located dispensers of ABHR . Where sin ks are available, ensure that supplies for hand washing (i.e., soap, disposable paper towels) are consist ently available. 87World Health Organization.

It is essential that health facilities have systems in place to ensure appropriate patient placement to prevent spread of transmissibl e pathogens . Consider isolation, depending on resources , when : there is a risk of transmission of a susp ected or known infectious disease ; presence of MDRO ; based on the route of transmission and risk of transmission to other patients an d health workers . Depending on the route of transmission single room or cohort (several patients with the same infectious d isease) isolation is indicated. A risk assessment can be done by following the steps outlined in Figure 15.94 Figure 15: Risk assessment steps for patient placement Ask questions about possible exposure events when a risk assess ment is performed: Travel history Occupation Hobbies 94 Dramowski, A., 2014.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 88 PRINCIPLES OF ASEPSIS Aseptic technique is a general term involving practices that minimize the introduction of microorganisms to patients during patient care. There are two categories of asepsis: General asepsis which applies to patient care procedures outside the op erating theatre. Surgical asepsis relating to procedures/processes designed to prevent surgical site infection. Aseptic techniques are used to reduce the risk of post -procedure infections and to minimize the exposure of health workers to potentially infe ctious microorganisms. Aseptic techniques include practices performed just before, during, or after any invasive p rocedures. Poor adherence to aseptic techniques results in considerable morbidity and mortality. To reduce procedure related HAI s, a set of infection prevention bundles have been established (Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) which, when followed c orrectly, have proven t o be effective in preventing HAIs.95 Principles of asepsis: Several non-surgical procedures require aseptic technique i n order to prevent transmission of infectious agents particularly during the placement of devices into sterile body spaces. The introduction of a steri le item into a patient should always be performed with a no-touch -technique. This means that the skin in the area of insertion should not be touched after skin antisepsis has been applied . Aseptic techniques are practiced for al l invasive medical procedur es such as insertion of central venous and peripheral line insertion, surgery , or inserting a urinary cat heter . For further information on bundles, see section on HAI . Most HAI is attributed to actions of health workers who either ignore or are unaware o f basic concepts of aseptic techniques including HH aseptic procedures.96 Education and training of all health workers is essential to ensure safe practices. 95http://www.ihi.org/Topics/Bundles/Pages/default.aspx# targetText=A%20bundle%20is%20a%20structured,proven%20 to%20impr ove%20p atient%20outcomes. 96 Western Cape Department of Health.

Injection safety WHO defines injection safety as : A safe injection that does not harm t he recipient, Does not expose the provider to any avoidable risks, and Does not result in waste that is dangerous for the commun ity.97 Injections are one of the most frequently used medical procedures. The WHO estimates that 12 billion injections are give n annually , 5% of which are administered for immunization and 95% for curative purposes. Unsafe injectio n practices (especially needle and syringe re -use) occur and place both staff and patients at risk of infection with blood -borne viruses (BBVs). It is estimated that globally, up to 160 000 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 4.7 million hepatitis C and 16 million hepatitis B infections each year are a ttributabl e to these practices. The problem is complex and fuelled by a mixture of socio -cultural, econom ic and structural factors.98 Promoting the occupational safety of health workers is essential and protecting health workers from occupational infection with bloo d-borne viruses have a range of potential benefits, including safer injection practices for pati ents and less discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS.99,100 2.

Use the safety te chnique of a neutral zone (\"put down -pick up\") in operating theatres when passing sharps, to avoid hand -to-hand contact . Transport used needles safely, in a receiver (e.g. kidney bowl) to the disposal area if the sharps container is not at hand . Discard used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp objects directly into a rigid, punctur e proof container which is placed within arm's reach of the point of use . Close and secure sharps containers when recommended levels are reached (3/4 f ull). Ensure sharps containers are fixed and closed to avoid spillage during transport NEVER \u00d7 Re-cap ne edles or manipulate needles using both hands . Use techniques that involve directing the point of the needle toward any part of the body . Force used sha rp items (trocars, needles and syringes) into an overfull sharp container . Remove used needles from dispo sable syringe without capping (see below) or remove scalpel blades from holders without forceps . Insert a used needle into the mattress or anywhere els e; discard directly into the sharps container . 3. Safety Engineered Devices (SED s101) There a re two types of SEDs available for the protection of health care professionals as well as patients and the public. 1) 'Sharp injury protection ' for delivery of medicat ion by health care professionals by intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal route to pa tients; 2) 'Reuse prevention ' used for delivery of medication by health care professionals by intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal route. Both of these have different mechanisms of safety and clear indications for use. SEDs are available in South A frica and shou ld be used wherever and when ever possible to reduce needle stick injuries and to ensure that the injections are safely discarded. 101WHO guideline on the use of safety -engineered syringes for intramuscular, intradermal and subcutaneous injections - standards. 4.Syringes. 5.Needlestick Injuries - prevention and control. 6.Delivery of Health Care . 7.Guideline.

Multi dose vials ( MDV s) 83 MDVs are a major source of cross infection and outbreaks of hepatitis B and C in healthcare. The reintroduction of a used needle to refill the syringe as well as leaving a hypodermic needle in the diaphragm of the MDV from which a used syringe is filled is common , but is an unacceptable practice . The safest way to use a MDV is to insert a spike with a non -return valve to ensure there is no contamination and sterility of the solution is maintained. The diaphragm or bung of the vial should always be clean ed with 70% alcohol and rubbed for 15 - 30 seconds if a spike is not used, prior to access . Syringe s should not be prefilled from a multi dose vial . MVD should be stored as per the manufacturer's recommendation. 5. Sharps injury Health workers shoul d know their hepatitis B immune status and if possible their HIV status If an accidental sharps injury oc curs: Allow free bleeding Wash under running water immediately . Inform your immediate supervisor . Get a blood sample from the source (either a patient or sharps discarded incorrectly in waste ) and a good clinical history relating to blood -borne diseases . Report to the Occupational Health Department or designated persons . It might be required to give a sample of blood if the immune status of the health wo rker is not known . Hepatitis B immunisation booster might be offered . Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) wil l be offered after counselling102. Ideally PEP should be administered as soon as possible , but definitely within 24 hours of exposure , if indicated . Start PEP (if necessary) while waiting for source blood result . Once the source blood results are back, decis ion on continuation of PEP is made . 102 South African HIV Clinician Society.

Medical Surveillance Medical surveillance, as outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulatio ns, should be done for all at risk staff (as determined by a health risk assessment).103 Employees identifi ed for medical surveillance should undergo evaluation at various points during employment. The frequency should be determined by the nature of the risk involved. These evaluations can include one or more of the following: Baseline medic al examination , for example the baseline screening and testing for TB infection Routine periodic medical surveillance (based on risks identified). For e xample screening and testing for TB every six months. This should also be conducted as part of outbreak investigations . An exit examination on leaving employment. Example screening and testing for TB disease to exclude undiagnosed TB disease at the time of leaving the facil ity and ensure early treatment. 104 Post-incident medical surveillance (based on a spec ific incident). For example following a needle stick injury . 103 Republic of South Africa. Occupational Health and Safety Act. N0 95 of 1993. 104 National Department of Health. National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines for TB, MDR -TB and XDR -TB. Pretoria; 2015 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 93 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING A clean environment plays an important role in infection prevention and control prac tices. The environment in health facilit ies refers to the surroundings in which health care services are provided to patients, it refers to rooms, surfaces, equipment, and all objects used in connection with delivering of health care service s. Microbiolog ically contaminated surfaces can serve as r eservoirs of potential pathogens especially MDR Os, and play a significant role in transmission during outbreaks , particularly where there is overcrowding in clinical areas. Pathogens settle on surfaces and can be transferred by hands or objects to patients if the environment is not cleaned properly and regularly . The purpose of cleaning the environment is to remove visible dirt and dust. Cleaning reduce s the level of microorganisms which are carried on skin scales that form part of dust , and minimi ses the dissemination of infectious agents in the health facility. The effect is a sanitary, and relatively contamination -free environment for patients, staff, and visitors which is expected and inspires confidence in the health facility . This manual aims to provide uniform correct cleaning methods for the cleaning workfor ce, whether these are in -house or out -sourced contract ors, so that environmental cleaning can be effective, carried out by trained cleaners according t o a scheduled routine, us es appropriate cleaning agents and equipment and can be monitored . Also refer to Best Practices in Environmental Cleaning (2019) 105 for the latest evidence -based review. Objectives are to: understand principles and methods , procedur es and appropriate equipment requirements of effective cleaning in a facility setting ; ensure proper use of detergents and disinfectants in the environment ; define and apply appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for environmental cleaning ; provid e metho ds of monitoring and validation for environmental cleaning . 105 CDC and ICAN.

Requirements for c leaning staff 106 All staff must be trained in the correct methods of cleaning and disinfection relating to their job category Staff must be presentable, clean and practice good personal hygiene. Staff must wear clean , appropriate and identifiable regulation uniforms. If t he uniform becomes soiled or wet , it must be changed. HH must be performed (see section on HH): o at the beginning and end of each shift ; o after handling contaminated items ; o before and after meals or smoking ; o after handling cleaning chemicals; o after using th e bathroom ; o after removing gloves and between tasks; and o if hands are potentially contaminated with bloo d or body fluids. No eating, drinking, or smoki ng is allowed except in specific designated areas. Staff working in specialised areas , such as the operat ing theatres, must adhere to the specified dress code for those areas. Staff, including management , must be trained in the effective cleaning process es, appropriate equipment and use of detergents and disinfectants and proper cleaning methods for various a reas in a facility, including infection prevention and control Records of cleaning staff traini ng must be kept and be available for inspection 2. PPE for cleaning staff Cleaning staff must wear the appropriate PPE, see Table 2 8. In addition, cleaning staff working in infectious areas such as isolation wards or single rooms must wear appropriate PPE according to the transmission based precaution require ments as guided by the nursing 106 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa Note: The routine use of a disinfectant in the environment is strongly discouraged! I t is wasteful and promotes antimicrobial resistance. Th e IPC practitioner or team will advise when a disinf ectant is indicated, such as terminal cleaning after isolation of an infectious patient . Note: Staff working in all hospital units such as isolation wards or single rooms must be trained and a record of the training must be kept. The staff is responsible for familiarising themselves with the proper precautions required before entering the area. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 95 staff. Cleaning staff is within their right to refuse to work in an infect ious area if appropriate personal protective equipment is not provided. Table 28: PPE for cleaning staff107 Domestic rubber g loves (see section on PPE) (not the examination or clinical gloves worn by health workers) for normal cle aning duties. The gloves must reach up to mid arm and offer protection against chemicals and direct contact with dirt. Gloves must be changed or washed thoroughly with detergent after cleaning each bathroom, each patient room and whenever soiled . Domestic gloves are reusable and should be changed only if damaged. Gloves are preferably colour -coded for cleaning different areas - kitchens, bathrooms and to ilets. Heavy -duty gloves (see section on PPE ) if contact with chemicals which may harm the skin. Heavy -duty gloves are usually reusable and must be washed with detergent after use. Plastic aprons for any cleaning activity that may generate splashes. They must be worn so as to cover the front of the uniform. The use of colour coded aprons are recommende d. Eye Protection is not routinely recommended. It might, however, be necessary in special circum stances, depending on the activity and the anticipated risk of exposure to blood, body fluids, or strong chemicals. Surgical masks for use when entering areas where air borne and droplet precautions are required. in theatres, outpatient settings, sterile procedures Cloth or cotton gowns use when conducting term inal cleaning of patient rooms . Used with plastic apron underneath to reduce fluid contami nation. 107 Western Cape Department of Healt h. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 96 3. Cleaning principles Cleaning schedules and procedures must be planned so that cleaning progresses from the least soiled to the most soiled ar ea and from the top to the bottom of a room . All areas must be cleaned systematically to avoid missing a reas. Frequently touched surfaces are a high -risk for cross -transmission and must therefore be cleaned more frequently . Clean from high to low areas. Clean from cleanest to dirtier areas Only approved detergent must be used for cleaning. All solutions mu st be diluted according to manufacturer's instructions. This is essential for maximum effectiveness. Increasing the strength of disinfectants does not necessarily increase the antimicrobial activity. Decreasing the strength of disinfectants may lead to AMR . The key to environmental cleaning is the physical removal of microorganisms and debris. The use of soap, water and friction (action of washing/scrubb ing - \"elbow grease\") is effective, cheap and simple and is the first step in the cleaning process. No ad ditives (such as sco uring agents , disinfectant, or floor polish) are necessary since this will deactivate the active cleaning ingredients in the deterg ent.108 These are usually applied after cleaning has taken place . Attention in cleaning must be paid to bot h high touch and low touch surfaces . 4. Cleaning methods101 It is essential that the correct cleaning methods are used. See Table 2 9. Table 29: Recommended cleaning methods Damp dusting Dusting or wiping of surfaces must always be done with a damp cloth. The cloth must be dampened in clean water containing a detergent. The detergent breaks the surface tension of the water, allowin g the dust particles to cling to the cloth. Then the cloth is wrung tightly to remove most of the water before being used to wipe down surfaces. In high - risk areas, when using a bucket and cloth method, solutions should be changed and buckets and cloths cl eaned per bed space. Mix only enough solution for each bed space.109 108 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): T ygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, 2009 Dec;73(4):378 -85. doi: 10.1016/j.jhin.2009.03.030.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 97 A damp (not wet) floor mop must b e used to clean floors. Clean water and detergent must be placed in one bucket and the mop then is rinsed off in the other (dirty) side. The water must be changed frequently for every bed space in a high -risk area or as soo n as the solution becomes discolo ured . Mix only enough solution for each bed space . Not recommended Dry dusting is ineffectual since it only displaces dust; therefore , it is not reco mmended in health facilities . Feather dusters are not to be used. Sweeping: Sweeping with brooms is not r ecommended for health facilities since the individual bristles only displace the dust. 5. Cleaning equipment The recommended cleaning equipment is set o ut in Table 30. A colour -coding system should be used for cleaning equipment to reduce the risk of cross contamination in multiple areas; Red colour - for highly contaminated areas, such as toilets, showers, wash -up rooms, sluice rooms, and bathroom floors ; Blue colour - general areas including wards, offices and hand wash basins in public areas; Green colour - bathroom (basin, bath and showers ), ward /consulting room basi ns; White colour - Kitchens areas (food preparation and serving); Yellow colour - Isola tion areas (only applicable for hospitals as primary health care facilities rarely have to isolate patien ts). All equipment, carts and accessories used by domestic cleaners must be cleaned at the end of each day or more frequently when visibly soiled . Note : When applying chemicals to a surface, spray onto a cloth first and then wipe. NEVER spray directly onto a surface as it can cause respiratory irri tation and aerosolize any contamination on the surface. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 98 Table 30: Cleaning equipment Two-way bucket system for mopping A double bucket, colour coded, blue for clean and red for used water mounted on a trolley Colour coded mops Flat mop systems are preferred. \"Sp aghetti\" mops are more difficult to wash as they easily become tangled and cannot be tumble -dried. If \"spaghetti\" mops are used ( mop with a cotton string head ) for cleaning of floors , they must be tho roughly wrung out an d damp, NOT WET, when cleaning the floors. Mops should be washed in very hot water and dried or sent to the laundry at the end of each clean ing session. Colour coded cleaning cloths for damp dusting and wiping of surfaces . Colour coded buckets for water . Janitor trolley s are mo unted on wheels and front swivel castors that allows for easy manoeuvring. They are used to keep cleaning tools and consumables secure and tidy while working in the wards. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 99 Floor polisher, scraper and buffer for polishing of floors Static head mops f or cleaning dry floors These are used to sweep up dry, loose contamination such as dust and sand from the surface of the floor. \"Wet Floor\" sign - to warn staff. patients and visitors that floors are wet to minimize the risk of falls Window squeege e for cleaning windows Pistol -grip spray container NEVER \u00d7 spray directly on surfaces . The cloths sho uld be wetted and then wiped over the surface. Cleaning chemicals should be dispensed in dedicated, marked containers. No chemicals may be decanted int o cold drink or other food -containing, e .g milk, bottles. Cleaning equipment must be used according t o specific cleaning tasks The equipment must be easy to clean, regular maintenance and replacement schedules must be available, implemented and records kept. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 100 Wet equipment (bucket and mop) is more likely to encourage the growth of micro - organisms therefore it is important to keep all e quipment clean and dry. Cleaning equipment and solutions must be removed from patient care and food preparation area s as soon as possible after cleaning are complete. The cleaning and maintenance of all equipment should be ag reed upon before use. 6. Cleaning equipment - restocking and maintenance Cleaning cloths must be segregated according to the approved colour -coding syste m for washing . Change cleaning cloths and mop heads daily or per bed space in high -risk areas and situati ons. Used cloths and mo p heads must be washed with warm water and a detergent before reuse. (If washed in a washing machine, the temperature should be at least 60\u00b0C.) When solutions in pistol -grip spray containers have been completely used up, the reusabl e containers must be washed and dried before being refilled - DO NOT TOP UP! Cleaning carts and buckets must be constructed of rustproof material that is easily cleane d and free of scratches, cracks and crevices. All equipment, carts and accessories used by cleaners must be cleaned at the end of each day 's cleaning session . The equipment must be stored dry in a designated , clear ly marked storage area or cleaning closet. These closets must be kept neat, clean and free of clutter. All equipment must be routinely maintained and kept in good repair or replaced. Scheduled inspections should be done by supervisors. 110 7. Chemicals used in cleaning Detergents The majority of routine cleaning should be done with clean water and a neutral health facility grade detergen t. The detergents should be compatible with the material they are used to clean. Detergent s have no killing ability but do remove organic matter which contain microbes and thereby reduce environmental contamination. Supplies must be in original containers . 110 Western Cape Department of Health. IPC Manual (2015): Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 101 Bottles used for decanting must be relabeled stating the contents and instructions for use. Cleaning should only be carried out with the recommended detergents in accordance with this policy. Instructions for preparation of detergents Detergent must be freshly prepared daily Dilute accurately according to manufacturers' instructions No additives must be mixed with detergents as it will inactivate the cleaning ingredients in the detergent. Disinfectants Disinfectants do not make dirt safe. Disinfectants are inactivated by organic matter such as dirt, blood, faeces, cotton mops and hard water Disinfectants are not recommended for routine cleaning and s hould only be used for spillage containing blood and high -risk body fluids - see page 111 . Order of cleaning Ensure safety of p atients, staff and visitors by placing hazard signs / notices in strategic positions during cleaning in all service areas. A verbal reminder is also helpful. Clear the area (by section) to be cleaned by removing all the light mov able equipment, furniture. Cleaning should begin from the clean areas moving towards dirty areas , thus leaving cleaning of infectious patient areas for last. Cleaning should begin from the top to the bottom and from the furthest area to the closest entran ce area. Cleaning of floor s should be follow ed by cleaning of areas above it such as walls, windows, medical equipment and furniture. Drying of the f loor should be ensured by wiping the floor dry with a well wrung -out mop then air dried. 8. Routine cleanin g of clinical and non -clinical areas All clinical and non -clinical areas which include floors, walls, windows, beds and other medical equipment, curta ins and utensils, furniture and empty waste bins must be cleaned. All staff must wear appropriate PPE. A daily cleaning routine of all horizontal surfaces and toilet areas Note : Refer to the detergent, disinfectant and antiseptic section for details on chemicals for environ mental cleaning PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 102 is necessary to ensure that optimal cleanliness of the environment is maintained. So me of the areas are included in patient care articles (see patient care articles) . The area between the b ed and mattress is often missed and must be included in routine cleaning. Cleaning checklist must be put up in all areas. Cleaners must sign the check list after having cleaned. After carrying out checks, s upervisors must co -sign the checklists at least da ily. 9. Cleaning s chedule , methods and frequencies Schedules Cleaning should be carried out in a planned manner and cleaning schedules should be drawn up for each area and include all equipment, fixtures and fittings . There must be clear ly defined areas of (cleaning) responsibility for both the cleaners and nursing staff ; cleaners are generally responsible for cleaning and maintaining non -clinical equip ment while n ursing staff are responsible for the cleaning of clinical equipment - unless these tasks are delegated by mutual consent . Training must be provided. Checklists m ust be aligned to the cleaning schedule and include, signature of cleaning staff at every session and signature of supervisor, daily for validation . Frequently touched surfaces are a high -risk for cross -transmission because they are contaminated with the pathogens that are transferred from people's hands. Items such as door handles, lig ht switches, patient monitors and medical equipment buttons/knobs are frequently touched by health worker s and patients. Most areas of a health facility will require at least daily cleaning. See Table 31. The same cleaning principles apply to ambulances. First clean all surfaces and then disinfect. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 103 Table 31: Routine cleaning procedu res Area Cleaning method Equipment Frequency Floors 1) Static head mopping - remove dirt and dust on the floors before commencing with wet mopping. Star ting from the furthest area away from the door, the static head mop is run along the edges of the floor. Once all the mopping is done, all the debris is collected into the approp riate bag. 2) Wet mopping: - Immerse the mop in the water with detergent, wring o ut the mop, follow a systematic method, ensuring that all areas of the floor are covered paying particula r attention to the corners. Rinse off intermittently rinsed off throughou t the moping process. If the water becomes discoloured, and when moving to ano ther area, the bucket must be emptied, washed and be refilled with clean water and detergent. Dry floors to prevent slips and falls. 3) Scrubbing/stripping: Scrub floors frequently . Commence scrubbing from the furthest point and towards the cleaner. Mopping and scrubbing of corridors should be done first on one half of the corridor then the other side to ensure that there is a dry area where people can walk without any risk of slipping and falling. After scrubbing the main section of the floor, edges of the floor should be manually scrubbed with the scouring pad. The entire floor is then thoroughly mopped and d ried. 4) Floor sealing : It is recommended that scrubbed floors be sealed to ensure that the floors remain clean and shiny but not slippery. Floor sealing is commonly applied to vinyl floors. 5) Floor polishing: vinyl flooring is recommended for health e stablish ments therefore.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 106 alcohol and soap dispensers, door handles, lights and flooring are also thoroughly cleaned. The hand basins a re cleaned and soap scum is removed with scouring pad and detergent. Bathrooms and toilets - The walls / t iles are washed starting from the highest to the lowest areas. All dirt and soap scum are removed from sinks, basins and bath tubs using an appropriat e detergent / cleaning chemical. The inside of the cistern is scrubbed using a toilet brush then water is flushed to allow entry of clean, rust free water into the cistern. The rim and bowl of the toilet is sprayed with toilet cleaning chemical and left for few minutes to activate, scrubbed with toilet brush and wiped clean. The toilet brush and holder are rinsed in running water and or detergent and dried. Each toilet should have a dedicated toilet brush, especially in isolation cubicles . Shower Roo ms- Starting from the highest point to the lowest point walls / tiles and ceiling are washed with water that is m ixed with detergent. Ensure that shower heads are cleaned and functional . Food services/kitchens - Hazard signs are placed at entrances of corr idors. A s detailed in the preceding sections of this manual , walls are washed starting from the highest to the lo west and furthest to nearby areas. All edges, fixtures and fittings and surfaces, including door handles are washed with detergent. PHC and EMS : the sa me principles for cleaning apply. Frequency of cleaning is defined by clinical practice but should be at least once a day . Adequate cleaning materials must be available and training of all cleaning staff undertaken. In case of blood or body fluid spillage, follow the recommendations outlined in this manual ( see section 1 3 below) . 11. Terminal cleaning112 Terminal cleaning is specifically carried out by cleaners after a patient with an infectious disease has been discharged either from a ward or a single (isolati on) room. While the cleaning procedure is nearly the same as routine cleaning, it is recommended that transmission -based PPE should be worn before entering the room. The use of hydrogen peroxide vapour or UV pulsed light devices fo r additional disinfec tion after terminally cleaning following discharge of a patient with MDRO is becoming 113 Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion (Publ ic Health Ontario) , Provincial Infection. An appropriate disinfectant is applied to all surfaces only after thorough cleaning . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 107 increasingly common , especially during outbreaks. This is an effective additional measure, but has to be preceded with cleaning with a detergent and water and disinfectio n. It cannot replace normal cleaning and disinfection, but serves as an add -on. The manufacturer or suppl ier's guidance must be followed. If terminal cleaning is required, checklists (Table 32) must be completed and signed by the IPC co-ordinator or unit/h ealth facility manager before another patient can be admitted to the room. Table 32: Checklist for terminal cleaning of isolation rooms Date: Ward: Room no: No Item (tick with a ) 1.

Remove linen bag and waste containers Staff responsible for terminal cleaning Housekeeping staff are responsible for cleaning of isolation rooms. The staff member in charge in charge of housekeeping will: o Ensure p rocedures are in place. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 108 o Ensure all housekeeping staff are familiar with the infection control policies and procedures. The IPC Team should be available as a resource , to carry out final checks on the cleaning and disinfection of the room and to give final clearance for occupancy by the next patient. Procedure for cleaning after discharge of an infe ctious patient : 113 Domestic cleaners must be notified by nursing when an isolation room is ready or needs cleaning . Transmission -based precautions: Cleaning staff must observe the following precautions when cleaning the isolation room of a patient on transmission -based precautions: o Airborne precautions: Use N95 respirators only for patients with TB, measles or chickenpox. Gloves and aprons should be worn. o Droplet precautions: Surgical f ace mask unless otherwise specified by nursing staff. Gloves and a pron should be worn . Contact Precautions: Gloves and plastic apron for housekeeping activities. Remove the gloves and apron when leaving the room and perform hand hygie ne The cleaning procedure for rooms of patients requiring isolation is the same as other patient rooms. Routine cleaning procedures must be performed meticulously . Terminal cleaning should be performed carefully with minimum dispersing of dust. All PPE mus t be discarded inside the isolation area and hand hygiene carried out before exiting the room. Cleaning equipment: Only use cleaning equipment marked/colour coded for the cleaning of isolation rooms. Cleaning equipment must be c leaned and disinfected after cleaning each isolation room. Cleaning of furniture: Clean a ll surfaces of the bed frame with a detergent before the bed is made. The beds, over -bed tables, chairs, lamps and lockers must be wiped down with soap and water, dried and wipe d down with alco hol. Ensure that both surfaces above and 114 Infe ctious Diseases Adv isory Committee. Best practices for environmental cleaning for prevention and cont PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 109 below ( underneath ) the bed are cleaned especially between the bedframe and mattress . The inside of the bedside cabinet and storage closet must be damp -wiped with a detergent . Linen: Remove all sheets, bed linen, curtains and any other washable item in the room and place in appropriate colour bags or containers. Linen and waste bags must be closed and labelled inside the isolation room before removal and sent to the laundry . o All surfaces of mattress es and pillow s must be damp -wiped with a hospital - approved detergent before the bed is made. o If plastic covers are torn or damaged, these should be replaced and the mattresses and pillows sent for decontamination. o If the plastic covers of the pillows and th e mattresses are intact and there are no visible signs of contamination then these should be wash ed down with soap and water, dried and wipe d off with alcohol. Mattress : inspect the mattress and cover to ensure integrity (no tears or damage). Wipe both sid es of the mattre ss and the edges with a damp cloth soaked in water and detergent, carefully removing all visible dirt. Wipe over with appropriate concentration of a recommended disinfectant (alcohol or chlorine). Replace mattress if torn. Medical equipment: v entilators, infusion pumps, monitors, leads, drip stand, oxygen regulator, stethoscope, saturation monitors , sonar machines and ECG probes and the emergency trolley equipment must be thoroughly cleaned with detergent and water (without soaking ) and wipe d down with alc ohol or 1000 ppm available chlorine (for C. difficile ). Send the ambubag and respiratory equipment to SSD and hand the ventilator over to the technologist for further decontamination. Other equipmen t: such as suction bottles, silic one tubes (if not single use), circuits, inhalation masks, puriton bottles, other bottles, transducer domes and used procedure packets must be rinsed out with water, packed in a transparent plastic bag that is marked infectious and send to SSD for cleaning and ethylene oxide steri lization . Blood pressure cuffs and thermometers should be washed in warm water and detergent and dried . Thermometers should be washed, dried and disinfected. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 110 Surfaces: Clean all surfaces with detergent and water. Dry . Wipe all surfaces with 70% alcohol (or 1000 ppm available chlorine as indicated) . Walls and floors : must be wiped down with detergent and water and if there are any bloodstains, wipe over with hypochlorite (10 000 ppm) after the wall is clean. Windows, storage cupboards, curtain rails, d oors, door handles and, handwash basins must be wiped down with detergent and water. Lotions and solutions : Discard all the left -over lotions and solutions e.g. liquid soap and hand disinfectant. Discard containers in HCRW bins . Patient care articles : Bedp ans, urinals, bowls and jugs should be washed and heat disinfected . Waste : must be managed according to the healthcare waste management guidelines . 12. Validation /evaluation of cleaning methods (check it) There are various methods of ensuring environ mental cleaning processes have been followed; some are inexpensive but also less effective than other structured validation systems. Table 33 outlines the environmental cleaning validation methods and their poss ible application in South Africa .114 Feedback t o cleaning staff and managers are essential. 114 Role of infections in all health care settings. 3rd ed. Toronto, ON: Queen's Printer for Ontario; 2018 . Note: The room should ideally be left unoccupied until ALL SURFACES ARE DRY . Isolation signs are not to be removed until terminal cleaning is completed. The IPC Team will remove the transmission -based precaution signs once the process has been completed and the cleanliness checked. Do not use ABHR containing chlorhexidine or an emollient to clean surfaces. The same principles of terminal cleaning apply to PHC and EMS. First clean thoroughly with water and detergent and then apply appropriate disinfectant as indicated . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 111 Table 33: Suggested monitoring staff and frequency for common routine monitoring methods Monitoring method Monitoring staff Monitoring frequency Performance observations: Cleaning super visors At least weekly May be more frequent with new cleaning staff and eventually reduce in frequency after a defined time or target score has been reached Visual assessments of cleanliness: Cleaning supervisors IPC or hygiene committee staff Developed at a facility -level, based on local policy and context (e.g., resources) Fluorescent markers (e.g., UV visible): Cleaning supervisors IPC or hygiene committee staff Developed at a facility -level, based on local policy and context (e.g., resources) Used to measure compliance with cleaning methodology ATP meters Expensive Used to measure microbial load after cleaning Laboratory cultures Expensive, but are the gold standard for determining residual contamination after cleaning & disinfection Usually used during outbreaks or where specified It is best practice to routinely (i.e., with some reoccurring frequency) monitor environmental cleaning practices for example every week, or every month . Fluorescent markers are a cost - effective way of monitoring cleaning recommendations are to record: At least 5% of beds (150 bed facilities) or a minimum of 15 patient care beds/areas (for hospitals with less than 150 beds (every week ). If resources allow, 10 -15% of beds should be monitored during the first year of the monitoring program me. It is import ant that the agreed upon frequency can be consistently maintained in order to establish benchmarks and track changes in practice and performance over time. 13. Cleaning of blood spillages All spillages must be cleaned up immediately. The first person who causes, or notices, a spill of blood or body fluids must cover it immediately with paper towels to soak up the fluid and contain the spread. The person responsible for cleaning up the spillage must be called urgently . The person clean ing up the spillage sh ould proceed as follows: A pair of domestic gloves must be worn . DO NOT pour chlorine directly over the spill - it increases spread and contamination of the area PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 112 A pan and brush is used to carefully remove the soaked towels covering the spill, glass or any other solid material mixed in with the blood. Place contaminated bits of g lass carefully in news paper and wrap well for disposal. Surfaces visibly contaminated wi th blood or body fluids should be cleaned immediately with water and a detergent. Inspect to ensure no signs of spillage remain. Wipe over with 10000 ppm available chlorine . While wearing th e domestic gloves, w ash the brush and pan carefully with water and detergent and allow to dry. Remove gloves and carry out HH. 14. Handling of waste Domestic staff must wear thick domestic (rubber gloves) and protective clothing when handling healthcare waste . 15. Food preparation areas All facilities handling, preparation, serving of foodstuffs must comply with the provisions of the Regulations Governing General Hygiene Requirements for Food Premises, Transport of Foodstuffs and related matters, R638 of 22 June 2018. Microbiological sample swabs of food preparation surfaces (counter tops, cutting boards) to be taken at least quarterly for; Bacillus cereus ; Clostridi odes perfringens ; Total coliform count ; E coli ; Total viable( plate ) count ; Staphylococcus aureus ; Shigella spp (all) . Control samples of foodstuffs to be drawn to every batch of meals provided to patients and kept for at least 72 hours at 4o C. A record must be kept of all samples for at least 14 days. Food hygiene and safety in a health facility must be follow strict fo od safety systems, such as HACCP. A systematic approach for the identification, evaluation, and control of potential hazards at every stage of food preparation and serving should be implemented. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 113 16. Pest control Pest control does not fal l directly under IPC however, all h ealth facilities should have a pest control program me in place which clearly sets out procedures necessary to prevent and control the breeding of pests within the health facility , manage the use o f pesticides, in line wit h the environmental health norms and standards to prevent infections spread by pests . The programme should include a pest control schedule, based on the degree of infestation and a risk assessment . Only approved pesticides and registered service providers must be contacted for pest control services.115 The facility should a dopt an integrated pest management approach which includes facility inspections to identify conditions that may support the harbourage of pests , proper waste management, maintaining good environmental hygiene standards, good housekeeping, structural maintenance and repairs of premises to prevent infestation of vermin . Only approved pesticides should be used. Assistance may be obtained from a commercial pest control agency if necessary (e.g . in the case of rodents). For primary health care facilities in rural areas and facilities where insects are not a big problem , spraying with a high perform ance residual insecticide spray is acceptable (example Fendona). 115National Department of Health.

Government Gazette; 2015 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 114 PART B TRAN SMISSION -BASED PREC AUTIONS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 115 PART B: TRANSMISSION -BASED PRECAUTIONS Transmission -based precautions are used to reduce the risk of transmission of potentially infectious diseases and pathogens. These should ALWAYS be applied in ADDITION TO S P. The type of transmission -based precaution will depend on the route of transmission of the microbe. There may be more than one route of transmission and precautions have to reflec t all possible routes. Transmission based precautions consist of the follow ing categories: Contact precautions Microbes are transmitted by: o Direct contact e.g. the hands of health workers ; o Indirect contact, via the environment and contaminated equipment . Respiratory precautions : Microbes are released in droplets or droplet nucl ei (aerosols) when coughing or sneezing (respiratory tract activity). Precautions related to the respiratory route of transmission are divided into: o Airborne precautions for particles (aerosols) <5 \u00b5m e.g. TB o Droplet precautions for particles larger than > 5 \u00b5m e.g. N. meningitid is116,117 Transmission based precautions is based on risk assessment. Figure 1 7 outlines the principles and additional precautions for transmission based precautions. In summary: Contact precautions: protect hands and clothes. Airbo rne: remove airborne particles us ing negative pressure ventilation and N95 respirators Droplet: protect mucous membranes from droplets and fluid exposure Standard precautions and meticulous hand hygiene practices following the 5 Moments of Hand Hygiene wil l apply to ALL TYPES OF TRANSMISSION BASED PRECAUTIONS . 116CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions : Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Setting s, 2007. http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf 117Nulens, E., 201 8.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 116 Figure 17: Essential additional IPC practices for Transmission based Precautions. Note: Standard precautions and meticulous hand hygiene applies to all. A sign should be p laced on the door of patient areas where transmission -based precautions must be applied, to remind staff of the precautions they need to apply. If the patient has to be nursed on an open ward, the sign should be placed at the head of the patient's bed. A sign should be place d outside the patient area where transmission -based precautions are in place to remind staff of the precautions they need to apply. All signs must be removed after the patient has been discharged and terminal cleaning has been completed. 1. CONTACT PRECAUTIONS Contact precautions have to be applied when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed infections or colonisation with micro bes transmitted by direct or indirect contact. Conditions and/or organisms which require contact precau tions inclu de the following: Antimicrobial -resistant bacteria transmitted by contact such as, but not limited to methicillin - resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin -resistant Enterococci , as C. auris . Conditions: skin infections, diarrhoeal diseases. In addition, procedures such as wound dressing or where contact wit h faeces, urine, secretions or excretions is anticipated , necessitate contact precautions. Specific guidelines for contact precautions are shown in Table 34.

Figure 18: Poster for contact precautions PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 120 2. RESPIRATORY PRECAUTIONS: AIRBORNE PRECAUTIONS Airborne pathogens can be transmitted via aerosols and air currents. Diseases spread by airborne pathogens include: to the respiratory tract (pleura, trachea , etc.) Patients with extra pulmonary TB (e.g. TB bone) do not require isolation if PTB has been excluded. Negative pressure air handling (ventilation) is required for isolating patients diagnosed or suspected of being infected with the above organisms and should provide no less than 6 air changes per hour (ACH). Ideally , a private negative pressure isolation room with en su ite ablution facilities should be available within all facilitie s. In the absence of negative pressure ventilation and in out -patient settings or primary healthcare clinics , open the window and place a fan, facing the open window to direct the airflow towa rds the open window and to reduce the microbial burden in the en vironment . This should achieve around 6 -12 air changes per hour (ACH ). All health workers entering the room of a patient with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis should wear a fit -tested N95 r espirator or equivalent (see page 39) . If TB patients are accomm odated in an open ward due to lack of isolation facilities, the patient should wear a surgical mask at all times. In addition to adhering to SP at all times there are specific guidelines that must be followed as set out in Table 35. Adhere to Standard precau tions at all times . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 121 Table 35: Guidelines for airborne precautions123,124,125,126,127 Patient placement Place patient in single room with en suite bathroom Patient must be accommodated in a room with negative pre ssure ventilation where available or in a room with open windows if possible Keep door closed at all times Cohort patients with same diagnosis or mi cro-organism, but use single room for MDR/XDR -PTB cases Put up isolation sign: Airborne precautions Place c lean, unused PPE outside patient room Clinical notes should stay outside patient area Hand hygiene Perform HH according to the 5 Moments of HH HH has to be performed before donning and after removal of PPE Personal protective equipment All staff wearin g N95 respirators must have undergone a fit test to ensure that the correct size respirator is used to provide optimal protection N95 respirators are to be donned before entering the patient room Always perform a facial seal check after donning the respira tor, prior to entering Never share N95 respirators The N95 respirator can be used for the duration of one shift or until damp, contaminated or deformed Replace damp, soiled, contaminated or damaged respirators immediately Remove re spirator after exiting th e patient room and either store individual respirators in a marked paper bag outside the isolation room or discard in health care risk waste container Perfor m HH after removal If a N95 respirator does not fit properly, it is unsafe , even though it may prov ide a false sense of security A N95 respirator should not be worn by a patient whilst in isolation or during transportation outside the room.

Figure 19: Poster for airborne precautions PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 124 3. RESPIRATORY PRECAUTIONS: DROPLET PRECAUTIONS Large droplet nuclei do not remain suspend ed in the air for long periods and are only able to travel short distances. Transmission occurs when droplets containing micro bes generated from an infected person are propelled a short distance before they fall due to gravity, landing on surfaces surround ing the patient, contaminating the environment and come in contac t with another person's conjunctivae or mucous membranes (eyes, nose or mouth).Microbes transmitted by the droplet route include influenza and other respiratory viruses, mumps rubella, and Neisseria meningitid is, the cause of meningococcal meningitis. Some viruses and bacteria survive outside the body in the presence of mucous, serum and organic matter . Transmission from large droplets requires close contact (approximately 1 m) with the sourc e or through risk -prone procedures causing aeroli sation and splashes. Risk-prone procedures for droplet transmission in hospitals include: Coughing up or inducing sputum production for laboratory tests; collecting of throat swabs; Endotracheal suctioning (open and closed) of ventilated patients; Chest physiotherapy; Taking chest X -Rays from patients who are coughing, especially with poor cough etiquette; Bronchoscopy; Re-use of ventilator circuits and respiratory equipment; Washing and cleaning respiratory ventilation equipment in clinical areas without adequate knowledge or protection. In addition to adhering to SP at all times there are specific guidelines that must be followed as set out in Table 36. Adhere to Standard precautions at all times .

Built environment The built environment has a direct effect on the implementation of IPC practices and workflow . In most temperate climates natural ventilation is p referred with mechanically controlled ventilation for specialised areas only such as operating theatres , neonatal units, burns units and sterile preparation and decontamination areas . The environment and layout The air temperature, humidity and airflow in the health -care setting should provide a comfortable environment for patients, staff and carers. Adequate a irflow should be ensured to minimize the risk of transmission of airborne pathogens from infected patients and reduces risks to susceptible staff, p atients and carers. The air flow can be either natural air flow or mechanical airflow. Natural ventilation is almost always more effective than mechanical ventilation. Natural ventilation achieving more than 17 -40 air changes per hour, while well -functioni ng mechanical ventilation achieving 12 air changes per hour is recommended.137 There should be sufficient, preferably natural lighting, during daylight working hours and artificial lighting during evening 133Core questions and indicators for mon itoring WASH in health care facilities in the Sustainable Development Goals.

Buildings should be designed to be airy, light and allow workflow activities to minimize the spread of contamination by the movement of patients, staff and carers, equipment, supplies and contaminated ite ms, including health -care waste removal , and to facilitate good IPC practices . a. Patient clinical areas (wards , waiting areas, patient consulting rooms ) Health -care settings should be built, furnished and equipped with materials that minimize infectious disease transmission and facilitate cleaning. The floors should be continuous, smooth with the floor covering coving up the wall to 2.5 cm to facilitate cleaning. Carpets are not recommended in patient areas because these are difficult to clean and harbour pathogens. The walls should be smooth and washable. Tiles are not recommended as these are difficult to clean and get easily damaged due to the high wear and tear of a busy health facility. Layout The layout of all patient clinical areas shoul d minimise transmission of infectious pathogens . Sufficient space should be provided for people in wheelchairs, as well as to minimize infectious disease transmission. All surfaces must be made of material that is easy to clean and water resistant. There sh ould be a staff work station provided so that the clinical areas are not used for these purposes. In hospitals the allocation of the number of beds should not be more than six to eight per unit allowing for an unobstructed space of at l east 1.2m2 between beds to enable movement of carers and equipment .138 In high care areas, this distance should be increased to 2.5 metres between beds to allow for movement of equipment and to carry out aseptic procedures comfortably.139 In hospitals t here should be at least t wo isolation/ single rooms with en -suite ablution facilities per 24 beds. Only in hospitals that have designated i n infectious disease units, the number of isolation beds should increase to three or four per 24 beds depe nding on the disease profile of the community, such as high TB or diarrhoea . 138National Department of Health.

Available from https://www.who.int/infection -prevention/publications /core -components/en/ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 131 Handwash basins in hospitals should be placed outside the patient zone to avoid splashing and spread of pathogens. Hand wash b asins should be located nearest to the door. Ideally, the ratio of basins to beds is 1: 10, however in isolation rooms there should be one basin outside the entrance of the room. ABHR should be placed at the entrance of a clinical area and at the point of care .140 All consultation rooms should have a hand wash basin per room. For IPC purpose s, function al hand wash basins should be fitted with non -touch or elbow taps and provides a supply of clean running water . Hand wash basins should have a back splash made of impervious material that is easy to wash. Wall mounted s oap dispenser and single u se paper towels should be available . Furnishings There must be adequate clean surfaces around the patient's bed to allow carrying out aseptic procedures easily and to reduce contact with non sterile areas (procedure trolleys are preferred) . All furniture must be covered in material that can be easily cleaned and if necessary, disinfected. Chairs covered in impervious material should be provided for the patients and visitors to sit. Visitors should not sit on beds. There should be a bedside t able and a sepa rate over bed table used for clinical purposes. Ensure mattresses and pillows are covered with intact impervious chemical resistant covers for easy cle aning. Bed (privacy) curtains should be washable and should preferably be changed with eac h patient disch arge as part of the linen change. Procedure trolleys Procedure trolleys should have impervious and chemical resistant surfaces. It is preferable that all procedures are carried out using a procedure trolley that has been thoroughly cleaned and is dry. The trolley should be prepared in a clean area, and removed after use. Procedures should not be carried out using the patient's bed as a \"sterile\" work surface. However, in confined spaces, the overbed table maybe the only available surface and if used, must be cleared of clutter, wiped over with alcohol and allowed to dry before opening a sterile pack. 140Hopman et al.

Support Areas Staff rest ar eas: and meeting rooms are essential to ensure the well -being of staff as well as preserving valuable clinical space from being used for such purposes. Storage facilities : for linen , surgical consumables and equipment which is not in frequent use Sluice: There must be a separate sluice area for disposing of patient fluids, urine and faeces. This is a high -risk area for transmissio n of MDROs particularly gram negative bacteria from the patient's faeces and biofilm in the drains. It is highly recommended that bedpans, urinals and patient wash bowls are heat disinfected after each use to reduce transmission of MDROs . Utility room/SSD: Medical device s should not be cleaned in the ward or patient area. It is preferred that all reusable medical devices are sent to SSD for cleaning. However, if there is no alternative , cleaning should take place in a separate designated , closed, well venti lated area which should be fully equipped to fulf il the necessary requirements including a deep sink, running water, detergent used according to manufacturer's recommendations, cleaning brushes, and a drying area for the medical devices after cleaning. Th e staff must wear appropriate PPE . Used linen shou ld be stored in the utility room in a designated used linen trolley for removal to the laundry area or for collection by external laundry services. Healthcare waste: must be stored separately and not in the sluice area. Refer to section on health care waste management for the requirement of storage area for health care waste. Treatment room; for the preparation and storage of medicines, sterile equipment and sterile fluids, and procedure trolleys. The areas must be airy, clean and dry and must have storage facilities for sterile equipment and surgical packs. 2. Water The \"WHO standards for drinking water quality, sanitation and environmental health in health facilities should be implemented .141 International guidelines on sanitation (ISO/FDIS 30500 (2018)) should be followed when planning and executing water, sanitation and hygiene delivery. Quality monitoring of drinking water should be done by Environmental health practitioners. 141 Guidelines on Core Compone nts of infection prevention and control at the national and acute healthcare facility level. WHO 2016. Available from https://www.who.int/ infection -prevention/publications/core -components/en/ PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 133 Microbiological, chemical an d physical quality of drinking water supplies water must conform to the South African National Standards 241 for all domestic uses. A water quality -monitoring programme must be developed. All water supply including borehole and tankers , must b e protected f rom contamination. The temporary storage capacity should be sufficient for 2 days. Where bore hole water is being used in a health facility, at least 15 m horizontal distance and 1.5 m vertical distance between permeable faecal sludge containers and drinki ng-water sources is suggested. 142 Faecal sludge should not be discharged into an op en drain, water body or open ground. 3. Sanitation There must be adequate functioning toilet facilities which cater for staff and patients separately. Patient toilets shoul d be available for both genders and there must be provision for menstrual hygiene in female toilets. The WHO recommends one per 20 users for inpatient settings; at least four toilets per outpatient setting (one for staff, and for patients: one for females, one for males .143 More recently, the minimum number of toilets required to meet the criteria for a basic sanitation service is one toilet dedicated for staff and one gender -neutral toilet for patients that has menstrual hygiene facilities and is accessible for people with limited mobility.144 The number of toilets (sanitary fittings) for primary health facilities is determined using SANS 10400 -NBR based on the male and female population served. Adequate toilet and ablution facilities sh ould be provided at a hospital that meet the needs of patients, staff and visit ors.145 At least one functioning toilet and one handwash basin for not more than 20 in -patients, At least one functioning toilet and one handwash basin for not more than every 50 visitors. Separate toilet and hand washing facilities must be provided for staff members. 142Guidelines on Core Components of infection prevention and control at the national and acute healthcare facility level.

Staff required to sleep on the premises must be provided adequate wash up facilities, including a shower/bath. A drainage system must be in place and approved measures are utilized for the removal of waste water. An adequate supply or toilet paper, liquid soap and/or alcohol based hand rubs should be provided at every wash hand basin in the facility. 4. Operating theatre The surgi cal suite is usually divided into two desig nated areas: semi restricted and restricted , defined by the physical activities performed in each area. The semi -restricted area includes the peripheral support areas of the surgical suite, including storage areas for clean and sterile supplies, sterile pr ocessing rooms, scrub stations, and corridors leading to restricted areas. The semi -restricted area is limited to authorized personnel and to the patient. Surgical attire as well as headgear is recommended in this area. The restricted area is primarily i ntended to support a high level of asepsis control. In the restricted area, which includes the operating rooms and clean core, surgical attire, head covering, and masks are required where open sterile supplies or scrubbed persons are present. Operating rooms should be equipped with positive -pressure systems to ensure that air travels from operating room to adjacent areas, thus minimizing inflow of air to the room. This positive pressure system is challenged every time a door is opened. Ventilation of operating rooms should filter air at a minimum of 2 4 air changes/hour with fresh air. The temperature of operating rooms should be kept between 20\u00b0C - 24\u00b0C, with humidity of 30% to 60%.146 The inanimate theatre environ ment should make a negl igible contribution to the incidence of SSIs. Cleaning and disinfection of the operating theatre should follow a precise schedule: for example, floors should be cleaned once a day, and at the end of each session. Horizontal surfaces and all surgical items (e.g., tables, buckets) should be cleaned between 146 Clinical Issues.

Walls and ceilings are rarely heavily contaminated; therefore, cleaning them twice a year is reaso nable. For hospitals w ith limited resources, less expensive strategies to keep air in the operating room as clean as possible might include: Keep personnel to minimum in the OR during a procedure. Limit idle conversations as this creates dispersion of bac teria. Keep doors close d, and Keep entries into the operating room to a minimum during a procedure, as the opening/closing of doors can generate significant air currents and increase the probability of bacteria being deposited in the surgical site.147,148 Microbiological commissi oning and monitoring of operating theatre suites Commissioning Commissioning must occur before an operating theatre is first used and after any substantial modifications that may affect airflow patterns in pre -existing theatres (as par t of a re - commissioning process). It is important that the IPC team is involved at all stages from pre - design through to opening and that adequate time for commissioning is built in to the s chedule, including an allowance of time for microbiological assess ments (Particle count etc) . Contractual conditions should allow commissioning before handover of the theatre or have delayed acceptance after handover such that faults can be rectified. The theatre interior should be checked for obvious defects The air d istribution within the theatre and between rooms in the theatre suite should be checked by smoke tracing The air handling unit supplying, the theatre should be properly constructed, finishe d and functioning The air change rates in theatre and preparation room should be satisfactory (>20 ACH) Airborne microbial contamination in an empty theatre should be satisfactory 147Pokrywka M , Byers K .

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 136 Particle counts using a bio sampler should be done after filters have been changed Routine culturing of the operating room environment is unn ecessary because inanimate objects and surfaces are seldom the cause of SSIs. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 137 PART D SURVEILLANCE OF HEALTHCARE -ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 138 PART D: SURVEILLANCE HEALTHCARE -ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS Surveillance (of HAI ) is the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on the frequency of disease. It is essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practices and the timely dissemination of the data for public health action (pr event ion and control). A key step to mitigate AMR is to prevent HAIs from occurring. Successful implementation of infection prevention in health facilities can reduce HAIs .149 HAIs are the most common harmful patient safety incident related to hospitalisat ion an d have a major impact on morbidity, mortality and health care costs. The most common HAIs in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) were reported to be surgical site infections (SSI) (29%), followed by urinary tract infections (UTI) (24%), bloodstr eam fections (BSI) (19%) and hospital -acquired pneumonia (HAP) (15%).150,151 The most common pathogens causing HAI are ESKAPE (E. faecium, S. aureus, , National Institute for Communicable Diseases' (NICD) AMR report only covers ES KAPE from blood with drug combination s in line with international requirements GLASS for the publ ic and private sector. This is a sub -set of the HAI s that occur in health facilities . For on-going HAI surveillance , initially, point prevalence studies should be conducted in health facilities to establish a baseline. To prevent and reduce HAI , health facilities must provide clear guidance and training for the placement of invasive devi ces to reduce the risk of HAI s. 1. Classification of HAIs An infection is classified as a HAI if: It becomes clinically evident 48 hours after admission to the facility (on or after the third day of ad mission to the health facility where the day of admission is Day 1) . To establish t he origin of HAI s, ensure that the following are recorded in the patient's record : Appropriate history of the patient 's previous HAI. 149 National Department of Health.

The patient's admission date on the l aboratory request form . No evidence that an infection was present or incubating at the time of admission to the acute care setting or during the first two days after admission . Related to an intervention or procedure during admission . Includes infections acquired in the hospital, but appearing within 48 hours after discharge Within thirty (30) to ninety (90) days after surgery , depending on the type of surgery. Device -associated infections : with an invasive device suc h as a ventilator, central line or an indwelling urinary catheter are classified as healthcare -associated if: The device was in place for more than two calendar days prior to the infection An HAI occurring on the day of discontinuation of the device or the following calendar day is considered a device -associated infection if the device had already been in place for more than two calendar days. When classifying HAI take note of the following: Repeat infection Timeframe (RIT) is a 14-day period during which no new infections of the same type are reported , excluding surgical site infections . Additional pathogens cultured during the RIT for the same infection type are added to the event and regarded as one infective episode ; Infections occurring in new born bab ies on the first two days after birth are not usually considered an HAI unless it is a known HAI pathogen such as A baumannii , . Preoperative classification of surgical wounds according to United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) wound classification should be done as this will help gauge the risk of SSI. HAIs are classified as: Primary blood stream infections (BSI) , Central line -associated bloodstream infections ( or transplacental transmi ssion of viruses or bacteria is not considered HAI. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 140 Surgical site infections (SSI), and Ventilator -associated pneumonias (VAP)152 2. Standardised case d efinitions for HAIs Definitions of HAIs are adapted from CDC and Institute for Healthcare Improvement . This manual follows the CDC definitions as reference to classify infections as HAI or community acquired.153 See Table 37. Table 37: Standardised case definitions fo r HAIs rate Primary blood stream infections BSI case definition: The BSI is NOT related to an infection at another site and it meets one of the following criteria. Criterion 1: Recognized pathogen cultured from at least one blood culture, unrelated to i nfection at another site. OR Criterion 2: At least one o f: fever (>38\u00b0C core), chills, hypotension ; if aged < 1 year: fever (>38\u00b0C core), hypothermia (<36\u00b0C core), apnoea, or bradycardia AND common skin contaminant cultured from > 2 blood cultures drawn on separate occasions (within 48 hours of each other) , or at different sites, unrelated to infection at another site. Central line -associated bloodstream infections Central line: an intravascular catheter that terminates at or cl ose to the heart or in one of the great vessels (aorta, pulmonary artery, superior & inferior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, internal jugular veins, subclavian veins, external veins and common ili ac or femoral veins; neonates: umbilical artery or vein). Must be a lumened device which is used for infusion, withdrawal of blood or hemodynamic monitoring. May be temporary or permanent (e.g. dialysis tunnelled or implanted catheters, including ports)154 CLABSI is a laboratory -confirmed bloodstream infecti on where a central line or umbilical catheter was in place for more than two days prior to the development of signs and symptoms of infection AND A central line or umbilical line was in place on the date of the event (when infections were diagnose d or iden tified) or the day before. If a central line or an umbilical line was in place for more than two days and then removed, the classification of such infection must refer to the day or removal of the line or the next day Peripheral line -associated bloodstrea m infections A peripheral line was in place on the date of the event or the day before Patient has at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38\u00b0C), pain, erythema, or heat at involved vascular site Patient has purulent drainage at involved v ascular site Report infections of an intravascular cannulation site without organisms cultured from blood as Phlebitis Report intravascular infections with organisms cultured from the blood as PLABSI 152 Cent re for Disease Control and Prevention [Int ernet].

(Straight in -and-out catheters, condom catheters and supra -pubic catheters are not included in the definition.) CAUTI is an infection where an indwelling urinary catheter was in place for more than two days prior to the first signs and symptoms of infection OR if signs and symptoms of infections are not present there is a positive urine culture o f more than 100,000 CFU/ml with no more than two species of urine pathogens. AND An indwelling catheter was in place for more than two days and then removed. Signs and symptoms of infection must be present on the day of removal of the catheter or from the next day in order to the infection to be classified as a CAUTI Surgical site infections Surgical site infection is defined as an infection that occurs within 30 to 90 days after the operation and involves the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision (super incisional) and/or the deep soft tissue (for example, facia, muscle) of the incision (deep incisi onal) and/or any part of the anatomy (for example, organs and spaces) other than the incision that was opened or manipulate d during an operation (organ/ space). 155 NOTE: where decontamination of medical devices and operating theatre facilities are suboptimal, surgery associated infections should be considered. There are 3 categories of SSIs: Superficial Incisional Infection - involves only skin and subcuta neous tissue of incision. Patient has at least 1 of the following: a. Purulent drainage from superficial incision b. Microbes isolated from aseptically -obtained culture of fluid or tissue from superficial incision c. Sup erficial incision that spontaneous ly dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon and is culture -positive or not cultured. (A culture -negative finding does not meet criterion.)

How to c alculate HAI Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) CLABSI rates are calculated by dividing the total number of CL ABSI by the total number of central line days. This number must be multiplied by 1000 to get a rate per 1000 central line days No of CLABSI infections x 1000 Total number of central line days = rate of CLABSI infection/ 1000 days Counting central line days Central line days are counted from the day of insertion of the device (day one) until the date of removal. Every day that the device is in situ needs to be counted to identify the total number of device days Only one central line per patient is counted per calendar day regardless of the number of central lines present. All central lines on inpatie nt units should be included in device day counts regardless of access156 If a central line is removed and re -inserted on the same da y, the central line day count should be continued If more than one calendar day pass es before a new central line is inserted, the count should start from one again Peripheral IV line infection Rates calculated by the number of pe ripheral lines inserted o ver a period of time, such as one month, divided by the number of peripheral sites recorded as infected x 100. The result is expressed as a percentage Number of infection x 100 Total number of peripheral lines inserted = infection rate as a percentage CAUTI CAUTI rates are calculated by dividing the total number of CAUTIs by the total number of catheter days 156https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/pscmanual/4psc_clabscurrent.pdf PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 143 This number must be multiplied by 1000 to get a rate per 1000 catheter days No of CAUTI infections x 100 0 Total number of catheter days = rate of CAUTI infection/ 1000 catheter days Counting catheter days Catheter days are counted from the day of insertion of the device (day one) until the date of removal. Every day that the device is in situ needs to be counted to identify the total number of device days If a catheter is removed and re -inserted on the same day, the catheter day count should be continued If more than one calendar day passes (the next day) before a new catheter is inserted, the count shoul d start again from one Surgical site infections SSI rates are calculated by dividing the total number of SSIs by the total number of operative procedures (or by category of operation) This number must be multiplied by 1000 to get a rate per 100 operative procedures No of SSI x 100 Total number of operative procedures = rate of SSI infection/ 100 operative procedures Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) VAP rates are calculated by dividing the total number of VAP cases by th e total number of ventilator days. This number mu st be multiplied by 1000 to get a rate per 1000 ventilator days No of VAP Cases x 1000 Total number of ventilator days = rate of CAUTI infection/ 1000 ven tilator day Ventilator days are counted from the day of insertion of the device (day one) until the date of removal. Every day that the device is in situ needs to be counted to identify the total number of device days Rate is an expression of the frequ ency with which an event (e.g., an infection) occurs in a defined population in a given time period. Rate always includes time as a part of its expression. A constan t is used to put the result into a uniform quantity so comparisons between rates can be mad e. The constant is selected based on how frequ ently the event occurs; generally, it is globally agreed upon. For example, SSI or peripheral IV infection is expressed as percentages (per 100), CAUTI as number of urinary tract infection per 1,000 catheter -days, and hand hygiene compliance as percentage of hand hygiene opportunities. To summarize, there are three important things to remember when calculating a rate: The numerator and denominator must reflect the same population \u2014cases that are in the numerator must also be counted in the denominator. All cases in the denominator are eligible to be considered for the numerator. Counts in the numerator and denominator must cover the same time period. (APIC 2014b) PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 144 These rates can be used as indicators of mo nitoring HAI. Bundle compliance rates can be calculated based on the patients receiving all components of the bundle/ total patients with a device in situ or had surgery on the day of the sample x 1000. For SSI rates, various categories of surgery can also be calculated using a particular type of su rgery as a denominator. 4. Infection control bundles of care for the prevention of HAIs A bundle is a structured way of improving the processes of care and patient outcomes. They consist of a small, straightforward set of evidence -based practices \u2014 generally three to five \u2014 that, when performed collectively and reliably, have been proven to i mprove patient and prevent the development of HAIs. The following descriptions of infection control bundles are sourced from B estCare -Always !157 Principles for implementing infection control bundl es: Compliance to the bundles is important to ensure the desired outcomes. Checklists are used to record the elements of care rendered. Guides the person performing the task and serves as a reminder of the essential steps required to prevent infection. Compliance must be assessed and measured on a regular basis. Non-compliant el ements must be addressed in order to reduce infections and improve patient outcomes. Both process and o utcomes measures have to be monitored a. Prevent central -line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) Ninety percent of catheter -related blood stream infections occur with central venous catheters 157Based on the Best Care... Always! Bundles, av ailable from www.bestcare.org.za Remember: Principles of asepsis such as hand hygiene, appropriate PPE, and setting up and main taining a clean or sterile field are essential for all aseptic procedures and when applying bundles. All elements of the bundle must be executed together to get maximum compliance . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 145 (CVCs) . CLABSI prolong hospitalisation by a mean of seven days . CLABSI mortality (controlled for underlying severity) is between 4% and 20% . The odds ratio for developing CLABSI was 2.2 - 6.6 times greater without maximum barrier precautions and aseptic procedures . Intervention: There are key elements contained i n the CLABSI Bundle : o Hand hygiene o Set up a sterile field, wearing sterile gloves and gown; face cover ; o Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis of the insertion site ; o Optimal catheter insertion site selected after weighing infection risk* and possible complications ; o Daily review of necessity for line, prompt removal of unnecessary central lines . *The subclavian route has the lowest risk of infection; the femoral site the highest (especially in obese adult patients) Other evidence -based element s of care are not exclud ed and may be added to the Central Line Bundle by individual facilities, for example: The type of CV catheter - triple lumen , use of three way taps, multi -flow. Line is secured . Dressing is clean and intact . b. Prevent catheter -associated urinary tract infect ions (CAUTI) Urinary tract infections account for approximately 40% of all HAIs annually and 80% of these can be attributed to indwelling catheters. Duration of catheterisation is directly related to risk of developing a urinary tract infection. Although CAUTIs are not usually life -threatening, a complication of a CAUTI (e.g. urethritis, urethral strictures, haematur ia, bladder obstruction, and sepsis secondary to the UTI) does cause suffering and can increase a patient's length of stay and costs . Applicat ion of accepted evidence -based prevention guidelines has led to considerable reductions in CAUTI rates. Intervention: There are key elements contained in the CAUTI Bundle (\"Bladder Bundle\"): Avoid unnecessary urinary catheters . Insert urinary catheters usi ng aseptic technique and maintain a closed system of drainage . 158 Maintain urinary catheters based on re commended guidelines . Review urinary catheter necessity daily and remove promptly . 158 World Health Organization. How to insert an indwelling catheter. Available from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a4aNFJoZdQ&feature=youtu.be PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 146 The bundle elements are not exclusive and other scientifically proven elements of available evidence -based guidelines can be added by each individual health facility. c. Prevent surgical site infections(SSI)159 A one -day point prevalence survey was conducted at a t ertiary hospital in Northern Cape, South Africa in 2016. The stu dy included all patients who were admitted to 15 selected wards at the hospital . The Standardised Centers for Disease Control and National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Systems criteria were used . A total of 326 patients were surveyed and the overall HCAI prevalence rate was 7.67% , with SSIs predominant at 4.60% . This rate was c omparable to studies done in other countries and shows a similar trend with predominance of SSI .160 . Intervention: There are 4 components of the SSI Bundle: 1. Appropriate use o f prophylactic antibiotics (including appropriate selection, timing and duration/ discontinuation) . 2. Appropriate hair removal: Avoid shaving; where depilation is necessary, use of clippers or depilatory creams . 3. Maintain post -operative glucose control (*for major cardiac surgery patients cared for in an ICU) . 4. Post-operative normothermia (** for all open abdominal surgery patients). *Glucose control: Review of evidence shows that the degree of hyperglycaemia in the postoperative period correlates with the rate of SSI in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. Although glucose control may benefit other surgical populations, for the BCA Campaign, this measure will apply only to the cardiac surgery population for the purposes of national measurement. **Normothermia: Evidence suggests that patients have a deceased risk of surgical site infection if they are not allowed to become hypothermic during the perioperative period. Although temperature control may benefit other surgical populations, for the BCA C ampaign, this measure will only apply to the colorectal or open abdominal surgical population for the purposes of measurement of compliance. Additional evidence -based components of good quality surgical care may be added by each individual health facility . Compliance with the SSI bundle has been most successful when all elements are executed together. Detailed tools are available to support the prevention of 159 World Health Organization.

Prevent ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) in adults Ventilator -associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of four commone st cause s of HAI associated mortality . Intervention: There are key elements contained in the VAP bundle o Elevate the head of the bed to 45 degrees when possible, otherwise attempt to maintain the head of the bed greater than 30 degrees ; o Daily evaluation of readiness for extubation ; o Subglottic se cretion drainage ; o Oral care and decontamination with chlorhexidine (0,5%) ; o Initiation of safe enteral nutrition within 24 - 48 hours of ICU admission . 5. Surveillance Surveillance for HAIs is a systematic way to gath er information (data) to describe the occurrence and distribution of HAIs. HAI surveillance includes the collection, compilation, analysis, interpretation, and distribution of information about HAIs. . In other countries, national surveillance for HAIs, inc luding mechanisms for tim ely feedback, has led to significant reductions in HAI rates. 162 The steps required for implementing HAI surveillance: (See Figure 21)163 A standardised surveillance model for HAIs is essential to: Establish the baseline of HAIs in t he hospital - either through point prevalence surveys (PPS) or laboratory reports from the hospital laboratory or from the N ationa ICD dashboard and identifying the most relevant AMR patterns .

However, since the principles of IPC apply to all outbreaks, should it be necessary, IPC support to community outbreaks m ay be offered. Prevention and control of epidemic prone communi cable diseases remains a priority in South Africa. Again the emergence of unknown/novel pathogens and re -emergence of infectious diseases of epidemic potential, continue to pose a threat to the health of our communities. In order to contain and minimise th eir impact, alertness and epidemic preparedness is critical. The National Guidelines on Epidemic Preparedness and Response aim to assist health care workers responsible for communi cable diseases control in improving epidemic preparedness and rapid response strategies so as to reduce morbidity, mortality and disability due to infectious diseases. For further details on the roles and responsibilities of outbreak response teams /committ ees and the process to follow to investigate disease outbreak s (Figure 22), refer to the National Guideline.168 168 National Department of Health. National Guidelines on Epidemic Pr eparedness and Response. Pretoria. 2009 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 154 Figure 22: Steps to investigate an outbreak Once the final steps in the process described above are complete and the source of the outbreak has been determined, it is vital to share learnings and revise standard operating procedures accordingly. In South Africa the following notifiable medical conditions are the most important disease s that contribute to outbreaks in health facilities (refer to notifiable medical condition sectio n. Notifiable conditions are not limited to these below) : Measle s, Multi Drug Resistant Gram Negative Bacilli (MDR Carbapenemase Resistant Enterobacteriacae (CRE), section on contact precautions, p115) , 1.The team 2. is there an outbreak? 3. verify diagnosis 4. case definition 5. find cases & line list 6. descriptive epidemiology & hypothesis7. evaluate hypothesis8 IPC & containment measures9. communicate findings10. maintain surveillance & vigilance PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 155 Viral haemorrhagic fever s (VHF) (Amongst these include Crimean -Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) which is endemic in South Africa and Ebola virus diseases (EVD), Marburg, Lassa fever and Lujo virus although not endemic, have been imported into South Africa on occasion. Noso comial transmission of VHFs is well described in South African hospitals and health care settings. Food and water -borne diseases, e .g. gastro enteritis, cholera (see section on contact precautions, p115), TB and respiratory pathogens (see the National Depa rtment of Health and WHO's tuberculosis infection prevention and control guidelines169). At clinics and community health centres, managers should be aware of the current infectious diseases in the community and those that may be expected to present at their facilities. Patients suspected of infectious diseases such as viral haemorrhagic fever should be immediately placed in a room which has been designated for high-risk isolation (when and if required) according to the health facility/district's standard ope rating procedu re. The appropriate PPE should be worn when treating these suspect patients. Patients should be transferred to a designated referral hospital via an ambulance as soon as possible , according to provincial/organisational protocols . The ambulanc e team and the hospital management of the receiving hospital must be informed of the suspected diagnosed so that they may take proper precautions and make preparations for receiving the patient . Standard and transmission -based precautions sh ould be follo wed when treating patients with notifiable medical conditions. 169National Department of Health.

Table 38 sets out the IPC procedures for management of measles. Table proc edures What is measles? Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus. Symptoms of measles include fever , a blotchy widespread rash and runny nose , cough and red eyes . Who is affected? Mostly young children, but adults may also be affected, if non-immune or immunocompromised How is it spread? Via breathing, coughing or sneezing (AIRBORNE) Measles is so contagious that anyone exposed to it who is not immune will probably get the disease (secondary attack rate > 90%) How can infection with mea sles be prevented? Airborne precautions AND Isolation OR cohorting during outbreaks Measles is a vaccine preventable illness Period of infection risk? Incubation period: 8 -12 days from exp osure to measles onset. Contagious period: 3 -5 days before rash u ntil 4 days after rash appears. Immune - compromised patients have prolonged virus excretion. Recommendations for PATIENTS with measles Patient placement Prioritise measles patients for single room isolation Cohort isolate if multiple cases Do not transf er patients to other wards or clinical areas Equipment Do NOT share equipment between patients e.g. oxygen saturation probe Precautions Institute AIRBORNE precautions (see Transmission based Precautions ) Display warning sign on door Keep the door to the room CLOSED at all times Recommendations for HEALTH WORKERS working with measles Immunity All staff must know their measles immunity status Precautions for staff Health care professional s who are immune may nurse the patient. Staff who are either pre gnant or are unsure of their immune status should avoid contact with measles unless wearing appropriate PPE. If possible, they should work in another clinical area for the duration of the outbreak. Refer pregnant staff members with measles exposure to Occ upational Health. Personal protective equipment (PPE) Face masks are NOT necessary for health workers who are immune to measles but may be worn as part of the Airborne Precaution protocol Wear gloves when dealing directly with patients or carrying out procedures Wear aprons when in contact with respiratory s ecretions or mucous membranes Discard PPE immediately in the red plastic lined HCRW box 170 Western Cape Department of Health.

Pretoria. November 2018 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 158 Much of this resistance is carried on genetic material (plasmid) that passes rapidly between differe nt species of GNB such as Escherichia coli pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii . The main IPC concern is that CRE illustrate resistance to drugs of last resort, such as carbapenems , e.g. meropenem, imipenem and ertapenem which are commonly us ed in the intensive care units. Further, the se also confer resistance to non --lactam antibiotics, like the fluoroquinolones, sulphonamides and aminoglycosides . Colonisation of humans and the environ ment occurs readily in the healthcare settin g and infections caused by these MDROs become difficult to tre at. GNB are carried in the gut of the colonised patients and the WHO advises rectal swab screening on all patients admitted to the health facility as a preventative measure however this has not yet been universally accepted in South Africa . 174 The WHO Imple mentation guidelines to contain CRE175 are summarised below. Transmission can be rapid and occurs via direct contact such as hands of staff or patie nts and contact with colonised sites such as the gut, skin or the environment and poorly decontaminated patie nt care articles. 174 Guidelines for the prevention and co ntrol Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017. 175 Implementation manual to prevent and control the spread of carbapenem -resistant organ isms at the national and health care facility level. Geneva: World He alth Organization; 2019 (WHO/UHC/SDS/2019.6) The containment requires meticulo us IPC contact precautions for as long as the patient is in hospital. GNB are destroyed by heat or chemicals and therefore it is essential that any patient with MDR GNB must be isolated with contact precautions and all body fluids and faeces should be di sposed of in a functioning bedpan washer disinfector or macerator or co vered with a hypochlorite solution at 1000 ppm and left for 30 minutes before disposal into a sewer. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 159 IPC Procedures for GNB , see Table 39 Table 39: MDRO: IPC procedures What is MDRO MDRO refers to gram negative and gram positive multiple drug resistant organisms, but mainly GNB. The types of resi stance encountered are ESBL and CRE but resistance to other classes of antibiotics are also found. Who is affected? MDRO are most commonly found in health facilities particularly high care (ITU) patients who have undergone invasive procedures such as sur gery, indwelling venous and urinary catheters. Many of them would have been exposed to antibiotics How is it spread? Via contact with contaminated hands of HCWs, and medical devices. Indirectly through contact with inadequately cleaned environmental surfa ces or disinfected bedpans and urinals and patient care articles.. How can infection with measles be prevented? Contact precautions (CP) applied as soon a s possible after risk assessment and isolate the patient if possible Inform the HCW about implement ing CP Take advice from IPC team regarding disinfection of the environment and terminal cleaning after the patient has been discharged If well, discharge patient as soon as possible, and terminally clean the isolation facility The bedpans and urinals desig nated to the patient for the length of admission (no sharing), are heat disinfected or at the very least thoroughly cleaned and wiped over with 70% alcohol. Period of infection risk? Incubation period: unknown; some reports suggest as soon as 24 hours po st admission Contagious period: as long as patient is in the health facility. May carry up to 2 -3 months post discharge Recommendations for PATIENTS with MDRO (CRE) Patient placement If possible place patient in a single room If not, cohort with full c ontact precautions for each patient in the bay Do not transfer patients to other wards or clinical areas Equipment Do NOT share equipment between patients e.g. oxygen saturation probe Precautions Institute CONTACT precautions (see Transmission based Pre cautions ) Display warning sign on door Keep the door to the room CLOSED at all times Recommendations for HEALTH WORKERS working MDRO (CRE) Precautions for staff IPC team to visit the clinical area and ensure CP signage is clearly displayed Hand hygiene is reinforced Health workers must be reminded of CONTACT PRECAUTIONS particularly hand hygiene Set up line list Daily follow up by IPC team Personal protective equipment (PPE) Wear gloves when dealing directly with patients or carrying out procedures Wear aprons when in contact with the patient Discard PPE immediately in the red plastic lined HCRW box Apply hand disinfection by washing with soap and water OR alcohol hand rub, after each patient or surface contact Staff allocation If possible, assign t he same staff per shift to each affected area Recommendations for VIS ITORS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 160 Restrict visitors to close family only Staff to explain precautions to visitors on admission/reinforce daily Ensure sufficient PPE for parents/visitors i.e ABHR, soap, water, paper towels, masks Ensure parents/visitors' compliance with precautions and correct where needed Recommendations for CLEANING All waste Place all waste in a container INSIDE the isolation area.

IPC protocols in Referral Unit180 Note: Isolation facility refers to the hospitals that are designated receiving hospitals for VHF. Isolation unit refers to the suite of rooms in a VHF isolation hosp ital dedicated for management of a VHF patient - usually consisting of an administration/rest area, ante -room, patient isolation room, stock room, waste storage area, decontamination area, etc. Isolation room refers to the room in which the patient wit h a VHF is nursed Step 1: IPC person on call: check all protocols and checklists are up to date The IPC team will be informed of a transfer or admission of a suspected or known case of VHF . Checklists for ensuring safety of the health worker are paramount . See Appendix E. All staff working or entering the VHF UNIT will change into scrub suits and closed toed foo twear without exception . All policies must be followed meticulously . Step 2: Isolation The patient will be admitted directly to the VHF Isolation Faci lity o The patient will be admitted to a single isolation room with a hand -wash basin and en - suite facilities . o The door must remain closed at all times.

Negative pressure ve ntilation is desirable. o Engineering check of the ventilation in the unit must be recorded regularly to ensure the isolation unit is always ready to receive a patient. o Where a w asher disinfector is available for the ward , it must be checked and its performa nce recorded . o The following will be placed in the isolation room before the patient arrives : HCRW containers ; Sharps container on the wall but also on the procedure trolley : o Procedure trolley containing all the necessary equipment to take blood safely, put up intra -venous fluid administration, and dress wound s, including sterile cotton wool and gauze /other dressings. Resuscitation trolley with equipment in centres at designat ed sites ; Safety engineered devices to administer medicines and draw blood ; Thermo meter - disposable or electronic ; Alcohol rub must be placed near the patient's bedside . Step 3: Personal Protective Equipment Any suspected patient - high level PPE N95 respirators - fitted to face by pushing down and sealing nasal and face contou rs. Eye shield - visors or goggles are recommended . Fluid resistant gowns or coveralls . Coveralls must include neck protection, seam and zip protection. Double l atex or nitrile gloves - first pair underneath the coverall /gown sleeve cuff, the second pair o f gloves over the sleeves. Head gear - fluid-resistant, if coverall does not have an attached hood. Wear PPE FROM THE PACK PROVIDED ONLY I F ENTERING THE ISOLATION ROOM - DISCARD IN THE DOFFING AREA. A buddy must assist with the donning and doff ing of PPE. The buddy checks that no skin is exposed after donning PPE and that there are no breaks or tears i n the PPE. The risk of self -contamina tion occurs during the doffing process. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 164 Disposable knee -high, fluid-resistant overboots, if coverall does not have \"socks\" attached. Ensure disposable overboots do not have seams underneath the so le. Alternatively, white gumboots may be worn, which will have to be decontaminated after each use in a 5% hypochlorite solution. (See Appendix B). Step 4: T aking blood and other samples for laboratory Two people should carry out thi s procedure . Both should be dressed in full VHF protective gear. Outer gloves must be nitrile as hands (gloves) will need to be disinfected with 0.5% hypochlorite solution prior to the sterile procedure. Take the prepared pack containing all the necessary sample tubes, tourniquet, swabs and SED needles and syringes, sharps container and checklist of what bloods to take and place on the procedure trolley in the isolation room. Checklist referred to is the l ist of bloods to be taken, which must be determined by the expert VHF microbiologist on call. Enter the room with the procedure trolley . One person opens the pack and lays up the trolley with all the necessary equipment and sample containers. Check the lis t. Second person prepares to take bloods .

Notification of certain medical conditions i n South Africa is based on the Health Act, 1977 (Act No. 63 of 1977 : Regulation 1434: Regulation relating to the surveillance of the control of notifiable medical conditions . Regul ations on Notifiable Medical Conditions prescribe the diseases in South Afri ca that need to be notified by every health care provider and how soon after clinical diagnosis this information is required for each condition to break the cycle of transmission .181 This section provides a summary of the reporting system. a. Why notify? International Health Regulations (IHR) and the South African National Health Act require rapid detection, notification and prompt risk assessment of public health risks to enable timely and targeted public health response. Notifications serve as early war ning signs for possible outbreaks hence enable efficient public health actions to contain or prevent such outbreaks. Notifications provide empirical data required to monitor disease distribution and trends and identify populations at risk, and for policy d ecisions. b. Who should notify a Notifiable Medical Condition ( NMC )? Every doctor or nurse (health care provider) who diagnoses a patient with any one of the NMC. c. Where to obtain information on how to report NMC? The National Standard Operating Proced ure with flow chart, case definitions and case investigation forms are available from www.health.gov.za . The NMC Notification booklet from the NMC focal person at the province/d istrict. d. What and when to report NMC? NMCs are categorised into four categories, i.e. category 1 , 2, 3 and 4 . See Table 41. 181 National Department of Health . Regulations Relating to the Surveillance and the Control of Notifi able Medical Conditions . Government Gazette R1434. 15 December 2017. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 170 NMCs r eported by health facilities: Category 1 NMC are conditions that require immediate reporting by the most rapid means available upon clinical or laboratory di agnosis followed by a written or electronic notification to the Department of Health within 24 hours of diagnosis by health care providers. Category 2 NMC are conditions that must be notified through a written or an electronic notification to the Departme nt of Health within 7 days of diagnosis. NMCs Reported by private and public laboratories: Category 3 and 4 .

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 172 PART H EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL STAFF PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIO N MANUAL 173 PART H: EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF STAFF AND IPC STAFF IPC e ducation of the health workforce is essential to ensure patient and health worker safety. An effective IPC programme can reduce HAI, thereby driving down the health costs in the institutions. In 2010, an HAI in a general ward cost between R25,000 - R50,000 (unpublished data, S Mehtar); an HAI in the ICU cost ten times more these included direct and indirect costs of hospital stay, investigations, antimicrobial therapy and medical devices, extra staff and PPE needed to care for such patients. By understanding the basics of transmission, all health workers can contribute towar ds reducing HAI by implementing simple yet effective IPC measures. The WHO identifies three groups requiring training. 1) IPC staff; 2) health care professionals ; 3) support (non -clinical) health work force including administrators, sterile services, cleaners, and porters. A national IPC curriculum for these groups includes the link nurse programme which runs in South Africa is shown below . The National Qualification Framework (NQF) (2017) details the necessary level of qualification for the workforce as stipulated in various legislation shown below which apply to the IPC training programmes outlined in this document. Higher Education Act (Act 10 1 of 1997) Skills Development Act (Act 97 of 1998) General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act (Act 58 of 2001) NQF Act (Act 67 of 2008) White Paper for Post -school Education and Training (Department of Higher Education and Trainin g, 2013) . Under graduate Basic IPC should be incorporated into all health pre -curriculum training including, medical students, nurses, occupational health, physiotherapists, pharmacist, radiographers , EMS and allied health professionals. The curriculum s hould include : Microbes and their transmission Methods of preventing transmission PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 174 o SP including : HH appropriate use of personal protective equipment patient placement disinfectant use sterilization and medical devices decontamination safe handling of linen and laundry health care waste management respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette environmental cleaning principles of asepsis prevention of injuries from sharp instruments and post -exposure prophylaxis o Transmission based precautions . Risk assessment . Training must be delivered by IPC trained tutors with knowledge grounded in the most recently available evidence Post graduate Training in IPC should progress from the essential (basics) to the specialized. IPC is a process which encompasses healthcare p rocedures but also requires management, communication & writing, feedback and skills to design layout of health facilities to red uce transmission as part of a multimodal improvement strategy. The table below outlines the topics which should be covered star ting with the basic curriculum and progressively becoming more complex, requiring in -depth knowledge at Postgraduate diploma in I PC (PDIC ) level ( Table 42; Figure 23). This training should be provided for all health workforce who are working in health and should be updated regularly. All training must be certified for competence by a recognised body or institution. The proposed step wise structure for the national IPC curriculum in South Africa consist s of a basic IPC curriculum , Intermediate , Fundamentals for IPC (FIPC) and PDIC. See Figure 23. In service training IPC education must be provided regularly to all health workers during their employment. Some of this on the job training is provided during clinical ward rounds, or visits to areas of the health PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 175 facility. A record of all in service training should show att endance and topics discussed. Hand hygiene is a very common example of in -service training. Figure 23: Proposed step wise structure for national IPC curriculum, South Africa 1. Basic IPC knowledge for all health workers This level of training is usually delivered to all clinical practitioners including nurses and doctors, allied healthcare professional, support services and ancillary workers. All health workers should be trained in the basics of IPC such as HH, SP and transmis sion- based precautions. They should also be able to evaluate risk when carrying out procedures, understand the basics of surveillance data and outcomes. They should recognize the consequences of no ncompliance with preventative measures such as clean envi ronment, safely processed patient care articles and decontamination of medical devices. Finally, they should be responsible for their personal health, protection through vaccination and appropriate u se of PPE, and the impact on their personal wellbeing. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 176 Basic IPC curriculum NQF level : 5 Time spent per course : 40 hours Credits : 4 credits Entry level qualification: matric or equivalent (RPL accepted) The curriculum should be delivered as a combination of didactic lectures and practical support including ward rounds, group discussion and case studies on the following topics: Microbes, pathogens and routes of transmission ; Zones of patient care.

Link nurses can also be used to create 182 National Departmen t of Health. South African antimicrobial resistance national strategy framework; a one health appr oach 2018 - 2024. Pretoria PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 177 a \"pool\" of possible IPC practitioners in future with further development and ensure continuity in IPC through successor planning. Additional for Intermediate Level curriculum In addition to the basic course , link nurses should learn how to evaluate IPC practices at ward level, carry out audits of essential practices such as HH, environmental cleaning, compliance to transmission -based precautions, knowledge about basic surveillance and identification of l central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI), catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) , reporting of notifi able medical conditions . They should learn how to interpret surveillance data and to develop interventions to reduce HAIs, togethe r with the nursing team and prepare simple IPC reports for discussion with the IPC team and nurse management. Healthcare managers Managers should provide support for IPC prog rammes at national and health facility level, including dedicated budgets, appr opriate cost -effective procurement measures, and understand the cost of HAIs and implement measures to drive down costs by improving IPC and reducing AMR. Healthcare Managers' curriculum NQF level : 5/6 Time spent per course : 40 hours Credits : 4 credits Entry level qualification: none The curriculum for managers should include elements of the Basic IPC course with an emphasis on cost effective measures and leadership.

IPC Practitioners national curriculum Newly appointed IPC practitioners should attend competency -based training courses within one year of taking up th eir post. They should be competent in evidence -based IPC practices. They should be able to provide mentorship to the health facility workforce towards preventing transmission of HAI pathogens, and implementation skills towards reducing AMR through surveil lance and feedback, monitoring and evaluating IPC systems through audit and feedback, while ensuring high quality service delivery. 3. Fundamenta ls in IPC (FIPC) (short course) NQF level : 6/7 Time spent per course : 6 months Credits : 60 credits Entry level qu alification: diploma or degree in a relevant specialty. A six -month part time course which ensures IPC competence, mentorship and implementation skills. Infectious disease, paediatrics and neonatal clinical teams will also benefit from such training. The curriculum should cover topics included in the basic IPC course but more in depth with practical clinical ward rounds, group discus sion and case studies. This course should cover the following : Microbes and routes of transmission.

Specialised courses relating to IPC There should be IPC related courses run for specialities in other fields emphasizing reduction of transmission of pathogens through best practice. Decontamination of medical devices (sterile services) All health workers working with the reprocessing of medical devices should be trained. The Sterile Services Department is pivotal to the health facilit y and contributes towards reducing surgical site infection and infection caused by invasive procedures. T he reprocessing of sterile medical devices should be to the highest standard and each step and cycle must have evidence of validation. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 181 Basic course in decontamination Level: operators or nurses who work in reprocessing any medical device (Decontamination U nit or Sterile Services Department) NQF level: 5 Duration: five to ten days Topics: o Transmission of microbes o Personal protection o Workflow in decontami nation o Point of use cleaning o Cleaning methodology o Inspection, assembly and packaging o Sterilization - steam or chemical o Storage and transportation Advanced course in Decontamination The courses must be accredited by a recognised body or organisation.

Other IPC related courses Engineering and the built environment including WASH IPC should be part of the project teams when building a new health facility or renovating an existing one. IPC education of engineers, architects and building designers on the requirements for good vent ilation, WASH184, infrastructure including IPC facilities such as HH requirements185, isolation facilities186. A short course lasting five-days should be adequate to cover most of these topics. Train the trainers Training others is an integral part of IPC training and knowledge transfer. A short 5 day course for those who are required to train others in IPC is recommended. The attendees should have at least attended the basic IPC course and will be instructed in methods of adult learning. Pharmacy Most phar macy courses include some elements of IPC such as conditions during preparation of sterile fluids, mixing of drugs as well as checking on prescription charts for antibiotic prescribing. The course should also cover chemicals used in cleaning and HH, the us e of disinfectants and supporting AMS practices and IPC programmes . Food and catering The food preparation areas should be trained in hygienic practices during food storage, preparation, transportation to the wards, reprocessing used cutlery and crockery, maint aining a 184 Core questions and indicators for monitoring WASH in health care facilities in th e Sustainable Development Goa ls.

Care of cleaning equipment, colour coding, managing waste containers and occupational health requirements must be included in a five -day certified cou rse. On the job training and practical demonstrations are essential for all groups. 7. On the job training The IPC team should provide on the job training with a NO BLAME culture during clinical ward rounds or site visits, as part of the audit or assessment during the visits. This training could be related to any clinical or non -clinical matters requiring attention. Step wise training Table 4 2 summarises the topics which will be covered in each level for IPC training. Some topics such as standard precautions (SP) are covered as concepts at the basic level but in more depth and deeper understanding of what SP means, how it differs from Transmission based precautions and how SP should be implemented. For example, at the Basic level (X) micro biology will cover what microbes are a nd how they are transmitted. At PDIPC level (XXX) the students will be expected to go to the laboratory, look at gram stains, agar plates with growth on them, antibiograms and understand results produced by the various automated systems. At Basic Level the students will cover microbiology and transmission in one day, whilst for PDIPC that section will take two weeks!

Regular feedback promotes best practices and over time results in behaviour or system change towards improved quality of care and patient safety, with a goal to reduce HAI and AMR through a MMS approach. As an example, Best Care, Alway s! Implementing bundles of care programme in South Africa has reduced HAI in some public and private hospitals where it was implemented . 187 Monitoring and feedback is also aimed at engaging stakeholders, creating partnerships and developing working groups an d networks. As part of quality improvement, monitoring, audit and feedback is an important tool for informing and convincing health workers and managers of an existing problem and the correct and appropriate solutions. This should take place in a blame free environment. The WHO developed a five-step cycle of improvement to support guideline implementation which is grounded in the principles of successful change and improvement in health care. Step four of the cycle is t o evaluate the impact of the improveme nt, thus using the data collected to drive improvement and implement changes where required .

Although products used for hand -washing in healthcare PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 190 may contain various types of detergents, the term \"soap\" will be used to refer to such detergents in these guidelines. Deep cleaning: Deep cleaning (often referred to as spring cleaning ) involves cleaning walls, ventilation shafts and storage areas, floors, windows, ceilings, etc in all clinical and non -clinical areas . In some situations, temporary closure of such areas is required whilst deep cleaning is taking place . In clinical areas, medical equipment has been appropriately moved and or disconnected. Disinfectant: Antimicrobial agents that are applied to non -living objects to destroy micro - organisms, excluding spores. T hey are used on inanimate objects (furniture and the environment) and surfaces because they have adverse effects on living tissue. Disinfection : Process of removing microorganisms except spores. Efficacy/efficacious: The (possible) effect of the applicati on of a chemical such as HH formulation when tested in laboratory or in vivo s ituations. Effectiveness/effective : The clinical conditions under which a HH product has been tested for its potential to reduce the spread of pathogens, e.g. field trials. EMS: An organisation or body that is dedicated, staffed and equipped to operate a n ambulance, medical rescue vehicle or medical response vehicle in order to offer emergency care Endogenous flora : Bacteria which reside within the human body. Exogenous flora : Bacteria which do not reside within the body and are usually found in the environment or have been introduced by other means such as hands or medical devices . Fomites : Any articles which have been in contact with a patient that may transmit infectious microorganisms. General linen : Linen that has gone through proper laundry process ing to be rendered safe to handle by staff and ready for general patient use. Hand Hygiene : A general term referri ng to any action of hand cleansing. Hand rubbin g with an alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) or handwashing with soap and water aimed at reducing o r inhibiting the growth of micro -organisms on hands. Handwashing: refers to the action of washing hands with plain (non -antimicrobial) soap and water. Hands must be dried thoroughly after washing Healt hcare -associated Infections (HAI) : These infections occ ur as a result of receiving health care, whether in a hospital or an out -of-hospital setting and not present or incubating at the time of admission. Generally, they do not manifest within the first 48 hours after contact with healthcare services. Some surg ical site infections may only manifest after discharge, 30 days post-operatively and u p to 90 days in the case of prosthesis or implant . Occupational -related infection and iatrogenic infections are al so classified as HAI. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 191 Healthcare area/z one: Refers to all regions outside of the patient zone also referred to as the \"patient surroundings\" , i.e. other patients and their patient zones and the wider health -care environment. This includes the curtains, partitions and doors between separate patient areas. The healthcare zone can include shared patient areas. Organisms found within the healthcare zone are foreign to the patients and potentially harmful to all patients. For EMS the health care area could include the front cab of the ambulance including door handl es any clean or sterile supplies located in the ambulance compartments including, PPE, clean linen, the EMS bag and portable oxygen bag, portable radios and crew phones . Health facility (establishment): The whole, or part, of a public or private health ins titution, facility, building or place, whether for profit or not, that is operated or designed to provide treatment; diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, nursing, reha bilitative, palliative, convalescent, preventative or other health services such as e mergency medical services (EMS). Health care general waste: means the non -hazardous components of waste generated by a generator and can include liquids, but excludes health care risk waste; and health care waste generated from isolation wards. Health ca re risk waste (HCRW) : is the hazardous portion of waste (solid and liquid)generated in a health establishment, that in cludes wastes treatment , prevention and diagnosis of disease in humans, infectious waste, infectious sharps and pharmaceutical waste (exp ired, unused, spilt or contaminated drugs, medicines and vaccines, including packaging materials). Health care waste: means waste generated at a health facility and includes both health care general waste and health care risk waste. Health care waste dispo sal: The burial, deposit, discharge, abandoning, dumping, placing or release of any waste into, or onto, any land. Health worker: Any person who delivers health care and services (directly or indirectly) in a health facility to users . It includes health ca re professionals and support staff (cleaners, food service workers, laundry staff, administrative staff etc.) Health care professional : A person providing health services in terms of any law, including in terms of the (a) Allied Health Professions Act, 19 82 (Act No. 63 of 1982); (b) Health Professions Act, 1974 (Act No. 56 of 1974); (c) Nursing Act, 1978 (Act No. 50 of 1978); (d) Pharmacy Act. 1974 (Act No. 53 of 1974); and (e) Dental Technicians Act, 1979 (Act No. 19 of 1979) . High touch surfaces : Frequen tly touched surfaces. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 192 High -risk settings : Operating theatre, Neonatal unit, Intensive care units, Maternity units, Dialysis Units . Infection Control Bundles: Is a structured way of improving the processes of care and patient outcomes: a small, straightforw ard set of evidence -based practices \u2014 generally three to five \u2014 that, when performed collec tively and reliably, have been proven to improve patient outcomes. A set of evidence -based practices that have been proven to improve patient outcomes when performed consistently all the time . Infectious linen: Linen used in the care of patients with comm unicable disease or colonized/infected with multidrug -resistant organisms (patients nursed with isolation precautions). Infested linen: Linen used on patients with p arasites like scabies, lice, fleas and bedbugs. Low touch surfaces : Areas that are less often touched . Major waste generator: means a generator that generates more than 20 kilograms per day of health risk waste, including the container, calculated monthly as a daily average . Medical surveillance: is a planned programme or periodic examination (which may include clinical examinations, biological monitoring or medical tests) of employees by an occupational health practitioner or, in prescribed cases, by an oc cupational medicine practitioner . Minor waste generator : means a generator that generate less than 20kilograms, example PHC and EMS. Multimodal improvement strategies : Comprises of several elements or components (three or more; usually five ) implemented in an integrated way with the aim of improving an outcome and changing behaviour. It includes tools, such as bundles and checklists, developed by multidisciplinary teams that take into account local conditions. The five most common components include: (i) system change (availability of the appropriate infrastructure and supplies to enable IPC good practices); (ii) education and training of healthcare workers and key players (for example, managers); (iii) monitoring infrastructures, practices, p rocesses, outcomes and providing data feedback; (iv) reminders in the workplace/communications; and (v) culture change within the health facility or the strengthening of a safety climate . Negative Pressure ventilation system: Negative pressure is used in a reas where it is essential to prevent the escape of contaminated air from an isolation room through the door or other gaps towards other patient areas. It is created by extracting more air from a room than is supplied to the room so that the infectious dro plet nuclei a re contained within a room by a continuous air current being pulled into the room under the door. The air in the room is kept at negative pressure compared to the other areas and the air must be safely removed from the room to the outside. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 193 Patient: Refers to any part of a person, their clothes and belongings, who is undergoing healthcare. Patient Zone : Includes the patient and the patient's immediate surroundings. The patient zone is the area that is temporarily and exclusively dedicated to an individual p atient for their care. This typically includes the patient and all inanimate surfaces that are touch ed by or in direct physical contact with the patient such as the bed rails, bedside table, bed linen, infusion tubing and other medical equipment. It furthe r contains surfaces frequently touched by health workers while caring for the patient, such as monit ors, knobs and buttons, and other touch surfaces . Since the patient's flora rapidly contaminates the entire patient zone, it should be thoroughly cleaned af ter one patient leaves, before the next patient arrives. Within the patient zone there are two crit ical set of sites, a) clean site s (e.g. intravenous/ IV access point) that need to be protected against microorganisms, and b) body fluid site s (e.g. indwel ling urinary catheter) that may lead to exposure to body fluids. Point -of-care products should be ac cessible without having to leave the patient zone . For emergency medical service ( EMS ) the patient zone (in an ambulance) is the entire area where the pati ent is housed and transported inclu ding the stretcher with a patient on it , linen, patient care equipment including monitor patient belongings, paper/electronic patient care report and transfer documents , contact surfaces in the ambulance during patient tr ansport, and door internal handles. Persistent activity : The prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents the growth or survival of micro rganisms after application of a chemical such as antiseptic; also called \"residual\", \"sustained\" or \"rem nant\" activity. Both substantive and non -substantive active ingredients can show a persistent effect significantly inhibiting the growth of microorganisms after application. Plain soap: Detergents that contain no added antimicrobial agents, or may contain these solely as preservatives. Point of Care : The place where three elements come together: the patient, the healthcare worker and care or treatment involving contact with the patient or his/her surroundings (within the patient zone). Procedure : Is an ac t of care for a patient where there is a risk o f direct introduction of a pathogen into the patient's body. Positive pressure system: In a positive pressure system, the room is in positive pressure and the air in the room is leaked out through envelope le akages or other openings. This allows airborne microorganisms that may infect the patient to be kept away from the patient, an example of its use is in operating theatres. Segregation of health care waste: Systematic separation of health care waste into designated categories . PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL 194 Single -use devices: \"Single use\" in terms of a medical device means one use of a medical device on an individual or invitro diagnostic medical device ( IVD) on a sample during a single procedure and then the medical device or IVD is dis posed of and is not reprocessed and not used again.( 9 Dec 2016 R egulations relating to medical devices and IVDs) . Soiled linen: Linen that is visibly soiled with blood, other body fluids, and/or f aecal matter. Soiling (pollution ): The visible presence of d irt or offensive matter on a liv ing or non -living surface that should be clean. Theatre linen : Cotton drapes are used for sterile fields in the operating theatre and are sterilized by the SSD after they have been laundered. Terminal cleaning : The process o f rendering a patient room free from the possibility of transmitting infection after a patient has left the room. Used linen: Linen that has been used in patient care but is not visibly soiled. Visibly soiled hand s: Hands on which dirt or bo dy fluids are visible.
