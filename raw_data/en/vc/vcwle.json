This method of detoxification is both cheap and easy, and you can learn more about it here. Even as a young child, I knew the importance of taking a vitamin C supplement and eating vitamin c rich foods for your health. I remember eating chewable vitamin c tablets with bioflavonoids that we'd buy at the health food store. Like many families we went through cycles of healthier eating, but vitamin C was always a staple regardless. My Dad first introduced me to the \"cleansing\" properties of Vitamin C about 15 years ago when explaining to me how to determine my own vitamin c dose threshold, telling me that if you take too much, \"You'll know.\" He also taught me about the cleansing properties of Magnesium but didn't give me fair warning before I drank an entire [bottle](https://amzn.to/2l8vBP6) he gave me because it tasted so good, but that's a different story for a different time. Teaser alert, both vitamin C and magnesium, when the dosage exceeds your personal threshold (aka your bowel tolerance), will cause frequent trips to the bathroom. Lessons I learned the hard way, thanks Dad. Vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid) is known for its anti-aging, immune boosting, and mineral absorption properties. In high doses, it becomes an ascorbic acid flush, a powerful cleansing agent, protecting the body from chemical toxins and infection. Why do we need Vitamin C? Ascorbic acid is the primary preventative antioxidant agent of free radicals damage. It is needed for proper absorption of many minerals, such as iron, potassium and calcium. Without it, collagen, the connective tissue in skin, would be unable to form. Vitamin C also helps to prevent adrenal exhaustion by supporting the adrenal glands. Research has shown that people with high levels of ascorbic acid in the blood live longer than those with low levels. By combining the detoxification of pollutants and toxins with boosting the immune system with vitamin C, a detox flush with ascorbic acid can greatly contribute to overall health and longevity. The benefits of an ascorbic acid flush are particularly valuable for those with compromised health status, illness, influenza, allergies, or any chemical exposure. Benefits of a Vitamin C Flush A Vitamin C Flush is one of the easiest and quickest detoxification methods. It's simply introducing high amounts of vitamin C into the body at regular intervals until the intestines flush themselves with a watery stool. Like any detoxification program, afterwards the body feels refreshed and rejuvenated. The benefits of an ascorbic acid flush do not end there... It is also a way to boost the body's vitamin C stores (helping to resolve any vitamin c deficiency) and absorption rate. Each time a cleansing flush is done, the body needs less of the nutrient to reach its ideal level. In fact, doing an ascorbic acid flush will tell you exactly how much vitamin C your unique body needs. Seventy five percent of the amount of Vitamin C required to flush our you system, is your own personal recommended equivalent daily intake for optimal health. How to do a Vitamin C Flush It is important to use [ascorbic acid powder](https://amzn.to/2l8SDVW) or [buffered ascorbic acid powder](https://amzn.to/2l8Y9rF). The buffered vitamin c powder (buffered ascorbate powder) version is combined with a buffer mineral such as calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc. or a combination of all three that is gentler but may be less effective. For maximum effectiveness stick to regular [ascorbic acid powder](https://amzn.to/2l8SDVW) <\u2014 this is the one we use. Taking a bunch of capsules may seem appealing but I strongly recommend the powder in a glass of water or fruit juice, it's most similar in taste to strong lemon juice. You can even add it to plain sparkling water if you crave effervescence. Take 1000mg of vitamin c in a half-glass of [filtered](https://amzn.to/2jLikj3)/ [purified](https://amzn.to/2l8UQk8) water (roughly 8 ounces of water) every twenty to thirty minutes, keeping track of the total amount of ascorbic acid taken. Do this until you have a soupy, watery stool (this is the \"you'll know when\" part of the flush, with an enema-like evacuation of liquid from your body, fun stuff). NOTE; if you have inflamed hemorrhoids a flush may not be the best for your body. This quick trip to the bathroom is the body's way to prevent overdose. Vitamin C is a water soluble solution that once you reach our body particular threshold in grams of vitamin c and your saturation level becomes 'enough' your body simply purges it. Once the Vitamin C Flush is completed with high doses of vitamin c, you can continue taking smaller doses of ascorbate acid every four hours for the next couple days, trying to maintain a thicker, tapioca-like stool. If diarrhea occurs again, lower the dosage. This can be done for a more thorough detoxification, but is not required. To optimize the Vitamin C Flush, start in the morning on an empty stomach. Expect to cleanse for two to four hours, although for some people, more time is needed. Be sure to drink adequate water during the flush, sip mineral-rich bone broth and/or sole water to replace lost minerals. Your Optimal Daily Vitamin C Dose Multiply the total amount of vitamin C used to cause loose stools by .75, this will calculate the amount of ascorbic acid your body can use on a daily basis. A Vitamin C Flush can be done as often as once a month or once every four months. The healthier your body is, the less vitamin C you will require. So, the more vitamin C it takes to flush your system the more your body NEEDS vitamin c. In conclusion, I need to stress that I am NOT a doctor but only sharing what I've researched in response to the things that guinea pigs (like my dad and I) have found beneficial as a part of our overall healthy lifestyle where we are trying to keep things like diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol and inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 many of us are becoming more and more deficient in a variety of vitamins and minerals due to food processing premature food harvesting, artificial ripening and food supply issues that our genetic ancestors didn't have to deal with.
