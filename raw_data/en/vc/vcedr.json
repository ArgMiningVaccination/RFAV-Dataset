However, current studies mainly focus on European ancestry, highlighting a great need to identify the key genes, pathways and cell types in colonic mucosal cells of adult UC patients from other ancestries. Here we aimed to identify key genes and cell types in colonic mucosal of UC. Methods We performed Single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA -seq) analysis of 12 colon biopsies of UC patients and healthy controls from Chinese Han ancestry. Results Two novel plasma subsets were identified. Five epithelial/stromal and three immune cell subsets show significant difference in abundance between inflamed and non - inflamed samples. In general, UC -risk genes show consistent expression alteration in both Immune cells of inflamed and non -inflamed tissues. As one of the exceptions, IgA defection, marking the signal of immune dysfunction, is specific to the inflamed area. Moreover, Th17 derived activation was observed in both epithelial cell lineage and immune cell lineage of UC patients as compared to controls, suggesting a systemic change of immune activities driven by Th17. The UC -risk genes show enrichment in progenitors, glial cells and immune cells, and drug -target genes are differentially expressed in antigen presenting cells. Conclusions Our work identifies novel population -specific plasma cell molecular signatures of UC. The transcriptional signature of UC is shared in immune cells from both inflamed and non-inflamed tissues, whereas the transcriptional response to disease is a local effect only in inflamed epithelial/stromal cells. Keywords Ulcerative colitis, Single -cell RNA sequencing, Genome -wide association studies 7 203 202 Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterized by relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation in the rectum and extending to proximal segments of the colon. The pathogenesis of UC is complex and multifactorial 1, including genetic predisposition2, epithelial barrier defects3, 4, and deregulated immune responses5. In general, UC is thought to arise from an inappropriate activation of the intestinal mucosal immune system in response to commensal bacteria in a genetically susceptible host 6. The breakdown of the epithelial barrier and mucosal immune barrier homeostasis at the cellular level has been revealed to play an important role in the onset of UC 7, 8. UC is common in industrialized locations including North America and Western Europe 9. Recently, there is also an increasing incidence of UC in Asia due to urbanization10. The recent epidemiological report showed that India and China had the highest inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence in Asia. In China, the incidence of UC was reported to be positively associated with gross domestic product11. Genome -wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome analyses have been widely used to dissect the molecular mechanisms of UC, by identifying risk alleles as well as transcriptional alterations aiming at dening the functional consequences of associated alleles for both coding and n on-coding genetic variation 12, 13. To better understand the pathogenesis of UC, recent studies have been focused on the transcriptome at a cellular resolution and states within the tissue of IBD lesions 14-17. However, most of the current studies were performed in individuals of European ancestry, with only one study focusing on pediatric -onset colitis in Chinese 17, highlighting a great demand for studying on the key genes, pathways and cell types in colonic mucosal cells of adult UC patients from other ancestries. Here, we performed a single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA -seq) analysis of 12 colon biopsies from 5 UC patients including 4 inflamed (UC), 4 non- inflamed (self -control, SC) biopsies and 4 healthy biopsies (HC) from healthy individuals from Chinese Han ancestry (Fig 1A, Table S1A), to uncover the pathogenesis of UC on a cellular level. Figure 1 . Single -cell expression atlas and cell typing in biopsies of Chinese UC patients and control samples. A, Experimental design. Fresh biopsy specimens were disassociated and single- cell suspensions were obtained from four samples from inflamed sigmoid colon (UC) with the non -inflamed ascen ding colon biopsy specimens (SC) and four healthy samples (HC).

After quality control, 43,218 cells with an average of 1053 genes per cell remained and clustered into 21 subpopulations (Fig.1B), where cells from each of the UC, SC and HC biopsies were mapped to a comparable space in UMAP after batch correction (Fig.S1). We calculated marker genes for each cluster (Table.S1B), then annotated the clusters with both data- derived and literature -derived Fig.S5- S6), up with (e.g. enterocyte, enterocyte progenitors, goblet, tuft cell, glial cells and endothelial cells) and 11 immune cells (e.g. Naive T cells, Memory T cells, CD8+ T cell/NK cell, CD8+ T cell, Naive B cell, memory B cell, monocytes/DC cells, mast cells and 3 clusters of plasma cells). Among them, 16 out of 21 subsets were replicated in the scRNA -seq study from American/European descent 14. Interestingly, we observed two novel immune subsets (plasma -2 and plasma- 3 cells) in our data. The proportions of five epithelial/stromal and three immune cell subsets significantly differed between UC and SC (or HC). glial cells, fibroblasts, goblet progenitors and enterocyte with its progenitors were significant decreased in inflamed UC tissues. CD8+ T cell as well as two types of plasma cells were increased in UC (Fig. 1E -1F). Tuft cells are the chemosensory cells in the gut and are enriched for taste -sensing molecules 18. We observed a cluster of mature tuft cells (named as TRMP5+ tuft) , which Of note, TRMP5+ level on HPGDS , ALOX5 and PTGS1 , which function in of arachidonic acid and prostaglandin19-21. Moreover, TRMP5+ tuft cells also expressed IL -17RB , which may mediate the cross -talk with ILC222, and acted as a marker of tuft cell -like human colorectal cancer stem cells23, as previously identified in the Chinese pediatric UC17. Notably, we showed a significantly lower abundance of TRMP5+ tuft cells in UC compared to that in SC (paired student's t -test, P=0.048) (Fig. 1E and Table S2A). On the other hand, two out of three plasma subsets were observed with a higher proportion in UC, compared to that in either HC or SC (Fig. 1F and Table. S2A). Among the mentioned two plasma subsets, plasma- 2 cells specifically expressed MZB -1 gene (Fig. S7A, Table. S1B -C), w hich was significantly up- regulated in UC compared to HC (P adjusted = 1.18\u00d7 10-65) or SC (P adjusted = 3.45\u00d7 10-37). Plasma -3 cells specifically expressed IGLL5 gene, which was also significantly up- regulated in UC compared to HC (P adjusted = 1.16\u00d7 10-18) or S C (P adjusted = 1.83\u00d7 10-15). Consistent with previous findings, the up -regulation of MZB -1 and IGLL5 in Crohn's Disease (CD) has been reported in mesenteric adipose tissue8. Furthermore, genes co- expressed with MZB - 1 and IGLL5 in those cell -types were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, which play important roles in cytosol transport, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory cascades of plasma cells (Fig. S7B). In order to directly compare our plasma signatures to those of American/European ancestry, we intersected identified DE genes between UC and SC/HC in plasmas of our study with those found in Smillie's study (Table S3A -B) 14. Most up -regulated genes (270 out of 502) found in our study, such as XBP- 1 and MHC class II genes, have been found consistently up- regulated in Smillie's study14 (Table. S3C). On the other hand, two plasma maker genes: IGLL5 and MZB -1 showed up- regulation in UC patients in our study, but were found to be down- regulated (IGLL5 ) and not changed (MZB -1) respectively in Smillie's study14. This observation indicates that these two genes expression alteration could be specific to the plasma of Chinese UC patients (Table. S3). Antigen presentation pathway and IL- 17 signaling pathway were activated in the inflamed tissue of ulcerative colitis. In epithelial/stromal lineages, up- regulated genes between inflamed tissues and HC were enriched in the antigen processing and presentation pathway and MHC class II complex activity. These pathways were also showed up in UC compared with SC (Fig. 2A, 2B). Figure 2 .

D, Violin plots showing the expression distribution of LCN2 and MHC class II genes in each Epithelial/stromal cell cluster of UC, SC and HC. The differentially expressed genes (DEG) between UC and HC in LGR5+ stem cells, enterocyte progenitors and goblet progenitors over -represented the functions of rejective immunity, but mature cells (enterocyte and goblet) lose the functional difference of rejective reaction. Of note, the majority of genes involved in MHC class II molecules, such as HLA -DRA, HLA -DRB1 and HLA-DRC, were up -regulated in UC. but the MHC class I molecular HLA -B was down -regulated. Moreover, IL- 17 signaling pathway was significantly enriched in the up -regulated genes of goblet progenitor, endothelial cell and fibroblasts in the comparison of UC versus HC, suggesting that intestinal epithelial barrier was involved in IL- 17 cytokine responses in UC. One of the major genes of the IL- 17 signaling pathway in these cell types was LCN2 (Fig. 2C). LCN2 , a bacteriostatic molecule, has tissue destructive effects and is pro- inflammatory with chemoattractant molecule binding properties24. Earlier studies, using both DNA microarrays and RNA -seq data, showed that the LCN2 is among the top 10 up- regulated genes in UC, and correlated with disease severity25- 27. In addition, IL- 17A showed a synergistic effect with IL- 22 and T NF- in inducing colonic epithelial expression of LCN228. Next, we investigated whether the DE genes showing consistent pattern between Chinese UC patients and patients of American/European ancestry. We intersected D E genes found between UC and SC/HC in epithelial cells of our study with those found in Smillie's study 14 . Most up- regulated genes (299 out of 517) found in our study also showed up- regulation in the UC patients of Smillie's study (Table. S3C), including LCN2 , JUN and MHC class genes, etc. The up- regulated genes found in our study were enriched in pathways like translation initiation and structural molecule activity (Fig.S8). Th17 cell was the major immune characteristic of UC, but IgA was the key local immune component of inflamed tissue Similar to the activation of IL- 17 signaling pathway in the epithelial lineages, the Th17 cell differentiation, as well as the T cell receptor signaling and TNF signaling pathway were activated in CD4+ cell lineages in UC compared to HC. In general, immune- mediated inflammation, the presented antigen leads to the differentiation of CD4+ helper T cells, and stimulates Th17 cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF and IL- 17 29. On the other hand, we found that the Th17 cell differentiation and its cytokines related pathways were activated in NKT cells, which is in line with the previous finding that CD8+IL- 17+ cells were increased in American UC patients 2. Additionally, we found that NFKBIA and JUN were predominantly presented in plasma cells, mast cells, monocytes and dendritic cells in HC, but were only expressed in B cells and T cells in both UC and SC, whereas additional MHC class II genes (e.g. HLA - DRA ) were found in CD8+ T and NKT cells (Fig. 3C). Figure 3 . Gene signatures found in the inflamed samples (UC) comparing to non -inflamed samples (SC) and healthy samples (HC) in immune cells. A-B, Enriched KEGG and GO pathways of DE genes between UC vs HC (A) and UC vs SC (B) in immune cells. C, Violin plots showing the expression distribution of NFKBIA, JUN and HLA -DRA in each immune cell cluster of UC, SC and HC. The intestinal IgA production was found to be enriched in the up- regulated genes of goblet and enterocytes cells, their progenitor cells, and glial cells in comparison between UC and SC (Fig. 3B). Most of the IgA molecules presented at mucosal sites, where they are produced by locally residing plasma cells 30. As a key local immune component, IgA protects the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier by coating the bacteria 31. In line with these findings, abnormal coating capacity of IgA was reported in UC in Chinese young patients32. 195 UC -risk genes were enriched in the epithelia progenitors and immune cells with druggable targets in antigen presenting cells Among 511 UC- risk genes published in the GWAS catalog (https://ww w.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/ , last accessed on 22- Feb-2020) , 141 were found in 195 differentially expressed genes between UC and controls, of which 90% showed up - regulation in UC. Compared to the number of height -associated loci overlapped with our DE genes, UC -risk loci showed enrichment in epithelial cells (goblet, goblet progenitors, LGR5+ stem cell and enterocyte), endothelial cell, glial cells, fibroblasts and various immune cells (plasma- 1, Naive and memory B cell, CD4+ T cell and NKT cell) (Table S2B). Among these UC -risk DE genes, eight genes were previously reported in the UC GWAS studies in HLA- DRB1 were up- regulated in the epithelial cells of UC compared with both SC and HC (Fig. 4A -B and Fig.S9), suggesting an increased activity of antigen presentation during UC vs HC UC vs SCA 209 208 inflammation in the inflamed tissue, which is consistent with the enrichment pathways of DEG reported above. Figure 4 . Comp arison of signed log -P-values of differentially expressed (DE) genes from UC risk loci in epithelial /stromal cell clusters (A) and immune cells (B). In T cell lineages, FYN , PTPRC and CDC42SE2 were increased in UC, and they are known to be involved in the T cell receptor signaling via regulating the receptor -like tyrosine phosphatase 33. Similarly, immunosuppressive costimulatory molecules, receptor ICOS , were increased in CD4+ Naive T cell and CD4+ memory T cell, respectively. Of note, STAT3 is a recognized pro- inflammatory transcripts34. It is known that the differentiation of Th17 cells typically requires the cytokines signaling via the STAT3 transcription activator35. STAT3 was up- regulated in CD4+ Naive T cell of UC and SC, which was also consistent with the change of Th17 cell and IL -17 signal in systemic inflammation. Our analysis showed that many MHC molecules were up- regulated in the epithelial/stromal cells of UC compared to either HC or SC. In immune cells, however, many dysregulated risk genes were identified between UC and HC but not between UC and SC. For example, LTB, DUSP1 and IRF8 of memory B cell and T cells were increased in UC compared to HC but not to SC. Therefore, we performed a systematic compariso n of significance of DE UC -risk genes in immune and epithelial/stromal cells. It reveals contrasting patterns: the identified DE risk genes between UC and HC are more likely to be differentially expressed between UC and SC in epithelial/stromal cells than in immune cells (P 2 test = 1.35\u00d7 10-3, Fig. 4A -B and Fig. S9). Interestingly, we also noticed that 25% of the DE genes are druggable targets 36. Of note, the enrichment of DE genes in the known UC -drug targets was found for Basiliximab (P = 0.049) and Adalimumab (P = 0.042) in glial cells, and Abatacept in Monocytes and dendritic cells (P = 0.008). Discussion Here we demonstrate novel molecular signatures of adult Chinese UC patients at a single -cell level. Most o f the cell types we identified can be replicated in the previous studies in the American UC patients. The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a pivotal role in rectifying and orchestrating the inflammatory responses in gut tract 37. Enteric log10(P) (UC vs HC)signed log10(P) (UC vs have been recognized as APCs, express substance P and produce TNF -, IL-1, and IL -6, which could induce the activation of mast cells, macrophages, and T cells, and promote lymphocyte proliferation38, 39. We identified the decreased glial cells in inflamed tissues compared with both SC and HC, similar to American UC patients14, but not detected in Chinese pediatric UC patients17. Tuft cells have also been identified from UC patients. Theoretically, Tuft cells are absent from the stratified squamous epithelium of the anal canal and esophagus but may increase following replacement with a metaplast ic, intestine -like columnar epithelium 21. A tuft cell signature based on bulk profiles of TRPM5+ tuft cells contained both neuronal and inflammatory gene programs; this could reflect either co-expression in the same cells or distinct subsets 45. TRPM5 plays a crucial role for chemosensation in promoting tuft cell expansion in response to infection22. TRPM5+ tuft cells also interact closely with immune cells, playing a crucial role in the cellular regulatory network coordinating responses to luminal parasites 40. In the epithelial lineages, most progenitor cells were decreased in UC. We also identified LGR5+ stem cells, the major intestinal stem cell, which play a key role in regeneration of intestinal injury 46, in our data. In general, the intestinal epithelium is maintained by long- lived intestinal stem cells (ISCs), residing the crypt base, the specifically expressed marker is LGR5+47. Above the ISC zone, there are short -lived progenitors that normally give rise to lineage- specific differentiated cell types but can dedifferentiate into ISCs in the case of injury48. The short -lived enterocyte precursors just serve as a large reservoir of potential stem cells during crypt regeneration49. Thus, the reducing enterocyte progenitors and matured cells suggested the deficiency of mucosal regeneration in inflamed UC. Pericytes and enteroendocrine cells have been identified in the previous study by Smillie et al.14, but were largely missed in our data. A small number of pericytes and enteroendoc rine cells were found but mixed with fibroblasts and LGR5+ stem cells, respectively. The lack of resolution in detecting pericytes and enteroendocrine cells is likely due to the smaller sample size of our study compared to that of Smillie's study.14 Epithelial barrier and immune barrier defects are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis with significant dysbiosis 1, although there were no UC-related specific bacteria identified50. The DEGs were enriched in the function of antigen presentation and MHC class II complex activity in epithelial lineages of UC, and DEGs of the most progenitors were involved in the function of rejective immunity. Most differential genes code the antimicrobial proteins, such as LCN, a bacteriostatic molecule, involved in the antimicrobial immune response. CXCL1 and CXCL2 are involved as the antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptide, acting as the recruiters of immune cells. Both of them are the risk genes and were verified up- regulated in UC 51. Type17 immunity involved in the inflammation in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis has been implicated 52, 53, and Type17 immunity were derived by anti -commensal response or antigen presentation in UC54, 55. We found in the DEGs in epithelial/stromal lineages that Th17 signals were increased not only in the inflamed tissue but also in the uninflamed control tissue, with the bacteriostatic molecule LCN2 7 211 210 expression. In addition, Th17 cell differentiation and T cell receptor signaling were enriched in the CD4+ T cell lineage, which were consistent with the functional change in epithelial lineages. Moreover, the UC rick gene STAT3 was also increasingly expres sed in CD4+ Naive T cell of UC and itself control. Many studies have reported that the increased levels of Th17 cells and IL -17 not only in the intestinal mucosa but also in the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and serum of active UC in Chinese population 56, 57. It is also known that the level of Th17 cell was increased in PBMC, and the expression of IL- 17A mRNA were increased in the PBMC, MLN and LPC of DSS colitis mice58. Above all, type 17 immunity is one of the important systemic changes in UC. In epithelial lineages, up- regulated genes between inflamed tissues and HC were replicated in the comparison between UC and SC, but in immune cell lineages, most DEGs identified between inflamed intestines and HC cannot be found as DEGs in the comparison between inflamed intestines and SC. These observations indicated the local intestinal damage as well as a systemic inflammation were involved in the pathogenesis of UC 59. Particularly, in line with that the type IL -17 immunity was activated overall the colon, the defective IgA secretion has been confirmed as a local immunological character of UC910/1/21 5:23:00 PM . In summary, most cell types could be found in the colon of both Chinese UC patents and healthy controls, while we identified two novel plasma subsets in our data. The transcriptional signature of UC is shared in immune cells from both inflamed and non - inflamed tissues, except the defection of IgA, which is a located immunity dysfunction of inflamed area. However, in epithelial/stromal cells, the transcriptional response to disease is a local effect seen only in the inflamed biopsy. The activation of Th17 driven by anti -commensal inflammatory response is the core of the pathogenesis of UC, nearly including all the changes of epithelial cell lineage and immune cell lineage. In addition, the drug target genes were differentially expressed in antigen presenting cells. Our study serves as an important reference of the molecular mechanism behind the genetic risks of UC from transcriptional aspects, and identifies cell type specific drug targets. Methods Patient Selection and Sample C ollection The biopsy samples were collected from four male and one female Han Chinese patients at the Department of Gastroenterology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University (Beijing, China). All patients have been diagnosed as left -sided moderate ulcerative colitis for at least 3 years, with relapsing course, without receiving any treatment in recent 3 months. None of them had undergone surgical resections. UC was diagnosed by the conventional clinical, radiological and endoscopic features , and eventually conrmed by histological examination of colonic biopsies 60. Four Han Chinese healthy controls were enrolled at the Health Examination Center of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital of Capital Medical University. Among them, three healthy controls were age - and sex -matched with three UC patients. Written informed consent was obtained and ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee of the Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University. Characteristics of all patients are represented in Table S1A. For each of the five patients, one pinch biopsy specimen was collected from the inflamed sigmoid colon (the most common site of inflammation in UC) as the UC group, and one pinch biopsy specimen from the normal ascending colon of patients served as self -control (SC group), as well as four pinch biopsy specimens from sigmoids of four healthy volunteers served as healthy control (HC group). Biopsy specimens were collected into RPMI 1640 medium on ice and processed immediately. Tissue Processing Tissues were washed twice with PBS. The biopsy specimens were cut into 1mm 3 pieces using sterile scalpel blades, and put into a petri dish. 2 mg/mL collagenase and 10 U/mL DNAase were added and rotated at 37 for a period of time. After standing for 2- 3 minutes, decant the supernatant and remove the large lumps with the filter membrane. After centrifuging the cells, the supernatant portion was poured out and discarded. The cells were suspended again with erythrocyte lysis buffer, cultured at room temperature for 2~3 minutes, and then centrifuged at 120\u00d7 g for 3 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Samples were lastly resuspended with PBS. Single -Cell RNA Sequencing Cell capture and cDNA synthesis was performed using single -cell 3 'Library and Gel Bead Kit V2 (10xGenomics, 120237) and Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (10x Genomics, 120236). The cell suspension (300 -600 living cells per microliter determined by Count Star) was loaded onto the Chromium single cell controller (10x Genomics) to generate single- cell gel beads in the emulsion according to the manufacturer's protocol. In short, single cells were suspended in PBS containing 0.04% BSA. About 7000 cells were added to each channel, and the target cell recovery rate was estimated to be 3000 cells. Captured cells were lysed and the released RNAs were barcoded through reverse transcription in individual Gel Beads in Emulsion (GEMs). Using a S1000TM Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad) to reverse transcribe, the GEMs were programed at 53\u00b0C for 45 min, followed 85\u00b0C for 5 min, and hold at 4\u00b0C. The cDNA was obtained and amplified, and the quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 (performed by CapitalBio, Beijing). Single -cell RNA -Seq libraries were prepared according to the manufacture's introduction and the Single Cell 3' Library Gel Bead Kit V2 was used. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencer with a sequencing depth of at least 69,000 reads per cell and 150 bp (PE150) paired -end reads (performed by CapitalBio, Beijing). In addition, one UC sample (patient 2) and one self -control (patient 1) sample were excluded for further analyses because a high percentage of mitochondrial genes (>0.25) and the lower number of recovered cells (688) were estimated in them. Reads processing and quality control CellRanger v3.0.2 (10x Genomics) was used to process single -cell RNA sequencing reads. To generate a digital gene expression (DGE) matrix for each sample, we 7 213 212 mapped their reads to hg19 human transcriptome, and recorded the number of UMIs for each gene in each cell. For each DGE matrices, the estimated number of cells and number of genes per cell were examined based on cell barcode and UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) barcodes. Seurat v3.1 was applied to analyze DGE matrix from each sample 61, 62. To filter out low-quality cells and doublets, empirically filtering criteria were applied to each cell: number of estimated genes should be higher than 100 and lower than 6000, and the ratio of reads mapping to the mitochondria should be lower than 25%. Only genes detected in at least 5 cells were maintained for subsequent analyses. Clustering and identification of cell clusters Seurat v3.1 integration workflow with SCTransform normalization method was used to cluster cells from different samples into distinct cell subsets 62. We followed this workflow with the following steps: Firstly, we SCTransformed each sample and merged them into UC, SC and HC datasets. Next, we selected 2,000 variable features among three datasets and identified anchors from these features to integrate the datasets. These two steps corrected batch effects and prevented cells clustering by patients or disease phenotypes rather than by cell types or cell subsets. Principal component analysis (PCA) has then been performed on the integrated datasets, followed by Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) Graph construction using PC1 to 20 and k=20 nearest neighbours to identify unsupervised cell clusters. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the cell clusters. In order to keep the biological differences for downstream analyses, the above - mentioned batch correction was only used in the cell clustering and PCA related steps. For the other analyses, we used standard LogNormalization methods. The original gene counts for each cell were normalized by total UMI counts and multiplied by 10,000 (TP10K), and then log transformed by log (TP10K+1). In order to annotate cell identity to each cluster, we used a double- checking strategy for the inference 63 by comparing data- derived marker genes with public databases, and by directly visualizing the expression pattern of literature- derived marker genes. Firstly, we used the automatic cell annotation tool, SingleR64, with two reference dataset, Human Primary Cell Atlas Data and Blueprint Encode data, to generate primary annotation. Next, data -derived marker genes were detected by applying differential expression (DE) tests between cells in one cluster and all other cells in the dataset. Up -regulated genes from the cluster of interest were ranked by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and compared with their reported cell types in human large intestines in CellMarker databases 6510/1/21 5:23:00 PM. Then, marker genes and cell surface markers reported in other human intestine or immune cell analyses were regarded as literat ure-derived markers, and we visualized their expression levels in each of the identified cell clusters to manually check the cell identities. Finally, we used the harmony algorithm 66 to integrate our data with well annotated- cells from Smillie et al14, to further validate the identities. To test significant changes of cell proportion, the Dirichlet -multinomial regression which takes compositional dependencies into account, was used. For comparison and validation, the student's t test, the Wilcoxon signed-r ank test and paired t test (when applicable) were also applied. Differential expression genes and enrichment analysis For each annotated cell type, differential expression genes were estimated between UC and SC, UC and HC, SC and HC, using FindMarkers Seurat v3.1 with the default Wilcoxon rank -sum test, and with MAST 67 for validation. For each comparison, DE tests were performed only on genes that were detected in more than 10% of cells in any groups. P -value adjustment was performed using Bonf erroni correction based on the total number of genes in the tested dataset. R package clusterProfiler v3.10.1 68 was used for KEGG and GO enrichment analysis for over -represented pathways and GO terms on the DE genes found in UC vs HC and UC vs SC in each cell identity. DE genes in GWAS loci catalog69which contains 281 associated loci with 605 reported risk genes. Risk genes that were found to be significantly differentially expressed in any of our comparison were extracted and classified as Asian and Non- Asian risk genes based on whether they are initially estimated or have been replicated in Asian samples. In total, we identified 195 DE genes that are reported to be associated with ulcerative colitis, and only 8 of them have been reported in Asian GWAS studies, test was applied to test the over -representation of risk gene in differentially expressed genes in any cell types, using all genes expressed in >10% cells in estimated cell types as reference. Drug target analysis Druggable gene list was obtained from Finan C's work 36. The UC drugs information was collected from literatures70.71. Drug -targets were obtained from Drugbank72. Fisher's exact test was applied for enrichment analysis. Acknowledgments The authors thank the patients -participants at the Beijing Chaoyang hospital for contributing intestinal biopsy samples.
