We conducted hours of research on the best nutritionist-recommended multivitamins for women, spanning a range of budgets and particular health needs. After considering dozens of options, we compiled this list. We noted if each option is third-party tested for efficacy, as well as its inactive ingredients, and for what age stage the formula is intended. We also researched how easy it is to incorporate the supplement into your daily routine, looking at things like pill size taste, if any, and how many pills are included in a serving size. We then combined these testing insights with our registered dietician nutritionist recommendations to compile a list of the best in show.

Meet the Expert [Brooke Alpert](https://www.instagram.com/bnutritious/), MS, RD, CDN, a New York-based nutritionist, Certified Holistic Cannabis Practitioner, founder of Daily Habit CBD, and author. [Brigid Titgemeier](https://beingbrigid.com/)is a functional nutrition dietitian, graduate school instructor, and functional medicine patient. She has worked with nearly four thousand patients in her own business and as a founding dietitian of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. What to Look For in Multivitamins for Women Third-Party Testing This is one of the best indications that you're choosing a quality multivitamin, says Brigid Titgemeier, functional medicine registered dietitian and founder of My Food is Health. \"There are companies that conduct third-party testing to assess the ingredient quality, consistency of product label, freshness, and more. They then give supplements their seal of approval to indicate it meets their standards,\" she explains. A few to look for: ConsumerLab.com, NSF International, Informed-Choice, and US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). Consider Your Age According to Titgemeir, there are generally three stages of adulthood for women that need to be considered when choosing a multivitamin: regular menstruation, pregnancy, and post-menopause. Your nutrient needs will vary greatly based on the stage you're in, particularly when it comes to things such as iron, folate, and calcium. To that point, it's always best to chat through your particular needs with your doctor when choosing a multivitamin. Inactive Ingredients Along with the nutrients offered, Titgemeir says to look at the other ingredients in the vitamin (technical term: excipients) as well. These will be listed as \"other ingredients\" on the ingredient panel, she says, and it's important to make sure that they align with your dietary needs and preferences. For example, if you're a vegetarian, you'll want to avoid supplements with gelatin; if you have an allergy to soy, you'll want to make sure there's no soybean oil in the formula. - Are multivitamins good for pregnant women? When it comes to pregnancy, nationally recognized nutritionist and best-selling author Brooke Alpert says that multivitamins are good for pregnant women, \"but there are specific ones for pregnant women that focus on the most important nutrients.\" With that said, if you're pregnant, she recommends choosing a high-quality prenatal vitamin over a regular women's multivitamin. - How many multivitamins should be taken per day? When it comes to how many multivitamins you should take per day, Alpert says that it fully depends on the brand and formula. \"There isn't one stock answer,\" she says. Some formulas may require just one pill a day, while others may be broken up into multiple pills taken at different times throughout the day. That said, it's important to thoroughly read through directions (as well as consult your doctor) rather than guess what dosage is best. - Are gummy vitamins less effective? In terms of efficacy, Alpert says gummy vitamins aren't any more or less potent than pills or capsules. \"The most important thing with vitamins is to make sure they are the ones you will remember to take and can comfortably tolerate,\" she says. Just be aware that, while not any less effective, some gummy formulas contain high amounts of sugar, so thoroughly read through the inactive ingredient list of a product before making a purchase.
