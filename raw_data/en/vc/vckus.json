For, just as there are junk foods -there also are \"junk vitamins\" and ''.junk food supplements.\" (We're sorry to say ). YOU.GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR Let's be realis tic for a moment and dis\u00ad cuss dollars and cents. There are no \"free\u00ad bies\" in this world. The da y of the \"free lunch\" has long gone. It is a basic fact of economics: -\"You get what you pay for .\" Whenever the price goes down -so does product quality and dependability. It's an irrefutable law : Substitutions must be made by cutting corners- often by leaving out an important component. So the question arises: What \"sub\u00ad stitutions\" have been made? cut? \"SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE\" Cheaply made supplements -sold at a cheap price -just cannot have the same nutritional va lues as quality supplements, Someone's health must be short-changed. Very likely it could be yours -if you de\u00ad pend on cheap products at cheap prices. Again ... you get what you pay for! Aren't there enough questionable fillers, chemicals, poisons, and dyes in many everyday foods without having them in your vitamins and food supplements as well? Don't these substitutions impair po \u00ad tency and assimilation? You bet they can -and do. When you decide to \"get it cheaper\" - who are you \"cheaping?\" Only yourself! It's like playing both ends against the middle and-either way- YOU are bound to lose. DON'T BARGAIN WITH NATURE One cannot \"bargain\" with Mother Nature. She cannot be substftuted, hur\u00ad ried, or improved on . No chemical on earth can duplic&te sunshine, rich soil, spring rains and time.

DURING YOUR last health check-up, the doctor probably checked for early signs of cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease , blood pressure and so on. Chances are, no questions were asked about your diet. Nor did the doctor explain the role of nutrition in health and disease. \"Unfortunately, many doctors don't normally discuss nutrition with patients\u00ad even though it's their job to help patients use diet therapy to promote health and prevent disease,\" said one prominent phy\u00ad sician, a professor of medicine . To find out why, nutritionist Barbara Levine, Ph.D., surveyed hundreds of doc\u00ad tors and most claimed: \"They don't have the time to offer dietary advice.\" A lack of concern about diet reveals a gaping hole in medical doctors ' education. \"Until recently, medical schools offered little nutritional training. So most doctors fail to realize the importance of diet to disease prevention.\" Patients do not ask dietary advice be -HEALTH TODAY MAY-JUNE-JULY 1987 NUMBER 43 AN f ~{t.:,,{~, By lElORO KORDEl cause most doctors focus on treatment, not prevention. The average doctor is a re\u00ad pairman trying to undo the harm people do to themselves. Even if he had the knowl\u00ad edge of nutrition-and wanted to advise\u00ad a doctor's patient load often restricts time for discussion. \"Most patients are intimidated by physi\u00ad cians and are reluctant to discuss nutri\u00ad tional health concerns their doctor doesn't ask about,\" commented Janet R. Maurer, in her book , \"How to Talk to Your Doctor.\" That's where nutritionists come into the picture. And the sincere, but too-busy doc\u00ad tor will advise patients to visit a \"special\u00ad ist\" in nutrition. It saves the doctor's time and is a service to the patient. Other doctors , according to Dr. Maurer, rely on patients to make the first move . \"If a patient shows concern about nutrition and asks questions, most doctors will try to develop a healthful diet ... with a nutrition\u00ad ist's help. But if a doctor is \"r unning an hour or so late\" he cannot overtax his time for lenghty questions. It would be unfair to other patients. So, if you are contemplating a major change in diet, it is best to consult a qual\u00ad ified nutrition expert. \"Unfortunately, many physicians are not accustomed to working with nutritionists or using their services effectively,\" Dr. Levine states.

HEALTH TODAY 1987 29 When bones are packed to maximum density, the body makes withdrawals of calcium to saturate blood and other fluids where it is needed for nerve transmissions , regulating heartbeat, blood clotting, con\u00ad trolling blood pressure and contracting muscles. . So it is plainly clear that the bones act as a \"bank\" to store calcium deposits which are withdrawn daily to meet various bodily needs. If the daily diet provides adequate calcium the reserves in bones are safe from this \"benevolent piracy.\" But few women get enough calcium in the foods they eat. The adult Recommended Daily Allow\u00ad ance (RDA) for calcium is 800 milligrams. But osteoporosis experts state the very minimum needed by women is about double that - at least 1500 milligrams daily. The average woman consumes only about 450 to 500 milligrams per day. Less than one -third her actual requirement. No wonder her body starts leeching huge amounts of calcium from reserves in the bones ... thus inviting disaster through se \u00ad vere -bone mass loss. BANK UP YOUR BONES But getting 1500 milligrams of calcium from foods is easier said than done. It is almost impossible for the modern woman. As a result , most experts recommend that all ~omen use a calcium supplement to ward off osteoporosis and other calcium\u00ad deficiency problems. A helpful suggestion: to increase more efficient absorption of calcium it's a good idea to take a couple teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water at each meal. Use only apple cider vinegar. This provides the acidity calcium requires for its more complete dispersement within the body. It is well to remember that vitamin D helps the body conserve calcium and as\u00ad sists in its absorption. A good calcium sup\u00ad plement will contain the proper amount of this vital factor. CONSERVE YOUR CALCIUM Other steps a woman can take to avoid crippling osteoporosis are: 1. Eliminate heavy smoking and too much alcohol. Both interfere with calcium absorption. 2. Avoid excess soft drinks. Their high phosphorus content can cause rapid calcium depletion. 28 HEALTH TODAY 1987 3. Reduce salt intake. Too much salt speeds greater expulsion of calcium through the urine. 4. Excercise regularly ... it has been proved that modest , weight-bearing excercises such as brisk walking, or bicycling, helps increase bone den\u00ad sity. Jogging is good in moderation. \u00b7 Notice the word moderation . Most professional therapies for osteo\u00ad porosis are identical to the preventive measures cited above . Heed these sage words of Jonathan Stevens: \"Women are wiser than men be\u00ad cause they understand more.\" If his analy\u00ad sis is correct then these \"words to the wise\" women of the world should suffice: Supplement your dai ly diet with extra calcium. Have routine check-ups. Take a pleasant brisk stroll through the park daily. CALCIUM the missing link in nutrition Are you getting enou~h of this vitally lmportant mineral? Here is an exciting new formula CALCIUM \"COMPLEX \" Balanced with MAGNESIUM and VITAMIN D Buffered with CIDER VINEGAR Concentrate This new formula called CALCI-TIME, provides 1,000 mg. of CALCIUM* from six different sources - each one supporting the other.

But it's not. Sir Winston believed in keeping calm during stress and getting a good night's sleep. Actually, thousands of valiant British\u00ad ers slept with Valerian during the stressful and hazardous years of World War 2 . Nightly bombings, worrying about loved ones in battle, working long hours in ar\u00ad mament plants, fighting fires - all con\u00ad tributed to ragged, jangled nerves and many restless, sleepless nights. During those times the herb Valerian served its purpose well ... and naturally. Shakespeare wrote, \"Sleep knits the raveled sleeve of care.\" And when we miss out on a good night's rest ... we tend to be\u00ad come unraveled. SOUND SLEEP Following WW2, chemical industries marketed new, potent \"knock-out\" sleep\u00ad ing drugs. The side effects were intol \u00ad erable. So it's not surprising that the herb Valerian was \"re-discovered\" as the NEW \"saviour for sleeplessness,\" tense people. \"NEW\" even though this magical herb had proved itself for more than 2000 years. Valerian is the most common non\u00ad prescriptio n herb sold throughout the world as a sedative for nerve afflictions , tenseness, anxiety , and sleeping problems. Science is discovering that it eases those minor aches and pains that quickly turn the day into a prison of misery. Joys of living soon return with Valerian. It also is effective for nagging headaches , whether from nerves, muscle cramps, or stresses. Research has confirmed that, for induc\u00ad ing sleep, Valerian is far superior to the many often habit-forming drug-type sleep\u00ad ing pills with their hangover side effects . Recent in-depth studies have shown that Valerian helps people deal with daytime stresses caused by tension, anxiety, jittery nerves. It also assists such people to fall asleep more easily . VALERIAN'S SLEEP SECRET It was professor Hildebert Wagner of the Medical School of Munich University that unlocked the \"sleep secret\" attributed to Valerian . And that \"Valerian a sig\u00ad nificant improvement in the quality of sleep.\" A study was conducted to determine the value of Valerian as a nerve calmant and an anti-stress agent. This study, in Ger\u00ad many, by Dr . E. Stephan, involved driving students. The aim was to find out if people suffering from anxiety and stress did better HEALTH TODAY 1987 5 Feel like new,n 30 days!

The results were most favorable. Con\u00ad centration and proficiency were increased; far fewer mistakes were made. Dr. Ste\u00ad phan's report concludes that those who suf\u00ad fer most from stresses, anxiety, nervous\u00ad ness, sleeplessness, -benefit most from Valerian. Dr. Michael W. Weiner, in his book, states that, in an age of anxiety, when tranquilizing agents reign supreme, it may be wise to reconsider the natural sedative values of Valerian. It is non-narcotic. A natural herb that works 'with' your body, not 'against' it . Valerian is gentle, soothing, helping one to drift away to a deep, full sleep without frequent awakenings that disturb the sleep cycle. THE PLUS OF PASSIFLORA Early in the 16th Century, Spanish ex\u00ad plorers accidentally discovered an herb which they named, Passiflora, or Passion Flower. In writings to loved ones at home, they described the flower. How it helped relax battle weary soldiers. Restored the ability to sleep restfully and calmly. Soon doctors and herbalists began pre\u00ad \u00b7 scribing it as a calmant for nerves. And to overcome insomnia. What patients also discovered is that its amazing properties relieved those minor aches and pains that usually accompany a sleepness night ... or appear as irritants for no known reason. But the great discovery was that Pass\u00ad iflora works synergistically with Valerian. By synergistically, we mean that, when combining two ingredients you gain more than the individual ingredients produce alone. Two and two -equal six -so to speak. Even today Passiflora is still employed medicinally in most sedatives and tran\u00ad quilizers. For centuries Passiflora was a common synonym for \"pain-killer.\" It re\u00ad lieves simple pains so often afflicting the tense body. Please turn page MARY MARTIN, famous stage and screen star, when asked about the 'secret of her endless bounce' had this to say: \"Diet is very important. I eliminate carbohydrates and concentrate on p _rotein, fruit, green salads and vegetables.\" Which is another way of saying that Mis s Martin lives ac\u00ad cording to the principles laid down in Lelord : 'Eat and Grow Younger!' .. , . ' IF YOU'RE a female between ages 11 and 34, the chances are about 50-50 you may have a serious \"calcium problem.\" And, if you're over 35, the odds are 3-to-1 that you already suffer some form of seri\u00ad ous bone disease. Women worldwide have become unsus\u00ad of \"brittle bones\" . .. a syn\u00ad onym for a silent bone disease called OSTEOPOROSIS. Osteoporosis is reaching epidemic lev\u00ad els ... especially in industrial countries. The sad part is that millions of women who have some degree of Osteoporosis - don't know it! Routine X-rays cannot detect \"brittle bones\". And most women show no visible symptoms until the disease reaches its late stage. \u00b7 Osteoporosis aflocts about three out of every four women, causing them to suffer ten times as many serious bone fractures as do men of comparable age. Osteoporosis is the twelfth leading cause of death in the world. CALCIUM IS IMPORTANT But women can take a few simple steps to prevent osteoporosis and avoid this major cause of pai.n, restricted mobility , and life threatening fractures. Osteoporosis was the most urgent topic at a recent health conference. World ex\u00ad perts agreed on the need for more calcium in women's diets if this crippling disease is to be prevented . Other side effects of calcium deficiencies in women cited at the conference were: high blood pressure, irregular heart beat, heart disease, nervousness, insomnia, hy\u00ad pertension, irritability ... and periodontal disease, causing loosening or loss of teeth. Rarely does the average woman get suf\u00ad ficient calcium in her diet to escape some degree of bone -ravaging osteoporosis. Most ha'1e eschewed calcium -rich food sources such as milk, cheese, other dairy products, because of their high calorie content. Don't be a calcium loser * Two million bone fractures occur every year among American women over age 45. Osteoporosis is the single most important cause of these broken bones. * Hip fractures are more common among , women who develop osteoporosis take less cal\u00ad cium than those who don 't have the condition. In light of the facts above, we have double trouble. First, we have millions of people consuming far below the amount of calcium considered adequate. Second, there are strong doubts that our \"adequate level\" is high enough. II is believed that millions.of'American women are taking in LESS THAN HALF of the calcium they need. Frequent dieting, stomach and bowel diseases, glandular problems, medications ,, (including \"The Pill\") - all help to di\u00ad minish calcium reserves. Plus ... as women get older, their intes\u00ad tines may not absorb calcium efficiently from the foods they do eat. HOW \"BRITTLE BONES\" BEGINS Some women, normally proud of , their practical and realistic outlook, still believe in myths about calcium. One such myth is that adults don't need much calcium \"because bones are fully de\u00ad veloped.\" But medical science dispells this fairy tale. Research -has proved that bones are constantly being broken down and re\u00ad built. A perpetual renovation program . Ninety-nine percent of the body's cal\u00ad cium is stored in the bones of the spine, arms, and legs.

Doctors who specialize in the science of aging attribute much needless degeneration of physical and mental vitality after age 40 to a deficiency of certain nutritional elements. When the body DOES NOT get adequate amounts of \"anti-degenerative\" nutrients, health begins to deteriorate. Bones weaken. Organs and cells function poorly. Muscle tissue emaciates. Signs of early aging. It's difficult, with many of today's foods, to get a consistently well-balanced diet. And too, many people, particularly after 40, fail to eat meals with a full quota of nutrients.

HOW FISH CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE Omega-3 and your heart A UNIQUE group of compounds in fish oils has proved powerful protection for the heart. Doctors are urging people to eat more salmon, sardines, other seafoods. Studies reveal just two fish meals a week can substantially reduce risks of heart at- tack. The reason: fish body oils are rich in unsaturated compounds called _Omega-3 fatty acids which alter the blood's chemis\u00ad try to lower incidence of heart disease. Scientists found that Eskimos and Japanese fishermen have a far lower rate of heart disease and high blood pressure problems. What these two groups do differ\u00ad ently from most of us is eat lots of fish ... fresh fish. More evidence was provided when Dutch researchers reported on a 20-y ear study of die'ts for 852 mid-aged men. Those who ate only one ounce of fresh fish daily experi\u00ad enced 50 % fewer heart attacks than those men who ate little or no fish. Further, the more fresh fish the men ate, the less likely they were to experience heart attacks. Why? Those bodily chemical shortages which provoke heart disease may hold an answer. Over the years a sludge-like plaque of cho\u00ad lesterol and other blood fats clings to inner walls of arteries causing them to \"narrow\". As the artery narrows , a clot may cut off blood flow to a portion of the heart - trig\u00ad gering a heart attack. Fish oils can prevent this from occurring in many ways: 1. They lower cholesterol levels - which directly correlates with high risk of heart attack. 2. They change the balance of blood com\u00ad ponents that pile cholesterol on artery walls. 3. They reduce levels of triglycerides - blood fats identified with heart disease. 4. They make blood cells \"less sticky\" pre\u00ad venting clots that lead to heart attacks. At Oregon Health Sciences University, Dr. William Conner , head of the clinical nutrition department, tested fish oils against polyunsaturated vegetable oils - proven cholesterol cutters . Drop for drop, HEALTH TODAY 1987 25 &SEX Essential Nutrient for Normal Sexual Functions Oysters have long been prized as boosters of sexual potency. It turns out that they are rich in an essential nutrient crucial to sex\u00ad ual maturity and fertility. That nutrient is the mineral zinc , needed in the diet to assure normal health and deveiopment. Among the tissues that con\u00ad tain high concentrations of zinc are the prostate gland . Zinc deficiency _ h~s ?~en linked to a low sperm count and mfert1hty . In addition, zinc deficiency during preg\u00ad nancy may produce serious birth defects and fetal loss. Zinc supplements in such cases stimulate sexual maturation , im\u00ad prove fertility and protect the fetus . ENHANCES SEXUALITY Zinc's critical role in normal sexual and reproductive function has become a cause celebre among nutritionists. Concern has focused on the fact that a significant pro\u00ad portion of the population, includ_ing those in middle .and upper-income families, may not be consuming enough zinc. And the mineral is now known to play many vital roles in health, including pro\u00ad tection against infection and possibly cancer. Nutritional surveys of adults indicate that the intake of zinc generally falls below the recommended dietary allowanc e. Meat, liver, eggs, poultry and seafood (especially oysters) are the richest sources of zinc, followed by milk and whole gram products. Vegetarians who consume few or no animal food are especially susceptible to zinc deficiency . In addition to dietary shortages, a num\u00ad ber of health conditions can compromise the body 's zinc supply. Among them are excessive alcohol consumption , cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal arthritis and other inflam\u00ad matory diseases. Zinc supplements can often correct such problems. But, to be most effective, such Zinc supplements should also contain Magnesium and Pyridoxine {B-6) as balancing agents. Tissues of the eye , especially those in\u00ad volved in adapting to the dark , contain high concentrations of zinc. . The mineral also plays a role m the metabolism of insulin , the hormone needed to process sugar in the blood . Zinc speeds the healing of wounds and is also involved in the health of the skin . Zinc taken orally, may be an effective treatment for acne. BALANCED FORMULA Readers who would like to add sup\u00ad plemental Zinc to their diets will be pleased to know that a correctly-balanced Zinc supplement is now available under the name of ZinGO . In addition to Zinc, ZinGO contains Magnesium ridoxine IB-61 which are ess ential to help\u00ad ing Zinc do its maximum job within your bodv.

EVERY SO OFTEN a new \"elixir of youth \" is repoi:ted .. In Maeterlinck's masterful work, The Life of the Bee , he is obviously fascinated by the fact that the queen bee lives 40 to 80 times as long as the drones . The secret of the queen bee's prolonged life is credited to a diet which consists ex\u00ad clusively of a secretion from the pha\u00ad ryngeal glands of young nurse bees , fed exclusively to queens . This glandular sec\u00ad retion, called \"ROYAL JELLY,\" is said to have an almost miraculous power. Scientists have been fascinated to know more about this life-prolonging substance . Upon examination, it was found that Royal Jelly contains so man y of life's vital nutri\u00ad ents that it holds out the promise of re\u00ad taining longer youth for many of today 's oldsters. This promise , although empiric, is certainly worth latching on to! Biologists - and some medical men, too - are so impressed that I have yet to meet one who does not concede the possibility that there is something in Royal Jelly that may be of serious importance to all humanity. A physician in Mexico City is prescribing Royal Jelly for his patients. It is reported that he has a long line outside of his door each mormng awaiting his services . The demand, in Mexico, continues to b e sensational. REJUVENATION PROPERTIES? Rejuvenation tales about Royal Jelly can stir hope for the millions of people over 40. It is prescribed by physicians in France , even though its cost is high. Small doses prescribed for one Frenchman, an oc\u00ad togenarian, have kept him ... amorously . Potency of Royal Jelly is best illustrated by the queen bee, for whose use it is manu\u00ad factured. While the life of worker bees is only forty days , the queen bee lives for several years on Royal Jelly - laying more than her weight in eggs dail y. In a Swiss apiary, one queen reached nine years of egg-laying activity . Honey is principally a carbohydrate , but Royal Jelly is almost pure protein . Larvae fed on honey and pollen develop into workers or drones. Only long-living, repro\u00ad ductive queens feed on Royal Jelly. And what will Royal Jelly do for you? The claims coming out of Mexico, France , Japan and other countries are sensational - yet, there is f;!Vidence in the truly scien\u00ad tific literature to indicate corroboration . For example, the scientist Heyl found that giving Royal Jelly to 21-day-old fe\u00ad male rats caused an increase in follicular activities of the ovaries . By adding Royal Jelly to the diet of fruit flies, the scientists Townsend and Lucas of Canada - caused a marked increase in the rate of reaching sexual maturity and in \u00ad creased number of eggs laid daily by 60 %. Bernard Desouches of France has writ\u00ad ten a book extolling Royal Jelly as a de\u00ad layer of age . Another Frenchman reported on the therapeutic action of Royal Jelly in the medically-supervised treatment of . chronic diseases. Royal Jelly capsules are given to the aging and the aged . turn pag e HEALTH TODAY 1987 9 SCIENTISTS AGREE German scientists, analyzing Royal Jelly, found that it was tremendously rich in pantothenic acid , biotin, and nucleic acid. Deficiency of pantothenic acid exhi\u00ad bits itself in a beefy furrowed tongue, pre\u00ad mature gray hair , and painful , burning feet. In many cases neuritis and indigestion sufferers have found relief by taking sup\u00ad plements of this vitamin. A deficiency of biotin brings on conditions associated with premature aging . Royal Jelly is believed to contain many of the twenty known amino acids, broken down by the bees into their most digestible form to be more completely assimilated by the young bees. Scientists feel that persons who cannot utilize many protein foods can assimilate the proteins of Royal Jelly . VIRTUES NOT FULLY EXPLORED The virtues of Royal Jelly and its possi\u00ad bility in human nutrition have not yet been fully explored -but, for those fortunate enough to obtain it , a brighter tomorrow may or may not lie in its use . As users have reported - they seem to have found brighter days in the indefinable something which their systems may, or seemed to, have drawn from Royal Jelly. I am happy to be living at a time when this wonderful food will be abundantly available to buffer my own passage from maturity to later years. Royal Jelly, along with proper diet, vitamins and minerals, may give me the extra zest for living that will enable me to bring my messages of health for a long, long time to come! Those who are below par physically and mentally - and who have the opportunity to experiment with Royal Jelly may be able to tell whether they have experienced any of the reactions claimed for it. Royal Jelly in convenient capsule form, is available to those who wish to personally experiment with it to find out if it has any of the values claimed for it.

They are intermixing to create even heartier strains. These new breeds of sickness\u00ad makers are taking their toll on previously healthy people .

ATTACKS SICKNESS SOURCE Many physici ans believe th at \"all dis\u00ad eases are due to the deficiency of oxygen. The dangers of an oxygen deficiency in the body cannot be overemphasized . Adequate oxygenation of cells and tissues is vital to effectively extract energies from foods and to air out body tissues. Germanium has proved to be a powerful energy tuner and oxygen booster . It is ca\u00ad pable of substantially improving the health and energies of the sick . As well as sustaining health and energy of th e healthy. Germanium serves as an oxygen catalyst allowing cells to better utilize available oxygen. Increasing numbers of people are becoming oxygen deficient ... perhaps due to pollutions and poisons in the air. The foods we eat, water we drink, chemi\u00ad cals we consume all can contribute to hyp\u00ad oxia ~oxygen deficiency) which, in turn, contributes to ill-health. ger-ma-n1-um (jer-ma~ne-em) The mineral that helps the body help itselt. n. 1. a unique mineral plentiful in living things. 2. shown to have a wide range of positive influ\u00ad ences on human health. 3. a dramatic enhancer of resistance to disease.

IMPROVES IMMUNITIES Germanium has been reveal ed to act as an immune cell stimulator . What this means is that the immume syst em pro\u00ad duces white blood cells -(natural killer cells) -Macrophages and T-Cells . These substances help the body protect itself against viruses, bacteria, other body invaders . Many scientists hail Germanium as the most important natural immune\u00adenhancing agent known today ENERGY EFFICIENT The body requires a lot of energy to fight off infectious invaders.

It also appears to help moderate blood pressure by raising it when too low and lowering it when too high. Since high blood pressure, if left unattended, can lead to heart attacks, this function alone is well worth considering getting more Ger\u00ad manium into one's diet. BONES AND BEAUTY One thing that excites medical prac\u00ad titioners is that Germanium appears to increase density of the bones -thus help \u00ad ing to reduce bone losses due to osteo\u00ad porosis. Further studies regarding the den\u00ad sifying of bones may finally offer a total solution to aging and excessive bone losses. PAIN AND POISONS When you're in pain, the body sends a message to the brain receptors which, in turn, release analgesics - pain killers - to restore normalcy to the body and elimin\u00ad ate or reduce pa in. Germanium seems to cause these brain receptors to become more sensitive to the body's cry of pain . The result: You need not suffer as long and minor bodily discomforts are quickly vanished . You feel your 'old self again.' Detoxifying the human body is essential to good health and Germanium can help do that. It has the ability to neutralize heavy metal toxins and harmful metabolic wastes by binding itself to these substances and flushing them out of the body. TIDINGS OF TOMORROW Currently, more than 30 hospitals and universities are conducting studies as to the therapeutic effects of Germanium on digestive organs, lymphomas and leu\u00ad kemias, respiratory problems , arthritis, osteoporosis, hepatitis , hearing problems, -as well as collagen diseases - to name a few. Germanium's healing powers may be at\u00ad tributed to the fact that it brings about sharp increases in the body's supply of oxy\u00ad gen.

Convenient to use when working , traveling, playing . HEALTH TODAY 1987 19 important as what you DO. What Kordel recommends is a whole\u00ad some way of living. He does not advocate any one miracle food . Nor does he claim that if you eat \"X\" bread and drink \"Y\" liquid you will be cured of the incurable or become an over\u00ad night sensation. He deplores the term, \"faddist.\" \"Fad\u00ad dism,\" he explains, \"indicates something transitory or short-lived .\" There is nothing short-term about good . nutrition if you want to add life and vitality to all your years. Especially the later ones. BALANCED DIET VITAL Lelord Kordel believes in maintaining at all times a balanced diet which incor\u00ad porates all the vitamins, minerals and other factors. He recommends a high protein diet bal\u00ad anced with fresh fruits and vegetables (fro\u00ad zen are permissible) and whole grain cereals. Honey and molasses are the rec\u00ad ommended sweeteners. Questioned about vitamin supplements, Kordel advised, \"They should never be used in place of food. But, to be on the nutritionally safer side, it is advisable to use them. \"I can understand poor nutrition in some countries where food is not abundant and available to the people, but here,\" he mourned, \"where food is so plentiful, it doesn't make sense.\" His own meals are high in protein, bal\u00ad anced with generous portions of salads made with fresh, leafy greens. Fruit and/or cheese invariably the desserts. Occasion \u00ad ally, the fruit may be tossed in a very small amount of light cream to enhance the flavor, but, because of the extremely high fat content, cream should not be poured over fruit. ADVOCATES EXERCISE Lelord Kordel is also an advocate of ex\u00ad ercise as the perfect and natural com \u00ad panion of proper nourishment. He will frequently park his car as much as two miles away from his destination to get the benefit of that excellent and available-to-all exercise - walking. When at home, he uses a special Schwinn/Aerodyne stationary bicycle to do ten miles each day - five miles in the morning and another five miles in the evening. He offers this suggestion to all weight watchers: \"Resist that tempting, last mouthful that you really do not need or want, but eat just because it is in front of you.\" \"How can the average person get . the nutrition-for-health message in just a few simple words?\" I asked Lelord Kordel. His closing words were: \"If, when at the table, one followed this basic rule, it would pay enormous health dividends. The Basic Rule: \"First eat the foods your body re\u00ad quires for good health, Then, eat the foods you want- even if they do not contribute to overall nutrition. Chan\u00ad ces are, by the time you will have eaten the foods your body requires -there will be very little room (or desire) for foods you thought you wanted.\" --------------------------------~ 'LELORD KORDEL ' Redford Box 19268 I Detroit, Michigan 48219 U.S.A. I Indeed I want you to continue with your work of helping people around the world. Enclosed in my contribution to the Lelord Kordel Research Fund. Name_ _____________________ ________ 1987 I ) John D. Rockefeller was worth millions but, due to ill hea!th, was c~mpelled to exist on milk and toast. Often he said he would gladly give half his fortune to enjoy one good solid meal. These are stressful times .. In the struggle of today, are you neglecting your health? Do you feel you are immune to the hundreds of diseases that attack the body? Why take chances? Learn how to care for YOUR MILLION DOLLAR BODY IF A FEDERAL tax were assessed on our bodies according to their worth , would you know how to compute the sum you would have to pay? \u00b7 How would you go about determining what your body is worth in dollars and cents? By \"worth\" we mean the actual economic value, not its chemical value . It's easy to ascertain the value of chemi\u00ad cal substances contained in the human body. In fact, an American chemist esti\u00ad mated the average human body would bring about $28 .00* to $30.00* for the chemicals it contains. (*U.S. Dollars as of August 1987). But although your body may be worth only $28.00 in chemical content , its value to you as a \"going concern\" totals some hundreds of thousands of dollars. Maybe even more than a million dollars. This investment started accumulating the day you were born; the day your brain and muscles began to develop. Your body represents cash money. \"How much of an investment does my body represent?\" you may ask. It's easy enough to calculate what any person's body is worth ... at least in round figures . CALCULATE YOUR WORTH Here's a simple and fast way to estimate your \"cash value\". Total up all your income tax forms to date. Then estimate your future income until the time you expect to retire (adding about 10% increase in salary per year). To this, estimate and add your expected re\u00ad tirement income. You'll be surprised to find YOU are worth a million dollars or more. This is your body's \"hard cash\" value! Not to mention t he \"hard cash value\" your continued good health has on your family. For example: If you remain in good health you can earn more without losing money for sick days. After all , sickness costs cash. If you can earn more, chances are your children can go to college and they, in turn, reap a \"hard cash\" value from your con\u00ad tinued good health. Anyone not receiving a direct salary - but performing such tasks that save money - would calculate his or her total economic worth by estimating the normal salary paid by firms for performing similar tasks. Again ... it adds tip to a veritable fortune. GUARDING YOUR INVESTMENT With a million dollars in cash or bonds in your pockets, would you set out each morn\u00ad ing to deliberately try to lose or depreciate that sum? Of course not. If you owned a $500,000.00 building which brought you a weekly income of, let's say, $1,000.00 would you neglect the structure? Worse yet, would you deliberately weaken its foundation, tear down its par\u00ad titions, or deface its interior or exterior? Certainly not. If your tenant told you the roof was cav\u00ad ing in, or the foundation was crumbling, would you hesitate sending a repairman to protect your investment? Again, the an\u00ad swer is no. Economically, your body is equivalent to cash money in the pocket or purse; it is the. same as any other investment. Yet, what do many of us do? We turn a deaf ear to all advice about proper maintenance of the body ... our million-dollar money-maker. Or, knowing what is needed, we start pinching pennies and decide we \"can't afford\" to protect our multi-dollar investment . Please turn page HEALTH TODAY 1987 15 Your Million Dollar Body -versus the Cost of Diet Supplements If a $500,000.00 building n'eeded only $10.00 per week upkeep, the owner would feel as though he had gotton off \"mighty lucky.\" Yet that same person may likely feel that $10.00 weekly was an extravagantly high sum to spend on special nutrients for the \"upkeep\" of his/her own body. In later years that person would see nothing ironical about paying thousands of dollars in hospital and doctors' bills. To say nothing about months of acute suffering and invalidism . Inconsistent creatures, aren't we? THE UPKEEP IS LOW No one should hesitate to spend a gener\u00ad ous portion of his net worth for health\u00ad building concentrates and vitamin\u00ad mineral food supplements. A person with a modest weekly income of $200.00 could easily afford to spend at least $10.00 a week to protect his/her priceless body. This would amount to only pennies a day to fuel a body that earns thousands per year. An excellent return for a. small investment. A wise investor will spend more to in\u00ad crease the value of his original investment so it can bring increased dividends or income. The expenditure of a few cents a day for vitamins, minerals , and other supplements can mean the increase of your total eco\u00ad nomic value. Your earning powers and opportunity for advancement will be greater because you feel better. Think more objectively. Are alert to opportunity. Have more vitality, greater endurance. Such \"plus\" values are assets (worth money) to any company. \u00b7 N atilrally, to justify a higher salary you will have to contribute more in knowledge . Accept more responsibility. Expend more energy. In order to withstand this extra strain, your body must be fortified and strengthened. Your mind must be kept keen and sharp. Correct nutrition will help do this for you. Your employer is not a charitable soul who pays a salary because he wants to ke!:!p you off the bread line. He pays you what he thinks your services are now worth ... and what worth they will be to the business in the future . And how does he judge your total value? You guessed it. SPEND TO EARN MORE By the way you perform your job .. And to be able to consistently \"do a good job\" your body must be in tip-top condition. So, again, give your body, the vitamins , min\u00ad erals and other food supplements it should have on a regular basis. That is what we call nutritional insurance. It is also insur\u00ad ance for your continued earning power. As a closing suggestion: If you are not now using a good, and truly complete, vitamin-mineral food supplement -you might consider Lelord Kordel's NUTRI\u00ad TIME (in addition to whatever other indi\u00ad vidual nutrients you decide are importa .nt to you). *Please note: The reference : to U.S. Dollars is for purposes of illustration only.

LELORD KORDEL THE auditorium was filled to overflowing, the audience listening intently to the man on the lecture platform . He is Lelord Kordel, the internationally\u00ad famous nutritionist , lecturer and author of 19 books on food and its relation to healthy living. Suddenly, Kordel made a most extra\u00ad ordinary, even astonishing, statement. He said that never in his life had he known physical illness . This fact he attri\u00ad buted to his unwavering devotion to proper nutrition. He insists that it is unnatural to be sick. When questioned later about childhood diseases and the common cold, he dis\u00ad claimed ever having suffered from them . FOOD FOR THOUGHT The impact of Lelord Kordel's initial declaration that he had never known the pain of physical illness caused me to con\u00ad sider several things . Conceive, if you can, of people not buying laxatives . Or anthihistamines. Or aspirins for colds. Not needing any of the mycins or penicillin . And not requiring any of the myriad other wonder drugs . Imagine having bodies so adequately nourished that they resist infections . IMPRESSED WITH INTERVIEW Subsequently, I interviewed Lelord Kordel and was impressed with his obvious sincerity and the common sense of his suggestions . He is an affable, pleasant man . His trim figure displays absolutely no paunchiness, in spite of the fact that he is in his early \u00b7B0's. He looks more like 50 . . LELORD KORDEL -worldfamous nutrition expert. Author of 20 books on food and its relation to health and longer, more vital living.(1987 photo) His expectation -barring accidents - is to live to be 120, still without pain or illness. Lelord Kordel feels it is never too late to start on the pathway to better health and greater happiness through proper eating. Nor is it ever too soon, he believes, if you want to add years to your life and give life to these years. SIMPLE PRESCRIPTIC.,r-l His prescription for adding years toy~~, life is comparatively simple and readily understandable . It involves what most people will concede is one of the great pleasures of life: ea' \u00b7 \u00b7, ~-. Not; of course, indiscriminate eating, be\u00ad cause what you DO NOT eat is equally as HEALTH TODAY 1987 17 DON'T MISS THIS EXCITING SPECTACULAR! STEP INTO AUTUMN Are you getting enough of this important mineral - or are you one of the 98% who, according to Dr. Henry C. Sherman of Columbia University, are woe fully lacking in CALCIUM? Women, especially, should read this very important article. IF YOU'RE a female between ages 11 and 34, the chances are about 50-50 you may have a serious \"calcium problem .\" And, if you're over 35, the odds are 3-to-1 that you already suffer some form of seri\u00ad ous bone disease. Women worldwide have become unsus\u00ad of \"brittle bones\" . .. for a silent bone disease called QSTEOPOROSIS. Osteoporosis is reaching epidemic Jev\u00ad els ... especially in industrial countries . The sad part is that millions of women who have some degree of Osteoporosis - don't know it! Routine X -rays cannot detect \"brittle bones\". And most women show no visible symptoms until the disease reaches its late stage. Osteoporosis affects about three out of every four women, causing them to suffer ten times as many serious bone fractures as do men of comparable age . Osteoporosis is the twelfth leading cause of death in the world. CALCIUM IS IMPORTANT But women can take a few simple steps to prevent osteoporosis and avoid this major cause of pain, restricted mobility, and life threatening fractures. Osteoporosis was the most urgent topic at a recent health conference . World ex\u00ad perts agreed on the need for more calcium in women's diets if this crippling disease is to be prevented. Other side effects of calcium deficiencies in women cited at the conference were : high blood pressure, irregular heart beat, heart disease, nervousness, insomnia, hy\u00ad pertension, irritability ... and periodontal disease, causing loosening or Joss of teeth. \u00b7 Rarely does the average woman get suf\u00ad ficient calcium in her diet to escape some degree of bone-ravaging osteoporosis. Most have eschewed calcium-rich food sources such as milk, cheese, other dairy products , because of their high calorie content . Don't be a calcium loser * Two million bone fractures occur every year among American women over age 45. \u00b7 Osteoporosis is the single most important cause of these broken bones. * Hip fractures are more common among , women who develop osteoporosis take less cal\u00ad cium than those who don't have the condition. In light of the facts above, we have double trouble. First, we have millions of people consuming far below the amount of calcium considered adequate. Second, there are strong doubts that our \"adequate level\" is high enough. It is believed that millions of American women are taking in LESS THAN HALF of the calcium they need. Frequent dieting, stomach and bowel diseases, glandular problems, medications, (including \"The Pill\") - all help to di\u00ad minish calcium reserves. Plus ... as women get older , their intes\u00ad tines may not absorb calcium efficiently from the foods they do eat . HOW \"BRITTLE BONES\" BEGINS Some women , normally proud of their practical and realistic outlook, still believe in myths about calcium . One such myth is that adults don't need much calcium \"because bones are fully de\u00ad veloped.\" But medical science dispells this fairy tale. Research has proved that bones are constantly being broken down and re\u00ad built. A perpetual renovation program. Ninety-nine percent of the body's cal \u00ad cium is stored in the bones of the spine, arms, and legs. (please turn pag e) h When bones are packed to maximum density, the body makes withdrawals of calcium to saturate blood and other fluids where it is needed for nerve transmissions, regulating heartbeat, blood clotting, con\u00ad trolling blood pressure and contracting muscles. So it is plainly clear that the bones act as a \"bank\" to store calcium deposits which are withdrawn daily to meet various bodily needs. If the daily diet provides adequate calcium the reserves in bones are safe from this \"benevolent piracy.\" But few women get enough calcium in the foods they eat. The adult Recommended Daily Allow\u00ad ance (RDA) for calcium is 800 milligrams. But osteoporosis experts state the very minimum needed by women is about double that - at least 1500 milligrams daily. The average woman consumes only about 450 to 500 milligrams per day . Less than one-third her actual requirement . No wonder her body starts leeching huge amounts of calcium from reserves in the bones ... thus inviting disaster through se\u00ad vere bone mass loss. BANK UP YOUR BONES But getting 1500 milligrams of calcium from foods is easier said than done. It is almost impossible for the modem woman. As a result, most experts recommend that all women use a calcium supplement to ward off osteoporosis and other calcium\u00ad deficiency problems. A helpful suggestion: to increase more efficient absorption of calcium it's a good idea to take a couple teaspoons of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water at each meal. Use only apple cider vinegar. This provides the acidity .calcium requires for its more complete dispersement within the body. It is well to remember that vitamin D helps the body conserve calcium and as\u00ad sists in its absorption .. A good calcium sup\u00ad plement will contain the proper amount of this vital factor. CONSERVE YOUR CALCIUM Other steps a woman can take to avoid crippling osteoporosis are: 1. Eliminate heavy smoking and too much alcohol. Both interfere with calcium absorption. 2. A void excess soft drinks. Their high phosphorus content can cause rapid calcium depletion. 3. Reduce salt intake. Too mu'ch salt speeds greater expulsion of calcium through the urine . 4. Excercise regularly .. .it has been proved that modest, weight-bearing excercises such as brisk walking, or bicycling, helps increase bone den\u00ad sity. Jogging is good in moderation. Notice the word moderation. Most professional therapies for osteo\u00adporosis are identical to the preventive measures cited above. Heed these sage words of Jonathan Stevens: \"Women are wiser than men be\u00adcause they understand more .\" If his analy\u00ad sis is correct then these \"words to the wise\" women of the world should suffice: Supplement your daily diet with extra calcium. Have routine check-ups : Take a pleasant brisk stroll through the park daily. CALCIUM the missing link in nutrition Are you getting enough of this vitally lmportant mineral? Here is an exciting new formula CALCIUM .. COMPLEX ' Balanced with MAGNESIUM and VITAMIN D Buffered with CIDER VINEGAR Concentrate This new formula called CALCI-TIME, provides 1,000 mg. of CALCIUM* from six different sources - each one supportin~ the other.

Switzerland Develops COMBAT CONSTIPATION A CLEAN COLON HELPS New Herbal Elixir SPLEEN ''B10-STRATH'' TMVROIC MINERAL'-... By Dr. William Strathmeyer Swiss Bio-Chemist who believes that only natural herbs are good enough for present .day humanity. o:;~~::;:~ GLANDS ASTHMA We have the greatest news for you!-Recently one of our associ\u00ad ates was traveling through Europe and stopped overnight in Zurich, Switzerland. As many travelers do, he started talking to one of the hotel employees, who, it developed, was a natural-organic food enthusiast. Out of this conversation came an unexpected discovery. The hotel employee literally raved about an Herbal-Elixir prod\u00ad uct that was made in Switzerland -about 20 miles up the lake from the hotel. His story was so inter\u00ad esting that our associate decided to stay an extra day and investi\u00ad gate this fantastic product. The next day he contacted the manufacturer, and was allowed to visit the plant. In this small fac\u00ad tory, set into the Swiss Alps, em\u00adployees were busy feeding 88 dif\u00ad ferent \u00b7 varieties of organically grown herbs to vats of growing yeast cells. Yes, 88 different plants actually being fed slowly and sepa\u00ad rately-without heat-to a living mixture of cells.

It turns out that they are rich in an essential nutrient crucial to sex\u00ad ual maturity and fertility. That nutrient is the mineral zinc , needed in the diet to assure normal health and development. Among the tissues that con\u00ad tain high concentrations of zinc a re the prostate gland. Zinc deficiency has been linked to a low sperm count and infertility. In addition , zinc deficiency during preg\u00ad nancy may produce serious birth defects an.d fetal loss . Zinc supplements in such cases stimulate sexual maturation , im\u00ad prove fertility and protect the fetus. ENHANCES SEXUALITY Zinc's critical role in normal sexual and reproductive function has become a cause celebre among nutritionists . Concern has focused on the fact that a significant pro\u00ad portion of the population, including those in middle and upper-income families, may not be consuming enough zinc . And the mineral is now known to play many vital roles in health, including pro\u00ad tection against infection and possibly cancer. Nutritional surveys of adults indicate that the intake of zinc generally falls below the recommended dietary allowance. Meat, liver, eggs, poultry and seafood (especially oysters) are the richest sources of zinc, followed by milk and whole grain products. Vegetarians who consume few or no animal food are especially susceptible to zinc deficiency . In addition to dietary shortages, a num\u00ad ber of health conditions can compromise the body's zinc supply. Among them are excessive alcohol consumption , cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal inflam\u00ad matory diseases . Zinc supplement s can often correct such problems. But, to be most effective, such Zinc supplements should also contain Magnesium and Pyridoxine <B-6) as balancing agents. Tissues of the eye , especially those in\u00ad volved in adapting to the dark, contain high concentrations of zinc. The mineral also plays a role in the metabolism of insulin , the hormone needed to process sugar in the blood. Zinc speeds the healing of wounds and is also involved in the health of the skin. Zinc taken orally, may be an effective treatment for acne. BALANCED FORMULA Readers who would like to add sup\u00ad plemental Zinc to their diets will be pleased to know that a correctly-balanced Zinc supplement is now available under the name of ZinGO.

And many people accept indigestion and all its discomforts as a sort of necessary evil. But indigestion is not normal. You're supposed to be able to eat all you want, of all the foods you like -within reason, of course-without paying the p a i n f u l penalty of a \"stomach-ache.\" Of course, it is true that chronic indigestion may be caused by a num\u00ad ber of serious organic diseases _ But clinical statistics indicate that ap\u00ad proximately 700 out of 1,000 dyspep- tics suffer because their digestive system, i t s e 1 f, is not functioning properly. CHEMICAL \"SPARK PLUGS\" A motor in an automobile which isn't performing as it should, is not necessarily ready for the junk pile . There may be nothing seriously wrong with it. All it may need is new spark plugs. The motor simply can't burn the gasoline properly . It becomes choked with undigested fuel. But equipped with new or clean<=d-up spark plugs , it will run like new. To be efficiently digested , the food we consume requires a lot of \"spark could eat generous portions of the most nourishing foods, and not only would you fail to digest them, but you would starve to death. Beefsteak, a favorite protein food, will remain u n dig e gt e d in your stomach and intestines until enzymes in the digestive tract break it down into amino acids, which are used to replace worn-out body tissues. The starch in potatoes and bread cannot be digested until it is con\u00ad verted into glucose-a body sugar. Butter, bacon, salad oils, and other fats will remain undigested until they have been converted into fatty acids. In this way, all the foods we eat are finally digested-broken down or reduced into the essential nutrients of life. THE GREAT \"BELLYACHE\" A normally functioning digestive system manufactures its own en\u00ad zymes, hydrochloric acid, and bile. Occasionally, however, one or more of the enzymatic secretions fall below par . Or, we may, temporarily, \"take in too big a load\" for the enzymes to handle. Sometimes, as age increases, enzymatic secretions may b e c o m e chronically inadequate. When such conditions occur, not o_nly do we fail to get the full bene ,\u00ad f1 t of the food we eat, but we suffer indigestion and gastrointestinal dis\u00ad tress-bloating, \"heartburn,\" cramps, flatulence, and other uncomfortable symptoms of \"dyspepsia.\" A SUPPLEMENT FOR RELIEF When overindulgence in food , or inadequate secretion of the digestive enzymes occurs, and is the cause of gastrointestinal distress, an enzyma\u00ad tic digestant supplement may bring relief. TRIO-ZYME Tablets have been es\u00ad pecially formulated for this purpose. TRIO-ZYME Tablets have been so designed that the enzymes and other substances in the formula are released in the intestinal tract to help \"sweet\u00ad en\" it-while aiding the more com\u00ad plete digestion of foods . AIDS DIGESTION OF ALL FOODS This is as comprehensive a digestant supplement as the science of biochem\u00ad istry makes possible today. The digestive effectiveness of TRIO\u00ad ZYME Tablets is not limited to protein, or carbohydrate, or fat , alone. It is an all inclusive digestant aiding in the conversion of all three components of foods. A WARNING Please understand that occasional, frequent, or chronic functional indiges\u00ad tion cannot be corrected by swallowing ordinary anti-acid tablets, containing bicarbonate of soda which, incidentally, if taken too frequently, will do more harm than good. Or tablets containing aluminum hy\u00ad droxide, or other chemicals which na\u00ad ture does not use in natural digestive processes. These can only bring you temporary relief. The way to control indigestion, due to a lack of the natural enzymes secreted by the body, is to replace them with nature's own digestants, as pres\u00ad ent in TRIO-ZYME Tablets. Best of all, TRIO-ZYME Tablets are a natural food. Not a medicine. Not a drug. Very pleasant to take. At all Vital Foods Stores or by mail.

Pollen is fantas\u00ad tically rich in nutritionally important sub\u00ad stances such as proteins, vitamins, amino acids and minerals. Bees gather pollen in microscopic amounts and bring it to the hive for food. Bees naturally collect only the healthiest, most nutritive pollens, ig\u00ad noring those poorly endowed. Pollen col\u00ad lected by bees passes one of nature's most strenuous quality control tests! In the process of collecting anti depositing pollen in the hive, bees treat the pollen by adding a small amount of nectar to it, forming it into tiny granules to make it manageable. As a by-product, this nectar eliminates any possibility of the pollen producing an adverse reaction in humans, and also keeps it pure. SOME INTERESTING FACTS: Swedish physicians regu\u00ad larly give BEE POLLEN and hundreds of U.S. doctors are now doing the same. BEE POL\u00ad LEN is rich in Zinc, an all\u00ad important element no longer found in adequate quantities in much of America's soil. e BEE POLLEN is being used effectively in building immu\u00ad nities to many allergies. BEE POLLEN contains more available protein than beef, eggs and cheese. BEE POLLEN contains at least 12 essential vitamins and 10 necessary minerals . A U.S. Olympic gold medal\u00ad ist says he takes BEE POLLEN tablets three times a day for more energy and increased stamina. e BEE POLLEN, a completely natural substance, may safely replace dangerous synthetic drugs as an all around readily available and concentrated form of nutritional energy , Bee Pollen Granules Sprinkle over cereals, des\u00ad serts, add to liquids, use ir , cooking -or eat \"as is.\" Delicious over ice cream. 4 oz. $5.95 German research has indi\u00ad cated that BEE POLLEN may be helpful in alleviating the harmful effects produced by stress of all k inds, from that of a marital argument to the after effects of radiation therapy.

Regular use of BEE POLLEN should add a healthy glow to the way one looks without cosmetics. BEE POLLEN has long been used in many European health regimens.

Heh~ never been ill, and has mo~ ~tality than many men of half his age . Lelord Kordel 1s his_ own best advertisement. In this article the famous nutrition expert and author reveals his remarkably simple formula for nutritional good health. h your way of eating may be ~dding up troubles you'll collect all at once -so check up right now! This very minute, a \"burglar\" in the form of nutritional deficien\u00ad cy may be stealing away a bit of your health -and you are prob\u00ad abJy doing nothing about it! In fact, you may even be an accom\u00ad plice to the crime! Shocking? Yes! But so damagingly true! Your food may be killing you. When you eat food that does not contain some 50 life-sustaining elements: vitamins, minerals and other nut\u00ad rients, you are robbing your body of part of its natural good health. If you are punishing yourself with \"flabby\" foods that have very little nutritional value .. . do you think you are doing your health any good? Try running your car on a mixture of half gasoline-half water and see how far you can go. Doctors' flies throughout the world include many cases of persons suf\u00ad fering ill health due to nutritional deficiencies . Countless other people go through their daily lives feeling run-down and tired, hardly realizing that their way of eating can be the cause of so much trouble . Marriage counsellors indicate that thousands of homes are broken up yearly because of tempers brought to the boiling point. In many of these instances, the \"loving couple\" had neglected their bodies' nutritional needs to the point where the nervous system had been affected . Divorce often has its start at the table! Watch the Danger Signals! The real danger of poor nutrition catches up with its victims when sickness strikes. A person may be getting enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food he eats to give him \"passable\" health . But may not be getting enough to keep him in the most favorable con\u00ad dition to withstand the strain of sickness. In certain infectious dis\u00ad eases, nutritional instability becom -es a contributing factor to physical breakdown. What's the answer? You were meant to be healthy . You were born to live a lot longer than most people do. Behind the scenes of your human body is a remarkable mechanism ready to serve you with glowing good health for many, many years - if you give it the proper care and fuel it needs. If you want to really live - in\u00ad stead of just existing - you must keep your body in good nutritional health. Let me tell you something you can do to protect your nutritional health ... something which may have never occurred to you. Many of the foods you are compel\u00ad led to eat may fill you up . .. but they cannot, will not, do not . . . build proper nutritional health. Why is this so?

Take famous \"NUTRI-TIME\" to be sure! The answer is a simple one: Many modern foods look good, but they may not contain enough of all the necessary substances needed for nutritional super health. Therefore ... If you cannot be sure of getting all these necessary substances from your everyday diet ... you must get them from outside the diet. Anything that supplies the essen\u00ad tial substances to the diet from out\u00ad side the diet - is \"an accessory to the diet.\" Do I recommend any special acces\u00ad sory to the diet? I most certainly do! I recommend-and use myself-what I consider to be one of the truly su\u00ad perior food supplements ... sold under the name of NUTRI-TIME . NUTRI-TIME is a mitritional food supplement that contains more than 50 nutrients.

NOTE: Statements in this article may not reflect consensus of medical opinion Don't Let Eyestrain Shorten Your life TOO MANY persons feed their sto\u00ad machs, yet starve their eyes! They forget a poorly-fed eye is the one that burns, becomes bloodshot, and sees ob\u00ad jects through a gray mist of dimming vision. If the heavy strain put upon our eyes by modern living -(movies, televi\u00ad sion, \u00b7long hours urider glaring artifi\u00ad cial lights, smoky atmosphere) -is to be overcome, we must stop thinking of the eyes as merely two highly useful \"mechanical\" devices set on either side of the nose for our convenience. Instead, we must treat the eyes as the vital parts of the body they are. And, like every other part of the hu\u00ad man body, the eyes must be properly nourished. Many an automobile tragedy could be traced to a deficiency of vitamin A which can cause \"night blindness,\" an Inability of the eyes to adjust from light to dark and vice-versa . Another serious visual problem, \"twilight blindness,\" or difficulty seeing in dim light, can be caused by a shortage of riboflavin In the diet. Insurance companies say the greatest number of accidents occur during this twilight period. Otherwise, they will break down and age prematurely. When this occurs, medical science has found that the resulting eyestrain frequently exerts a tremendous influ\u00ad ence on shortening of life. Since none of us can turn back the calendar to days of soft lights and slow living, the only way we can protect our eyes against the rigorous demands put upon them, is to fortify the eyes by means of proper food elements in con\u00ad centrated form . An eye starved for two of these very vital food elements -riboflavin and vitamin A -is the eye that can\u00ad not withstand the strain of a speeded\u00ad up civilization where electric lights, fine-print, glaring movie screens, tele\u00ad vision are a part ofour every-day Ii ves. Subjecting the eyes to such visual hazards without feeding them correct\u00ad ly is like insisting a half-starved wretch run a marathon race! EYESTRAIN SHORTENS LIFE All men and women who subject their eyes to close work should realize they are likely to shorten their lives through pro\u00ad longed eyestrain -unless they keep their eyes in good health through proper feeding of the eye nerves and muscles. \u00b7 How can eyestrain shorten life? The United States Public Health Service ' studied the health records of 65,000 per\u00ad sons earning their living in industries where tiny ,precision parts are assembled as, for instance , manufacturing of watches and optical instruments. These persons were chosen because their work is typical of the highly exhausting work performed by millions of other men and women in home, office and factory. The findings of this sur\u00ad vey were astounding: Within a five-year period, almost 80% of the deaths occurring in this group resulted from heart disease. The conclusion was that the strain put upon the brain, as well as upon the nerves and muscles of a body made tense because of eye fatigue, even\u00ad tually weakens the he!lrt, Obviously, the need to earn a Jiving or perform certain homecrafts is not going to change for most ofus. So, the only sensible thing for us to do is to avoid eyestrain and the health hazards it creates and streng\u00ad then the eyes to meet the fatiguing de\u00ad mands put upon them at least 16 hours out of every 24. In other words, the eyes must be fed. How? Through using a food supplement contain\u00ad ing both vitamin A and riboflavin in scien\u00ad tific proportions- balanced with a catalyst to help these 'two vitamins do the right job, where your eyes are concerned. VITAMIN A AN EYE CHEMICAL Most persons have become familiar with vitamin A as the \"eye vitamin.\" Why is this true? When the eyes see an object they practic\u00ad ally duplicate the function of the ordinary camera, that is, the image picked up by the lens of the eyes is likewise recorded on a \"film,\" and then must be \"developed\" by means of a chemical. This chemical de\u00ad veloper used by the body in developing the photographic images on the eye is called rhodopsin . When there is not enough vitamin A in the body, rhodopsin, the chemical develop\u00ad er, gradually bleaches out and becomes weak and inefficient. Lack of enough vita\u00ad min A causes the rhodopsin to be become bleached out of the eyes, with the result that eyesight becomes impaired. VITAMIN A PREVENTS NIGHT BLINDNESS Light of any kind, either daylight or arti\u00ad ficial, uses up the rhodopsin in the eyes. And if anyone could be totally deprived of Continued on page following vitamin A,, it ~ouldn't be long before that person would become totally sightless - blind! But what mostly happens is that we manage to get just enough vitamin A in our diets to keep the eyes working in a hapha\u00ad zard fashion. We seldom get all the vitamin A needed to keep the eyes operating in tip-top shape. One sure sign there is not enough vita\u00ad min A in the diet is when the eyes are unable to adjust easily from light to dark\u00ad ness -when glaring lights cause momen\u00ad tary blindness, when a sudden change from sunlight to a darkened room leaves a per\u00ad son groping blindly in the pitch-blackness. Even a split second of such blindness is enough to cause a traffic accident, or a dan\u00ad gerous fall over an unseen object in a dark room. Nothing counteracts this \"night\u00ad blindness\" like vitamin A . Medical science has long recognized this, and most of us have been educated to the fact of\"vitamin A for the eyes.\" RIBOFLAVIN VITAL, TOO But what many persons have not yet learned is that riboflavin is equally vital in maintaining healthy eyes! In fact, many persons ~ho have used vitamin A supple\u00ad ments faithfully failed to derive the ex\u00ad ~ected benefits, because they neglected to include riboflavin in their health program for the eyes. Why is riboflavin so essential for the eyes? Because the eyes, unlike other bodily or~ans, lack the blood vessels to carry off poisonous wastes created when the eye cells burn oxygen. And so Nature made provisions for riboflavin to chemically re\u00ad move the harmful waste materials of the eye in a mysteriously wonderful way! BLOODSHOT EYES, A SYMPTOM But, if the body does not receive enough riboflavin to supply all that the eyes need to detoxify them, then Nature must provide a ml!keshift means of clearing the eyes of this poisonous waste. To do this, kind Mother Nature creates hundreds of tiny blood vessels in the cornea (white of the eye) as an emergency mea\u00ad sure. And, when this happens, we say our \u00b7 s dimming your sight eyes are \"bloodshot.\" Hundreds of emergency vessels that should never have been there, are there because not enough riboflavin was avail\u00ad able to keep our eyes clear. As a result of too little riboflavin, the eyes become extremely sensitive to glare; they water and itch; and there is a rough, sandy feeling under the lids. In other words the eyes suffer from what oculists call \"co~eal vascularization\". WHICH VITAMIN DO YOU NEED How can you tell which of these two vital eye vitamins -A or riboflavin -are se- riously lacking in your system? \u00b7 There is no absolutely sure way to know without consulting a specialist whose office is equipped with two highly technical in\u00ad struments: the biophotometer to tell if you are deficient in vitamin A, and the slit\u00ad lamp to see if you need more riboflavin, Yet these two highly complex machines are seldom found in the offices of \"eye doc\u00ad tors,\" and this is particularly true of the biophotometer. NO GUESSWORK IN THESE To take the guesswork out of correcting malnutrition of the eyes, Lelord Kordel has developed a tablet containing both vitamin A and riboflavin in scientifically deter\u00ad mined amounts. Then, to these vitamins he added an herb known as eyebright which contains an aerid principle used in diseases of the eye. Dr. Leclerc, famous research scientist, reported that the herb eyebright has an astringent and soothing effect in conjunc\u00ad tivitis.\" (Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the inner surface .of the eyelid -a condition result\u00ad ing directly either from eyestrain or mal nutrition of the eyes). Besides its own beneficial properties, the herb eyebright acts as a catalyst to to speed up the action of vitamin A and riboflavin for the eyes. (Think of\"bright eyes\" as an easy way of remembering the herb eyebright). EYEBRIGHT ASSISTS THE ACTION OF VITAMIN A AND RIBOFLAVIN A catalyst might be called an \"expedi\u00ad ter.\" To illustrate: a man plans to go from California to New York. Of course, \u00b7 he would eventually get there if he walked, but he could arrive much faster ifhe drove his car, and still more speedily ifhe were to take a plane. Therefore, t~e airylane can be compared to a catalyst m this example, because it speeds up an action that was going to take place eventually. rpiat, precisely, is what the herb eye\u00ad bright does when combined with these two \"eye vitamins\" -Vitamin A and ribofla\u00ad vin. It helps them act upon the eyes more quickly. Of course, in itself, the herb eyebright also has properties that have special values for the eyes. OTHER \"EYE\" VITAMINS Other vitamins which play important roles in eye hygiene are Thiamine (B-1) and vitamin C . Vitamin C protects the capillaries -tiny blood vessels naturally present in the eye (except for the cornea). And a protracted deficiency of Thiamine (B-1), accompanied by an habitual, intem\u00ad perate use of alcoholic beverages, or smok \u00ad ing, may cause a dimness of vision, and an impairment of the normal ability of the eye to adjust to different distances.
