I. Summary Description of the Request PQB NOTES: The Plant Quarantine Branch (PQB) submittal for requests for import or possession permits, as revised, distinguishes information provided by the applicant from procedural information and advisory comment and evaluation presented by PQB. With the exception of PQB notes, hereafter \"PQB NOTES,\" the text shown below in S ection II from page 6 through page 7 of the submittal was taken directly from Anatis Bioprotection' s application and subsequent written communications provided by the applicant, Dr. Martin Nadeau. For instance, the statements on page 6 regarding effects on the environment are the applicant's statements in response to standard PQB questions and are not PQB's statements. This approach for PQB submittals aims for greater applicant participation in presenting import requests in order to move these requests to the Board of Agriculture (Board) more quickly, while distinguishing applicant provided informati on from PQB information. The portion of the submittal prepared by PQB, including the Summary of Proposed Rule Amendments and Advisory Subcommittee Review is identified as Sections I II and IV of the submittal, which start at the beginning of page 12 and end of page 1 2. Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 2 have a request to review the following: COMMODITY: Bioceres WP, a wettable powder formulation of % (w/w) of conidia of Beauveria ANT-03 (equivalent to 1 x10 10 conidia/g) SHIPPER: Leader Liquids LLC (The manufacturer of the BioCeres WP) , 345 Vista Drive, Cold Water , MI IMPORTER: 96720 CATEGORY: All species in the genus Beauveria, are on the List of Restricte d Microorganis ms (Part A). This includes B. bassiana strain ANT -03. Pursuant to chapter 4- 71A, Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR), microorganism species on the List of Restricted Microorganisms (Part A) are categorized as high- risk microorganisms, which ma y be allowed import into the State under a permit approved by the Board. PQB NOTES: Microorganisms on the List of Non- Restricted Microorganisms (NR List) are classified as low risk.

II. Information Provided by the Applicant in Support of the Application PROJECT : Sale of the bioinsecticide, Bioceres WP , in Hawaii PURPOSE: Biological control of insect pests in agriculture OBJECTIVE: The objective is to prov ide to the crop producer a cost-effective and safe alternative insecticidal solution for the protection of agricultural crop commodity yield and quality by controlling insect pests. Other benefit s include the reduction of conventional chemical insecticides by using Bio ceres WP, an organic biochemical product , that is safe for human s and the environment (including nontarget pollinators). For the user, the product also offers lack of pest resistance, is Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 3 compatible with other biocontrol agents, is not phytotox ic, and does not require a pre- harvest interval. PROCEDURE : Bioceres WP, containing the microorganism, Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03, must be diluted in water and appl ied to the crop by using conventional spraying equipment to cover the leaves of the plant. The det ailed application procedure is described on the end- use product l abel (see Attach ment 1). The product label includes all safety measures and precautions to follow when handling the product. REGULATORY Beauveria bassiana is ubiquit ous and found all over the world. BACKGROUND: Hawaii has several strains of B. bassiana. In December of 2010, researchers from the US Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture- Agricultural Research Service published findings of 14 isolates of B. bassiana collected from insects on Hawaii island alone. Currently , there are six strains of Beauveria bassiana that are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as follows. Active Ingredient Name PC Code Year Fi rst Registered B. bassiana GHA 128924 1995 bassiana strain PPRI 5339 128813 2018 Of the six strains, HF23 an d ANT -03 are approved for organic use. All B. bassiana strains in Agricultural Pesticide products designed for outdoor use, have similar language on the labels under the heading: ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, declaring that the product is potentially harmful to honeybees and to not apply while honeybees and other insects are actively pollinating or foraging. Also, similar language that drift and runoff may be hazardous to aquatic organisms and to not apply within 50 feet of aquatic habitats such as, but not limi ted to, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, marshes, ponds, estuaries, and commercial fishponds. Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 4 Do not apply directly to water or areas where surface water is present or to intertidal areas below the mean high- water mark. Do not contaminate water when di sposing of equipment washwater or rinsate. The EPA requires detailed data and analysis on exposure to non-target species and sites to ensure that the product is safe to use when following the pesticide label's use instructions prior to registering a product. All B. bassiana strains registered with the EPA are assigned the \"CAUTION\" signal word in the precautionary statement of the pesticide label, which means that acute oral and dermal exposure is low risk. The other signal words with higher risk of exposure are: \"WARNING\" and \"DANGER.\" If a product is found to be poison, then the word \"POISON\" along with a Skull and Crossbones must be displayed near the signal word \"DANGER.\" When B. bassiana is applied in the field, it is sensitive to light and, theref ore, breaks down quickly. The potential for leaching through the soil is very low. Several applications can be made at instructed intervals until pests are not visible. There is no limit on the number of applications or total amount used on a site provi ded that the l abel directions are followed. B. bassiana is not phytotoxic. The pre- harvest Interval is zero days. Currently , there are two products containing Beauveria bassiana GHA strain that are registered as Microbial Products in Hawaii (registered w ith the Plant Qu arantine Branch and Pesticide Branch), and the general public is able to purchase these products in Hawaii. DISCUSSION: 1. Person Responsible: The responsible person is Martin Nadeau, P h.D. Dr. Nadeau is the Scientific Director at Anatis Bioprotection at the division of Bioinsecticide[,] since June 2016. Anatis Bioprotection is the developer and the registrant of the Bioceres WP product . Dr. Nadeau 's responsibilities at Anatis Bioprotection include work on the development of formulations of bioinsectici des based on the B. bassiana strain ANT-03 active ingredient and obtaining registrations [from the] Pest Management Regulatory Agency ( PMRA ) in Canada, [and the] EPA in USA[,] including California). The master and doctorate subjects were the evaluation of Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection insects , and the physiological ecology of entomopathogenic fungi, respectively. Copies of Dr. Nadeau's diploma, CV and letter of employment are provided in Attachment 2 (documents 507, 508, 509, an d 510). 2. Manufa cturing Process: The Bioceres WP end- use product is formulated and package d at the following facility : Leader Liquid Packaging 345 Vista Drive Coldwater , MI 49036 EPA Establishment No. 92957- MI-001 The manufacturing process for produc ing Beauveria bassi ana strain ANT -03 technical and the end- use product, Bioceres WP, ensures consistent quantity and quality of production. Anatis qualifies each batch to ensure the potency conforms to the specification of a minimum of 1 x 10 10 viable coni dia/gram of product . Information pertaining to the manufacturing process for both the technical material and end- use product is confidential business information and can be made available upon request. 3. Method of Disposition To avoid waste, all materi al in the product c ontainer should be used by the applicator. The product will be handled in heat [-] sealable pouches with the inert ingredients. If waste [ ] cannot be avoided, dispose of remaining product in a waste disposal facility or pesticide disposal program (often such programs are run by state or local governments or by industry) (see product label in Attachment 1) . 4. Abstract fungi found around the world except Antarctica. Conidia can be found naturally on insects, leaves, in the air or in the soil. Strain ANT -03 has been isolated from a dead Lygus lineolaris (Tarnished plant bug) (Sherrington, QC, C anada). Copies of t he strain were stored in the Canadian National Mycological Herbarium (DAOM) Advisory 10, 2021 6 hosted by the AAFC and in the American ARS Culture and Patent Culture Collection (NRRL number 50797). The Anatis Bioprotection collection stock cultures of -03 strain are stored in 70% glycerol in micro- tubes at -70\u00b0C. B. bassiana forms white/yellowish colonies having a cotton texture. The conidiogenous cells are clustered, colorless, with a globose or flask -like base and denticulate extension called rachis bearing one c onidium per denticule, resulting in a zig- zag extension. The conidium (or conidiospore) is one- cell, hyaline, round to ovoid. Spherical shape with a diameter of 1 to 4 \u00b5m or oval shape with 1.5 to 5.5 x 1- 3 \u00b5m in length. In an aerobi c environment, the fungus produces conidiospores. In an anaerobic environment, the fungus produces blastospores having oval shape with 2- 3 \u00b5m x 7 \u00b5 m in length. Blastospores are as [ ] infectious as conidia[,] causing white muscardine. The fungus is a parasitoid for insects. It penetrates their cuticle because of the protein expression Chitine Binding Domain that allows the fungus to attach on an insect's exoskeleton. Then, its production of the enzyme Pr1 allows penetration of cuticles. It grows inside their host [,] feeding on their interior [,] [ ] as nutrients, ultimately killing their host. During the process, toxins may be produced. In the case of strain ANT -03, beauvericin is not, [sic] as suggested by analysis of conidia produced in laboratory co nditions (Attachment 3 ; document 613). The optimum of growth of the strain ANT -03 is 27 \u00b0C. At the temperature higher than 35\u00b0C, the fungus will not survive. The conidia are also sensitive to the UV. Insects having a high metabolism or performing activiti es generating heat are not devastated by this fungus. Beauveria bassiana can infect entomopatogen generalist, each strain may be specie's [sic] specific. For instance, one can be an efficient insecticide for Leptinotarsa decemlineata but having a minimal impact on others such as Coleomegilla maculate (Attachments 4 and 5; documents 609 and 614) . Beauveria bassiana strain A NT-03 is produced (technical grade) by conventional, liquid fermentation following a solid- state fermentation on cereal grains. The harvested conidia are air -dried at room temperature. The technical grade has been registered i n Canada (PMRA) and in the U nited States (EPA) [,] including California. The accompanying product, Bioceres WP , is a wettable formulation registered in Canada (PMRA, Reg istration No. 31231 ) and in the United (EPA, Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 7 Registration No. 89600 -2)[,] including California. Its formulation contains only organic excipients. Organic certification has been obtained (OMRI in U.S.A. and Ecocert i n Canada). 5. Effects on the Environment Although Bioceres WP may be washed off leaves and vegetables by rain and irrigation systems, or may be spr ayed deliberately on soil, in the case of uses targeting insects in soil such as white grubs, it can be anticipated that the fungus will manifest its natural behavior of low mobility (refer to Attachments 6 and 7; documents 636, 638). The likelihood for t hese conidia to be carried toward streams or other water bodies by irrigation or rain events is reduced by the fact that they are hydrophobic (refer to Attachment 8; document 639). This characteristic makes them buoyant, increasing their exposure to UV radiation, which is lethal to the micro -organism (refer to Attachments 9 , 10, and 11 ; documents 605, 616, 617). In addition, the viability of conidia declines exponentially in fresh water such that viability is reduced to 30% remains at day 7 (refer to Atta chment 12 ; document 640). When all these elements are considered together, the residual viable concentration of the micro- organism that may inadvertently get to fresh water would be so low that risk of germination would be minimal (refer to Attachment 13; document 608) . 6. Non-target Organisms Testing Guideline studies and waiver rationales were submitted to U.S. EPA and Canada PMRA to meet data requirements for non- target organisms for Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03. Both EPA and PMRA determined tha t these data and waiver rational es were sufficient to fulfill the relevant microbial pesticide data requirements and for risk assessment purposes. Further testing of non- target organisms at higher tier levels (i.e., Tiers II, III, and IV) was not required. Studies were conducted to determine the effects of the technical grade active ingredient, Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03, on birds and terrestrial and aquatic arthropods. These studies showed that the technical grade active ingredient was not pathogenic to birds; however, it may be pathogenic/toxic to insects and daphnids. As a result, the end-use product labels contain statements identifying the potential for harm to beneficial insects and bees and that applications [should] avoid direct contact to foraging bees. The end-use product labels also contain standard statements restricting users from activities that may release B. bassiana strain ANT -03 into aquatic environments from its use in the greenhouse. Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 8 A brief summary of the non- target organisms studies that have been submitted to and reviewed by EPA and PMRA in support of the current registrations of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03 are provided below. a. Birds and Mammals Acute Oral Toxicity /Pathogenicity Study in Bobwhite Quail This study wa s conducted to assess the acute oral toxicity /pathogenicity potential of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 when administered by oral gavage at 5 mL/kg once daily for five consecutive days to bobwhite quail (refer to Attachment 14; document 501). EPA Summar y from Biopesticides Registration Action Document ( BRAD) (EPA, 2015) 1 (Attachment 15) The guideline study submitted for the avian oral toxicity/pathogenicity testing requirement showed no adverse effects in birds tested (Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus). However, the study is classif ied as supplemental because the birds were not tested at the maximum hazard dose. Nonetheless, Beauveria bassiana strain ANT - 03 is not likely to grow at a bird's high body temperatures (McNab , 1966) and adverse effects to birds exposed via the oral route a re considered to be unlikely. Based on expected lack of adverse effects observed in birds exposed to Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03, risk to non- target birds is not likely significant. Acute Oral Toxicity /Pathogeni city Study in Rats An acute oral toxi city/pathogenicity study with laboratory rats indicated no adverse effects of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03 when administered at a dose of 1.3 X 10 9 CFU/animal. An acute pulmonary toxicity/pathogenicity study was a lso submitted that indicated Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03 was not toxic, infective, or pathogenic to rats at a dose of 1.1 x 109 CFU/animal. An acute intraperitoneal (IP) injection toxicity and pathogenicity study does not appear to show toxicity when administered in a single dose to rats by IP injection at 1.4 x 109 CFU/animal. Some wild mammals may be exposed to Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03 in treated areas. Since adverse effects were not observed in the mammalian studies, risk to wild mammals is expected to be low. 1 EPA, 2015. Bio pesticides Registration Action Document (BRAD) for Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03. Pesticide Chemical (PC) Code: 129990. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Pesti cide Programs Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division. March 30, 2015. Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 9 Aquatic Organi sms Freshwater Fish Test with Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout) This study was conducted to assess the chronic toxicity and pathogenicity of B eauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 to Oncorhynchus mykiss (Rainbow Trout) in a 30 -day static - renewal test. Since the mean survival rates were not significantly different and no symptomology observed; there were no toxic or pathogenic effects observed (refer to Attachment 16; document 502). EPA Summary from BRAD (EPA, 2015) A guideline study submitted for the non- target freshwater fish testing requirements indicated no toxicity/pathogenicity of Beauveria bassiana ANT-03 to Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) when tested at 1 x 10 6 CFU/mL. However, one of the three replicates of the test substance group (10 of the 30 fish in that group) was not included in the mortality calculations. The study author's explanation for the mortality was that this was likely due to a temporary lack of aeration/drop in dissolved oxygen in the tes t containers, but no other details (e.g., analysis of the dead fish for the MPCA and/or necropsy) were provided. Freshwater Aquatic Invertebrate with Daphnia magna This study was conducted to assess the chronic toxicity of the B eauveria bassiana strain ANT-03, to the mortality, reproduction and growth of the freshwater invertebrate, Daphnia magna, in a 21 -day static renewal test. No significant adverse effects were observed in organisms treated with sterile filtrate. Results presented are based on nominal concentrations (refer to Attachment 17; document 506). EPA Summary from BRAD (EPA, 2015) A guideline study for the non- target freshwater invertebrate testing showed toxicity to Daphnia magna at 1 x 10 6 CFU/mL. Mortality reached 100% in the 1 x 106 test substance group ( Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03) by Day 8 and 20% in the 1 x 103 test substance group in 21 days. The study is classified as supplemental for the following reasons: The study indicates that Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03 is toxic to Daphnia when tested at 1 x 106 conidia/mL. The study describes the EC 50 values for survival, reproduction and biomass. However, the significance of these EC 50 values are uncertain, because the study was not designed properly to calculate a definitive EC 50. In the daphnia study, two concentrations w ere tested at 103 and 106 CFU/mL. Since 100% mortality was observed at the high rate and 20% mortality was observed at the low rate, it can be concluded that the LC 50 is >103 CFU/mL. More testing at Advisory Bioprotection lower than 106 CFU/mL but higher than 103 CFU/mL is needed to support the EC 50 values presented in the Daphnia study. c. Non-Target Insects and Honey Bees Arthropods Ladybird Beetle Non- Target Insect Microbial Testing EPA Summary from BRAD (EPA, 2015) The guideline study submitted to meet the requirement for non- target insect testing showed no toxicity to ladybird beetles (Hippodamia convergens) upon a 10- day (Helicoverpa zea) sprayed with Beauveria bassiana ANT-03 6 CFU/mL. However, reduced food consu mption was observed with the test substance group during Days 7- 11 when compared to the untreated control group. It is not possible to determine potential toxicity or pathogenicity in this study, since reduced food consumption could be the result of toxic ity/pathogenicity, or could have resulted in reduced exposure during the study. Therefore, these results are inconclusive (refer to Attachment 18; document 503). Green Lacewing Microbial Testing EPA Su mmary from BRAD (EPA, 2015) The results with green lacewing larvae indicated no significant differences in mortality among different test groups when exposed to Beauveria bassiana ANT-03 at 1 x 10 6 CFU/mL in a 25 -day dietary toxicity/pathogenicity study. However, the mean number of eggs consumed per day during Days 0- 7 in the untreated control group, inactivated test substance group, and test substance group was 19.3, 14.5, and 16.3, respectively. The inactivated test substance group and the test substance group consumed significantly fewer eggs during Day s 0-7 than did the untreated control group (p<0.0001). (The presence or absence of the surfactant in the various test groups was not clear. Upon request for clarification, the applicant submitted addit ional information that stated that only test substance and inactive test substance groups included the surfactant but not the untreated control. Surfactants can cause adverse effects in some insects.) The reduced egg consumption observed might be due to the surfactant, but this cannot be confirmed without havi ng a control group treated with the surfactant alone. Without this control, results are inconclusive (refer to Attachment 19; document 504). Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 11 Honey bees The study presents the results of the Semi -Field study trials to evaluate the short and long term impacts of BioCeres WP treatments on honeybee's, Apis mellifera, heath and behaviour. In [ ] light of this study, the BioCeres, containing the active ingredient of conidiospores of the strain B. bassi ana ANT-03, at the highest recommended doses did not infe ct, cause sub lethal behavioural abnormalities, nor kill the honey bees under field conditions. The current study results indicate that B. bassiana strain ANT -03 is safe to honeybees under field conditions (refer to Attachment 20 ; document 505). In light of the observation of reduced food consumption in adult ladybird beetles tested and the fact that Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogen known to have a wide host range, the EPA cannot conclude that adverse effects to non- target insects will not occur. It should be best to exercise caution with the uses of the new active ingredient: e.g., to avoid the use of the new active ingredient on or around the crops that are pollinated by insects. The langu age in the Use Directions on the label under the heading \"SE NSITIVE AREAS\" states, \"[t]he pesticide should only be applied when the potential for drift to adjacent sensitive areas (e.g., residential areas, bodies of water, known habitat for threatened or endangered species, non- target crops) is minimal (e.g., when wind is blowing away from the sensitive areas),\" which may serve to reduce exposure. Additional language will be required to alert users to the potential for adverse effects to insects, including beneficial species. A study with honey bees was not provide d to support the honey bee data requirement for the proposed FIFRA S ection 3 registration of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03. A data waiver was requested with rationale that included a reference (Al-mazra'awi, 2006) that involved honey bees as a vector for the dispersal of another strain of Beauveria bassiana for control of tarnished plant bug on canola, without observable impact on honey bees. Given that Beauveria bassiana species is a known insect pathogen and honey bee is a major pollinating insect that plays an important role agriculturally as well as environmentally, the absence of the required Tier 1 Honey Bee study is likely to increase concerns about the effects of Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 on honey bees. In addition, the existing data may not be sufficient to predict the effects of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03, a unique strain, on other beneficial non- target insects. A vector technology has been developed to use honey bees to dissemi nate conidia of Beauveria bassiana to control target pests such as whiteflies and thrips (Shipp, 2009), but studies like this generally are not intended to study the direct effects of Beauveria bassiana on honey bees or the bee hives, but to evaluate the effectiveness of honey bee as a vector to transfer the microbial pest control agent. One study (Al Mazra'awi et al., 2007) did examine the effects of another strain of Beauveria bassiana on honey bees. In this study, mortality was low and not significantly different from that of the Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December bee ca davers from Beauveria bassiana treated hives indicated the potential for Beauveria bassiana to c ause mortality in honey bees. Based on the above information, the rationale provided by the applicant is not sufficient to determine conclusively that Beauveri a bassiana strain ANT -03 will not adversely affect honey bees or that applications to insect pollinated crops will not cause bee mortality. Thus, a statement is required to be added to cautio n users about the potential effects on bees and other pollinators , and specifically restrict users from applying the end-use product when bees are visiting crops and surrounding areas. This language is likely to reduce exposure, but may not eliminate it c ompletely. d. Terrestrial plants Bioceres WP is not phytotoxic. EPA Summary from BRAD (EPA, 2015) A guideline study for Non- target Plant Testing, Tier 1 was not submitted, but a data waiver was requested. Scientific rationale submitted for a waiver of the requirement for Non-target Plant Testing consists of the following: Beauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 is a naturally occurring soil fungus whose level in the environment would not significantly increase with the registration of the new active ingredient, and the uses of the new a.i. on agricultural crop, turf, ornamental and landscape, and home and garden use sites is not expected to result in increased exposure to non- target plants. Beauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 is a newly isolated strain from a dead insect in Canada, with new uses (e.g., for terrestrial and food) . This strain was stated to be not phytotoxic to certain crops in research and development, but data were not provided to support the claim of no phytotoxicity. Scientific rationale based solely on the published information on existing strains is not suffi cient for the waiver request for the new a.i. However, while Beauveria bassiana is a known entomopathogen, it is generally not known as a plant pathogen. Therefore, the proposed uses of B eauveria bassiana ANT- 03 do not exceed the EPA's level of concern. III. Summary of Proposed Amendments to Chapter 4 -71A Plant and Non- Domestic Animal Quarantine, Microorganism Import Rules Dr. Martin Nadeau of Anatis Bioprotection Inc. proposes the following amendments to various lists in Chapter 4- 71A, HAR to make the following changes : Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December 10, 2021 13 1. Section 4-71A-21A, HAR, List of Restricted Microorganisms (Part A). In the Fungi section, amends the existing listing of \" Beauveria - all species in genus\" to read \" Beauveria - all species in genus except: B. bassiana strain ANT -03\" 2. Section 4-71A-24, HAR, List of Nonrestricted Microorganisms. In the Fungi section, a dds Scientific Name: \" Beauv eria bassiana strain ANT - 03\". IV. Advisory Subcommittee Review This request was submitted to the Advisory Subcommittee on Fungi for their review. Their recommendations and comments are as follows 1. I recommend Approval ___ / ___ Disapproval to change the list placement of Beauveria bassiana strain ANT -03, a fungi on the List of Restricted Microorganisms (Part A), for future placeme nt on the List of Nonrestricted Microorganisms, for use in a Microbial Bio -Remediation Product. Dr. Edward Desmond: Recommends approval. Comments: \"Recommendation is contingent upo n the ability to conduct bee count. To ensure customers are adhering t o labeling and bees are not adversely affected. \" Mr. David Clements: Recommends approval. Comments: \"Since other strains of Beauveria bassiana have been registered as microbial pr oduct in Hawaii and additional strains have been registered by EPA, would it be reasonable to place all 6 of the EPA registered strains on the List of Non-restricted Microorganisms? This would avoid additional reviews of the same nature and create continuity in the listings of B. bassiana.\" Dr. Susan Schenck: Recommends appr oval. Comments: \"Since this is a commercial product that has been tested and shown to be safe for honey bees, I recommend approval.\" Advisory Committee Beauveria bassiana ANT -03 Anatis Bioprotection December Christian Whelen: Recommends approval . Comments: \"Recommendation is contingent upon the ability to conduct bee counts to ensure customers are adhering to labeling and bees are not adversely affected.\" Dr. Stephen Ferreira: Recommends approval. Comments : \"For Beauveria bassiana, in gen eral my opinion is that it is not a strong or aggressive bioagent. Thus, mov ing the species to the non- restricted list has my support. My concern would be the potential for non- target interactions with bees. While the applicant has addressed this concer n, I don't think the studies are conclusive. Any use of this biocide should be made with the view of minimizing non-target impacts on bees. I would support moving B. bassiana to the non -restricted list, but I would council that the entire species be reclassified, not the specific strain being requested. Either we approve B. bass iana across the board or we don't allow individual exceptions, or we risk future reviews on a case -by-case basis, which I think is not warranted for B. bassiana.\" Dr. Raquel Wong: Recommends approval. Comments: None. Dr. George Wong : Recommends disapproval . Comments : \"I have reservations concerning changing Beauv eria bassiana to placement as a nonrestricted microorganism. A question came up as to why this species is even on the restricted list. I think that can be best answered by saying that there are concerns as to preserving even native insects in Hawaii. Something that other parts of the United States don't share. On the mainland, various strains of B. bassiana are authorized for commercial use to rid insect pests. Obviously, these strains cannot guarantee that only listed species will be targeted, but since they are not concerned with endangered insects, that problem is not considered, but we have insect species t hat are on the endangered list. I know that it has been tested for honeybees, but what about other insects. There are lots of native insects and you can't test them all!\" ADVISORY COMMITTEE REVIEW : May we request your recommendation and comments at th e next meeting of the Advisory Committee on Plants and Animals. 1610-0Manufactured for: X 10 10 viable conidia/gram of product.Wettable PowderFIRST AID IF IN EYES: Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes.

PRODUCT INFORMATION Bioceres WP is a biological insecticide containing the active ingredient Beauveria bassiana strain ANT-03 for use on labeled growing crops to control insect pests. Bioceres WP acts as a contact biological insecticide for use in the control or suppression of labeled foliar-feeding pests, including aphids, white flies, thrips, plant bugs, beetles and weevils infesting labeled crops or use sites. Bioceres WP must be mixed with water and applied as a foliar spray with ground or aerial equipment equipped for conventional insecti - cide spraying, or by chemigation, in eld or use sites. PRE-HARVEST INTERVAL (PHI): Pre-harvest in-terval for Bioceres WP is zero (0) days. Bioceres WP can be applied up to the day of harvest. USE INSTRUCTIONS Bioceres WP is a selective insecticide for use against labeled insects. Close scouting and early attention to infestations is highly recommended. Proper tim-ing of application targeting newly hatched larvae is important for optimal results. Thorough coverage of infested plant parts is neces- sary for effective control. Bioceres WP does not have systemic activity. For some crops, directed drop noz-zles by ground machine are required. Under heavy pest populations, use the stated higher label rates, shorten the spray interval, and/or increase the spray volume to improve coverage. Repeat applications at an interval sufcient to maintain control, usu-ally 3-10 days depending upon plant growth rate, insect activity, and other factors. If attempting to control an insect population with a single applica-tion, make the treatment when eggs start hatching, but before economic damage occurs. To enhance control, tank mix with contact insec- ticides/miticides/nematicides. Use the lower label rates of Bioceres WP when populations are low and when tank-mixing with other insecticides/miticides/nematicides. Use the stated higher rates of Bioceres WP when applied standalone, when populations are high or when egg numbers are high. To enhance adhesion of Bioceres WP use a spreader/sticker adjuvant. Bioceres WP has been evaluated for phytotoxicity on a variety of crops under various normal growing condi-tions. However, testing all crop varieties, in all mixtures and combinations, is not feasible. Prior to tr eating en- tire crop, test a small portion of the crop for sensitivity. GROUND AND AERIAL APPLICATIONS Apply Bioceres WP in ground and aerial equipment with quantities of water sufcient to provide thor-ough coverage of infested plant parts. The amount of water needed per acre will depend upon crop development, weather, application equipment, and local experience. Do not spray when wind speed fa-vors drift beyond the area intended for use. Avoid-ing spray drift is the responsibility of the applicator. Mixing directions Important - Do not add Bioceres WP to the mix tank before introducing the correct amount of wa-ter. Add water to the mix tank. Start the mechani- 23cal or hydraulic agitation to provide moderate cir- culation before adding Bioceres WP . Add spreader/sticker and then correct amount of Bioceres WP to the mix tank and continue circulation. Maintain circulation while loading and spraying. Do not mix more Bioceres WP than can be used in 24 hours. Spray volume For conventional air and ground applications, use at least 50 gallons of total volume per acre in water-based sprays. Tank mixing Do not tank mix with fungicides. Do not com-bine Bioceres WP in the spray tank with other pesti-cides, surfactants, adjuvants, or fertilizers if there has been no pr evious experience or use of the combina- tion to show it is physically compatible, ef fective, and non-injurious under your use conditions. Observe the most r estrictive of the labeling limitations and pr e- cautions of all products used in mixtures. To ensure compatibility of tank-mix combinations, they must be evaluated prior to use. To determine the physical compatibility of this product with other products, use a jar test. Using a quart jar, add the pro - portionate amounts of the products to one quart of water with agitation. Add dry formulations rst, then flowables, and then emulsiable concentrates last. After thoroughly mixing, let this mixture stand for 5 minutes. If the combination remains mixed or can be readily remixed, it is physically compatible. Once com - patibility has been proven, use the same procedure for adding required ingredients to the spray tank. AERIAL DRIFT REDUCTION INFORMATION GENERAL: Avoiding spray drift at the application site is the responsibility of the applicator and the grower (specically, see SENSITIVE AREAS sec - tion for the requirement regarding spray drift and honey bees). The interaction of many equipment- and weather-related factors determine the potential for spray drift. The applicator and the grower are responsible for considering all these factors when making decisions. Where states have more stringent regulations, they must be observed. Do not apply directly to aquatic habitats (such as, but not limited to, lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, marshes, ponds, estuaries, and commercial sh ponds).INFORMATION ON DROPLET SIZE: Use only medium or coarser spray nozzles according to ASAE (S572) denition for standard nozzles. In conditions of low humidity and high temperatures, applicators should use a coarser droplet size. The most effective way to reduce drift potential is to apply large drop-lets. The best drift management strategy is to apply the largest droplets that will provide sufcient cov-erage and control. Applying larger droplets reduces drift potential, but will not prevent drift if applica-tions are made improperly, or under unfavorable environmental conditions (see Wind, Temperature and Humidity, and Temperature Inversions). CONTROLLING DROPLET SIZE: Volume - Use high flow rate nozzles to apply the highest practical spray volume. Nozzles with higher rated flows pro-duce larger droplets. Pressure - Do not exceed the nozzle manufactur er's specied pressures. For many nozzle types, lower pressure produces larger droplets. When high flow rates are needed, use higher flow rate nozzles instead of increasing pressure. Number of Nozzles - Use the minimum number of nozzles that provide uniform coverage. Nozzle Orientation - Orienting nozzles so that the spray is released parallel to the airstream produces larger droplets than other orientations and is the recommended practice. Sig - nicant deflection from horizontal will reduce droplet size and increase drift potential. Nozzle T ype - Use a nozzle type that is designed for the intended applica - tion. With most nozzle types, narrower spray angles produce larger droplets. Consider using low-drift nozzles. Solid stream nozzles oriented straight back produce the largest droplets and the lowest drift. BOOM WIDTH: For aerial applications, the boom width must not exceed 75% of the wingspan or 90% of the rotary blade. APPLICATION HEIGHT: Do not make application at a height greater than 10 feet above the top of the largest plants unless a greater height is required for aircraft safety. Making applications at the lowest height that is safe reduces exposure to droplets to evaporation and wind. If application includes a no-spray zone, do not release spray at a height greater than 10 feet above the ground or crop canopy.4SWATH ADJUSTMENT: When applications are made with a crosswind, the swath will be displaced downward. Therefore, on the up and downwind edges of the eld, the applicator must compensate for this displacement by adjusting the path of the aircraft upwind. Swath adjustment distance should increase with increasing drift potential (higher wind, smaller drops, etc.). WIND: Only apply this product if the wind direction favors on-target deposition. Do not apply when the wind velocity exceeds 15 mph. Drift potential is low - est between wind speeds of 2-10 mph. However, many factors, including droplet size and equipment type determine drift potential at anygiven speed. Application should be avoided below 2 mph due to variable wind direction and high inversion potential. NOTE: Local terrain can influence wind patterns. Every applicator should be familiar with local wind patterns and how they affect spray drift. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY: When making applications in low relative humidity, set up equip-ment to produce larger droplets to compensate for evaporation. Dr oplet evaporation is most sever e when conditions are both hot and dry. TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS: Do not apply dur- ing a temperature inversion because drift potential is high. T emperatur e inversions restrict vertical air mixing, which causes small, suspended droplets to remain in a concentrated cloud. This cloud can move in unpredictable directions due to the light variable winds common during inversions. Tem - perature inversions are characterized by increas-ing temperatures with altitude and are common on nights with limited cloud cover and light to no wind. They begin to form as the sun sets and often continue into the morning. Their pr esence can be indicated by ground fog; however, if fog is not pres - ent, inversions can also be identied by the move-ment of smoke from a ground source or an aircraft smoke generator . Smoke that layers and moves laterally in a concentrated cloud (under low wind conditions) indicates an inversion, while smoke that moves upward and rapidly dissipates indicates good vertical air mixing.SENSITIVE AREAS: The pesticide should only be applied when the potential for drift to adjacent sen-sitive areas (e.g. residential areas, bodies of water, known habitat for thr eatened or endanger ed spe- cies, non-target crops) is minimal (e.g. when wind is blowing away fr om the sensitive ar eas). Do not allow spray to drift from the application site and contact people, structures people occupy at any time and the associated property, parks and recreation areas, non-target crops, blooming crops or weeds that bees are visiting, aquatic and wetland areas, wood - lands, pastures, rangelands, or animals. CHEMIGATION USE DIRECTIONSSpray preparation First, prepare a suspension of Bioceres WP in a mix tank. Fill tank \u00bd-\u00be of the amount of water for the area to be treated. Start mechanical or hydraulic agitation. Add the required amount of Bioceres WP , and then the remaining volume of water. Then set the sprinkler to deliver a minimum of 0.1- 0.3 inch of water per acre. Start sprinkler and uniformly inject the suspension of Bioceres WP into the irri - gation water line so as to deliver the correct rate of Biocer es WP per acr e. Inject the suspension of Bioceres WP with a positive displacement pump into the main line ahead of a right angle turn to ensure adequate mixing. Bioceres WP is to be metered con - tinuously for the duration of the water application. If you have questions about calibration, you should contact State Extension Service specialists, equip - ment manufacturers or other experts. Do not combine Bioceres WP with other pesticides, surfactants, adjuvants, or fertilizers for application through chemigation equipment unless prior expe-rience has shown the combination to be physically compatible, effective and non-injurious under con-ditions of use. General Requirements - 1. Apply this product only through sprinkler, in- cluding center pivot, lateral move, end tow, side (wheel) r oll, traveler, big gun, solid set, or hand move, or drip (trickle) irrigation systems.

In order to achieve this objective, we used combined methods LC-UV-MS where an HPLC is linked to a UV detector then tandem mass spectrometer API3000 from applied biosystems HPLC method S-3 120A 2.0 \u00d7 100, 3 Waters, AQ12S031002WT column, mobile phases A= 0.1% formic acid in water, B= Acetonitrile. The elution was performed using a gradient starting at 50%B then ramping B% to 70% during 7 minutes, then keep the B% at 70% for one minute with a conditioning time of 3 minutes. Mobile phase flow was 0.85 mL/min. The UV detector was a \" SPD10A \"from S himadzu, measured wavelengths were =205nm and 254 nm.

The chromatographic conditions of the analysis and deta ils of settings were described in table 5.3. The UV detector was set at =205nm and the mass spectrometer dete ctor were equipped with turbo ion spray using Electrospray ionization using posi tive mode. Q1 scan mode was used to perform a wide acquisition from 400 to 800 Da. Then we extracted the data within 1 Da unite from 784-785 Da in order to detect BEA. The MS chromatogram was delayed of the UV chro matogram with an offset of 20 second. The measured mass to charge ratio of BEA was m/z=784.5 Da figure 7.8. \u0003 Repeatability and recovery test have been conducted. Repeatability of the analysis was excellent signal and retention time was stable and reproduc ible. The coefficient of variation was below 1% for area under the curve, height, and retention time. Linearity in UV was excellent within the analytical range from 2.5 to 140 g/mL (R= 0.9996) see figure 6.3, the standard had excellent accuracy se e table 6.3. MS range of linearity was limited, but shows much better sensitivity. Using the UV detector, the limit of quantitation is in the ug/mL level, and no trace was found in the extracted samples from the \"fungus\". Using mass spectrometry, the detection level is much more sensitive than UV and the limit of quantitation was lower as 25 ng/mL. At 25 ng/mL we see a good peak shape and sufficient sensitivity from extracted ions between 784 and 785 Da. No detectable level of BEA was observed in the samples as shown in figures 7.10, 7.11 and 7.12. Since the signal that corresponds to BEA at the retention of time of BEA was under the limit of detection. We don't longer need to quantify BEA.

The fungus has a very diverse and extensive host range. Variation in virulence among isolates of B. bassiana to different insect species has been abundantly documented. Given the effect of multiple factors on virulence, it is not certain whether the observed difference in virulence can belabelled as host specificity. Environmental conditions and susceptibility of the insectpopulation are two main factors that affect successful fungal infection. Keeping theenvironmental factors constant, if virulence of an isolate to different insect species anddifferent populations within an insect species is compared, the scale of difference between the two responses can be estimated. If differences in virulence of an isolate to different insect species are greater than the difference in virulence to different insectpopulations within an insect species, then, the isolate can be considered as exhibitingspecific preference to those insect species towards which it exhibits high virulence. Toexamine this feature, a worldwide sample of B. bassiana was bioassayed on nine insect species and two different populations within two insect species. of variation in virulence of a B. bassiana isolate to different insect species was not more than that observed with different populations within a single insect species. B. bassiana is thus a generalist with no strict host preference . B. bassiana based biopesticide can be used as a broad spectrum insecticide against a myriad of insect bassiana , a popular registered mycoinsecti- cide, has an extremely large host list of /C2700 Inglis, and Wraight 2000). It is ubiquitous in distribution and is pathogenic to a wide spectrum of arthropods with its host range spanning most orders ofclass Insecta (Butt and Goettel 2000; Lacey, author. Email: umadevikoduru@gmail.comBiocontrol Science and Technology /C1989 2010It also has the ability to colonise plants (e.g. corn), though not as a pathogen, but as an endophyte (Wagner and Lewis 2000). It has been reported as an endophyte in a few otherplants as well (Zimmerman 2007). Beauveria bassiana was speculated to contain a diverse assemblage of genotypes and most likely to be a species complex (Goettel et al. 2000). This view has been amply substantiated by molecular genetic data (Rehner and Goettel et al. (2000) envisaged that it will not be surprising to find within the taxon ofB. bassiana which collectively possesses a very wide host range, individual isolates or pathotypes, with a substantially restricted host range. Fire ants ( Solenopsis invicta ) across South America were found to be infected by a single genotype of B. bassiana (Zeng 1999). Isolates of B. bassiana infecting European corn borer moth ( Ostrinia nubilalis ) were all found to have identical telomere fingerprints; similar was the case with to rice water weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus , were found to have a very similar genotype (Urtz and Rice 1997). Reviews of literature on B. bassiana hint at the prevalence of host specificity with strains differing in their host range (Fargues and Remaudie \u00b4re 1977; Ferron 1978; McCoy 1990;Glare and Milner 1991). Commercial formulations of this fungus have also been developedwith isolates specifically virulent against target pests: Ostrinil for corn borer ( Recommendations have been made to test the virulence of B. bassiana isolate to be incorporated in the mycopesticide formulation against the insect to which it is targeted (Ferron, Fargues, and Riba 1991). On the other hand, in a study of thehost range of B. bassiana using eight lepidopteran insect species (Wraight et al. 2003), all the 40 isolates tested were reported to be pathogenic to all the insect species with numerousisolates being highly virulent to all the tested insects. Naturalis , a registered B. bassiana based mycopesticide formulation was found effective against taxonomically diverse insect pests (Butt, Jackson, and Magan 2001). Naturaliswas labelled as not being effective against lepidopteran pests but was found virulent to Plutella xylostella , a lepidopteran (Vandenberg, Ramos, and Altre 1998). In B. bassiana , cases of extreme specialisation with isolates being either virulent or avirulent to the tested insect species have only rarely been reported (Riba, Katagiri, and Kawakami 1982; Urtz and Rice 1997). Most studies describe differences among B. bassiana isolates in the degree of virulence rather than a distinction into virulence/ avirulence. Gradation of virulence of an isolate can however be affected by the bioassay conditions and susceptibility of the insect population of the species being tested. Effects ofphysical environmental conditions like temperature and moisture on the virulence of isolateshave been abundantly documented (e.g. Ferron et al. 1991; Glare and Milner 1991;Vandenberg et al. 1998). With Nomuraea rileyi , another entomopathogenic fungus, laboratory bioassay results even with the same isolates under similar conditions in thesame lab were reported to vary significantly with bioassays done at different times (Boucias,Stokes, Suazo, and Funderburk 2000). Significant differences in virulence have beenobserved with Beauveria brongniartii isolates tested against two different populations of the same insect species, the European cockchafer Melolontha melolontha (Keller, Schweizer, and Shah 1999). Host specificity in B. bassiana was studied taking a sample of isolates from different geographic regions and insect hosts and testing on nine insect species belonging to different taxonomic orders within the class Insecta and two different insect populations within two insect species. It was hypothesised that if the differences in virulence of isolates ofB. bassiana to different insect species are greater than differences in virulence to different976 K. Uma Devi et al.Downloaded January 2010populations of the same insect species, then, an isolate can be labeled as highly/less virulent against a particular insect species. If the differences in this comparison are not significant,it might be that virulence is determined by the genotype (as regards susceptibility) of the insect population in an insect species rather than the type of insect species per se . Materials and methods Fungal isolates The isolates were sampled to constitute representatives from disparate insect hosts collected worldwide from different climatic conditions (Table 1). This sample of 29 B. bassiana isolates was DNA fingerprinted by RAPD, AFLP and telomere Uma 2006). The Table 1. Origin of Beauveria bassiana isolates used in the study of insect host specicity. Original insect host Helicoverpa Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures, Ithaca, NY; ITCC isolates from Indian Type Culture Collection, IARI, New Delhi; NRRL isolates are from NRRL culture collection, Peoria, IL; BB isolates are from Indian fields and not yet accessioned.Biocontrol Science and Technology 977Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] cultured on Sabouraud dextrose yeast agar (SDYA) medium in culture tubes placed in an environmental chamber set at 25 918C and 90% relative humidity with 16 h L:8 h D cycle. The cultures for every bioassay were established from colonies obtainedfrom streaking conidia stored as glycerol stocks at /C28208C. The glycerol stocks were made from conidia harvested from pure cultures of the isolates established from conidia obtained after in vivo passage through silkworm (Butt and Goettel 2000). When bioassays are used to compare virulence among isolates obtained from various sources and culture collections whose culture history is seldom known, it is recommended to minimise the variation in virulence due to culture conditions by in vivo passage of the isolates (St. Leger, Allee, May, Staples, and Roberts 1991). The conidia of 14-day-old cultures on SDYA slants were harvested by scraping with a sterile steel spatula. For some insects, the conidia were directlyused. For others, an aqueous suspension was made with sterile distilled water. Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added at a concentration of 0.01% to disperse the conidia in theaqueous medium; the suspension was vortexed. The conidial concentration in thesuspension was estimated through hemocytometer counts. The conidial suspension wasdiluted with 0. 01% Tween till a concentration with countable number of conidia in the hemocytometer was achieved. The conidial counts were made using a light microscope at 400/C29magnification. The volume of the conidial suspension was made up with 0.01% Tween to the required conidial concentration. For every bioassay, the cultures wereestablished afresh from glycerol stocks. The viability of the conidia used in the treatmentswas checked as described by Varela and Morales (1996). Data were collected only fromsuch treatments where the conidial viability was /C2190%. For isolates with lower viability, the bioassay was repeated with conidia from a fresh culture. Insects Eight insect species belonging to seven families of five orders were selected for bioassays (Table 2). The lepidopteran insects and mealy bug ( Maconellicoccus hirsutus ) were obtained from second generation laboratory-bred collectedinsects. The The field-collected insects were kept under observation for a day in the laboratory before treatment. Injured or dead individuals wereremoved and only active insects were treated. The insects were provided with natural food (Table 2). The insects were placed individually (except A. craccivora andM. hirsutus )i n perforated plastic boxes with lids or plastic dishes whose mouth was closed with a black cloth fastened with a rubber band. Five adult insects of A. craccivora andM. hirsutus were placed per container. The leaf and flower eating insects were transferred daily to newcontainers with fresh food. The aphids ( A. craccivora ) were carefully transferred daily to fresh flowers with a fine tip camel hairbrush. Mealy bug ( M. hirsutus ) was left on the same leaf throughout the experiment. A cotton plug was fixed at the tip of the petiole and wetteddaily to prevent the leaf from drying and delay leaf senescence (Butt and Goettel 2000). For ants ( O. smaragdina ), diluted (40%, with water) honey was sprayed daily onto a cotton plug in the plastic box in which treated ants were kept. To compare virulence against different populations within an insect species, two populations from different regions of two insect species, Spodoptera litura andHelicoverpa armigera , were tested. H. armigera collections at both sites were from cotton fields and S. litura , from pigeon pea ( Cajanus cajan ) fields. The farmers of the fields were advised to not use chemical insecticides on the crop and the second instar larvae were collected from the field for treatment. For the repeat experiments, the larvae were collected from the same978 K. Uma At: January 2010Table 2.

The pest density was at its peak during the insect collection time in all the fields from which larvae were collected. Bioassays The bioassay with each insect species was set up in a completely randomised block design with appropriate controls (Goettel and Inglis 1997) in an environmental chamber set at25918C and 90% relative humidity with 16 h L:8 h D cycle. Each treatment was set up as a duplicate and the bioassays with each insect were repeated once. One insect bioassay was done at a time; the bioassays were carried out over a period of 36 months. The description of the insects treated is given in Table 2. All insect species except O. smaragdina andM. hirsutus were treated with an aqueous conidial 6conidia/ml) with 0.01% Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich). Preliminary bioassays with a few fungal isolates on each insect species that was to be tested were doneto decide the conidial concentration suitable to gauge the difference in virulence betweenthe isolates. High conidial doses of B. bassiana were found necessary to cause mortality in many insect species; allee effect i.e. requirement of a threshold level of conidia to initiate infection has been observed in bioassays of B. bassiana isolates on Mylabris pustulata (Uma Devi and Uma Maheswara Rao 2006). Therefore, this conidial concentration was used in the bioassays. Treatment with aqueous conidial suspension did not elicit high mortality in ants (O. smaragdina ) and mealy bugs ( M. hirsutus ). Therefore, they were treated with dry conidia harvested from culture slants. The ants were allowed to crawl for 2 min on conidiaplaced in a Petri dish (Mohan, Aruna Lakshmi, and Uma Devi 1999). Conidia wereapplied with a fine tip camel hairbrush on mealy bug ( M. hirsutus ). The number of conidia that attached to an insect in this mode of treatment was estimated as described by Mohanet al. (1999). Briefly, the treated insect was dipped in water (volume enough to drown theinsect), Tween at a concentration of 0.01% was added and vortexed thoroughly. The insectwas removed and the spore count in the water was made through haemocytometer counts.An inoculum concentration of /C210 9conidia/100 insects could be dispensed on mealy bugs and/C2107conidia/insect for ants through the methods of application described. The controls were treated with heat (100 8C) killed conidia. In treatments with aqueous conidial suspension, for each insect species, the volume sufficient to drench the insect was determined and equal volume was dispensed on all insectswith a Gilson micropipette. As the aphids were very small, 20 were placed on a flower bud and the inoculum was dispensed onto them. The concentration of the conidial suspensionwas adjusted such that each volume aliquot dispensed per 20 insects (aphids) contained /C22/C2910 6conidia. A volume of 100 mLwas required to drench the larvae of 40 mLf o r E. vigintioctopunctata . The controls were treated with an equal volume of water with 0.01% Tween. Mortality of the insects was recorded daily post treatment in all insect bioassays except with C. partellus (sorghum shoot borer). In bioassays with C. partellus , mortality was recorded at 4-day intervals: the larvae tunneled into shoots provided as diet; to minimiseinjury to the larvae while tearing open the shoots, the shoots were cut open at 4-dayintervals to observe the larvae. Treated dead insects were placed singly in humid chambers (Petri dish lined with moist blotting paper) to facilitate mycosis. The data were recorded in larval bioassays until all thelarvae in the controls pupated, and in bioassays on adult insects, the day from which nofurther mortality was observed in the treated insects. The duration of the bioassay was 7980 K. Uma for H. 14 days for B. mori andM. pustulata ,1 6d a y sf o r E. vigintioctopunctata and 30 days for Chilo partellus . To examine if differences in virulence exist based on difference in the genotype of insects within an insect species, bioassays were done with a subset (five isolates) of B. bassiana sample on two populations of Helicoverpa armigera andSpodoptera litura collected from different locations. Two isolates which caused high mortality on all the tested eight insect species were included in this sample. The two populations of each insect species were tested simultaneously with the same conidial inoculum of the B. bassiana isolate. The experiment with the two populations was set up as a completely randomised block design with threereplicates for each treatment. The experiment was repeated with the second set of field collected larvae with inoculum from fresh cultures of the B. bassiana isolates. Data analysis In each treatment, the cumulative mortality on the last day of observation was corrected for control mortality (Abbott 1925) and percent /C226arcsine transformed to normalise data and back transformed (Gomez and Gomez 1984). The number of insects with mycosis(cadavers with external growth of fungus) was computed as percent proportion of the dead insects. The mean 9SE of percent mortality and percent mycosis of the two replicates of each isolate was calculated. The mean values were back transformed to normalise the data (Gomez and Gomez 1984) .Median lethal time was calculated from the cumulative mortality data using survival analysis with Weibull distribution (Lee 1992). The results of bioassays are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. The mortality and mycosis values are rounded to the nearest whole number. Standard errors (SE) in no instance were so high as to indicate a significant difference between replicate experiments; they are not mentioned to simplify the table. The results of bioassays with entomopathogenic fungi conducted at different times in the same laboratory and with the same isolates on the same insect in different laboratories are reported to vary (Boucias et al. 2000). Therefore, less importance was given to the absolute values. The isolates were graded broadly into three classes/C1high, medium and low (A, B and C, respectively) (Yip, Rath, and Koen 1992) for the three virulence characteristics (mortality, mycosis and median lethal time). Formortality and mycosis, taking the range as 100 (0 /C1100%), 0 /C133% was taken as low (C), 34 /C1 67% as medium (B) and 68 /C1100% as high (C). For values in the boundaries of the grades, the SE value was added to the mean for grading. For classifying the speed of kill, a day was subtracted from the total time duration of the bioassay (because mortality observations were started 1 day after treatment) and divided by three to set the upper boundary for median lethal time for each of the three (A, B, C) classes. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS 7.5 for windows (SPSS Inc. 1989 /C11996). Results Virulence comparison of isolates to different insect species Mortality All the B. bassiana isolates in the sample were found pathogenic to all the insect species tested (Table 3).

With C. partellus , only eight isolates caused high mortality and with M. hirsutus , 10 isolates (Tables 3 and 4). Most of the isolates caused medium mortality on these two insects (Tables 3 and 4). The percent mortality in the controls of each insect bioassay are given in Table 3. In all of the insect bioassays, including those done with field collected samples ( M. pustulata ,O. smaragdiana, A. craccivora), the few insects that died among the controls showed no sign of fungal infection. Mycosis Only one isolate, ARSEF 1149, graded high in mycotic potential on all insect species (Table 3). With others, the mycotic potential of an insect was not uniform on different insect species (Table 3). Some of the isolates caused no mycosis on some insect species (Table 3). Median lethal time When the speed of killing of an isolate across all the eight insects was compared, no isolate showed a uniform behaviour (Table 3). The isolates could not be rated as fast/slow killers;the LT 50values of an isolate varied with different insect species. Virulence comparison between two populations of two insect species Great differences were observed in the virulence comparison of isolates to different populations of S. litura andH. armigera , The isolates caused high mortality (grade A) in one population but low mortality (grade C) on another, the difference being highlysignificant (Table 5). Among the isolates of this subset sample were isolates BB3 and BB4which caused high mortality (graded A) on all the eight insect species tested in this study(Table 3).

Uma Devi et al.Downloaded January 2010populations of an insect species was as variable (Table 5) as the differences observed with different insect species (Table 3). Just as with the other two virulence characters, thedifference in speed of kill of an isolate to different insect populations of an insect specieswas also very drastic; the LT 50values could not be computed for an isolate with one population due to less than 50% mortality caused while with another population, the LT 50 values ranged between 3.89 /C14.65 days in H. armigera and 2.26 /C13.84 days in S. litura (Table 5). Thus, the difference in virulence of an isolate to two insect populations within an insectspecies was even more than the differences observed between isolates with different insectspecies. More than three-fourths of the B. bassiana isolates in the sample caused high mortality in most of the insect species (Tables 3 and 4). Discussion All the 29 B. bassiana isolates bioassayed were found pathogenic to all the eight insect species tested. While considering host specificity, among the three virulence parameters of the fungal isolate, mortality, mycosis and median lethal time, mortality could be taken asthe main trait. A majority (at least 25 of the 29 tested) of the B. bassiana isolates were found highly virulent to six of the eight insect species tested. Fewer isolates were highlyvirulent to C. partellus andM. hirsutus . In their studies on host specificity in B. bassiana , Viaud et al. (1996) and Maurer et al. (1997) concluded that specificity might be acharacteristic of the insect species rather than the fungal isolate. In the present study,significant differences were observed in mortality caused by an isolate on differentpopulations within H. armigera andS. litura . Therefore, it is not possible to conclude if these two insect species ( C. partellus andM. hirsutus ) are in general less susceptible to B. bassiana , or if the tested insect population of these two insects was genotypically less susceptible to fungal infection. Significant differences in susceptibility between differentinsect populations of an insect species to fungal pathogens have been reported (Milner1985; Stephen and Fichter 1990; Keller et al. 1999). The tunnelling behaviour ofC. partellus and the waxy coat of M. hirsutus may have affected the adhesion of conidia, essential to initiate infection resulting in less mortality in these insect species. The laboratory bioassays described here were not conducted to evaluate the dose response to arrive at an accurate estimate of virulence of an isolate given the sample size ofB. bassiana and the number of insect species tested. Thus, they are preliminary. However, the results clearly point to the trends. A strict host specialisation with an isolate beinghighly virulent to one or a group of insect species with very low or no virulence to anothergroup of insect species is not evident in the B. bassiana sample in the present study. Successful pathogenesis was found to be affected as much by the genotype (with respect tosusceptibility) of the insect population as the type of insect species. Humber (1991)hypothesized that the entomogenous habit of B. bassiana may be relatively new and therefore it is poorly adjusted to the host. B. bassiana is described as a hemi-biotroph (Butt and Goettel 2000) and is not fastidious of diet. TheB. bassiana sample examined in the present study is constituted by isolates collected worldwide from disparate insect hosts with immense genotypic variability (Padmavathi2002; Padmavathi et al. 2003; Uma Devi et al. 2006). Therefore, it can be taken asrepresentative of the large spectrum of diversity in this species complex including at least,some of the specialised physiological races or sub-species. Fargues, Duriez, Popeye, Robert,and Biguet (1981) observed that host specialisation can serve as a taxonomic criterion in obligate parasites, but, in entomopathogenic hyphomycetous fungi like B. bassiana , because of their facultative saprotrophic habit, it may not be feasible to use this criterion toBiocontrol Science and Technology 985Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 20:13 12 January 2010Table 5.

Uma Devi et al.Downloaded January 2010differentiate the different 'species' in the species complex. A similar conclusion was arrived in the study of host range of Aspergillus flavus , an ascomycetous fungus with highly polymorphic and complex populations (St. Leger, Screen, and Shams Pirzadeh 2000). Mostof the Aspergillus flavus strains cause disease in both plants and animals; the same A. flavus strain infects diverse lepidopteran insect species (St. Leger et al. 2000). Beauveria bassiana has thus a generalist nature. From the study of Metarhizium anisopliae , another entomopathogenic mitosporic fungus similar to B. bassiana in having a very wide host range and a saprophytic existence in soil, Bidochka, Kamp, Lavender, Dekoning, and De Croos (2001) concluded that 'the search for highly virulent isolates directed at certain insect pests may be inherently flawed, since virulent isolates havecomparable facility to infect susceptible insects but have large discrepancies in theirabilities to tolerate certain environmental conditions'. They recommend that habitat preferences rather than virulence should be considered as a feature for selecting fungalstrains to be used in biocontrol efforts. Carruthers and Soper (1987) speculated that thepathogen (fungal) may be limited in the field by environmental conditions and/or spatialand temporal interactions with its host rather than the lack of pathogenecity. With the generalist character of B. bassiana , it is not necessary to choose isolates suitable for each one of the multitude insect pests, rather isolates suitable for different habitats (environmental conditions). An isolate suitable for a particular habitat would besufficient to deal with most of the insect pests in that area, just like the nonspecificchemical pesticides. A broad host spectrum biopesticide based on B. bassiana may, however, may have the risk of causing undesirable effects on non-target beneficial organisms like chemical insecticides. Goettel and Hajek (2001) observe that too muchconcern over effects of entomopathogenic fungi on non-target organisms is not warranted. The physiological host range as evident from laboratory bioassays may not be similar to ecological host range and a mycopesticide formulation targeted against a dense pestpopulation may not have disastrous effects on the non-target organisms.

Newton, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USAGordon William Beakes, University of Newcastle, increasingly sophisticated microbiological techniques, and long after the rst discovery of microbes, basic knowledge is still lacking to fully appreciate the ecological importance of microbial parasites in sh. This is likely due to the nature of their habitats as many species of sh suffer from living beneath turbid water away from easy recording. However, shes represent key ecosystem services for millions of people around the world and the absence of a functional ecological understanding of viruses, prokaryotes, andsmall eukaryotes in the maintenance of sh populations and of their diversity represents an inherent barrier to aquatic conservation and food security. Among recent emerginginfectious diseases responsible for severe population declines in plant and animal taxa, fungal and fungal-like microbes have emerged as signicant contributors. Here, we review the current knowledge gaps of fungal and fungal-like parasites and pathogens in shand put them into an ecological perspective with direct implications for the monitoring of fungal sh pathogens in the wild, their phylogeography as well as their associated ecological impact on sh populations. With increasing sh movement around the worldfor farming, releases into the wild for sport shing and human-driven habitat changes, it is expected, along with improved environmental monitoring of fungal and fungal-like infections, that the full extent of the impact of these pathogens on wild sh populationswill soon emerge as a major threat to freshwater biodiversity. Keywords: emerging infectious disease, aquatic, extinction, vertebrate, global, biodiversity, Oomycota, Mesomycetozoea INTRODUCTION Fishes are susceptible to diseases caused by a large number of infectious agents including viruses, bacteria, true fungi, fungal-like microrganisms, other protists, and metazoans. This reviewwill briefly discuss fungal pathogens pathogensin the reported fungal and fungal-like pathogens responsiblefor diseases in animals is on the increase globally ( Fisher et al., 2009; Holdich et et al., 2010 ). As such, they are truly emerging diseases with increasing incidence, geo-graphic range, virulence, and some of these fungal and fungal-likepathogens have recently been found in new hosts or are newlydiscovered (Berger et al., 1998; Brown, 2000; Daszak 2009; Peeler et al., 2010;Cameron et al., 2011). The underpinning drivers of this observedincrease remain unclear but these pathogens are known to beopportunistic (Fisher et al., 2012 ), to have resilient and rel- atively long-lived environmental stages ( Mitchell et al., 2008; Andreou et al., 2009 ) and may have beneted from recent increase in global trade (Brasier, 2008 ) and spread of invasive species(Gozlan et al., 2010). Thus increasingly infectious outbreaks arereported in a broad range of species from coral ( Kim and Harvell, 2004)t ow h e a t( W anyera et al., 2006 ); notable examples include local extinctions of bats ( Frick et al., 2010), bees ( Ratnieks and amphib- et al., 2009 ) and sh ( Gozlan et al., 2005, 2009). In aquatic ecosystems fungi and fungal-like pathogen detection insh hosts is more complicated due to the lack of direct obser-vation of their hosts contrary to frogs or coral, for example(Gozlan, 2012). This is particularly true in freshwater systemswhere, despite being responsible for pan-continental popula-tion extinctions, some diseases caused by fungal and fungal-likepathogens are chronic with no clear external symptoms Gozlan et al., 2005; Kocan and Hershberger, 2006; Andreou et al., 2011,2012). This is very well illustrated, for example, by the rosetteagent Sphareothecum destruens , which has been rapidly spreading all over Europe via an invasive healthy sh host carrier ( Gozlan et al., 2005; Gozlan, 2012 ). This fungal\u2014like is intra- cellular, causing high mortality (up to 90%) after about 20-30days but it can only be condently detected by PCR analysis(Mendonca and Arkush, 2004). The paradox is that despite hugepan-continental population extinction, it remains difcult to www.frontiersin.org February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |1Attachment 6 Document 636Gozlan et al. Understanding sh fungal pathogens characterize the true ecological impact of fungal and fungal-like pathogens on freshwater sh populations. Despite sheries representing a key ecosystem service for mil- lions of people around the world, the full appreciation of diseaserisk associated with fungal pathogen emergence remains limited(Gozlan et al., 2006). Here, we review the current knowledge gapsof fungal microbes in sh, their phylogeography along with thecurrent methods of detection and associated limitations and aglobal ecological understanding of their impacts on sh host pop-ulations. With an increasing volume of sh translocation aroundthe world for farming and sport shing, the relative absence ofsh-infecting fungi outbreaks when compared to other more eas-i l yo b s e r v e dt a x ae x e m p l i e st h ec u r r e n tc o n c e r no far e p o r t i n gbias in wild sh populations ( Gozlan, 2012). DIVERSITY AND PHYLOGENY In recent years interest in the phylogeny of eukaryotes has beenre-evaluated (see Adl et al., 2005). Based on data from sequencing genes, particularly rRNA gene sequences, Baldauf (2003) reas- signed eukaryotes into eight different branches or supergroupswithin the tree of life, namely the opisthokonts, amoebozoa,plants, cercozoa, alveolates, heterokonts, discicristates, and exca-v a t e s .T h et r u ef u n g ia n dM e s o m y c e t o z o e aa r ep l a c e da l o n gw i t hthe animals in the Opistokonta. The Mesomycetozoea form aclade, which falls on the animal branch, near the animal fungaldivide ( Paps et al., 2013). All of the Oomycota are placed into the Heterokont supergroup. T rue fungi constitute the most species rich group of organ- isms on earth with 35 recognized classes and 129 orders (Hibbettet al., 2007 ). The majority of the fungi causing infection in sh belong to the phylum Ascomycota, with thick-walled non-motilespores ( Hibbett et Within the Ascomycota, species from several genera have been reported to be associated withsh infections (Ta b l e 1 ). In addition to the Ascomycota, species belonging to the (earlier diverging) Zygomycota have also beenreported to cause disease. The majority of the fungi, which cancause infection in sh are opportunistic and not exclusive para-sites of sh. They are most commonly known as plant pathogens(e.g., Penicillium corylophilum and Phoma herbarum), soil fungi (e.g., Paecilomyces lilacinus ) and some have even been reported to cause infection in immunosuppressed humans (e.g., Exaphiala xenobiota and Ochroconis humicola). Branching close to the divergence between fungi and ani- mals there is a relatively recently recognized clade of organisms,the Mesomycetozoea (Mendoza et al., 2002; Ragan et al., 1996), which includes a number of species that are pathogenic to aquaticorganisms including sh ( Mendoza et al., 2002; Glockling et al., 2013). Within the Mesomycetozoea, species can be divided fur-ther into the orders of Dermocystida and Ichthyophonida. TheDermocystida include a number of species that can be pathogenicto sh, the most notable being Sphaerothecum destruens, which can infect a wide range of hosts and has been shown to cause dis-ease and high mortality in cyprinids ( Andreou et al., 2011, 2012) and salmonid species (Arkush et al., 1998; Paley et al., 2012 ). The order also includes numerous Dermocystidium sp., which can infect a variety of sh species (see Ta b l e 1 ). The diversity of the Dermocystidium g e n u si sp r o b a b l yu n d e r e s t i m a t e da sal a r g eproportion of recorded cases in the literature only identify thepathogen to genus level. This can be addressed by applying molec-ular techniques to identify species. Within the Ichthyophonida,Ichthyophonus hoferi is the most common parasite of salt and freshwater sh ( Hershberger et al., 2010; Kocan et al., Gregg al., 2012; Hamazaki et al., 2013 ). The Oomycete parasites of shes are placed in the Phylum Oomycota and fall into either the saprolegnialean lineage orthe peronosporalean lineage. The Oomycetes are water mouldswhich morphologically resemble fungi, but are taxonomicallydistinct, encompassing species that are parasitic to a large diver-sity of host species ( Beakes et al., 2012). The majority of the species, which can infect and cause disease in sh belong to theorder of Saprolegniales and fall within the genera Aphanomyces and Achlya . A of species fall within the genus Pythium , a member of the peronsporalean lineage. T welve species of Saprolegnia and six species each of Aphanomyces and Achlya (Ta b l e 1 ) are more often described in the literature as causing infection in sh; with the most common pathogens ofsh being Saprolegnia parasitica and Aphanomyces invadans which have relatively high generalist indices (See Ta b l e 1 ).S. parasitica has been reported to cause disease in 12 sh species whilst A. invadans can par asitize 48 sh species. HOST SPECIFICITY A common characteristic of the sh pathogens within Fungi,Mesomycetozoea, and Oomycetes is their generalist nature, withthe majority of species infecting and causing disease in shesacross different families ( Ta b l e 1 ). All three groups include an equal proportion of species with generalist indices above 3 indi-cating that they are true generalists ( Poulin and Mouillot, 2003). Due to higher reporting and detection of disease in farmed envi-ronments, most disease reports are from aquaculture facilities andinvolve cultured sh species. There is thus a bias in the sh speciesreported as susceptible to these pathogens and a possible under-estimation of their generalist nature ( Ramaiah, 2006). A large number of species have a single record of affecting a single shspecies in the literature and thus the generalist index cannot becalculated. The ability of fungal and fungal-like pathogens to infect mul- tiple hosts (\"the widest spectrum of host ranges for any groupof pathogens\" according to Fisher et al., 2012 ;s e e Ta b l e 1 for sh). often drives high virulence in the most susceptible hosts(Andreou et al., 2012; Huchzermeyer and V an der W aal, 2012 ). The aspect of generalism in pathogenicity is important due to thefact that generalist pathogens are more likely to emerge throughhost switching (W oolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005), and itis often overlooked (Y amamoto and Kilistoff, 1979; Peeler et al.,2010). However, it is commonly accepted ( Ewald, 1994)t h a ti n single hosts the optimum level of virulence is determined by thetrade-off between virulence and transmissibility ( Davies et al., 2001). Thus, the composition of the community and the suscep-tibility of each host could alter its potential transmissibility andthe outcome of infection ( W oolhouse et al., 2001 ). Experimental challenges to fungal and fungal-like pathogens of several sh hostspecies are currently needed. This could involve simple one host -one pathogen challenges such as in Andreou et al.

NA stands for non-applicable as the index cannot be calculated when only one host has been reported. The sh taxonomy proposed by Nelson (1994) was used in calculating all generalist indices. combination of multi-hosts challenges. In addition, experimental data on the free-living elements of these life cycles of pathogenssuch as the presence of zoospores, would allow the measurementof their production, longevity in the system and their resistanceto a range of abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, PH). These dataare needed to build reliable models to test host susceptibility,understand the controlling factors of infectious phase as well asthe recovery phase typical of SIT or SEIR epidemiological models(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered). LIFE CYCLES AND STAGES In the assimilative phases of oomycetes and most of the true fungi,colonization of new tissues is accomplished through the growth ofhyphae, with the exception of the black yeasts, Exophiala,w h i c h may transition between yeast and hyphal forms (dimorphism) ( de Hoog et al., 2011 ). Mesomycetozoeans more often grow as round multinucleate coenocytes. These can be concentrated in visiblecysts in the genus Dermocystidium (e.g., Lotman et al., 2000 ) or disseminated or destruens and et al., forms have been described in some Dermocystidium (Dykova and Lom, 1992 ) and are 1994; Franco-Sierra fungi, however, have septate hyphae, although some oomycetes have segmented or plugged functioning for dispersal or further dis-semination within the host. In the fungi, this is through theproduction of conidiospores (Ascomycota) or sporangiospores(Zygomycota), and the budding of yeast stages. These spores are not motile and are protected by a chitinous cell wall. The durability and resilience of these spores is an important adap- tation for increasing opportunities to encounter new susceptiblehosts ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). These spores can survive in a dormantstate during conditions unfavorable for growth. Oomycetes pro-duce biflagellated zoospores within sporangia, usually locatedeither at the terminal ends of hyphae. These spores functionto disperse the parasite between hosts and typically encyst aftera short period of motility. In Saprolegnia species longer lived secondary zoospores emerge from cysts produced by primaryzoospores. This pattern of re-emergence called polyplanetism,may be repeated several times ( Bruno et al., 2011 ), and most likely functions to allow several opportunities to contact a newhost. Zoospores of many oomycetes are chemotactic, respondingto amino acids, carbohydrates and a range aldehyde attractants(Donaldson and Deacon, 1993 ). The encysted zoospores of S. par- asitica are decorated by long hooked hairs that are thought to aid in attachment to the sh host (V an W est, 2006; W alker and V anW est, 2007). Reproduction in the Mesomycetozoea is more varied (Mendoza et al., 2002). S. destruens produce non-motile walled endospores which may either infect other cells within thesame host or spread and infect a new host ( Arkush et al., 2003). Endospores also produce singly flagellate zoosporesupon exposure to fresh water ( Arkush et al., 2003 ) but it is not clear whether these zoospores are infective ( Paley et al., 2012). Dermocystidium has development devel- opment within spores, but zoospores are infective ( et al., 1991). Released endospores of both Dermocystidium salmonis and S. destruens have the capacity to release zoospores for several weeks at 4 C( Olson et al., 1991; Andreou et al., 2009 ). The life cycle of Ichthyophonus is less understood and varies with pH (Okamoto et al., 1985; Spanggaard et ). Single endospores are culture and in vivo (Okamoto released under specic pH optima in culture (e.g., Okamoto et al., 1985 ). T ransmission is also not well understood, except Frontiers in Microbiology | Aquatic Microbiology February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |6Gozlan et al. Understanding sh fungal pathogens that the parasite can be acquired through carnivory ( Jones and Dawe, 2002). Kocan et al. (2013) describe small amoeboid stages within the stomach wall of sculpin and trout hosts after feeding of infected tissues and hypothesize that these amoebae representthe infectious stage. The infectious stage of planktivorous shis still unknown ( Gregg et al., 2012 ) and an alternate host is suspected ( Sindermann and Scattergood, 1954 ). In parasites of shes sexual reproduction (s-strategy) has only been described in a few oomycetes. When sexual reproductionoccurs, the two dissimilar gametangial structures called the oogo-nium and the antheridium grow closer together until they fuse,and haploid nuclei from the antheridia fertilize the eggs withinthe forming diploid oospores. In free living oomycetesthe fertilized zygote, or oospore, is typically resistant and cansurvive for prolonged periods. Meiosis and recombination occurbefore germination of the oospore. However, the main oomycetepathogens of live sh (e.g., A. invadans and S. parasitica), do not generally (in case of A. invadans never) reproduce sexually and therefore rely entirely on asexual zoosporogenesis (r-strategy).Some egg infecting species do produce oogonia (e.g., S. australis, S. diclina, S. ferax ) but even in these species oospore germination is rarely if ever observed. It is highly unlikely that oosporesserve as effective resistant survival structures for sh parasiticoomycetes. Most true fungal parasites of sh are described as\"fungi imperfecti, \" based on the lack of a described sexual stage. TROPHIC MODES Research on animal parasites has revealed that many of thesespecies are not exclusively saprophytic or parasitic ( Gleason et al., 2010; McCreadie et al., 2011 ). In fact, their precise ecological functions can only be understood with intensive metagenomicinvestigations, which have rarely been conducted ( Jiang et al., 2013). Nonetheless, these microorganisms are frequently charac-terized as either saprotrophs or biotrophs (Gleason et al., 2010;McCreadie et al., 2011 ). Saprotrophs usually do not infect live hosts, rather they grow on non-living organic material. In con-trast many biotrophs cannot grow outside the host, but some canbe grown in culture. Growth of parasites in culture allows researchon mechanisms of infection and sequencing genes. Facultativeparasites can grow well as either parasites or saprotrophs. Manyeukaryotic microorganisms are thought to be parasites primarilybecause they cannot be grown outside their host, but in fact theirtrophic relationships remain to be determined. Many Oomycetespecies are primarily saprotrophs, yet few can become parasitesunder certain conditions, such as compromised immunity in theirhosts. The important point is that they have alternative substratesfor growth outside the host, which is an important characteristicof emerging infectious diseases (EID) ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). PROTEINS AS SUBSTRATES FOR GROWTH For a long time proteins have been known to be good sub-strates for the isolation of Oomycetes into pure culture and fortheir subsequent growth in liquid media ( Sparrow, 1960). For example, casein and keratin can be useful substrates for isola-tion and growth. Furthermore animal hosts and tissues are knownto be protein rich environments. Czeczuga et al. (2002) iso- lated many species of Oomycetes from specimens of sh musclesplaced in freshwater lakes. Some of these specimens came fromsh, which were known to be hosts for Oomycetes. Smith et al. (1994) demonstrated proteolytic activity of Saprolegnia diclina, ferax, and parasitica by observing the clearing of casein on solid media. Proteins must be digested extra-cellularly and the aminoacids produced must be transported into the cell prior to theircatabolism. Jiang et al. (2013) documented the presence of genes for serine, metallo- and cysteine proteases and genes for aminoacid transporters in the complete sequence of the genome of Pythium grew rapidly on many but not all amino acids as sole sources of carbon andnitrogen in liquid media ( good carbon sources,there was very little or no growth on valine, isoleucine, threonine,methionine, and glycine, and there were considerable differencesin rates of utilization among the species tested. Saprotrohic andparasitic isolates of Saprolegnia can remove all amino acids from liquid media during growth on mixtures of amino acids ( Gleason, 1973; Nolan, 1976). These data indicate that many Oomyceteshave the capacity for digestion of proteins and subsequent uptakeand catabolism of amino acids. Therefore they commonly growin protein rich environments. Recently, a few species in theMesomycetozoea have been grown in culture ( Glockling et al., 2013), but nutritional experiments have not been conducted, andlittle is known about their proteolytic capacities. CURRENT DETECTION TECHNIQUES Lesions formed by parasites were initially characterized fromphenotypic, serological and morphological properties of thepathogen. Isolation and culturing of causative organisms fromswabbed lesions of infected sh has been an integral part inunderstanding the taxonomic groupings, etiology of the disease,infectivity, and host-parasite relationships. The process of isolat-ing and identifying pathogens can however be a time consumingprocess requiring a high level of technical expertise. Morphological identication of microbial species, which often requires identication of reproductive stages, is difcult toaccomplish directly from ulcerated tissue. Direct visualization ofpathogens in infected tissues has been made possible with thedevelopment of species-specic fluorescent probes. For exam-ple, the monoclonal antibody MAb 3gJC9, which is specicfor an antigen involved the pathogenicity of Aphanomyces astaci and A. invadans (=piscicida) in infected craysh and sh respectively, has been used for immunofluorescent identica-tion of these species in infected tissues ( Miles et al., 2003 ). The approach was found to be more sensitive than the conventionalstaining method, Grocott's methanamine silver stain, in that itenabled the detection of early stages of infection ( Grocott, 1955; Miles et al., 2003 ). Fluorescent hybridization (FISH) probes have also been used to identify specic pathogens in infected tissuesin situ . For example, A. invadans was found to be a primary oomycete pathogen in ulcerative mycosis of infected estuarinesh in North Carolina and Florida using a FISH assay ( V andersea et al., 2006; Sosa et al., 2007a,b). Continuing improvements in www.frontiersin.org February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |7Gozlan et al. Understanding sh fungal pathogens isolation, culturing and in situ approaches is essential for broad- ening our understanding of disease pathology and etiology and more fundamentally the morphology and physiology of thesepathogenic species. In comparison to morphological and physio-logical classication, the rapid advances in molecular techniqueshas improved the reliability and accuracy of the tool in distin-guishing many taxa, such as the microsporidian taxa ( Larsson, 2005). A molecular approach has also led to rapid development ofdiagnostic tools which involve polymerase chain reaction (PCR),amplication of nucleic acids, restriction enzyme digestion, probehybridization and nucleotide sequencing. The development ofthe FISH assay for example was as a result of using a sensitivePCR technique. The use of PCR to detect and identify infectionshas become commonplace ( T sui et al., 2011 ). A large number of disease-causing pathogens are often identied to genus level(e.g., Dermocystidium sp.) and not species level. The number of species being identied has been constantly increasing throughthe use of molecular tools for disease detection and identication.A concerted effort to use the same DNA loci would increase theavailable genetic information resulting in a better resolution ofthe phylogenetic relationships within and between these groups.The 18S rRNA gene has been used extensively (for Fungi andMesomycetozoans); however the Internal T ranscribed Sequence1 (ITS1) has been more extensively used within the Oomycetes.As documented by Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo et al. (2007) for the S. diclina- S. parasitica complex, both molecular and morphological and physiological data can help solve phylogenetic relationships.Thus, using ITS rRNA gene, ve phylogenetic separate clades wereidentied for the Saprolegnia complex, with all isolates collected from salmonid lesions falling into a single clade (i.e., clade I).However, within that clade I, parasitic isolates came from a widerange of hosts including, for example, crustaceans, and catshbut also non-pathogenic isolates from soil and water. Molecularanalyses have the potential to discriminate at the subspecies orstrain level (Phadee et al., 2004 ). The level of sensitivity of the molecular techniques in the clinical context has however beensporadic ( Cunningham, 2002). This is largely due to the rela- tively low genomic information that is available through publicdata bases such as Genbank. W e propose that all reported casesof disease outbreaks should have both of these regions sequencedand reported within the literature. The use of these loci will allowboth detection at species level (18S rRNA) and identication ofdifferent strains (using ITS1) within the same species; allowing fora better identication and detection of virulent strains. This col-lection of information alongside morphological and physiologicaldata will increase the resolution of the phylogenetic informationand the sensitivity of molecular identication. Alternative detection approaches include loop-mediated isothermal amplication (LAMP) and pyrolysis massspectrometry. LAMP has the potential of increasing sensi-tivity of pathogen compared to PCR and unlike PCR it is notinactivated by tissue and blood-derived inhibitors or genomicDNA ( Savan et al., 2005 ) .I th a sb e e nu s e di nt h ed e t e c t i o n of trypanosome infection ( Savan et canonical variate analysis have demonstrate clusters of A. isolates and dis- criminate them from non-pathogenic Aphanomyces species(Lilley et al., 2001 ). The development and renement of multiple approaches of detection have their place in increasing theknowledge of the pathogen, its distribution, impact and possiblemanagement. IMPORTANCE OF FUNGAL PATHOGENS IN AQUACULTURE Fish represent a key ecosystem service for sheries and aquacul-ture across the world ( Zhao et al., 2014 ). The annual harvest is about 42 million tonnes (marine and freshwater) and the sectoremploys 33.1 million people, highlighting the tremendous socialcost of sheries ( Gozlan and Britton, 2014). The livelihoods of 60 million people in the developing world are dependent on riversheries and millions more rely on them for food ( Dugan and Allison, 2010). However, disease in aquaculture represents themost signicant economic losses and in particular fungal infec-tions, which in terms of economic impact are second only to bac-terial diseases ( Neish and W est, 2006; Gon\u00e7alves and Gagnon,2011). For example it has been reported in Japan some annuallosses of 50% in the production of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch a n de l v e r so fe e lAnguilla Anguilla due to outbreaks of S. parasitica (Hatai and Hoshai, 1994; Scarfe, 2003 ). In the last decades, the aquaculture sector has seen a change in the sh production with a trend toward intensication withthe use of recirculating systems ( Larkin and Sylvia, 1999 ). The underpinning drive was a reduction of environmental footprint, abetter control of the rearing environment and increased biosecu-rity. Nonetheless, this improved control of rearing conditions, haslead the industry to also increase the stocking densities of targetsh. Thus, it has resulted in an increase of disease outbreaks, withfaster transmission and increased mortalities ( Bondad-Reantaso et al., 2005; and Chong, 2007; Peeler et al., 2010;Gon\u00e7alves and Gagnon, 2011). One of the key risks associated with this new aquaculture environment is the stress caused by intensive production. Somefungal pathogens such as Saproglegnia for example are more prevalent and virulent in host (salmonids in particular) thatare raised under stressful conditions However, othersignicant pathogen risks in aquaculture arise from the large andfrequent movement of young stages due to either a lack of orinsufcient national production, or due to sh species for whichthe life cycle has not yet been mastered at a commercial level, oreven contaminated sources of water supplies. Of course this is notspecic to fungal or fungal-like pathogens but their generalist andopportunistic nature associated with a wide environmental toler-ance are risk factors that may lead to signicant loss of production(Harrell et al., 1986; Paley et al., 2012 ). I na d d i t i o n ,m y c o s e ss p r e a di n s h e sa r eo f t e ns e e na sa secondary phenomenon. However, due to their virulence, theircurrent emergence in wild sh populations and also the riskof spill back from aquaculture facilities to the wild, routinepathological examination should include (in addition to bac-teriological ones) mycological examination (see Rehulka, 1991 for details). Dominant fungal pathogens in and Saprolegnia (Willoughby and Pickering, 1977; Blazer and Frontiers in Microbiology | Aquatic Microbiology February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |8Gozlan et al. Understanding sh fungal pathogens W olke, 1979; 1993 ).A. invadans for example can cause epizootic ulcerative syndrome in over a hundred of mostly fresh- water sh (e.g., Vishwanath et al., 1998; Blazer et al., 2013; Nsonga et al., 2013 ) but also in some brackish sh species ( Catap and Munday, 2002; Sosa et al., 2007b ). In aquaculture conditions, the most appropriate control is through eradication of the stock,quarantine of new stocks and good husbandry (Scarfe, 2003;Whittington and Chong, 2007 ) and as such represent a signicant cost to the trade ( Forneris et al., 2003). There are no treatments that are specic to fungal and fungal- like pathogens but existing ones such as the use of hydrogenperoxide or formalin ( Arndt et al., 2001 ), malachite n W est, 2006), sodium chloride ( Schreier et al., 1996)a n db r o n o p o l (Shinn et al., 2012 ) all present some signicant issues related to either human or sh health or to efcacy of the treatments(Carana et al., 2012 ). Malachite green was banned by the US and EU in early nineties and since then formalin has probably beenthe most effective control measure but there is a strong possibil-ity that this will soon also be banned from use. Other treatmentsuch as bronopol and other agents are not as effective. Other treat-ments such as the use of ozone in recirculating systems have tobe specically adapted for fugal pathogens. For example, stud-ies have shown that ozone treatments for Saprolegnia are effective with doze from about 0.01 to 0.2 mg.L 1(Gon\u00e7alves and Gagnon, 2011) but present a cost of through reduction in hatching rates(e.g., 42.6-49.1%). New treatments based on plant extract haveshown some promising paths but further evaluations need to beperformed before its use by the industry ( Carana et al., 2012 ). ECOLOGICAL IMPACT ON WILD POPULATIONS The emergence of infectious diseases caused by fungal andfungal-like microbes continues to negatively impact wild shpopulations, leading in some cases to local and pan-continentalextinctions (Gozlan et al., 2005, 2010; Rowley et al., 2013 ). Thus, understanding of the true ecological cost of fungal and fungal-like microbes is pivotal to improve our conservation practicesof sh populations, especially freshwater species, as declines inpopulations, species distributions and species diversity continueto occur at alarming rates ( Myers, 1993; Singh, 2002; Romansic et al., 2009 ). Fungal and fungal-like microbes that cause disease emergence in wild sh (Ta b l e 2 ), craysh, amphibians al., 2011 ).Saprolegnia and Sphaerothecum spp. are impacting wild salmon populations around the world ( Willoughby et al., 1983; V an W est, 2006; et al., 2009), prevailing in 32% ofadult late-fall-run chinook salmon returning to Battle Creek onthe Sacramento River ( Arkush et al., 1998 ).Aphanomyces spp. are also responsible for causing EIDs, for example, EpizooticUlcerative Syndrome (EUS) commonly known as red spot inover a hundred freshwater and estuarine sh species worldwide(Chinabut et al., 1995; Lilley et al., 1997; Boys et al., 2012).EUS has been recognized in Australia ( Huchzermeyer and V an der W aal, 2012 ) and the Philippines ( Callinan et al., 1995 ) since 1972 and 1995 respectively, however in 2006 this fungal pathogenwas sighted in the Zambezi River System (ZRS), Africa, ZRS inhabiting severalnew ecosystems Huchzermeyer and V Nsonga et al., 2013 ). Additionally, Aphanomcyes spp. low host specicity increases its prevalence among a range of species, increasing dis-ease outbreaks in the ZRS, which is home to approximately eightyspecies and thus becoming a great concern in disease control(Huchzermeyer and V an der W aal, 2012 ). However, compared to farmed sh populations, monitoring EIDs in wild populations can prove difcult as sh are constantlymoving long distances beneath turbid waters, which means theycan go undetected and underreported distorting our understand-i n go ft h ee f f e c t so nt h e s ep o p u l a t i o n s( Gozlan, 2012). Globally, EIDs have caused high mortalities in farmed populations ( To r t o - Alalibo et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 2008; V an Den Berg et al., 2013 ). This is important information for wild populations because thereare several instances where transmission of fungal and fungal-likemicrobes can occur between the two environments. For exam-ple, farmed sheries often drain into rivers (Andreou et al., 2012 ) allowing the transfer of microbes and other organisms ( widely known by its aquaculture and ornamental shtrade, is a healthy carrier of S. destruens (Gozlan et al., 2005 ). Originally and unintentionally imported from China, the top-mouth gudgeon's propitious nature has allowed it to become aprofound invader in wild environments, invading thirty ve newcountries over the past 40 years, where for example S. destruens was identied in river systems of the Netherlands and the UK,posing great threats to native sh populations ( Gozlan et al., 2010; Spikmans et al., 2013 ). Previous studies have shown that susceptibility of farmed sh to fungal or fungal-like microbes depends on several factorsincluding rapid drops in ambient temperatures (Bly et al., 1993;Lategan et al., 2004 ), low water levels, failure to remove dead sh or eggs, primary infection by other organisms, ( Piper et al., 1982; Plumb, 1984)a n dp o l l u t i o n( Wu et al., 2010 ), all of which can reduce ecosystem function ( Chapin et al., 2000; Cowx and Gerdeaux, 2004; Peeler al., 2010) and to an increase inEIDs ( W oolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005). Thus, we could expect that such environmental drivers at play in the wild wouldpotentially have also a direct impact on the emergence of fungalpathogens. In particular, the recent paper by V \u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. (2010) sho ws that 65% of rivers worldwide regarding thermaland water level disturbances are under moderate-high threat, in particular Asia and North America. However, V \u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. (2010) goes on further to highlight the fact that there is a lack of knowledge and investment being directed to biodiversity con-servation, with an increase in EIDs, species distinctions, humanpopulation, climate change and habitat destruction ( V\u00f6 r \u00f6 s m a r t y et al., 2010; Huchzermeyer and V an der W aal, 2012; Nsonga et al.,2013). It will be important to monitor these river systems andto reduce these pressures, consequently allowing the populations,species distributions and diversity of sh to remain sustainablefor the future. PERSPECTIVES AND CONCLUSIONS Since, the initial discovery of the fungal chytrid pathogen 20years ago ( Berger et al., 1998), several studies have reported its www.frontiersin.org February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |9Gozlan et al.

What is interesting with this particular pathogen is the relatively good epidemio-logical data, which have allowed the progression of the diseaseto be tracked on a global scale and in many wild amphibianpopulations. However, there is currently not enough epidemiological data r e l a t e dt of u n g a lp a t h o g e n so f s h .I nl i g h to ft h er e c e n te m e r -gence of S. destruens, which poses a threat to European sh diversity (Gozlan et al., 2005; Andreou et al., 2012 ), it is likely that patterns of ecological impacts similar to those found in chytridparasites of amphibians, are at play in freshwater sh populations(Gozlan, 2012). For example, as the great majority of S. destru- ens cases are driven by the invasion of a healthy sh carrier, it is expected, as shown by Spikmans et al. (2013) , that additional monitoring of invaded wild sh communities would show thepresence of this fungal-like infectious pathogen. In fact, there isnot enough fungal pathogen data mostly for sh from wild popu-lations. It is interesting to note that the dominant reporting of shfungal and fungal-like pathogens has come from the aquaculturesector with very limited reports on fungal emergence in wild shpopulations (see Ta b l e 2 ). The key reason is likely to be a com- bination of a lack of external pathological specicity of infectedhosts and the chronic nature of some of the diseases caused bythese fungal and fungal-like pathogens, which, in contrast to viralpathogens, spread over longer periods of time. Research should be modeled after the amphibian chytrid research structure with a lot more systematic tracking of thesepathogens. For example, the recent paper by McMahon et al. (2013) clearly indicates that even for the chytrid, which has been well studied in the wild, new potential non-amphibianhosts could contribute further to its dispersal, prevalence andvirulence. Similarly, it would thus be pertinent to determine iffungal and fungal-like pathogens of sh that have a high gener-alist index could include non-sh hosts and thus contribute to awider dissemination of some fungal related diseases beyond theimmediate local sh communities. Additional monitoring of wild s h e si sa l s on e e d e d .I d e n t i c a t i o na n ds u r v e y so fe n v i r o n m e n -tal drivers of fungal pathogens would improve understanding ofthe ecological risks of disease emergence in aquatic communi-ties ( Copp et al., 2009, 2010 ). This should also be the concern of the aquaculture sector, as strong pathways exist between wild andfarmed sh with truly biosecure sh farms being the exception.The pan-extinction of sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus populations in Europe in less than 40 years should be a reminder of the riskassociated with an un-controlled epizooty of fungal pathogens Frontiers in Microbiology | Aquatic Microbiology February 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 62 |10Gozlan et al. Understanding sh fungal pathogens (see Gozlan et al., 2005, 2010). Environmental surveys to iden- tify ecological drivers of fungal pathogens in shes are also key in characterizing the underpinning drivers of fungal and fungal-likepathogen emergence. For example, sh fungal pathogen emer-gence such as the EUS in Africa could well be linked to currentenvironmental changes occurring in African rivers ( V \u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al., 2010 ). Thus, in light of the importance of freshwater sh for millions of people around the world, particularly in develop-ing countries, in addition to biodiversity conservation perspec-tives, pathologists should make a concerted effort to increasetheir monitoring of fungal pathogens in wild sh populations.Currently, PCR is the method that should be used for moni-toring. Along with an increasing reduction in PCR associatedcost, their sensitivity and specicity should facilitate such regularmonitoring of the wild sh compartment. In conclusion, our review of fungal and fungal-like pathogens of sh has highlighted current knowledge gaps that need tobe rapidly lled if future epizootics are to be prevented. Ithas also that epidemiological elements arising fromother non-sh specic fungal pathogens could be used torene our true understanding of current and future ecologi-cal impacts of these types of pathogens on global sh diversity.For example, existing experimental data arising from fungalpathogen challenges of sh should be used to develop SEIRmodels (i.e., susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) specicto fungal pathogens and sh hosts. This would allow a simulationof the true extent of the ecological risk and provide elements fora better environmental monitoring and understanding of thesetypes of pathogens. REFERENCES Adl, S.

Conservation biological control is a biological control strategy in which farming practices and environmental manipulations are adopted to enhance the living conditions for specic natural enemiesof pests. However, in order to manipulate the environment for the benet of populations of the entomopathogens, knowledge of fundamental aspects of the ecology of the fungi considered is necessary. This knowledge is still scarce despite the large bulk of recent research into inoculation and inundation biological control with these fungi. Here, we review the current knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in agroecosystems of temperate regions, primarily Europe and North America. We suggest anamorphic life cycles of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in these regions based on the literature of their natural occurrence and distribution in agroecosystems, population dynamics, and interactions with other organisms, environ-mental factors, and agronomical practices./C2112007 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Studies of biodiversity in agroecosystems and the delivery of ecosystem services to agricultural production have usually ignored the contribution of entomopatho-gens in the regulation of pest populations ( Altieri, 1999; et ever, entomopathogens are among the natural enemiesof arthropod pests in agroecosystems. An improved understanding of the ecology of indigenous populations of these benecial organisms is a prerequisite for theevaluation of their contributions to pest control andfor predicting the impact of agricultural practices on their populations. The anamorphic (Asco- mycota) are natural enemies of a wide range of insects andarachnids and both fungi have a cosmopolitan distribution(Roberts and St. Leger, 2004; Rehner, 2005 ). Much eort has been put into research on the development of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae as biological control agents (for inunda- tion and inoculation biological control) to be applied in agri-culture and forestry in temperate regions. However, this bulkof knowledge is in striking contrast to the lack of researchinto the fundamental ecology of these fungi in terrestrial eco-systems, including agroecosystems. 1049-9644/$ - see front matter /C2112007 Elsevier Inc.

CBC is a biological control strategy in which farming manage-ment practices are adopted to enhance the living condi- tions for specic natural enemies of pests with the specic objective to suppress pest populations ( Barbosa, 1998; Eilenberg et al., 2001 ). In recent years, an extensive number of studies have been published with focus on CBC with respect to natural enemies belonging to the arthropods, i.e., predators and parasitoids (e.g., Landis et al., 2000; Gurr et al., 2003; Kean et al., 2003; Changand Snyder, 2004 ). So far, limited research eort has been devoted to the eects of environmental manipula-tions on entomopathogens ( Fuxa, 1998; Ekesi et al., 2005). Emphasis has been given to aphid pathogenic fungi from Entomophthorales: Pandora neoaphidis (Rem- audie`re and Hennebert) Humber and its potential as a natural enemy in CBC was studied in the UK ( Shah and Pell, 2003; Ekesi et al., 2005 ) and Neozygites fresenii (Nowakowski) Batko was studied in ( Shah and Pell, 2003; Steinkraus, 2006 ). In both cases the authors concluded that these fungal pathogens showed highpotential for CBC of aphids. However, insights into thefundamental ecology of the fungi in agroecosystems areessential to predict the eects of environmental manipu-lations on the fungal populations and thus to includeentomopathogens in CBC ( Fuxa, 1998; Lacey et al., 2001; Stuart et al., 2006 ). Informa- tion of pathogen persistence and dispersal is equally important ( Fuxa, 1998 ). Knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae in agroecosystems in temperate regions as well as the eects of environmental conditions andagricultural practices on the fungi is therefore necessary if they are to be manipulated for CBC in the future. Here, we present the current knowledge of these ecolog- ical aspects with reference to B. bassiana and M. anisop- liaein temperate agroecosystems. We have based the review on the published literature on natural occurrence and fundamental ecology of the mor- phological species B. bassiana and M. anisopliae . Recent research has shown that morphological species B. bas- siana is paraphyletic ( Rehner and 2005 ) and con- sists of two separate clades that should be separated taxonomically. As this redescription has not yet been done, we use B. bassiana throughout this review as reference to the morphological species when no information of phylo-genetic aliation is available. German studies have recently shown that the structure of the agricultural landscape has impact on agroecosystembiodiversity, which also comprises entomopathogenicfungi, and thus the ecosystem services they deliver (Tscharntke et al., 2005 ). We therefore include the aspect of landscape elements in this review. This review aims to create the foundations for future focus on the indigenouspopulations of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae as biological control agents in temperate regions using a CBC strategy. 2. Distribution and diversity of indigenous populations2.1. Soil The soil environment is usually the conventional isola- tion site for hypocrealean entomopathogenic fungi ( Keller and Zimmerman, 1989; Hajek, 1997 ), and several species can be found in both cultivated and more natural habitats (Steenberg, 1995; Va \u00a8nninen, 1996; Bidochka et 2003; Meyling and Eilen-berg, 2006b ). In studies of natural occurrence of entomo- pathogenic fungi in the soil, susceptible bait insects suchasGaller ia mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) or Teneb- rio molitor L.(Coleoptera: Tenebrioidae) are usually added to soil samples in order to recover fungal isolates; in prin- ciple the method can be described as the use of selective media. Keller et al. (2003) found M. anisopliae to be common in both arable elds and adjacent meadows, but the species occurred at higher densities in meadows. In Canada, M. anisopliae was most frequent in agricultural elds com- pared to forest habitats ( Bidochka et al., 1998 ), while M. anisopliae in Finland was isolated more often in southern parts of the country and the occurrence was not adversely aected by cultivation of the soil ( Va\u00a8nninen, 1996 ). In Dan- ish soils M. anisopliae was more frequent in sun exposed habitats (i.e., cultivated areas) than in shaded habitats (Steenberg, 1995 ), which is similar to the Canadian nd- ings. Furthermore, M. anisopliae was not among the entomopathogenic fungi isolated in the soil of a Danish forest ecosystem ( Nielsen et al., 2004 ). This implies charac- teristics of M. anisopliae as an 'agricultural' species that is most common in exposed and regularly disturbed soil envi-ronments. Local and signicant dierences in natural dis-tribution on one location can, however, occur. Meyling and Eilenberg (2006b) found M. anisopliae to be locally rare in a Danish agricultural eld while B. bassiana was the dominant fungal species. Bidochka et al. (1998) found B. bassiana to be aliated with shaded and uncultivated habitats (i.e., forests) and B. bassiana also occurred fre- quently in hedgerow soils at a locality ( Meyling and Eilenberg, 2006b ). These dierences in natural occurrences in soil challenge the CBC strategy. Based on the studies made at a regionalscale, indigenous populations of M. anisopliae appeared to be the most suitable candidates for environmental manipu-lations because M. anisopliae was most associated with agricultural eld soil. However, in the case of the Danishagroecosystem described by Meyling and Eilenberg (2006b) ,M. anisopliae was found to be rare locally and B. bassiana would be a more suitable candidate for CBC. Thus the scale of the landscape needs to be consideredwhen evaluating indigenous populations of entomopatho-genic fungi in soils.146 N.V. Meyling, J. Eilenberg / Biological Control 43 (2007) 145-1552.2. Insects Entomopathogenic fungi occur naturally as infections in insect hosts which can be collected in the eld and incu- bated in the laboratory for documentation of the fungus.B. bassiana have been documented to occur naturally in >700 species of hosts ( Inglis et al., 2001 ). Studies on the prevalence of fungi in insects have usually been limited tospecies that are pests or are important non-target speciessuch as certain predators and parasitoids. However, it islikely that almost any major insect taxon collected inten-sively will be found to be a natural host for B. bassiana in temperate regions. The occurrences of the fungi as infec-tions in hosts are presumably the only part of the fungal life cycle in which the fungi can build up signicant popu- lation sizes by producing vast numbers of conidia. Thuscontributing to the availability of susceptible hosts for fun-gal population increase is a key component when consider- ing environmental manipulations in CBC strategies. 2.3. Plant associations Recent evidence suggests that both B. bassiana andM. anisopliae have the potential to engage in fungus-plant interactions. The large majority of investigated higher vas- cular plants have been found to host fungal endophytes(Saikkonen et al., 1998; Arnold and Lewis, 2005 ) including species in Clavicipitaceae contained within Hypocreales(White et al., 2002 ).B. bassiana has also been included in this spectrum of fungi with endophytic activity by infectingcorn ( Zea mays )(Bing and Lewis, 1991, 1992, 1993 phytic fungi are often regarded as plant-defending mutual-ists (Saikkonen et al., 2004 ) and the presence of B. bassiana in internal plant tissue has been discussed as an adaptiveprotection against herbivorous insects ( Elliot et al., 2000; White et al., 2002 ). Besides natural occurrence in leaf tissue of corn, B. bassiana exhibited endophytic activity in cacao In temperate regions,inoculum of B. bassiana has furthermore been isolated from phylloplanes of various plants hedgerows in Den-mark ( Meyling and Eilenberg, 2006a ). This occurrence was hypothesized to be a consequence of deposition fromthe surroundings but was also suggested to act as a naturalinfection pathway of endophytic activity ( Meyling open exciting per- spectives for the understanding of the ecology of B. bassi- ana. However, no knowledge is currently available about natural endophytic activity and host plant range of B. bas- siana in temperate regions or of the signicance of B. bas- siana as an endophyte for fungus or plant tness. Plant association was also recently documented for M. anisopliae , but this association occurred below ground in the rhizosphere ( Hu and St. Leger, 2002 ). The rhizosphere is the layer of soil immediately surrounding the root andmany interactions between plants and other organismsoccur in this interface ( Bais et al., 2006 ). By releasing a recombinant isolate of M. anisopliae to the soil of an exper- imental cabbage eld in MD, USA, Hu and St. Leger (2002) were able to demonstrate that the released isolate persisted better in the soil immediately surrounding the cabbage roots as compared to the bulk soil. Factors in the rhizosphere therefore seemed to promote the persis- tence andbiological activity of M. anisopliae (Hu and St. Leger, 2002 ).Wang et al. (2005) further documented that M. anisopliae expressed similar genes when growing in exu- dates from bean roots and on a nutrient rich medium whiledierent genes were expressed by the fungus when growingon insect cuticle and in insect hemolymph. This indicated that M. anisopliae has developed dierent adaptations to function as a pathogen and to grow saprophytically in the rhizosphere ( Wang et al., 2005 ). The implication for biological control with M. anisopliae exploring the rhizo- sphere competence was investigated by Bruck . Inoc- ulated conidia of M. anisopliae persisted signicantly better to one year) in the rhizosphere of Picea abies compared to the bulk soil ( Bruck, 2005 ). Survival outside the host may thus be critical for the ability of M. anisopliae to con- trol insect pests in the soil ( Roberts and St. Leger, 2004; Bruck, 2005 ). Whether the rhizosphere of plants generally provide a ''refuge'' (where the fungus can survive outsideinsect hosts) for M. anisopliae in the soil remains to be investigated. Perhaps associations with plants are impor-tant in the life cycle of both B. bassiana andM. anisopliae in temperate regions. The compartments in temperate terrestrial ecosystems in which B. bassiana and M. anisopliae occur naturally are summarized in Fig. 1 . Compartments are connected with lines to indicate dispersal and infection pathways whenthese are known; these aspects are presented below. Plantassociations are included as potential compartments forthe natural occurrence of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae . 2.4. Genetic diversity in populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae Biodiversity is usually evaluated by assessment of spe- cies diversity. Biodiversity assessment of fungal communi- ties is, however, challenging, because fungal taxa oftenconsist of complexes of cryptic species ( Bickford et al., 2007). Cryptic species are found in B. bassiana (Rehner and Buckley, 2005; Rehner et al., 2006 ) and seemingly also in the morphological species M. anisopliae (Bidochka et al., 2001, 2005 ). Evaluating the biodiversity contribution of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae in agroecosystems must there- fore be based on an assessment of the genetic diversity todiscover potential cryptic species. Traditional assessmentof fungal species diversity is based on morphological fea-tures. Unfortunately, few and sometimes ambiguous char-acters are used for species separation. Furthermore, many entomopathogenic hypocrealean fungi have probably exclusively anamorphic life cycles in temperate regions, atN.V. Meyling, J. Eilenberg / Biological Control 43 (2007) 145-155 147least outside East Asia, which additionally complicates matters about dening biological species and comparingintraspecic and interspecic genetic diversity. Recentadvances in molecular techniques have shed new light onour understanding of species boundaries, especially within the genus Beauveria . Several studies have revealed much genetic diversity of the morphological species B. bassiana (Glare, 2004 ). However, a recent phylogeny of Beauveria spp. showed that the morphological species B. bassiana in fact is paraphyletic and consists of two unrelated clades of which one is more related to Beauveria brongniartii (Sac- cardo) Petch ''-group ( Reh- ner and Buckley, 2005 ). This latter group is tentatively referred to as 'pseudobassiana' ( Rehner et al., 2006 ) but it needs a formal description. The existence of two unre-lated clades may explain some of the large genetic diversityreported in the morphological species B. bassiana . Further- more, the two groups of B. bassiana are themselves assem- blages of cryptic Buckley, 2005; Rehner et al., 2006 ) thus each group also contains much genetic diversity. Both groups infect a wide range of insects and can be isolated from the soil ( Meyling, 2005; Rehner and Buckley, 2005 ) but unfortunately no data currently exists on dierences in ecological niches between the groups. As mentioned above, B. bassiana is used here to refer to the morphological species when noother information is known. Most studies of genetic diversity of B. bassiana have been based on isolates from culture collections and haveusually been compiled to present isolates from infections in certain pest insects or isolates originating from a (major) geographical region. However, to understand the ecologyof the indigenous fungal populations, studies must be car-ried out on isolates collected at a local scale and in dierent spatial compartments of the ecosystem. These isolates will represent genotypes that potentially interact with host pop-ulations, with each other and the environment under eldconditions. Based on the latter sampling strategy, B. bassiana iso- lates were sampled within the boundaries of a single organic agroecosystem in Denmark with the specic objec-tive to characterize the genetic diversity. Sequence analyses [genomic regions as described in Rehner and Buckley (2005) andRehner et al. (2006) ] showed that several phylo- genetic lineages were present in this single agroecosystem (Meyling, 2005; Meyling et al., 2005 ).Table 1 shows that the Danish locality contained the morphologically similargroups B. bassiana sensu clade of B. bassiana s.l.were more related to isolates from other European countries than they were to isolates from other clades atthe locality. Only one of these clades was representedamong isolates from the arable eld soil ( Table 1 ). At the same site, the morphological species B. bassiana was the most frequent entomopathogenic fungus in the soil of theagricultural eld ( Meyling and Eilenberg, 2006b ).

Meyling, J. Eilenberg / Biological Control 43 (2007) 145-155in the agricultural landscape. The study further indicated that typical North European agroecosystems bordered byhedgerows may harbor signicant sources of genetic diver-sity of entomopathogenic fungi. However, the agriculturaleld soil only harbored one of the identied B. bassiana s.l. clades, documenting the lack of biodiversity in a monocul-tural cropping system, even when organic. Very few studies have been carried out on the genetic diversity of M. anisopliae at a local or regional scale. Most knowledge has been generated in Canada on M. anisopliae isolates from dierent habitats, i.e., agricultural and forestsites. Bidochka et al. (2001) demonstrated that M. anisop- liaeisolates from agricultural soils belonged to a specic genetic group distinguished from isolates originating fromforest soils. These two groups of M. anisopliae could be considered as separate cryptic species ( Bidochka et al., 2001, 2005 ). However, there is currently very limited knowledge about the composition and distribution of M. anisopliae populations at a local scale. Hu and St. Leger (2002) described selected indigenous isolates of M. anisop- liaefrom a local cabbage eld in MD, USA, as belonging to two separate explicit allozyme groups. However, specicgenetic studies of local populations of M. anisopliae still need to be conducted. The Canadian studies ( Bidochka et al., 2001 )o nM. ani- sopliae further generated the interesting conclusion that isolates belonging to the genetic group in agricultural hab- itats exhibited heat-tolerance for in vitro growth as well as stronger UV-light resistance as compared to the group from forested habitats ( Bidochka et al., 2001 ). Thus Bido- chka et al. (2001) proposed the hypothesis that the abiotic conditions (i.e., UV-radiation, exposure to elevated tem- peratures) in the habitat selected for the genetic group ofM. anisopliae that could survive in that given habitat. This hypothesis suggested that the time-window experienced outside the host was the most important factor for patho-gen survival in the environment. Furthermore, it was indi-cated that similar characteristics could be found among B. bassiana isolates collected in Canada ( Bidochka et al., 2002). This corroborates with the distribution of genetic groups of B. bassiana s.l. in the Danish agroecosystem sum- marized in Table 1. Here, only one group could be found in the agricultural soil while several genetic groups were har-bored in the soil of the neighboring hedgerow ( Meyling, 2005; Meyling et al., 2005 ). Obviously, more studies are needed to verify if this is a general trend in agriculturallandscapes in temperate regions and whether the dierent genetic groups of B. bassiana s.l. exhibit variation in their realized niches under dierent abiotic conditions. If only specic genetic groups of the fungi can survive in agricul- tural elds then this will be a challenge for environmentalmanipulations in a CBC strategy targeting B. bassiana andM. anisopliae . 3. Population dynamics 3.1. Population increase and infections of hosts Entomopathogenic fungi rely on arthropod hosts to build up population levels of infective stages (mitosporic conidia). During the cropping season outbreaks of diseasescan regularly be observed in insect populations in the eld,referred to as epizootics. Generally, the development ofepizootics rely on host population dynamics, the number of infective stages in the pathogen population and the via- bility of these, infection eciency and development(Anderson and May, 1981 ) and a complex set of environ- mental factors and timing ( Inglis et al., 2001 ). Considerable information on the biology of the organisms as well as spe-cic environmental parameters (in time and space) is neces-sary to understand and predict the development ofepizootics. Key components of population dynamics of the entomopathogenic fungi are the build up of the popu- lation, the infection of hosts, and the survival and dispersalin the environment ( Anderson and May, 1981 ). Both B. bassiana andM. anisopliae need resourc es from a host individual to grow and build up fungal biomass. It is conventional to consider the hypocrealean entomopatho- genic fungi as saprophytic because many species grow wellon articial media. However, the status of Metarhizium spp. as true saprophytes is not well established ( Roberts and St. ). Moreover, Beauveria spp. and Meta- rhizium spp. are poor competitors for organic resources compared to opportunistic saprophytic fungi that are ubiq-uitous in soils ( Keller and Zimmerman, 1989; Hajek, 1997 ). It seems more likely that the fungi lurk as conidia in the soilenvironment waiting to infect a new host. However, M. anisopliae may be activated by root exudates in the rhizo- sphere as described above. Despite this new evidence, insecthosts should still be considered to constitute the principalTable 1 Genetic groups of isolates of the morphological species B. bassiana collected within a single agroecosystem (an organic eld atBakkega rden, identied based on DNA sequences of genomic regions as described by Rehner and Buckley (2005) andRehner et al.

The host is the ''home ground'' of the entomopathogenicfungi, and opportunistic microorganisms are assumed tobe held eectively at bay by antimicrobial substances pro-duced fungus ( Boucias and Pendland, 1998 ). How- ever, there is very scant published evidence for the antimicrobial activities of the compounds released by these fungi and accordingly Boucias and Pendland (1998) did not provide any references for their claim. A recent documen-tation of antimicrobial activity of substances from B. bas- siana (Oller-Lo \u00b4pez et al., 2005 ) indicates that the assumption is plausible. Field collected living insects,which are incubated in the laboratory, are regularly foundinfected by B. bassiana, yet limited published quantitative data exists on the prevalence of mycosed cadavers in theeld. In Denmark, careful inspection stinging nettles ( Urtica dioica ) in that dead insects sporulating with B. bassiana were relatively abundant among leaf litter and soil: densities of3.5-8.8 cadavers per m 2could be recovered in July in sep- arate patches (N.V. Meyling, unpublished data). Althoughthese data were preliminary they indicated that cadavers were common on the soil surface, probably mostly in hedges and under natural vegetation. Furthermore, the results indicated that population levels of B. bassiana were boosted during the season by conidia production from mycosed insects in the litter layer beneath their host plants. Conidia are produced in a single event which is consis- tent with the denition of semelparous reproduction ( Prin- gle and Taylor, 2002; Hughes et al., 2004 ). Vast numbers of conidia are produced from a single infected insect cadaver(Gottwald and Tedders, 1982 ). The production ( Pringle and Taylor, 2002 ) and has been used as a measure of cost in intraspecic competition in M. ani- sopliae (Hughes et al., 2004 ). However, the persistence and the eectiveness of infection of conidia are also criticalproperties for the ecological tness of entomopathogenic fungi. Most conidia are likely to disintegrate quickly in the environment and only minimal proportions will pre-sumably succeed in infecting new hosts. Infection successis density dependent and the number of conidia must exceed a critical threshold level or minimal viable popula-tion size ( Hughes et al., 2004 ). Thus the acquisition of the threshold of infective conidia by a susceptible host is necessary for the continued survival of the fungus. 3.2. Dispersal in the environment Dispersal of infective stages of a pathogen is an impor- tant factor in disease development ( Anderson and May, 1981). Infective propagules of entomopathogenic fungi in the Hypocreales are passively dispersed, and this is mainly considered to occur through the action of weather compo-nents like wind and rain ( Hajek, 1997; Inglis et al., 2001; Shah and Pell, ). In air samples, B. bassiana was iso- lated among a large array of 1996; Shimazu et al., 2002; Ulevicius et al.,2004) and deposition from the air could be one likely source of the newly documented occurrence of B. bassiana on phylloplanes of hedgerow plants ( Meyling and Eilen- berg, 2006a ). However, localized transmission onto plant parts by rain splash has also been shown ( Bruck and Lewis, 2002b ) but rainfall also removed fungus inoculum that had been applied to foliage ( Inglis et al., 1993, 1995, 2000, 2001). In the soil environment the hypocrealen entomo- pathogenic fungi can persist, but extensive proliferationand dispersal are limited. Population build up relies onthe conversion of host cadaver resources into infective con-idia that are released from and Tedders, 1982 ). The number of conidia released per host is dependent both on fungusspecies, host species, and host size. For example, B. bassi- anareleased 10-200 times more from weevil cadav- ers in the soil by hyphal growth and subsequently infectedlarvae in neighbouring experimental cells while M. anisop- liaegrowth was restricted to the surface of the cadaver (Gottwald and Tedders, 1984 ). Entomopathogenic fungi are dispersed by living infected hosts which migrate and die in another place than wherethey became infected ( Hajek, 1997 ). Several aphid species migrate long distances high in the atmosphere and migrat-ing aphids were found to harbour several entomopatho-genic fungi (Entomophthorales and B. bassiana )(Feng et al., 2004 ). This implies that B. bassiana is able to travel over long distances as infections in hosts, which can later lead to new infections and establishment far away fromthe original site of the fungus. The potential of arthropods to disperse and vector entomopathogenic fungi by their activity has been demon-strated in dierent terrestrial ecosystems. In the soil, coll-embolans dispersed conidia of B. bassiana and M. anisopli aewhich were not pathogenic to them ( Dromph and Vestergaard, 2002 ), both by carrying conidia on the cuticle and by ingesting conidia which, after passage through the digestive tract, could remain viable ( Dromph, 2001). Moreover, collembolans were able to vector inocu- lum to other soil-dwelling insects and initiate infections in laboratory experiments ( Dromph, 2003 ). Also soil-dwell- ing mites were shown to be potential vectors of B. bassiana (Renker et al., 2005 ). Insects inhabiting nettle plants were able to disperse inoculum of B. bassiana by their activity ( Meyling et al., 2006) and could therefore be the distributors of naturally occurring B. bassiana on nettle phylloplanes as ling et al., Moreover, predators infections in aphids after vectoring sporulating cadav-ers ). Interspecic vectoring of B. bassiana has additionally been shown in corn systems where fungivorous beetles dispersed inoculumto larvae of the European corn borer Ostrinia nubialis150 N.V. Meyling, J. Eilenberg / Biological Control 43 (2007) 145-155(Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in the tunnels of the latter ( Bruck and Lewis, 2002a ). Insect activity may therefore influence the dispersal of conidia of B. bassiana as indicated on Fig. 1 . Thus CBC strategies that aim to manipulate the dis- persal of insects may also aect dispersal of entomopatho- genic fungi in the agroecosystem. 4. Eects of agricultural practices and structure of the agroecosystem 4.1. Soil disturbance and environmental factors Annually cropped agroecosystems are highly disturbed mostly due to tillage regimes and this aects the popula- tions of natural enemies of crop pests. The communities of entomopathogenic fungi in the arable soil environ-ments are dierent from communities of less disturbance in the crop- ping system also aect the populations of the fungi. Incorn elds in the US, soil densities of B. bassiana (as measured by colony forming units per g of soil) under dierent tillage regimes were very variable between years, but were seemingly higher in no-tillage systems comparedto systems subjected to ploughing and chiselling ( Bing and Lewis, 1993 ). Likewise, conservation tillage regimes, using strip-till and no-till, were more favorable to B. bas- siana andM. ansiopliae populations in the and wheat aected thepopulation levels of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae com- pared to conventional tillage ( Sosa-Gomez and Moscar- di, 1994 ). These higher fungal densities in reduced tillage and no-till systems could be observationsof indirect eects caused by increased levels of host pop- ulations of non-pest insects. High population levels of non-pest insects have been observed in reduced tillage systems ( Hummel et al., 2002b ). The observations cited above may therefore not necessarily be a direct result of mechanical disturbance on fungal population levels. Exposed fungal inoculum is usually inactivated by the UV-components of solar ( Fargues 1996, 1997b fungi include temperature Inglis et al., 2001 ) with strains exhibiting dierent for growth ( Far- gues et al., 1997a ). Indeed, temperature, moisture and UV-radiation seem to be most important for B. bassiana survival ( Meikle et al., 2003 ). Persistence of applied fungus material in soils has been studied for several isolates of dif-ferent species but the complexity of the soil environmentmakes it dicult to evaluate single factors determining sur-vival ( Inglis et al., 2001 ). Factors such as soil texture ( Gro- den and Lockwood, 1991 ), pH values and moisture contents ( Lingg and Donaldson, 1981 ) have been explored and are thoroughly reviewed by Inglis et al. (2001) and Klingen and Haukeland (2006) .Recent evidence suggests that certain genotypes of M. anisopliae andB. bassiana are dominating in soils of agro- ecosystems in Canada ( Bidochka et al., 2001, 2002 ) and this also seems to apply to Danish conditions for B. bassi- ana(Meyling, 2005 ;Table 1 ). The reason for this observa- tion could be adaptations of specic genetic groups to be more resistant to UV-radiation and temporal elevated tem- peratures. UV resistance and growth tolerance at high tem- peratures were characteristics of the isolates belonging tothe genetic groups from agricultural soil in Canada ( Bido- chka et al., 2001, 2002 ). Given that these observations apply to populations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in general, other genotypes of these fungi could occur in thecropping system by the provisioning of sheltered and non-tilled habitats close to the crop in a CBC strategy. 4.2. Use of agrochemicals Chemical insecticides, herbicides and fungicides are usu- ally applied in conventional farming practices. These com- pounds, especially fungicides applied against plantpathogens, might also negatively aect the populations ofentomopathogenic fungi with reduced pest regulation potential as a consequence. Klingen and Haukeland (2006) provided a detailed review of published studies of eects of chemical pesticides on entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes. Their mainconclusions were that insecticides and herbicides were notvery harmful to fungal growth while fungicides were some-times harmful ( Klingen and Haukeland, 2006 ). However, most studies were performed in vitro with fungal cultures and extrapolation from studies in laboratory experimentsto eld conditions may not be straightforward. In theUK, for example, previous eld application of the fungi-cide benomyl correlated with a lower incidence of B. bassi- anain soil samples ( Mietkiewski et al., 1997; Chandler et al., 1998 ).In vitro experiments further showed that the fungicide triadimefon inhibited the growth of B. bassiana , but elds previously treated with this product showed a higher frequency of occurrence of the fungus in soil sam- ples than in samples from untreated control soils ( Miet- kiewski et al., 1997; Chandler et al., 1998 ). The fungicidal product albicarb even increased activity of in vitro cultures ofB. bassiana (Mietkiewski et al., 1997 ). This emphasizes that due to the complex interactions and composition ofagroecosystems applications of specic fungicides are notnecessarily detrimental to the occurrence of entomopatho- genic fungi in the soil. Selected compounds could thus pos- sibly be used in integrated pest management ( Mietkiewski et al., 1997 ). 4.3. Crop diversication Mixtures of plants within the crop can reduce coloniza- tion by pest species and the use of trap crops can lure the pest insects away from the crop by a push-pull strategy (Hooks and Johnson, 2003; Cook et al., 2007 ). Manipula-N.V. Meyling, J. Eilenberg / Biological Control 43 (2007) 151tion of insect behavior may also aect the dispersal of entomopathogenic fungi in agroecosystems because fungalinoculum can be distributed by insect activity. Reducing the area of bare ground between the crop plants by mulching may reduce the population sizes ofpests by enhancing conditions for ground dwelling preda- tors ( Hellqvist, 1996; Schmidt et al., 2004 ). Mulching may be unfavorable for hypocrealean entomopathogenic fungi as increased amounts of organic matter in soil havebeen shown to increase antagonistic activity against the fungi ( Fargues and Robert, 1985; Studdert and Kaya, 1990). Establishment of beetle banks within the elds for CBC targeted at populations of carabid beetles ( Landis et al., 2000) could also promote populations of entomopatho- genic fungi. Specically, populations of certain genetic groups of B. bassiana orM. anisopliae , which have been documented to be absent from the cultivated soils in agro- ecosystems, could potentially benet from beetle banks. 4.4. Importance of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes Semi-natural habitats (e.g., hedgerows) are important refuges for flora and fauna that do not thrive within thecultivated arable elds ( Marshall and Moonen, al., ences in the communities of hypocrealean entomopatho- genic fungi in soils between arable elds and hedgerows have been documented ( Chandler et al., 1997; Meyling and Eilenberg, 2006b ). It is likely that the populations of fungi are depending on the arthropod community in thehedgerows for their survival. Regarding B. bassiana , hedge- rows constituted a tremendous reservoir of genetic diversitycompared to agricultural soil ( Table 1 ;Meyling, 2005 ). manent hedgerow habitats, preferably of some arevaluable refuges of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes,including B. bassiana that could be manipulated for CBC. Increasing evidence suggests that heterogeneity in the agricultural landscape is crucial for the maintenance ofthe diversity of species and ecological functional groupsof organisms that are relevant for pest management infuture sustainable agriculture ( Benton et al., 2003; Weibull and Ostman, 2003 ). Landscape structure is also important when predicting the recruitment potential of organisms for biological control by changes in agricultural practices(Tscharntke et al., 2005 ). Both empirical evidence as well as simulation studies suggest that diversity in the guild of natural enemies is important for ecient biological pestcontrol in agroecosystems ( Wilby and Thomas, 2002; Car- dinale al., 2003 ). Thus initiatives for enhancing popula- tion levels of predators and parasitoids in CBC maysimultaneously benet the communities of entomopatho-genic fungi knowledge of the eect of semi-natural habi- tats on indigenous populations of entomopathogenic fundamental for their inclusion in CBC strategies ( Shahand Pell, 2003 ). In the UK, studies have been carried out to include the entomophthoralean fungus P. neoaphidis in CBC of aphids. In this system, eld margins constitutedan important reservoir of fungus inoculum and predators acted as vectors of conidia among aphid populations(Roy et al., were particu- larly important reservoirs of P. neoaphidis because they harbored populations of nettle aphids that were susceptible to the fungus ( Roy et al., 2001; Ekesi et al., 2005 ). In gen- eral, eld margins also harbored predatorsand Davis, 1973 ) and dioica ) may be a key plant species for populations of predators, parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi. Whether man- agement strategies can facilitate the use of indigenous pop-ulations of B. bassiana in eld margins in CBC remains to be elucidated. 5. Conclusion Recent research has generated more knowledge of the natural occurrence, genetic diversity and dispersal mecha- nisms of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae intempe rate agroeco- systems. This knowledge is crucial to understand the ecology of entomopathogenic fungi and it is essential for the inclu-sion of the fungi in CBC. Molecular markers to assess geneticdiversity are important tools in future studies of indigenouspopulations of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae . Initiatives to manipulate populations of predators and parasitoids in agroecosystems for CBC are likely to of B. bassiana andM. anisopliae . However, there is a need for further understanding of the ecology of the entomo-pathogenic fungi in order to predict these eects.

Keyhani* Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611 Received 4 January 2005/Accepted 11 April 2005 The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana produces at least three distinct single-cell propagules, aerial conidia, vegetative cells termed blastospores, and submerged conidia, which can be isolated from agar plates, from rich broth liquid cultures, and under nutrient limitation conditions in submerged cultures,respectively. Fluorescently labeled fungal cells were used to quantify the kinetics of adhesion of these cell typesto surfaces having various hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties. Aerial conidia adhered poorly to weaklypolar surfaces and rapidly to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces but could be readily washed off thelatter surfaces. In contrast, blastospores bound poorly to hydrophobic surfaces, forming small aggregates,bound rapidly to hydrophilic surfaces, and required a longer incubation time to bind to weakly polar surfacesthan to hydrophilic surfaces. Submerged conidia displayed the broadest binding specicity, adhering tohydrophobic, weakly polar, and hydrophilic surfaces. The adhesion of the B. bassiana cell types also differed in sensitivity to glycosidase and protease treatments, pH, and addition of various carbohydrate competitors anddetergents. The outer cell wall layer of aerial conidia contained sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble, trifluoro-acetic acid-soluble proteins (presumably were not present on either blastospores orsubmerged conidia. The variations in the cell surface properties leading to the different adhesion qualities ofB. bassiana aerial conidia, blastospores, and submerged conidia could lead to rational design decisions for improving the efcacy and possibly the specicity of entomopathogenic fungi for host targets. Under intensive study for use as a biopesticide, the ento- mopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana displays a broad host range and is able to target a number of diverse arthropod species (7, 15, 16, 23, 26, 27, 31). Strains of B. bassiana have been selected for control of insects and other arthropods thatact as disease vectors, including mosquitoes and ticks (6, 22);crop pests, such as whiteflies, caterpillars, grasshoppers, andborers (5, 9, 21, 25, 36); and even ecologically hazardous,invading pests, such as re ants and termites (4, 8). The variedcuticles of these organisms represent the rst barrier to thepathogen, and attachment of fungal propagules to the cuticle isthe initial event in establishing mycosis. Air currents, disper-sion via water droplets, and saprophytic growth over substratainhabited by insects are considered the major routes for con-tact of fungal spores with host cuticles (2). Upon contact,fungal cells bind to the cuticle and initiate a developmentalprogram that includes the production of specialized infectionstructures, such as germ tubes and penetrant hyphae (2, 17). Ifthe infection is successful, the fungus grows across the cuticlesurface and penetrates the host cuticle to invade and prolifer-ate within the hemolymph, which ultimately results in thedeath of the host. Fungal cell attachment to the cuticle may involve specic receptor-ligand and/or nonspecic hydrophobic and electro-static (2, 3, A haploid fungus, B. bassiana, produces a including aerial conidia, blastospores, and submergedconidia, which can be isolated from agar plates, from rich brothsubmerged cultures, and from nutrient-limited submerged cul-tures, respectively. Although it is well known that culture con-ditions (and hence the cell type produced) can affect successfulvirulence for targeted hosts, little is known about the process ofadhesion of B. bassiana cell types other than conidia. In this report we describe a quantitative assay used to determine thebinding qualities and adhesion substratum preferences of B. bassiana aerial conidia, blastospores, and submerged conidia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cultivation of fungi. B. bassiana ATCC 90517 was routinely grown on potato dextrose agar. Plates were incubated at 26\u00b0C for 10 to 14 days, and aerial conidia were harvested by flooding a plate with sterile distilled H2O. Conidial suspen- sions were ltered through Miracloth, and nal spore concen- trations were determined by direct counting using a hemocytometer. Blasto-spores were produced in Sabouraud dextrose-1 to 2% yeast extract liquid brothcultures using conidia harvested from plates at a nal concentration of 0.5 /H1100310 5 to 5/H11003105conidia/ml as the inoculum. Cultures were grown for 3 to 4 days at 26\u00b0C with aeration. Cultures were ltered twice through glass wool to removemycelia, and the concentration of blastospores was determined by direct count-ing. Submerged conidia were produced in TKI broth using fructose as the carbonsource as described previously (32). For all cell types, Miracloth- or glass wool-ltered cell suspensions were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 /H11003g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C), washed two times with sterile distilled H 2O, and resuspended to the desired concentration as indicated below (typically 107to 108cells/ml). FITC labeling of B. (100 /H9262l of a 1-mg/ml stock solution per ml of fungal cells) was added to washed fungalcells (0.5 /H1100310 8to 1/H11003108cells/ml) resuspended in 50 mM calcium carbonate buffer, pH 9.2. Each reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min in the dark, afterwhich the cells were extensively washed (four or ve times with an equal volume)with TB (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The nal cell pellets were resuspended in TBto obtain the desired concentrations, as indicated below. The nal cell suspen-sion spore concentrations were checked by direct counting using a hemocyto-meter.* Corresponding author.

Florida Agricultural Experimental Station Journal Series number R-10687. 5260Attachment 8 Document 639Adhesion assay. Two assays were used to assess adhesion to substrata. In the rst (qualitative) assay, solutions of fungal cell suspensions (100 /H9262l, 1/H11003106to 20 /H11003106cells/ml) were placed in slide chambers (treated and untreated glass surfaces; Lab Tech chamber slide system; Nalgene Nunc, Naperville, IL) and incubated at 25\u00b0C and 100% humidity for various times. Adhesion was assessedmicroscopically after one wash or three washes. Digital images were taken usinga Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Adhesion wasalso assessed quantitatively using FITC-labeled cells incubated on various 20/H11003 in (black) microtiter plate wells and incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark for various times. Unbound cells were removed by aspiration of theliquid from the wells, followed by up to three washes with 450 /H9262l TB. Fluores- cence was measured using a Spectra Max Gemini XS microplate fluorometer(excitation wavelength, 495 nm; emission wavelength, 530 nm; cutoff wavelength,515 nm; Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnydale, CA). For each experiment astandard curve of fluorescence intensity versus cell number (as measured bydirect counting) was prepared. Typically, the fluorescence intensity was mea-sured before washing (total number of cells) and after each wash. Weakly polarmicrotiter plates (Fluorotrac F200) and hydrophilic microtiter plates (FluorotracF600) were Biotech (Longwood, FL) and were usedunmodied. Hydrophobic substrata were prepared by addition of a thin layer ofsilicone using Sigmacote (Sigma Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) to glass slides or toFluorotrac F200 microtiter plate wells. Typically, substrata were treated up tothree times with Sigmacote, and the treated plates or slides were placed in a fumehood overnight in order to ensure evaporation of all solvent. Enzyme treatments. Aerial conidia, blastospores, and submerged conidia (0.5 /H1100310 1.0/H11003107cells/ml) twice and resuspended in the enzyme reaction buffers suggested by the manufacturer. Portions (100 /H9262l) of 10-mg/ml stock solutions of amylase (catalog no. A6255; Sigma), cellulase (catalog no.C9422; Sigma), or laminarinase (catalog no. L5272; Sigma) in 0.01 M KPO 4(pH 6.8 for /H9251-amylase and pH 5.6 for cellulase and laminarinase) were added to 0.9 ml of cells resuspended in the same buffer. For protease treatments, 100 /H9262l and 50/H9262l of stock solutions (10 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml) of proteinase K (catalog no. p6911; Sigma) and pronase E (catalog no. 300140; Stratagene), respectively, in buffer (0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1 mM CaCl2) were added to cells resuspended in the same buffer. Glycosidase reaction mix-tures were incubated for4ha t25\u00b0C, and performed f o r4ha t37\u00b0C. After incubation, cells were extensively washed in 50 mM calciumbicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2) (seven or eight times, 1 ml each) by centrifugation(10,000 /H11003g, 5 min). Treated, washed cells were then FITC labeled and used in adhesion assays as described above. Effect of pH on attachment. FITC-labeled cells (0.5 /H1100310 7to 1.0 /H11003107 cells/ml) were washed twice and resuspended in one of the following physiolog-ical buffers (0.1 M) before they were used in adhesion assays: acetate (pH 4 and5), morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6 and 7), HEPES (pH 7 and 8),and TB (pH 8). Control wells with cells suspended in TB (pH 8) were used todetermine initial cell concentrations due to the pH sensitivity of FITC fluores-cence intensity measurement. Normalization due to pH effects on the FITCintensity was performed by allowing adhered cells (i.e., cells after the adhesionassay incubation and washing steps) to equilibrate in TB (pH 8) until the fluo-rescence intensity of the signal of the cells stopped increasing. Competition assays. Cells were FITC labeled, and the nal cell pellets result- ing from the washing steps of the labeling reaction were suspended in TBcontaining either 0.3 M carbohydrate (added as a competitor), 0.1% detergent(SDS, Tween 80, or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB]) or 1 M NaCl.Cells were then immediately used in adhesion assays. Contact angle determination. Contact angle (c/H11028a) measurements for the surfaces used to evaluate the adhesive properties of the fungal cell types wereobtained by using a Ramehart model 500 Advanced goniometer with an auto-mated drop dispenser and tilting plate, using the DropImage Advanced software.Dynamic angle measurements were obtained just prior to movement of the waterdrop. Briefly, a 10-/H9262l drop of sterile water was placed onto the surface of thesubstratum to be tested. The stage and the camera were tilted at 10\u00b0 incrementsuntil the drop was on the verge of movement. The advanced (dynamic) contactangle was then determined. Rodlet layer extraction. The rodlet layer proteins were removed from the surface of the spores as described by Paris et al. (29). Briefly, aerial conidia,blastospores, and submerged conidia were prepared as described above, resus-pended in water, and sonicated at 140 W (3-mm-diameter microtip, 50% dutycycle) twice for min cell disrupter B-30 (Branson Ultrasons,Rungis, France). Unlysed cells debris were removed by low-speed cen-trifugation (10,000 /H11003g, 10 min), and the for1ha t 50,000 /H11003g. The resultant pellet boiled gel (2% SDS, 5% /H9252-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol in 62 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and washed twice with sample buffer and three times with distilled water. The nal pellet was lyophilized and then treatedwith 100% trifluoroacetic acid for 10 min at room temperature. The acid wasremoved under a stream of nitrogen, and dried extracts were stored at roomtemperature under dry air and resuspended in water prior to analysis. Aliquotsof a protein sample were mixed with 4/H11003 lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) plus dithiothreitol and run on a 10% bis-Tris Nu-PAGE gel with MES-SDS gel running buffer together with standards. Proteinbands were visualized using either Sypro Ruby red (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) orCoomassie blue. RESULTS A quantitative assay was developed in order to measure the kinetics of fungal cell adhesion to various substrata. treated with the fluorescent reagent FITC ap-peared to be uniformly labeled, with clear halo rings deningthe cell envelope. Labeling of all three cell types, aerialconidia, blastospores, and submerged conidia, revealed a linearrelationship between cell number (as measured by cell count-ing using a hemocytometer) and fluorescence intensity. Littlevariation was observed within experiments; however, somevariation (up to a twofold difference in fluorescence intensity)was observed between experiments (i.e., between separateFITC labeling reactions). Therefore, a standard curve of fluo-rescence intensity versus cell number as determined by cellcounting was determined and used for each experiment. In order to determine the effects of the labeling reaction on the adhesive qualities of the cells, a series of preliminary qual-itative experiments were performed using untreated and sili-conized glass slides with both unlabeled and labeled cells. In allinstances no difference was observed between using FITC-labeled cells and using unlabeled cells. These data demon-strated (i) that aerial conidia were able to bind to hydrophobicsurfaces but not to hydrophilic surfaces; (ii) that blastosporesbound uniformly to hydrophilic surfaces but bound poorly tohydrophobic surfaces, forming small clumps on the latter; and(iii) that submerged conidia bound equally well to both hydro-philic and hydrophobic surfaces, forming large clumps thatappeared to become more evenly distributed over time. Thesepatterns were identical for FITC-labeled and unlabeled cells. For the quantitative assays, the following three types of black polystyrene-based microtiter plates with different surfacecharacteristics were used as substrata: (i) siliconized Fluoro-trac F200 plates, which were highly hydrophobic; (ii) F200untreated polystyrene surface plates, which were weakly polar;and (iii) F600 plates, which were treated polystyrene and hadhydrophilic, polar surfaces containing hydroxyl, carbonyl, andamino groups with a small net negative charge. Dynamic ad-vanced water droplet contact angle measurements for thethree substrata were consistent with the decreasing hydropho-bicities; the silinated F200 plates displayed a c /H11028a of 104.7\u00b0, the untreated F200 plates displayed a c/H11028a of 95.6\u00b0, and the F600plates displayed a c/H11028a of 85.6\u00b0 (the contact angles for cleanedpolished glass, the glass chamber slides, and silinated glasswere determined to be 73.1\u00b0, 87.4\u00b0, and 109.7\u00b0, respectively). The number of binding sites per microtiter plate well was estimated to be 4 /H1100310 5to 8/H11003105, as determined by the saturation point derived from plots of the percentage of cellsbound as a function of the cell concentration (Fig. 1). Thesedata indicated that the linear ranges of the cell types wereVOL. 71, 2005 ADHESION OF B. BASSIANA TO SUBSTRATA 5261similar, although the saturation points for the cell types varied from approximately 25% of the aerial conidial cells able tobind per well to more than 70% of the submerged conidiabound in wells when /H110115/H1100310 5cells/well was used. All subse- quent experiments were performed using cell concentrations inthe linear range of the attachment curve (2 /H1100310 cells/well). Quantitative submerged conidia on hydrophobic, weakly polar,and hydrophilic surfaces with either one or three washes wereperformed (Fig. 2). Aerial conidia bound rapidly and tightly tohydrophobic surfaces, and there was no decrease in cell bind-ing after up to 10 washes with buffer (data not shown). Aerialconidia bound poorly to weakly polar surfaces even after pro-longed exposure (24 h) to the substrata. Interestingly, thesecells bound weakly to hydrophilic surfaces and were readilywashed off. In contrast, blastospores bound poorly to hydro-phobic surfaces, and no more than 10% of the cells were bound even after 24 h. Blastospores bound moderately to weakly polar surfaces, and approximately 1 /H1100310 5to 2/H11003105cells bound/well (30% of the 5 /H11003105cells the assay) after 4 h of incubation. Blastospores bound more readily to hydro- philic surfaces, and up to 50% of the cells bound within 30 min.Submerged conidia displayed the broadest binding character-istics, adhering to all three surfaces, although with slightlydifferent kinetics. On hydrophobic, weakly polar, and hydro-philic surfaces, up to 60% of the cells used bound to thesubstrata within 4 h, although in the case of the hydrophobicand weakly polar surfaces, almost one-half of the bound cellscould be removed using three washes. Attachment of aerial conidia to hydrophobic surfaces could not be competed with any of the carbohydrate compoundstested, including glucose, galactose, lactose, maltose, melibi-ose, or trehalose, and was not sensitive to salt concentrations ashigh as 1 M NaCl (Table 1). The presence of N-acetylglu- cosamine appeared to promote adhesion (conrmed by micro-scopic analysis). The effect was not due to any visible growth ormucilage production; i.e., no germination, germ tube, or secre-tion of an extracellular matrix could be seen. Conidial attach-ment was, however, sensitive to the presence of detergents, and80 to 90% inhibition was observed when 0.1% Tween 80 detergent), CTAB (a cationic detergent), or SDS also inhibited conidial attachment to hydrophobic sur- faces, although a large degree of variation was observed. Ad-hesion of aerial conidia to surfaces was only slightly affected bypH, and 30% fewer cells were bound at pH 4.0 than at pH 7.0. A unique feature of blastospore attachment was that adhe- sion could be competed with maltose (Table 1). No other sugartested had any effect on blastospore adhesion, nor did maltoseaffect conidial or submerged conidial adhesion. Blastosporeattachment was not sensitive to salt (1 M NaCl), SDS, andCTAB, but it was inhibited by Tween 20 and Triton X-100. Incontrast to the adhesion of the other cell types, the adhesion ofblastospores appeared to be pH dependent, and there was a50% decrease in the number of cells bound when assays wereperformed at pH 4 to 5 compared with the number of cellsbound when assays were performed at pH 7 to 8. Submergedconidia behaved like aerial conidia, except that N-acetylglu- cosamine did not increase the number of cells bound and thepresence of the detergents CTAB and Triton X-100 (Table 1)and changes in pH had only minor effects on microcycle conid-ial adhesion. Removal of carbohydrates (maltose, glucose, or glucuronic acid) from the cell surface of aerial conidia using either /H9251-amy- lase or laminarinase, but not removal carbohydrates usingcellulase, resulted in decreased conidial adhesion to hydropho-bic surfaces but had no effect on conidial adhesion to hydro-philic surfaces (Table 2). Treatment of blastospores with gly-cosidases appeared to either slightly promote adhesion ( /H9251- amylase and to a lesser extent cellulase tohydrophilic surfaces or to not affect adhesion (laminarinaseand/or hydrophobic surface). Glycosidase treatment of sub-merged conidia resulted in a 25 to 50% decrease in adhesion ofcells to hydrophilic surfaces and hydrophobic surfaces exceptfor/H9251-amylase-treated cells, for which great variation was ob- served for adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces. Some differentialeffects were observed after protease treatment of the cell types.Aerial conidia treated with pronase E exhibited a more than50% loss of adhesion to hydrophobic surfaces but no loss ofadhesion to hydrophilic surfaces, although great variation wasobserved. This variation was between experiments (i.e., differ-ent cell batches treated with the enzyme) and may have re-flected surface heterogeneity or accessibility of target sub-strates to the enzyme. Protease K treatment of aerial conidiadid not result in appreciable changes in adhesion. Similar treat-ment of blastospores with proteases had no effect or resulted inan almost twofold apparent increase in adhesion. Microscopicanalysis (i.e., visual counting) of the number of cells boundindicated that there did not appear to be an actual increase inthe number of cells bound; instead, protease treatment ap-peared to increase the intensity of the fluorescence signal.These conditions were the only conditions tested in which thefluorescent signal was affected, and in all other experiments theresults of microscopic analysis were in agreement with thefluorescent intensity measurements. Finally, little or no effect FIG. 1. Saturation points of sites for binding of B. bassiana aerial conidia (F), blastospores (), and submerged conidia (E) to microtiter plates.

Hydrophobic interactions are thought to be mediated (at least in part) by low-molecular-weight proteins termed hydro-phobins that form a rodlet layer on the surface of fungal cells.Hydrophobins are highly resistant to extraction by detergentsbut can be solubilized by (100%) trifluoroacetic acid. B. bassi- ana aerial conidia, blastospores, and submerged conidia were examined for the presence of hydrophobins by using cell ex-tracts prepared as described in Materials and Methods andwere analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) (gels stained with SyproRuby red gave essentially the same results). Protein bandscorresponding to putative hydrophobins were extracted onlyfrom aerial conidia, and no bands were formed by extractsderived from either blastospores or submerged conidia. DISCUSSION Conidial adhesion has been examined in a number of plant- and insect-pathogenic fungi (2, 28). Adhesion of entomopatho-genic fungi has been considered to involve an initial bindinginteraction followed by a consolidation step, resulting in rmattachment to the cuticle (2, 13, 14). Similarly, studies on thephytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea revealed a two-stage FIG. 2. Quantitative adhesion and influence of washing on adhesion of aerial conidia (A), blastospores (B), and submerged conidia to (hydrophobic), F200 (weakly polar), and F600 (hydrophilic) microtiter plates. The percentages of cells bound after one wash (open bars) and after three washes (solid bars) are presented versus assay incubation time. The error bars indicate the results of at least three independentexperiments.V OL. 71, 2005 ADHESION OF B. BASSIANA process; immediate adhesion occurred upon hydra- tion and was characterized by relatively weak attachment, andstronger delayed adhesion was observed as the conidia germi-nated (10, 11). Immediate adhesion of B. cinerea was passive (nonmetabolic), and although no specic structures were visi-ble on the conidia, adhesion was characterized as dependent(in part) on hydrophobic interactions. Hydrophobic interac-tions have also been implicated in insect-pathogenic fungi Nomuraea rileyi, host and nonhost cuticle preparations (3). B. bassiana produces at least three single-cell types that can be distinguished based on morphological and adhesive charac-teristics. Qualitative studies assessing entomopathogenic fun-gal adhesion to various surfaces, including insect cuticles (2, 3,10, 11, 17), have almost exclusively addressed conidial bindingto surfaces and have not examined the adhesion properties ofeither blastospores or submerged conidia. We used a quanti-tative adhesion assay, and our results demonstrate that thereare complex interactions between various cell types and sub-strata with different surface properties. All three B. bassiana single-cell types studied, aerial conidia, blastospores, and sub-merged conidia, displayed different adhesion properties thatappeared to be mediated by different cell-specic mechanisms. B. bassiana aerial conidia were able to bind to both hydro- phobic and hydrophilic surfaces, although adhesion to the lat-ter was weak and the cells could readily be washed off. Aerialconidia binding to hydrophobic surfaces could not be com-peted off with any carbohydrate tested, although addition ofN-acetylglucosamine, the monomeric constituent of chitin, themajor carbohydrate (polymer) found in arthropod cuticles,appeared to increase adhesion. The hydrophobic nature of B. bassiana conidial spores, as well as conidial spores from other entomopathogens, such as N. rileyi, M. anisopliae, and Paecilo- myces fumsoroseus, has been correlated with the presence of anouter cell layer comprised of rodlets or fascicles, as visualized FIG. 3.

The rodlet layers are presumably formed by assembly of specic proteins termed hydrophobins,which in turn are thought to passively mediate adhesion tohydrophobic surfaces (34, 35). Consistent with this model, ex-traction of the B. bassiana cell types revealed the presence of putative hydrophobins (a rodlet layer) in aerial conidia thatwere absent from both blastospores and submerged conidia.Although hydrophobins may account for some of the observedadhesion qualities, our data also indicate that the interaction ofaerial conidia with hydrophobic surfaces may be more com-plex. Since amylase and laminarinase treatments, as well asprotease treatments, reduced adhesion (but had no discernibleeffects on the rodlet layer [B. H. Kirkland, D. andN. O. Keyhani, unpublished results]), both carbohydrates onthe cell surface and proteins may be involved in mediatingadhesion of aerial conidia. Some caution, however, should betaken in any interpretation of enzymatic treatments of cellssince amylase, laminarase, and cellulase are enzyme mixtureswhich contain various additional enzymes, often including pro-teases. In contrast, blastospores, which are cells that lack any visible rodlet layer (2, 3) and from which no (putative) hydrophobinswere extracted under the conditions tested, bound poorly tohydrophobic surfaces, forming small aggregates or clumps, butthey displayed high levels of binding to hydrophilic substrata.Blastospores were also able to bind to weakly polar substrata,although the incubation time required was greater than thatrequired for hydrophilic substrata. blastospore at-tachment could be specically competed with carbohydrate tested appeared to compete with adhesionof blastospores or the other fungal cell types; this includedtrehalose, the major carbohydrate constituent found in insecthemolymph. In vivo-generated blastospores (distinct but sim-ilar to the proliferation in the insect hemolymph after penetrationof the cuticle, are able to evade recognition by insect hemo-cytes and display altered membrane characteristics (19, 20, 30);however, the physiological signicance of potential maltoseinhibition of adhesion of these cells is unclear. Submerged conidia displayed the broadest binding charac- teristics of the B. bassiana single-cell types (they also appeared not to contain a rodlet layer or hydrophobins), and they wereable to bind to hydrophobic, weakly polar, and hydrophilicsurfaces. Spore tips or mucilage-covered appendages and ad-hesive knobs have been implicated as structures that mediateconidial adhesion of several fungi (1, 18, 33). The mucosal coatof nematophagous fungi not only appears to mediate adhesionbut also is attractive to host insects, and a wide variety ofarthropod mycopathogens appear to produce exocellular mu-cilage during germ tube or appressorial formation (2). Simi-larly, the hydrophilic nature of conidia of the Entomophtho-rales is thought to be mediated by a mucilaginous coat releasedupon attachment to cuticle surfaces, which acts as a glue me-diating attachment (12, 24). Although blastospores and sub-merged conidia attached to hydrophilic surfaces, no obviousmucilaginous coat was visible in either cell type, and scanningelectron microscopy did not reveal any specic structures ineither conidia, blastospores, or submerged conidia of B. bassi- ana that appeared to be involved in mediating adhesion (un- published data). It is possible, however, that extracellular ma-trix components or mucilage located between the inner andouter walls that may not be readily detectable could be in-volved in mediating adhesion. Although aerial conidia are considered easily dispersible via air currents and due to their spore-like cell walls are moreresistant to adverse environmental conditions, such as desicca-tion and extreme temperatures, microcycle conidiation andblastospore formation may occur under a variety of environ-mental conditions, as well as during the host-pathogen inter-action. The production of multiple cell types with differentadhesive properties may occur in response to specic environ-mental conditions, allowing fungal cells to bind to a broadrange of host targets and providing the fungus a way to adaptto substratum conditions (13, 14). It is unlikely, however, thatalteration of adhesion can account for the emergence of therestricted-host-range B. bassiana strains since these strains may have altered (cuticle-degrading) enzyme production or be un-able to penetrate and/or respond to surface cues of certainhosts but still retain the means to initiate binding or adhesioninteractions. Indeed, there is some evidence that when ento-mopathogens specialize, they lose structures rather than gainthem, although it would be interesting to see whether anyalteration in the adhesion kinetics of general and specializedstrains of B. bassiana occurs. Our data do indicate that certain practical considerations should be taken into account duringapplication of B. bassiana. For instance, if blastospores are to be used, formulations should probably contain aqueous ornonpolar liquids that may prove to be more successful in bio-control of certain hosts compared to aerial conidia. In contrast, the use of detergents in order to avoid aggregation of aerial conidia may prove to be detrimental during application sincethe presence of such detergents can decrease adhesion to sur-faces. Future research correlating the virulence of the fungalcell types to specic insect targets may lead to rational designdecisions for the selection of fungal strains with greater spec-icity for desired targets.

Worldwide, several registration guidelines are available, however, most of them focus on similar or even the same safety issues. With respect to the two entomopathogenic many commercial products have been developed, and numerous papers on different biological, environmental, toxicological and other safety aspects have been published during the past 30 /C140 years. The aim of the present review is to summarise these data. The following safety issues are presented: (1) identity of Beauveria spp.; (2) biological properties of Beauveria spp. (history, natural occurrence and geographical distribution, host range, mode of action, production of metabolites/toxins, effect of environmental factors); (3) analyticalmethods to determine and quantify residues; (4) fate and behaviour in the environment (mobility and persistence in air, water and soil); (5) effects on non-target organisms (non-target microorganisms, plants, soil organisms, aquatic organisms, predators, parasitoids, honey bees, earth worms and nontarget arthropods); (6) effects on vertebrates (fish, amphibia, reptiles and birds); and (7) effects on mammals and human health. Based on the present knowledge it is concluded that both Beauveria species are considered to be safe. Keywords: Beauveria bassiana, Beauveria brongniartii , occurrence, host range, The two were described for the first time about 170 and 110 years ago, respectively. Since that time they have always been Correspondence: Gisbert Zimmermann, Federal Biological Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry, Institute for Biological Control, Heinrichstrasse 2007 ISSN 1360-0478 online #2007 21 September 2010considered as fungi that can and should be used for control of pest insects. In the early days of biological control and especially microbial control, there was no concern for possible side-effects or safety considerations of these two species. Steinhaus (1957) was possibly the first who raised questions on the safety of microbial control products to man, other vertebrates and even to crops. He very carefully discussed different aspects of the scientific knowledge at that time. Although he concluded thatmicroorganisms pathogenic to insects are in general harmless to man, animals and plants, he recommended that such products are subjected to appropriate State and Federal regulations. A few years later, Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1965) published a book (unfortunately in German) on fungal diseases of insects, practical use for biological control and basics of insect mycology, in which some sections on side-effects ofentomopathogenic fungi on humans and other warm-blooded animals as well as on beneficial insects were already included. In 1971, Heimpel summarised the knowledge on safety of insect pathogens, i.e. bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi and rickettsiae forman and vertebrates. He also emphasised the necessity for testing the safety of insectpathogens and said 'it seems incredible that so many good scientists have worked so long with insect pathogens without testing them for safety ...'. He also mentioned registration guidelines of the USA and other countries at that time. A similar review was published two years later by Ignoffo (1973). With the increasing interest in biological control of pest insects between 1980 and 1990, safety aspects were discussed in more detail (e.g. Austwick 1980; Burges 1981;Hall et al. 1982; Laird et al. 1990). Burges (1981) outlined the main principles andguidelines for testing the safety of insect pathogens and stated 'I believe that a pathogen should be registered as safe when there is reasonable evidence that it is so and in the absence of concrete evidence that it is not. A ''no risk'' situation does notexist, certainly not with chemical pesticides, and even with biological agents onecannot absolutely prove a negative'. First guidelines for the registration of entomo- pathogenic fungi under the auspices of the IOBC as an advisory document were published by Hall et al. (1982). The first book, dedicated alone to the safety ofmicrobial insecticides was published by Laird et al. (1990), including sections onsafety to domestic animals and wildlife (Saik et al. 1990) and to vertebrates andhumans (Siegel & Shadduck 1990). In 1996, Cook and coauthors published an interesting framework for scientific safety evaluation of microorganisms intended for pest and plant disease control. The intention was to identify and discuss safety issueslinked to microbial control agents which should stimulate and improve discussions onpossible risks and risk management. Later reviews on safety of entomopathogenicfungi and especially also on Beauveria spp. were published by Goettel and Jaronski (1997), Goettel et al. (2001), Vestergaard et al. (2003) and Copping (2004). A goodsummary of various safety issues of B. bassiana strain GHA (128924) and strain ATCC found at www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_128924.htm and 128818.htm. Within the EU, safety regulations are documented in the Directive 91/414/EEC. A national registration of a microbial product is only possible after extensive testing (and inclusion of the microorganism in Annex I of the guideline). Annexes IIB and IIIB to Directive 91/414/EEC set out the requirements for the dossier to be submitted by anapplicant, respectively, for the inclusion of an active substance consisting of micro- organisms or viruses in Annex I to that Directive and for the authorisation of a plant protection product based on preparations of micro-organisms or viruses. A guidance554 G. 2010for registration requirements of microbial pesticides is also published by the OECD (Anon. 2003). The aim of the present review is to summarise and discuss our present knowledge on the safety, possible side-effects and the environmental behaviour of both Beauveria species, B. bassiana and B. brongniartii , as basis for further discussions within the registration process and the intended use of these fungi as mycoinsecticides. Identity of Beauveria spp. In 1954, MacLeod published the first, careful review of literature on the genera Beauveria and Tritirachium , including a taxonomic revision of both genera. The studies comprise cultural and morphological characteristics of numerous Beauveria isolates and species. Fourteen of formerly described species of Beauveria were described as synonyms were as of B. densa ,B. melolonthae strains of B. tenella Later, De Hoog (1972) restricted the genus Beauveria Vuill. to three species: B. bassiana ,B. brongniartii and B. alba . A comprehensive description of the species is presented, including a key to species, morphological characteristics, a huge list of former synonyms and some representative figures. The main synonymous names of B. bassiana andB. brongniartii are presented in Table I. Further descriptions of Beauveria spp. are presented by Domsch et al. (1980) and Humber (1997). Recently, the taxonomy and phylogenetics of the genus Beauveria was discussed in detail (Rehner 2005; Rehner & Buckley 2005). Beauveria bassiana is characterised by white, later yellowish or occasionally reddish colonies. The reverse is uncoloured, or yellowish to pinkish. Conidiogenous cells consist of globose and an up to 20- mm long rachis, mostly forming a zig-zag. Conidia are globose to broadly ellipsoidal, generally 2 /C13/C292/C12.5mm. The conidia are formed in clusters, like snow balls or cotton balls. Beauveria brongniartii is characterised by first white, later yellowish to pinkish or reddish colonies. The reverse is uncoloured, yellowish or pinkish. The conidiogenous cells also consist of a subglobose or flask-shaped basal part with a long rachis. In to Conidia are clustered, but also arranged in small groups or are solitary. Recent investigations have demonstrated that there is a direct link between the genus Beauveria and the teleomorph genus Cordyceps (Ascomycota: et al. 2002; Rehner 2005; Rehner & Buckley 2005). However, all Beauveria teleomorphs have been described so far from Asia. Biological properties of Beauveria spp. History The most comprehensive study on the genera Beauveria andTritirachium , the history of the genus Beauveria and of its species and the cultural and morphological characteristics are presented in detail by Steinhaus (1949), MacLeod (1954) and, later, by De Hoog (1972). The early history of B. bassiana started in 1835. It was Agostino Bassi di Lodi from Italy, who was the first to show that a fungus can cause adisease in insects, thus enunciating the germ theory of disease. He observed a diseasein silkworms, Bombyx mori , which he called 'white muscardine' and started the first infection experiments. The fungus was then studied and described by the famous Italian naturalist Giuseppe Gabriel Balsamo-Crivelli in 1835, who gave it Rehner 2005). In Beauverie studied the fungus again and in 1912 Vuillemin created the new genus Beauveria in honor of Beauverie, of which the species B. bassiana became the type. Beauveria brongniartii has been described under different names by several investigators at the end of the 19th century (MacLeod 1954). An extensive study ofthis fungus with respect to its use against Melolontha melolontha was already published more than 100 years ago by Giard (1892). Since the first descriptions of the genus Beauveria , both B. bassiana and B. brongniartii were used in biocontrol against pest insects. In a section on 'Fungous Infections', Steinhaus (1949) summarised the infection process, the development of the disease and the practical use of B. bassiana against some pest insects, mainly the European corn borer, Ostrinia (Pyrausta )nubilalis , and the codling moth, mentioned practical use of Beauveria globulifera , which later was included in against the chinch bug, the book of Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1965), 28 species and families of pest insects in agriculture, orchards, forestry, greenhouse and in the tropics were mentioned against which B. bassiana had been used for control purposes. The fungus B. brongniartii (/C30B. tenella ) however, and Epilachna vigintioctomaculata . A review on pest control of the fungi Beauveria andMetarhizium including basic as well as practical aspects was published later by Ferron (1981). Atthat time, the B. bassiana product 'Boverin' was extensively used in the against Colorado potato beetle, , the codling moth Cydia brongniartii was applied against M. melolontha . In China, B. bassiana was produced and widely used against O. nubilalis in corn, Dendrolimus punctatus on pines and Nephotettix leafhoppers on rice and tea (Hussey & Tinsley 1981). The present state of Beauveria products registered or under commercial develop- ment is summarised in Table II (Butt et and geographical distribution Beauveria bassiana is the most widely distributed species of the genus. It is generally found on infected insects both in temperate and tropical areas throughout the world. MacLeod (1954) mentioned that B. bassiana was isolated from 63 different insect species collected in various localities throughout Canada. He also reported thatBeauveria strains were found within the lung tissues of 14 rodents. However, histological examination did not show that the fungus creates a pathological conditionwithin the tissues. The occurrence and distribution of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii in various countries and areas are listed by Domsch et al. (1980). Reports of the occurrence of B. bassiana are from Turkey, the Ivory Coast, equatorial West Africa, central Africa, South Africa, the Bahamas, Nepal, east Siberia, New Zealand and Japan. Habitats forB. bassiana range from an alpine soil, to heathland, peat bogs, soils with savannah type vegetation, forest and cultivated soils, sand blows and dunes, desert soil and running Table II. Mycopesticides of Beauveria bassiana and B. brongniartii registered or under commercial development (Butt et al. 2001; from the rhizoplane of peat bog plants, the rhizosphere of clover, dead bark, nests, feathers and droppings of free-living birds were mentioned. Beauveria brongniartii is less common than B. bassiana , but also has a worldwide distribution in insects as well as in different habitats. It has been reported from open bogs, alpine habitats, forest soil in Hong Kong, terra rossa in Greece, a Calluna heath, an alpine grassland in Italy and sand dunes in the British Isles (see Domsch et al. 1980). Beauveria bassiana has also been isolated from the surface and the interior of plants. Using selective media, B. bassiana was isolated from bark of elm trees and from soil at the base of elm trees (Doberski & Tribe 1980) and from the bark of Carpinus caroliniana (ironwood, hop hornbeam) (Bills & Polishook 1991). Recently, the species was also found naturally occurring on phylloplanes of various hedgerow plants (Meyling & Eilenberg 2006). Further information on the natural occurrence of B. bassiana in general and as an endophyte in various plant species are reported in Host range andEffects on Plants , respectively. The description of the so-called 'Galleria-bait-bait' (Zimmermann 1986) and various selective media for isolation of Beauveria spp. from soil (see Analytical methods to determine and quantify residues ) have lead to a huge increase in the findings of B. bassiana throughout the world (Table III). Although Beauveria spp. are no common airborne fungi, B.bassiana has been isolated from the air. In a study on fungal biodiversity in the air of Turin, Italy, the species was found at a mean of 0.2 CFU m/C283during 10 months per year, while B. brongniartii was found at only B0.1 CFU m/C283during one month (Airaudi & Filipello-Marchisio 1996). The natural density of B. bassiana in the air of a forest in Japan ranged from 0 to 3.1 /C29103CFU m/C282day/C281(Shimazu et al. 2002). In the air of a hospital, the fungus was isolated together with 98 other fungal species (Rainer et al. 2000). Nolard (2004) mentioned B. bassiana in the air of humid dwellings of allergic patients. For natural occurrence in vertebrates including mammals and humans (see Effects on vertebrates (fish, amphibia, reptiles and birds ) and Effects on mammals and human health ). Recently, both Beauveria spp. were found in surface water-derived drinking water in Norway, but not in groundwater derived water (Hageskal et al. 2006). Host range Beauveria bassiana is a ubiquitous entomopathogenic fungus which has been found and isolated from a wide variety of insects from different orders (MacLeod 1954; Leatherdale 1970; Li mentioned about60 insect species from which Beauveria strains have been isolated. The hosts of 106 species of entomopathogenic fungi known from Britain are catalogued by Leatherdale (1970). Listed hosts 21 September 2010Based on worldwide data, Li (1988) listed 707 species of insect hosts of B. bassiana . These comprise 521 genera and 149 families of 15 orders. In addition, 13 host species of Acarina distributed in seven genera and six families are listed. The insect orders in which B. bassiana has been found as a pathogen are as follows:Table III.

(2003) USA Soil from 105 sites in 21 orchards: From 16 orchards mainly B. bassiana andM. Dermaptera, (14) Blattariae, (15) Embioptera. The host range and specificity of B. bassiana is listed by Goettel et hundred B. bassiana isolates from numerous host insects are listed in the USDA ARS Entomopathogenic Funguscollection. However, despite the prevalence of B. bassiana in a huge number of arthropods, it is known that most isolates of this fungus have a restricted host range (Goettel et al. 1990; Vestergaard et al. 2003), and there are several examples that B. bassiana isolates from a distinct host insect or from the soil are highly virulent against other target pests (Feng & Johnson 1990; Ekesi et al. 1998; Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan 2003). Therefore, itis necessary to screen the virulence of different isolates against a target insect species in order to select the most virulent one. In Europe, B. brongniartii mainly attacks the field and the forest cockchafer, Melolontha melolontha and M. hippocastani . However, the fungus may also occur on other insects. According to Leatherdale (1970), the listed hosts Vestergaard et al. (2003) summarised the reports on the occurrence of B. brongniartii and non- coleopteran hosts have a large genetic distance to those from Melolontha spp. (Enkerli et al. 2001). Mode of action There is a huge number of publications dealing with the mode of action and the infection process. The first publications dealing with the infection of certain pest insects by B. bassiana , such as the silkworm, were compiled by Steinhaus (1949) and Mu\u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1965). Therefore, in this section only the general aspects of the infection process are summarised (see e.g. Boucias & Pendland 1998 for more specific information). A comprehensive overview on the biochemical aspects of disease development, its physico-chemical aspects and the genetics and molecular biologyof disease development is presented by Khachatourians (1998). As in other entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria species attack their host insects generally percutaneously. The infection pathway consists of the following steps: (1) attachment of the spore to the cuticle; (2) germination; (3) penetration through thecuticle; (4) overcoming the host response and immune defense reactions; (5) proliferation within the host by formation of hyphal bodies/blastospores, i.e. yeast like cells; (6) saprophytic outgrowth from the dead host and production of new conidia. Attachment is due to the hydrophobicity of the conidia as well as the cuticular surfaces. In B. bassiana , conidia contain a hydrophobin-type protein on their exterior surfaces. Germination and successful infection depends on a number of G. 15:01 21 September 2010susceptible host and host stage and certain environmental factors, such as optimal temperature and humidity. Germination is further influenced by certain cuticularlipids, such as short-chain fatty acids, aldehydes, wax esters, ketones alcohols which may possess antimicrobial activity. However, the cuticle may also be coated with substances that are important for fungal recognition, like free amino acids or peptides, and may trigger attachment and germination. Generally, germination of B. bassiana conidia starts after about 10 h and is largely completed by 20 h at 20 /C1258C. Generally the fungus penetrates thinner, non-sclerotised areas of the cuticle, like joints, between segments or the mouthparts. Before penetration, germ tubes may produce so-called appressoria and infection pegs. The penetration process is by mechnical means and by the production of several enzymes, including proteases, chitinases and lipases. The penetration of the cuticle layers and the beginning of invasion is accompanied by several host response activities, e.g. by production of phenoloxidase and certainhemocytes and melanisation. The interactions between the penetrating fungus and the insect immune system are a complex process and comprise many molecular and cellular reactions (Vilcinskas & Go \u00a8tz 1999). During the infection process, Beauveria spp. produce proteolytic enzymes and toxins, while the host insects respond with cellular and humoral defence reactions. These reactions consist of the production of antifungal compounds, inducible protease inhibitors and proteins, which detoxifyfungal toxins in the insect. After successful penetration, the fungus produces hyphal bodies, i.e. yeast like cells, which are distributed passively in the hemolymph, enabling the fungus to invade other tissues of the host insect by extensive vegetative growth and the production of toxins. For example, during this stage, the metabolite oosporein is produced by B. brongniartii , which is visible by turning its host cadaver red. During its invasion of the insect body, the fungus depletes nutrients in the hemolymph and the fat body. This process is followed by the death of the insect and the end of the pathogenesis(Boucias & Pendland 1998). The incubation period depends on the host, the host stage, temperature and virulence of the fungus strain. In aphids, it may take 3 /C14 days, while in scarab larvae, 2/C14 weeks. After the host death and under humid conditions, the fungus starts its saprophytic phase by emerging out of the host body and producing conidia on the exterior surface of the cadaver. Under very dry conditions, the fungus may also persist in the hyphal stage inside the cadaver or, e.g. in locusts in Africa, produce its conidia inside the body. During the incubation period, the fungus may affect its host insect throughout behavioural and feeding changes, the reduction of body weight or fecundity, malformations et al. 2003). Production of metabolites/toxins Microorganisms, and especially fungi, produce a wide variety of compounds or metabolites, mostly within their secondary metabolism, which generally have diverse activities and functions. Therefore, it is not surprising that entomopathogenic fungiare also able to produce different metabolites. With respect to registration and riskassessment, these metabolites and their special activities are of In the following chapter, the most important metabolites of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii are presented and their occurrence and general activities are outlined. One of the first comprehensive overviews on the toxins of entomopathogenic fungi is presented by Roberts (1981). The author summarises the knowledge of toxic metabolites genus Entomophthora sensu lato. He presented four principle objectives of studies on fungal metabolites toxic to insects, which are stillimportant: (1) to elucidate the mode of action; (2) to search for new chemicals for usein pest control; (3) to evaluate the safety of specific fungi proposed for use in pestcontrol; and (4) to conduct basic chemistry studies on natural products. Today, we should add the search for new drugs and pharmaceuticals in human medicine. These objectives demonstrate that fungal metabolites generally cannot only be considered as safety issues. A recent review on toxic metabolites of entomopathogenic fungi including those used for other biocontrol purposes was given by Vey et al. (2001). Both Beauveria spp. produce several toxic compounds in vitro and in vivo (e.g. Mazet et al. 1994; Strasser et al. 2000; Vey et al. 2001). These are presented in Table IV. A majority of these insecticidal molecules are low molecular weight secondarymetabolites, mainly cyclic peptides such as beauvericin and bassianolide, and the pigments bassianin and & Vey 2004).One toxic macromolecule was identified as a hydrophilic, chitosanase-like protein (Fuguet et al. 2004). Additionally, the secondary metabolite cyclosporin A is produced by B. bassiana , which was originally found in T olypocladium inflatum (Boucias & Pendland 1998). The main metabolite produced by B. brongniartii is oosporein. Beauvericin is the most important compound which was reported first from B. bassiana. Beauvericin is a toxic cyclic hexadepsipeptide and comprises a cyclic repeating sequence of three molecules of N-methyl phenylalanine alternating with three molecules of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Not all isolates of B. bassiana produce beauvericin in vitro (for corresponding literature see Roberts, 1981). A review on the activity of beauvericin and two other metabolites, bassianolide and beauveriolide, is given by Strasser et al. (2000) and Vey et al. (2001). Beauvericin has also been isolated from other fungi, such as Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (see Roberts 1981), Paecilomyces tenuipes (Nilanonta et al. 2000) and, especially from members of the genus Fusarium Table IV. Major metabolites produced by (2001) Oxalic acid Roberts (1981) Bassiacridin Quesada-Moraga and Vey (2004) B. brongniartii Oosporein Strasser et al. (2000); Vey et al. (2001) Oxalic acid Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1965); Roberts (1981) B. 1991; Bottalico et al. 1995; Logrieco et al. 1998). Gupta et al. (1991) detected beauvericin in cultures of Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans and 1in F . moniliforme was reported (Bottalico et al. 1995). From 94 Fusarium isolates tested belonging to 25 taxa, the following species produced beauvericin: F . et al. 1998). The metabolite has also been found as a natural contaminant of maize in Italy, Austria, Poland, South Africa and the USA and was detected in all maize hybrids (Pascale et al. 2002). These results and other published data (Munkvold et al. 1998; Fotso et al. 2002; Logrieco et al. 2002;Moretti et al. 2002) confirm that beauvericin is a common metabolite of many phytopathogenic Fusarium species and occurs in diverse foods and feeds contaminated with Fusarium species. Investigations of beauvericin have demonstrated that this metabolite has insectidal, antibiotic, cytotoxic, and ionophoric properties. According to Roberts (1981), sometoxic effects have been noticed against bacteria, mosquito larvae, brine shrimp and adult houseflies, but not against silkworm larvae at 1000 ppm in artificial diet. Recently, Ganassi et al. (2002) reported some effects of of beauvericin and beauvericin A isolated from P. tenuipes BCC 1614 was reported by Nilanonta et al. (2000). Beauvericin is a specific cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor and is toxic towards Artemia salina larvae and against insect, murine and human cell lines. It can induce programmed cell death similar to apoptosis and causes cytolysis (Logrieco et al. 1998; Vey et al. 2001; Pascale et al. 2002). Investigations on the effect of beauvericin to the insect cell line SF-9 from the lepidopteran clear cytotoxicity et al. Fornelli et al. 2004). One micromolar concentration of beauvericin caused about 10% decrease in the number of viable cells, and the effect increased at higher concentrations. However, in time-course experiments, no effect of beauvericin at 30 mM was noticed on cell viability (Calo et al. 2003). Cytotoxicity of beauvericin to two human cell lines of myeloid origin was reported by Calo et al. (2004). After an exposure time of 24 h, a decline in viability of cells was observed at a concentration of 10 mM or higher. In turkeys, fumonisin B-1 and beauvericin may affect the immune functions by suppressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (Dombrink-Kurtzman 2003). Beauvericin did not cause any symptoms on roots of melon, tomato, wheat and barley, however, it showed high toxicity towards protoplasts of these plants (see Moretti et al. 2002). With respect to the natural occurrence of beauvericin in Fusarium- contaminated food, feeding trials were conducted with broilers to study the effect of diets containing the mycotoxins moniliformin and beauvericin from natural contamination in the field (Zollitsch et al. 2003). The results indicate that dosages of up to 2.7 mg moniliformin and 12 mg beauvericin per kg diet showed no effect on any of the traits observed. Whether beauvericin should be seen as a food mycotoxin is not yet clear, because it mostly co-occurrs with other Fusarium metabolites, such as fumonisins. In any case, it is likely that beauvericin found and isolated from foods and feeds in nature derivesfrom Fusarium species rather than from B. the erythrocyte membrane ATPases (Jeffs & Khatchatourians 1997). There is very little published information on these two metabolites (see Strasser et al. 2000). Bassianolide is another cyclo-octadepsipeptide produced by B. bassiana with ionophoric and antibiotic activity similar to beauvericin (see Strasser et al. 2000; Vey et al. 2001). The biosynthesis of a structurally related substance, called PF1022, was reported by Weckwerth et al. (2000). PF1022 has strong anthelmintic properties and was found in a fungus producing only sterile mycelium. Bassiacridin is a toxic protein, that was purified from a strain of B. bassiana infecting locusts (Queseda-Moraga & Vey 2004). Injection of fourth instar nymphs of Locusta migratoria with the pure protein at relatively low dosage (3.3 mg toxin/g body weight) caused nearly 50% mortality. This insecticidal protein showed specific activity against locusts and has a limited similarity to a chitin binding protein from yeasts. Beauveriolides and beauverolides are peptides with a similar structure to beauvericin and bassianolide (Namatame et al. 1999, 2004). Beauveriolides seem to have potential as drugs in human medicine. Beauveriolides I and III isolated from culture broth of Beauveria sp. (FO-6979) showed potent inhibitory activity of lipid droplet accumulation in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages. They are the first microbial cyclodepsipeptides with demonstrated in vivo antiartherosclerotic effects and show promise as potential lead compounds as antiartherosclerotic agents(Namatame et al. 2004). Recently, a patent for production of beauveriolide I or III byBeauveria sp. (FO-6979) on selective media was granted (Omura & Tomoda 2005). Oosporein is the major secondary metabolite produced by B. brongniartii and is also produced by many isolates of B. bassiana . Comprehensive overviews on oosporein are presented by Strasser et al. (2000), Vey et al. (2001) and Seger et al. (2005a,b). This red-coloured pigment is a dihydroxybenzoquinone, which is also produced by many soil fungi. It is an antiviral compound and has antibiotic activity against gram-positive bacteria, but little effect on gram-negative bacteria. Obviously, oosporein has no antifungal and phytotoxic effects. It has been reported to cause avian gout in broilerchicks and turkeys and was found to be toxic to 1-day-old chicks. Furthermore, studies on its toxicity in mice and hamsters indicated an LD 50value of 0.5 mg kg/C281 body weight after intraperitoneal injection (Manning & Wyatt 1984; Vey et al. 2001).In vivo and in vitro studies on the distribution of oosporein in the environment revealed negligible amounts present. The maximum amount of oosporein produced ina culture medium was 300 mg L /C281, 3.2 mg kg/C281in the commercial product 'Melocont-Pilzgerste' (Agrifutur-Kwizda), 200 mg in a mycosed larva, 0.02 mg m/C282 in soil enriched with the commercial product and 6.4 mg m/C282in soil enriched by mycosed larvae (Strasser et al. 2000). These results demonstrate that the quantity of oosporein produced by these fungi in vivo is usually much less than that secreted in nutrient rich liquid media. No fungal metabolites, such as oosporein, were detected inpotato plants and tubers after application of 'Melocont -Pilzgerste' into the soil of a potato field (Abendstein et al. 2000; Strasser et al. 2000; Seger and B. brongniartii (Mu\u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1965; Roberts 1981). It is considered an important pathogenicity determinant because it can solubilise specific cuticular proteins (see Vey et al. 2001). In the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes , a synergistic activity bassiana conidia was observed (Bidochka & Khachatourians 1991), however the acid was not related to virulence in grasshoppers (Bidochka & Khachatourians 1993). Cell-free culture supernatants of B. bassiana containing oxalic acid caused mortality in several tick species after dipping (Kirkland et al. 2005), which support the hypothesis that oxalic acid secretion by B.bassiana , coupled to a reduction in the pH of the medium, acts as a potent acaricidal factor during pathogenesis. Effect of environmental factors (temperature, humidity, solar radiation) The propagation and survival of any microorganism in the environment is strongly affected by several abiotic and biotic factors. The most important abiotic environ-mental constraints for fungi are temperature, humidity or moisture and solar radiation. These factors are also responsible for effective, commercial use of entomopathogenic fungi. The importance of these ecological parameters was recognised early (Clerk & Madelin 1965; Mu \u00a8ller-Ko Zimmermann 1989; Fuxa 1995). This section summarises some general observations of the effect of temperature, humidity and solar radiation on the activity and longevity of B. bassiana andB. brongniartii in the laboratory as well as in the field. T emperature. Temperature can affect an entomopathogen in different ways by influencing the germination, growth and viability of the fungus on and in the host insect and in the environment. High temperatures may inactivate an entomopathogenbefore contact with the pest insect or may reduce or accelerate the growth within an insect depending on the temperature requirements of the entomopathogen and the host insect. In contrast, low temperatures may reduce or stop the germination and growth, thus impair or prolong a successful infection, e.g. against soil dwelling pestinsects. InB. bassiana, the optimum temperature is 23 /C1288C, the minimum 5 /C1108C and the maximum about 30 /C1388C, depending on the isolates tested (Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1965; Roberts & Campbell 1977). These values have been substantiated later by other scientists (e.g. Hywel-Jones & Gillespie 1990; Fargues et al. 1997; Hallsworth & 1999). Among African isolates of B. bassiana , germination, radial growth and sporulation of all isolates were retarded at 15 and 358 C, while the optimum temperature of different isolates was between 20 and 30 8C (Tefera & Pringle 2003) or 25/C1308C (Ekesi et al. 1999). In contrast, B. bassiana isolates from subantarctic soils of Macquarie Island germinated at 58 C (Roddam & Rath 1997). The thermal death point of B. bassiana spores is at 508 C for 10 min (Walstad et al. 1970). In B. brongniartii the temperature range for growth and sporulation is between 2 and 338 C with an optimum of 22 /C1238C (Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1965; Roberts & Campbell 1977). Growth of B. brongniartii has been noticed during storage at 28 C (Aregger 1992). Humidity. Humidity is a very important environmental factor affecting the efficacy and survival of entomopathogens. Spore germination outgrowth of the dead host insect require high moisture. On the other hand, high or low humidity in conjunction with high temperature may affect the viability and persistence of fungal spores. We have to distinguish between the macroclimate or macrohumidity and the microclimate or microhumidity on leaf or insect surfaces when considering moisture effects in the field. Generally, the range of relative humidity (RH) for germination of B. bassiana conidia et al. 1970; Hallsworth & Magan 1999). A reduction in germination occurs at 99% RH, while germination and growth is retarded at 94% and 92%. However, fungal infections of insects have been noticed at relatively low macrohumidities of 60 /C170%. Presumably the microhumidity at the surface of the host integument or foliage washigher in these cases. Successful infection at low relative humidities has also been observed with oil formulations (Prior et al. 1988; Bateman et al. 1993; Vidal et al. 2003). Obviously, fungal spores are able to germinate and infect the insect when covered by a thin oil layer on the insect cuticle independent of the surrounding relative humidity. The longevity of conidia at different temperatures is also strongly affected by the relative humidity and moisture content of the conidia. For example, the viability of dry conidia of B. bassiana was 635 days at 8 8C and 0% RH in contrast to 28/C156 days at 258 C and 75.8% RH. A lower RH increases the longevity of spores even at higher temperature (Clerk & Madelin 1965). Solar radiation. Sunlight, especially UV-B (290 /C1330 nm) and UV-A (330 /C1400 nm), is the most detrimental environmental factor affecting the field persistence of fungal insecticides. The results presented in the literature reveal that entomopathogens are inactivated within hours or days when exposed to sunlight (Gardner et al. 1977). In laboratory experiments under simulated sunlight, 99% of all B. bassiana conidia were inactivated at UV-C after nearly 16 min, and at UV-A and UV-B after about 31 min (Krieg et al. 1981). After irradiation with simulated sunlight, Ignoffo and Garcia (1992) found a half life of B. bassiana conidia of about 2 h. The influence of simulated sunlight (295 /C11100 nm) on the survival of conidia of 65 isolates of B. bassiana demonstrated that the survival decreased with increasing exposure, i.e. an exposure for 2 h or more was detrimental to all isolates tested (Fargues et al. 1996). In the laboratory, the survival of conidia applied in water onto glass coverslips and on crested wheatgrass ( Agropyron cristatum ) was reduced by greater than 95% after 15 min exposure to UV-B radiation (Inglis et al. 1995). Conidial survival in oil was morepronounced on glass (74% mortality after 60 min) than on leaves (97% mortality after 60 min). Significant differences in susceptibility to simulated sunlight among isolates ofB. bassiana were demonstrated by Morley-Davies et al. (1995). Also, diffuse sunlight has inactivating abilities as demonstrated in the entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Smits et al. 1996). The detrimental effects of sunlight implicating the relatively short persistence of microbial control agents after application have led to incorporation of various UV-protectants to conidial formulations (e.g. Inglis et al. 1995; Edgington al. 2000; Cohen et al. 2001; Leland & Behle 2005). Analytical methods to determine and quantify residues There are several methods and techniques for selective isolation of entomopathogenic fungi, including B. bassiana andB. entomopathogenic fungi, the 'Galleria bait method' (Zimmermann 1986) is generally used for qualitative analysis and to indirectly isolate fungi from soil. The use of selective media in combination with thesoil serial dilution plating method or a leaf washing technique gives quantitative results. Different selective media for reisolation of B. bassiana andB. brongniartii from soil or plants have been used (Veen & Ferron 1966; Mu al. 1982; Chase et al. 1986; Strasser et al. 1996). As selective agents, the first media contained oxgall, rose Bengal, crystal violet, cycloheximide and antibiotics, such as streptomycin, chlor-amphenicol and/or tetracycline. In 1982, Beilharz et al. found, that media based on oatmeal agar containing the fungicide Dodine (N-dodecylguanidine monoacetate) for B. and M. anisopliae . Later, the addition of benomyl was suggested by Chase et al. (1986). For B. brongniartii , Strasser et al. (1996) demonstrated that a nutrient medium containing cycloheximide (0.05%), Dodine(0.1%) and antibiotics was best suited for selective isolation of this fungus from soil. In all cases, the minimum number for recovery of bothBeauveria species is about 10 2conidia or propagules per 1 g of soil. During a study on the microbial flora in heavy metal polluted soils, Ba ath (1991) found that entomogenous fungi were highly tolerant to copper. Therefore, a copper- based medium could also be useful for selective isolation of these fungi. A variety of different biochemical and molecular methods has been developed to identify and distinguish among strains of entomopathogenic fungi (see Bidochka 2001; Rehner & Buckley 2005). Neuveglise al. (1997) found that 28s rDNA group- I introns are a powerful tool for identifying strains of B. brongniartii. Also, strain- specific microsatellite markers in B. brongniartii (Enkerli et al. 2001) and in B. bassiana (Rehner & Buckley 2003) have been identified. These microsatellite markers can also be applied to study fungus populations and to monitor the fate of specific strains in the environment (Enkerli et al. 2004). Fate and behaviour in the environment Studies on the fate and behaviour of a microbial control agent are important with respect to its ecological safety, e.g. potential unintended effects on non-targetorganisms, including their displacement, unintended distribution in the environment or contamination of groundwater. Mobility and persistence in air Conidia of B. bassiana andB. brongniartii are dry, of small size and are produced in powdery clusters. Therefore, it is obvious that these types of conidia are easily transported by air. However, there are only few observations of Beauveria as an airborne fungus, but these results document that Beauveria spp., especially B. bassiana , do occur naturally in the air (Airaudi & Filipello-Marchisio 1996; Rainer et al. et al. 2004; Nolard 2004; see Natural occurrence and geographical distribution andEffects on mammals and human health ). The transportation of fungal spores through the air by insects has been documented in many cases. Insects may function as a mechanical carrier or vector for B. bassiana , e.g. in order to transmit the fungus from a contamination device into the pestSafety (for references see Kreutz et al. 2004). For example, sap beetles were contaminated with B. bassiana in an autoinoculative device and transferred the fungus to overwintering sites (Dowd & Vega 2003). The species was also isolated from free flying sap beetles caught in traps. Similar transmission of B. bassiana in laboratory and semi-field experiments has been demonstrated with the bark beetle, Ips typographus (Kreutz et al. 2004). Carpophilus freemani is a fungivore that is frequently found in European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis , tunnels in corn. Beetles fed B. bassiana excreted viable conidia in 14% of their fecal droppings and, thus, may transfer the fungus both via their fecal droppings and mechanically (Bruck & Lewis 2002a). The viability of B. bassiana spores in the air is mainly affected by temperature, humidity and sunlight (see Effect of environmental factors (temperature, humidity, solar radiation )). The longevity of dry conidia on glass surfaces decreases as the storage temperature increases from 8 to 25 8C and by exposure to light. High storage humidities reduce the germination sooner than low humidities (Clerk & Madelin 1965). Undoubtedly, natural sunlight, i.e. the UV-B (290 /C1330 nm) and UV-A (330 /C1 400 nm) component, is one of the most important factors affecting the survival offungal spores in the air and on plants. A rapid inactivation of B. bassiana conidia by ultraviolet radiation within hours has been demonstrated in the laboratory (e.g. Krieg et al. 1981; Fargues et al. 1996). Studies on the persistence of B. bassiana conidia on plant surfaces, such as soybean foliage, have demonstrated that one-half of the original activity was lost between 5 and 10 days post application (Gardner et al. 1977). Viability on the plant surface may also be influenced by the plant type. Field evaluations of B. bassiana revealed a conidia persistence and infectivity up to 26 days on foliage of lettuce and celery. However, the number of colony forming units (CFUs)recovered on lettuce was significantly higher than on celery leaves (Kouassi et al. 2003). The viability of conidia of B. bassiana on phylloplanes reduced after four days by more than 75%, at 16 days more than 99% of the conidia on wheatgrass leaves and28/C185% on alfalfa leaves were destroyed (Inglis et al. 1993). Mobility and persistence in water There are different aspects on the mobility and persistence of fungal spores in water: (1) water can be used for longterm storage of fungi under laboratory conditions, (2) water is responsible for migration/percolation of spores into the soil, and (3) water as raindrops is responsible for dispersal. Storage of fungal cultures in water is an easy and cheap method, which was used more than 60 years ago by Castellani (1939). Boesewinkel (1976) was able to store 650 plant pathogenic and saprophytic fungi successfully in sterile, distilled water at room temperature for periods up to seven years. Several entomopathogenic fungi were viable after storage in sterile aqueous solutions of 0.675% NaCl at 48 C for 2/C13 years (Mu\u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler & Zimmermann 1980). Water is responsible for percolation of spores into soil and will be discussed in Mobility and persistence in soil . Rainfall plays an active role in the dispersal of B. bassiana from the soil to the surface of whorl-stage corn. Increased levels of crop residues reduce the amount of fungal transfer to the surface of young maize (Bruck &Lewis 2002b). Recently, both Beauveria spp. were found in surface water-derived drinking water in Norway (Hageskal et 15:01 21 2010Mobility and persistence in soil The mobility of fungal spores in the soil is mainly due to water/rain and soil arthropods. In contrast, persistence depends on several abiotic and biotic factors.These are specific soil properties, temperature, moisture and water, and agrochem-icals as abiotic factors and soil microorganisms as well as soil arthropods as bioticfactors (Keller & Zimmermann 1989). Mobility. The mobility of fungal spores in and into the soil is of relevance for two different reasons: (1) for effective biocontrol of soil dwelling pests, which mostly feed on roots of their host plants. In this case, the fungus has to be introduced into the root area in order to come into contact with the host insect; (2) for environmental safetyconsiderations, i.e. it has to be demonstrated that the fungus only percolates to theroot area and does not reach or contaminate the ground water. In this respect,Marshall and Bitton (1980) pointed out that microbial adhesion is of fundamentalsignificance in the function and interaction between microorganisms, i.e. attachmentof microorganisms to surfaces ensures that they are not eliminated from the particularecosystem. This means that attachment may be a prerequisite for the relationship between micro- and macroorganisms. Concerning B. bassiana and B. brongniartii, it has been proven that these fungi occur naturally in the soil throughout the world (see Natural occurrrence and geographical distribution ). It has further been demonstrated that B. bassiana could be found from 0 /C15t o2 0/C125 cm depth in different arable soils (Mietkiewski et al. 1995). The question however is, how deep can these fungi percolate into the soil. First experiments with other fungal species show that the spore and soil type may affect themigration. Spores of Zygorrhynchus and Gliomastix wash readily through a sand column up to 30 /C140 cm, whereas Penicillium spores show very little movement (5 /C110 cm) (Burges 1950). Spores that have a mucilaginous coat wash down readily, while spores which have a waxy non-wetting coat remain on the surface (Burges 1950).According to Hepple (1960), water is responsible for vertical movement of spores of Mucor ramannianus , but only over short distances. About 75% of conidia of the entomopathogenic fungus Nomuraea rileyi layered on a 10.5-cm column of sand were recovered in the filtrate after exposure to the equivalent of 16.25 cm of rain (Ignoffo etal. 1977). However, no conidia were recovered in filtrate from a silt-loam soil and over 90% of the recovered conidia were in the upper 2 cm of the column. The spores had probably been adsorbed on clay or organic particles. Studies on the vertical movementof wet and dry spores of M. anisopliae through a 30-cm sand column revealed that less than one spore per 1 mL effluent was found (Zimmermann 1992). The effect ofpercolating water on spore movement through soil was also studied using a plant-pathogenic isolate of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum . Formulations were placed on soil columns and artificial rain was applied. In general, 10-fold fewer CFU wererecorded at an 8 /C110 cm depth compared with a 0 /C12 cm depth (Gracia-Garza & Fravel 1998). Vertical movement of commercially formulated conidia of B. bassiana was measured in four, sifted soil types in 30.6 cm columns (Storey & Gardner 1987). When appliedas an aqueous suspension to the soil, /C2190% of the viable CFU's were recovered in the upper 15.2 cm in two soil types. Approximately 12.5% of the CFU's moved through the 30.6 cm column of the two other types and were collected in the effluent. When the vertical movement of formulated B. bassiana conidia was 2010undisturbed soil types, the migration was considerably less than that observed in columns of sifted soil. The majority, i.e. /C2194% of the conidia remained in the upper 5 cm of all four soil profiles (Storey & Gardner 1988; Storey et al. 1989). These observations indicate that the soil type, the soil pore structure (sifted versus undisturbed soil) and probably also the shape and size of spores affect their movement through the soil. Finally, movement in horizontal and vertical direction is also possible by Collembola (Dromph 2003) and earthworms (Hozzank et al. 2003). Persistence. As already mentioned, persistence of fungal spores in the soil is affected by several biotic and abiotic factors. In this respect, one main aspect is soil fungistasis. The term describes the phenomenon, whereby (a) viable fungal propagules, not under the influence of endogenous or constitutive dormancy, do not germinate in non-sterile soil at temperature and moisture favourable for germination, or (b) growth of fungalhyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature and moisture (Watson & Ford 1972). A widespread fungistasis in soils was found and postulated about 50 years ago (Dobbs & Hinson 1953). Soil fungistasishas been shown to be general in natural soils and to be a dynamic phenomenon. First experiments concerning the survival of B. bassiana in the soil were carried out by Huber (1958) and later by Wartenberg and Freund (1961). The authors found thatantibiotic microorganisms suppress the germination of conidia of B. bassiana in soil. They concluded that B. bassiana is a weak saprophyte and speak of a 'conservation effect' induced by antibiotic microorganisms, such as Actinomycetes. According toClerk (1969), several authors have reported that conidia of B. bassiana are subject to fungistatic effects in natural soils. However, the nature of the inhibitor(s) responsible for soil fungistasis is still unknown, although several authors consider that inhibitory substances released by soil microorganisms play a major role in fungistasis. Clerk (1969) found that conidia of B. bassiana are able to germinate in sterilised soil or in soil stimulated by an external source of nutrients, i.e. the presence of insects in the soilmight influence the behaviour of conidia. Conidial germination ofB. bassiana was inhibited in unsterilised aqueous extracts of soil. Extracts of the deepest soil layer were less inhibiting than extracts of overlaying layers of humus-rich soil. The inhibition was reduced by autoclaving and by filtering the extracts, indicating that the soil microbiota has an impact on the activity of Beauveria spp. When B. bassiana andB. brongniartii were stored at 48 C in sterile soil for preservation purposes, Mu\u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler and Zimmermann (1980) found that the B. bassiana isolate was still viable after six years, the B. brongniartii isolate after four years with decreased viability after six years. According to Lingg and Donaldson (1981), the viability of B. bassiana conidia in soil was primarily dependent on temperature and soil water content. Conidia half-lives ranged from 14 days at 258 C and 75% water saturation to 276 days at 108 C and 25% water saturation. Conidia held at /C28158C exhibited little or no loss in viability. Conidia were not recoverable after 10 days from soils at 558 C. Conidia survival in nonsterile soil amended with carbon (wheat and pea straw, gluciose, chitin) and/or nitrogen (KNO 3,N H 4Cl, urea, ammonium tartrate) sources was greatly decreased with often complete loss in less than 22 days, whereas conidia in sterile soil treated inthe same manner showed dramatic increase. The fungistatic effect in amendednonsterile soil was possibly related to Penicillium urticae , which was often isolated and which produced water-soluble inhibitor of a fungistatic effect on B. bassiana in two soils from different areas. Fungistatic levels varied between years and increased with increasing pH in soil. A loss of fungistatic mechanisms by sterilisation was postulated by McDowell et al. (1990). Sterilising soil before bioassays resulted in a 10- and 1000-fold reduction in LC 50 values required to kill first and third instars of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), respectively. These findings are also supported by Rosin et al. (1996) whofound that soil containing fresh manure was detrimental to B. bassiana , whereas high rates of composted manure were beneficial. Obviously, certain factors in the fresh manure reduce the survival of B. bassiana . The persistence of B. bassiana conidia in artificially contaminated soil was investigated under laboratory and field conditions (Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler & Zimmermann 1986). When starting the experiment in October, the number of viable conidia decreased from about 10 6g/C281dry soil to about 104or 103after one year according to the soil depth. When the experiment was started in May, the corresponding valueswere 10 7at the beginning to about 105conidia g/C281dry soil after 1 year. Storey et al. (1989) estimated the persistence of applied conidia to be about 200 days, while thegranular formulation of conidia persisted for a longer period. The persistence of B. bassiana blastospores in soil and their protection by clay-coating was investigated by Fargues et al. (1983). Naked blastospores of B. bassiana were inactivated after 3 weeks incubation in soil, while clay-coated blastospores were still active after two months at208C. Clay coating is a protection against biodegradation of fungal propagules by soil bacteria and protozoa. The authors stated that antagonists implicated in lysis ofblastospores must be considered an important part of the environmental response to a massive introduction of a fungus for biocontrol. Studdert et al. (1990) studied the relationship between soil water potential and temperature on survival of B. bassiana clay coated and noncoated conidia in two nonsterile soils. The longest mean half-life value was 44.4 weeks for conidia in sandy loam at /C2810 bars (0.0 bars /C30saturation) and 108 C. Clay-coating increase the survival of conidia. Survival was longer in the low organic soil compared to the high organic peat. The results suggest that conidia survival is affected by several physical factors and the soil microbiota. With anexperimental biodegradation method, Fargues and Robert (1985) found that inoculaofB. bassiana were substantially degraded and subject to 70 /C180% dry weight loss after six months at 198 C. In another experiment, conidia were spread on test areas as water suspensions at a rate of 10 10spores m/C282. After one year, the mean counts were about only 0.2% for B. bassiana of the originally spread spore amount. In loamy soil, most of the spores were found at 0 /C15 cm, while in humus, they were found in deeper soil layers at 5 /C115 and 15 /C120 cm (Tyni-Juslin & Va \u00a8nninen 1990). Inglis et al. (1997) investigated the influence of three formulations (water, oil, and 15% oil emulsion) andtwo crops (alfalfa and crested wheatgrass) on the deposition and subsequentpersistence of B. bassiana conidia in soil. Reductions during winter after 225 /C1272 days were less than one order of magnitude. Neither crop nor formulation influenced conidial persistence in a clay /C1loam soil. Investigations on the persistence of B. brongniartii were done mainly in Switzerland within the frame of experiments for cockchafer control. Applications of B. brongiartii fungus kernels from May to August generally resulted in an increase of 1 /C15/C2910 3 CFU g/C281dry soil compared to untreated control plots (Kessler et al. 2003). Soils treated in October and November yielded no increase. Soil temperatures between 20and 258 C and a high clay content had a positive effect on the occurrence and densitySafety whereas temperatures above 27 8C had a negative influence. The survival of B. brongniartii in soil was further examined for over 16 months after application of fungus kernels in different soil types in Switzerland (Kessler et al. 2004). In the absence of the host insect, M. melolontha , the reduction in the CFU in soil was nearly 90%. In soils with high organic content, the decline was more pronounced. When grubs of M. melolontha were present, the survival was significantly longer. The rapid decrease of the fungus in soil without the host reveals the high specificity of the fungus and that a saprophytic multiplication is unlikely (La \u00a8ngle et al. 2005). Monitoring of introduced microorganisms in the environment is essential not only for the development of new biocontrol agents, but also for understanding of theirinteractions with the living environment, their ecological impact and safety assess-ments. Several years after B. brongniartii was applied against M. melolontha in various field tests in Switzerland, isolates were recovered from soil and subjected to genetic analyses using specific microsatellite markers (Enkerli et al. 2004). The applied B. brongniartii strains were detected at all sites up to 14 years after their application. In addition to the applied strains, indigenous and mutated or intermediate strains were also isolated. The results suggested that applied and indigenous strains of B. brongniartii could coexist in the same habitat. These observations are supported by Castrillo et al. (2004), who observed a large number of vegetative compatibility groups(VCG) among strains of B. bassiana and a very low level of recombination which may be a barrier preventing genetic exchange between dissimilar strains in the field. Effects on non-target organisms Effects on other microorganisms Investigations on the natural prevalence of B. bassiana have shown that this fungus widely occurs in the soil as well as on insects in the aerial environment. This means that there is a long lasting evolutionary coexistence with other microorganisms that includes different forms of interactions. From the viewpoint of safety, the main concern is that microorganisms applied for biological control could potentially pre-empt or displace other nontarget microorgan-isms. After application on plants or in the soil, biocontrol agents should be able to survive and maintain themselves for biocontrol activity, but they should not interfere with the resident microbiota. For example, studies on inundative release of anatoxigenic strain of Aspergillus flavus into the soil of cotton fields showed that the native, toxigenic isolates were almost completely displaced (Cotty 1994). Yet, in a risk analysis case study using Fusarium species, the effect of antagonistic Fusarium oxysporum to control Fusarium wilts on the resident soil microbiota revealed that the introduction of wild-type and genetically manipulated antagonistic strains of Fusarium oxysporum, released alone or in mixture, did not interfere with the microbial equilibrium of a natural soil (Gullino et al. 1995). Similar results were also obtained by Wang et al. (2004) in B. bassiana and Enkerli et al. (2004) in B. brongniartii . Wang et al. (2004) monitored the fate of inundatively applied strains of B. bassiana against Dendrolimus punctatus in southwest China. During one year, the indigenous and exotic strains were reisolated, but the indigenous strains predominated in the local environment, indicating that they were not displaced by the exotic ones. Enkerli et al. (2004) studied the behaviour of introduced B. brongniartii strains for control of M. September 2010Switzerland. The results suggested that applied and indigenous strains of B. brongniartii could coexist in the same habitat. Furthermore, in B. bassiana, a genetic exchange between indigenous and introduced strains in the field is unlikely due to the large number of vegetative compatibility groups (Castrillo et al. 2004). There are several reports on interactions of Beauveria spp. with hyperparasitic, antagonistic and especially, phytopathogenic fungi. A hyperparasitic fungus attack-ing and Donaldson (1981) reported that the survival ofconidia of B. bassiana in nonsterile soil amended with carbon sources, nitrogen sources or combinations of both was possibly related to Penicillium urticae , which produced a water-soluble inhibitor of B. . There are also various interactions with Clonostachys spp. and Trichoderma spp. which may suppress or bassiana in vitro (Krauss et al. 2004; Zimmermann unpublished). Meanwhile, there is an increased interest to test and use B. bassiana also against plant pathogens (Ownley et al. 2004). According to the experiments, B. bassiana isolate 11 /C198 could reduce Rhizoctonia solani damping-off of tomato in greenhouse tests, and also protect cotton against a seedling disease complex in some sites.Laine and Nuorteva (1970) had previously observed that B. bassiana and B. brongniartii (B. tenella ) had (Hetero- basidium )annosus .Beauveria (Ceratocystis ulmi ) (Gemma et al. 1984) the disease incidence of Phoma betae , the blackleg of beet (Roberti et al. 1993). Under greenhouse conditions, B. bassiana and B. brongniartii were antagonistic iaspecies & Koubova 1994). The of the genera Fusarium ,Armillaria und Rosellinia was by B. bassiana (Reisenzein & Tiefenbrunner 1997), and metabolites from B. bassiana produced in liquid culture inhibited the growth of several Fusarium spp. (Langbauer et al. 1996). Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium were inhibited by a culture filtrate of B. bassiana (Bark et al. 1996). Effects on plants Both Beauveria species are typical soil dwelling fungi and are known to be entomopathogens. Nevertheless, the question of possible phytopathogenic side-effects or any other interactions with plants should be raised. In the past 100 years,B. bassiana and B. brongniartii have been used for biocontrol of so many leaf- and root-feeding pest insects, that there was ample opportunity of observation of detrimental effects of these fungi in plants. In summarising the past literature, Mu\u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1965) concluded that side-effects or any phytopathogenic activity on plants are not known. We can presently come to the same conclusion. The natural occurrence on plants is reviewed in Natural occurrence and geographical distribution . Recent research has demonstrated that there are various tri-trophic interactions between the plant, the pest insect feeding on the plant and entomopathogenic fungi attacking these herbivores. Elliot et al. (2000) as bodyguards against herbivores. The most interesting interactions are as follows: 1. Plants may affect the infection by the entomopathogen;2. Plants may affect the persistence of the entomopathogen;3.B. bassiana can persist as an endophyte within plants. There are several reports indicating that the plant species may affect the infectivity andpersistence of B. bassiana . Ramoska that chinch bugs, Blissus leucopterus , fed on sorghum and corn were more resistant to B. bassiana than those on barley, and Bemisia argentifolii reared on cotton was significantly less susceptible to the fungus than white flies reared on melon (Poprawski & Walker 2000). On foliage oflettuce and celery, the mortality of Lygus lineolaris adults seven days post treatment was 91 and 78%, respectively (Kouassi et al. 2003). Nymphs of Trialeurodes vaporariorum were highly susceptible to B. bassiana on cucumber plants, while insects reared on tomato plants were significantly less susceptible (Poprawski et al. 2000). It isassumed that sequestered tomatine by T. vaporariorum nymphs may explain the inhibition of B. bassiana after the penetration process, as tomatine was demonstrated in vitro to have a detrimental effect on B. bassiana. Beauveria bassiana has been reported to be an endophyte of certain plants, especially corn (Bing & Lewis 1992). Studies have demonstrated that the fungus, applied to whorl-stage corn by foliar application or injection, colonised, translocated and persisted in corn plants. Some conidia of B. bassiana are able to germinate on the leaf surface of corn and penetrate it. Virulence bioassays demonstrated that B. bassiana does not lose virulence against Ostrinia nubilalis once it has colonised corn (Wagner & Lewis 2000). In the greenhouse, B. bassiana was applied as a liquid seed treatment to Bt transgenic corn hybrids and their near isolines (2 /C2910 10conidia mL/C281), and no significant differences in seed germination or presence of root pathogens were observed (Lewis et al. 2001). Recent experiments revealed that B. bassiana may also function as an endophyte in cocoa seedlings (Posada & Vega 2005), in banana tissue culture plants (Dubois et al. 2005) and in opium poppy, Papaver somniferum (Quesada-Moraga et al. 2006). Another aspect of the tri-trophic interactions between plants, entomopathogenic fungi and pest insects is the fact that toxic metabolites of Beauveria spp. may enter the plants. As already mentioned in Production of metabolites/toxins , beauvericin derived from Fusarium species and not from B. bassiana is obviously widespread in maize and food. Beauvericin did not cause any symptoms on roots of melon, tomato, wheat and barley, however, it showed high toxicity towards the protoplasts of these plants (see Moretti et al. 2002). The phytotoxic potential of B. brongniartii and its main metabolite oosporein were evaluated against seed potatoes ( Solanum tuberosum )in vitro and in situ . The weight of haulm and tubers was unaffected by B. brongniartii , and no oosporein was detected in the potatoes. Therefore, the species pose no risks topotato plants or tubers (Abendstein et al. 2000; Seger et al. 2005a; See Production of metabolites/toxins ). Effects on soil organisms As mentioned, B. bassiana and B. brongniartii are commonly found in soil. They generally have a broad host range and are often used for biocontrol of soil dwelling574 G. 15:01 21 2010pests. interactions or effects on other non-target soil inhabiting invertebrates should be noticed. In 1964, Sams found that the mites T yrophagus putrescentiae andAcarus are not susceptible to B. bassiana .T yrophagus putrescentiae feeds on insects and also on dead, Beauveria -infected larvae. This mite species is also able to transmit spores of B. bassiana from fungus-infected larvae of Galleria mellonella to healthy ones. Beauveria bassiana was also found in high frequency on a great number of the collembolan Onychiurus subtenuis (Visser et al. 1987). The authors concluded that there was no indication that B. bassiana killed the collembolan. The collembolan Folsomia candida was not susceptible to . It consumed and inactivated the insect pathogen without causing mortality or any other harmful effects (Broza et al. 2001).Pathogenicity tests of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii were collembolans in 1 /C2910 7conidia mL/C281suspension and in one case also in 1 /C29108conidia mL/C281, none of the fungal isolates increased mortality over the controls. After continuous exposure of F . fimetaria andP . minuta to conidia of B. brongniartii for 14 days at 208 C in sphagnum containing 1 /C29108conidia g/C281wet weight, one of the B. brongniartii isolates increased the mortality significantly. In a test of the attractiveness of these fungi for the three collembolan species, B. brongniartii was found to be more attractive than baker's yeast. Mites were also observed feeding on B. brongniartii killed white grubs of Melolontha spp. without any sign infection (Zimmermann, unpubl.). Dispersal of entomopathogenic fungi by Collembolans has 2001, 2003). For example, B. bassiana is distributed both in a horizontal and vertical direction by the mite Sancassania phyllognathi which is resistant to fungal infection (Sams ina\u00b4kova \u00b4 & Sams ina\u00b4k 1970). The transmission of spores of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii to a susceptible host, T , by collembolans F. fimetaria ,H.assimilis andP.minuta was also demonstrated (Dromph 2003). These findings show that there are no or very low detrimental effects on the tested soil-dwelling collembolans and mites. In contrast, collembolans can act as vectors ofBeauveria spp. and thus may play an important role for the dispersal and transmission of these fungi in soil. Effects on aquatic organisms No toxicity or pathogenicity was observed in Daphnia magna when exposed to 1 /C2910 9 conidia of B. bassiana strain GHA per litre for 21 days (Goettel & Jaronski 1997). Strain GHA was also not infectious against the grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio , after percutaneous and oral contamination bassiana conidia caused high mortalities, but these were attributed to a high particulate density since heat-killed controls also proved lethal (Genthner et al. 1994a). Beauvericin has been found to be highly toxic towards Artemia salina larvae and murine cell lines and can induce apoptosis (Pascale et al. 2002). In the mysid A. bahia , beauvericin was toxic at an LC 50of 0.56 mg L/C281(Genthner et al. 1994a). To my knowledge there are no published studies regarding effects of other Beauveria metabolites as well as of B. parasitoids, honey bees, earthworms and other non-target arthropods It is well known that B. bassiana has a wide host range, occurring on several hundred arthropod species; however, host specificity is really a strain-specific trait. For example, B. bassiana isolates from the lady beetle, Olla v-nigrum , were pathogenic to adult O. v-nigrum but not to adults of the Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan 2003). The GHA strain of B. bassiana was not significantly pathogenic to either O. v-nigrum orH. axyridis . In contrast, B. brongniartii has a much narrower host range being mostly restricted to members of the coleopteran familyScarabaeidae. The practical use of these fungi in different crop protection systems raises the question of possible side-effects on non-target organisms. This is especially important when commercial products of these fungi are used on wide areas, e.g. for control of grasshoppers on meadows or of the European cockchafer species, or when B. bassiana is used together with beneficial insects in glasshouses. Generally, there is a difference between the physiological host range and the ecological host range (Hajek & Butler 2000). The physiological host rangedemonstrates the range of insect species that can be infected in the laboratory, while the ecological host range demonstrates which insects can be infected in nature or under field conditions. Non-target insects which are infected under laboratory conditions, may not necessarily be infected in nature. This topic was also discussed in detail by Hajek and Goettel (2000) and Jaronski et al. (2003). There are numerous papers on the effect of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii on beneficial and other non-target organisms. Examples are presented in Table V . Most of the studies were done in the laboratory and only a few in the field. One of the first comprehensive reports was given by Goettel et al (1990), who listed the effects of B. bassiana on nontarget invertebrates, such as bees and other pollinators, silkworms, predators and parasitoids. Further, general information is mentioned by Goettel et al. (1997, 2001) and Vestergaard et al. (2003). The last authors conclude that despite the wide host range of B. bassiana , evidence to date suggests that this fungus can be used with minimal impact on nontarget organisms, especially when isolate selection and spacio-temporal factors are taken into consideration. Beauveria brongniartii has a narrower host range, mainly including Scarabaeidae, and occurs worldwide in soil habitat. Laboratory bioassays demon- strated that it was possible to infect collembolans, cicindellid and carabid beetles unter stress conditions, while honey bees and earthworms were not affected (Table V). Data from field investigations did not reveal any indication of possible adverse effects on vertebrates, honeybees, beneficial insects, earthworms and plants(Vestergaard et al. 2003). Effects on vertebrates (fish, amphibia, reptiles and birds) Possible side-effects of entomopathogenic fungi on vertebrates and men were summarised by Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1967) nearly 40 years ago. Today, detailed vertebrate safety tests are included in the registration process of commercial Beauveria products and have been conducted with several isolates of B. bassiana . of effects of B. bassiana andB. brongniartii (strains and formulations) on benecial laboratory conditions, lower infection rates ingreenhouseLudwig and Oetting (2001) Apis mellifera B. bassiana F Conidia were applied in bee hives: low mortality and no noticeableeffect on behaviour, larvae and colony characteristicsAlves et al.

Amphibia A fungal suspension of B. bassiana was fed to the leopard frog, Rana pipiens via gastric incubation. The dosage was 9.8 /C29108conidia corresponding to 2.22 /C291012conidia for a 70-kg human. No mortality or fungus recovery was recorded in any of the tissues. The viscera were free of mycelial growth. Viability of spores was established in fecalwashings of pellets (Donovan-Peluso et al. 1980). Reptiles A fungus attributed to be B. bassiana was observed to cause infections in a captive American alligator (Fromtling et al. 1979), and B. bassiana was implicated in causing a pulmonary disease in captive tortoises (Georg et al. 1962; Gonzales-Cabo 1995). The reptiles were in captivity and under temperature stress which may explain theirsusceptibility to the fungus. When a tortoise was kept at 228 C and injected with 0.5 mL of 10 6spores of B. bassiana into the lung, no mortality was observed, while a second contaminated tortoise died when kept only at 168 C (see Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1967). Birds Birds may become exposed to entomopathogenic fungi directly by consuming spores deposited on their food, or indirectly by consuming fungus-infected insects. Theconcern about possible side-effects in birds is more than 100 years old. Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1967) mentioned that according to E. Devaux (in Giard 1892), chickens, fed white grubs of Melolontha sp. infected with B. brongniartii (B. tenella ), did not demonstrate any side-effects. However, precise examinations were not carried out at that time. Later, young Falco sparvensis were fed with 5 /C2910 6spores of B. bassiana per kg body weight (Althouse et al. 1997). No differences were found among any treatments andthe control in growth, body mass or survival. Male and female ring-necked pheasants(Phasianus colchicus ) were challenged per os with conidia of B. bassiana (Johnson et al. 2002). In both sexes, the weight gain at 17 and 25 days was not significantlydifferent between challenged and control groups. Histopathological changes weregenerally undetectable. In 1987, a large field trial was carried out in Germanywith B. brongniartii 14blastospores ha/C281). During this experiment, no side-effects on birds, especially young ones, were noticed (Havelka & Ruge 1988). According toCopping (2004), the non-target bird toxicity for B. bassiana strain 74040 21 2010Effects on mammals and human health Safety of entomopathogenic fungi, especially B. bassiana and B. brongniartii ,t o mammals and humans is of primary concern and has to be considered as one of the main potential hazards of using fungi as biocontrol agents. Therefore, it is not unusualthat allergic, pathogenic or toxic risks for humans and mammals have been stressed inmany Goettel et al. 1997, 2001;Vestergaard et al. 2003). Recently, some papers from South Korea on the addition ofB. bassiana to human food documents a totally new aspect of this fungus. Yoon et al. (2003b) reported that extracts of B. bassiana synnemata had anticoagulant and immune system modulating activity, which could provide beneficial physiologicalactivities for humans. In another paper, Yoon et al. (2003a) found that B. bassiana synnemata could be used as an additive to wheat flour for the preparation of noodleand bread. Allergy Allergies are caused by certain protein and polysaccharide antigens, so all types of microorganisms are potentially allergenic to man. Generally, a wide range of allergic reactions to various fungi can occur. According to Nolard (2004), 5 /C115% of the population suffering from respiratory allergy have been sensitised to one or severalmoulds. Exposure to fungus associated antigens may cause sensitisation, and laterexposures can elicit reactions like respiratory distress, lachrymation or erythema. Themain route of sensitisation is respiratory. Allergies relevant to the safety of biologicalpesticides are placed in Type I and III. Type I allergy is an immediate response to relatively small amounts of an inhaled allergen resulting in rhinitis, heavy asthma or lacrymation. Type III allergy is a delayed response 4 /C18 h after exposure to a relatively heavy inhaled dose of the allergen, causing fever, headache and weakness (Austwick 1980; Burges 1981). Basics of fungal Concerning B. bassiana and B. brongniartii , allergies or allergic reactions could occur in workers in production facilities who are exposed repeatedly to high concentrations of spores and when thefungi are released into the air in an inhalable form after application for biocontrolpurposes. Because the conidia of both fungi are 'dry', relatively small (2 /C13mm, globose, in B. bassiana and 2/C16mm, oval, in B. brongniartii ) and produced in dusty clusters, they are easily spread by air and may reach the lower respiratory tract afterinhalation (Austwick 1980). The natural occurrence of B. bassiana in the air has already been mentioned in Natural occurrence and geographical distribution and Mobility and persistence in air . MacLeod (1954) reported, that B. bassiana was found within the lung tissues of 14 rodents. But, histological examination has not shown that the fungus could readilycreate a pathological condition within the tissues. In a survey of fungi from sputum ofpatients hospitalised from chronic pulmonary disease, more than 15% of more than3000 sputum samples were found to contain one or more colonies of B.bassiana (Pore et al. 1970) and from 103 sputum specimens from male telephone workers, fivecontained Beauveria sp. (Comstock et al. 1974). Gumowski with allergy; B. bassiana was not mentioned at that time. However, there are some documents that indicate B. bassiana may cause allergies and/ or allergic reactions. Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1967) mentions several cases of allergic reactions in humans caused by this species, especially during the production process. Generally, headache, weakness and fever were noticed. High fever and a reaction similar to an anaphylactic shock were noticed by Dr Sams ina\u00b4kova \u00b4, Praha, and her assistant in 1965 when producing a spore powder of B. bassiana . However, when she was working with dry and dusty blastospores of B. bassiana , such reactions were never observed. These observations confirm that fungal conidia contain more allergenicity causing factors compared to hyphae and to submerged culture produced blastospores (Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1967). Allergic reactions in workers were also reported by Mel'nikova and Murza (1980). In contrast to these findings, no incidents of human hypersensitivity reactionwere noticed by workers of the company Mycotech during many years of mass production of the fungus (Goettel & Jaronski 1997). Inhalation experiments \u00a8diger') were reported by Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler (1967). In preliminary experiments, mice were treated two times per week by dusting 50 mg conidia in a 10-L flask. They died within a short time. But the reactions were less harmful after only one treatment per week. There is no doubt, that the spore dose was rather high corresponding to 5 g m /C283. After histological examination, the fungus was not found in mouse lungs. In further inhalation experiments with B. bassiana and various animals, the fungus did not migrate from the lungs into other organs, and thelungs were completely rid of the fungus 4 /C15 days later (Mel'nikova & Murza 1980). Some inhalation and irritant data on B. bassiana brongniartii Mildly irritant to skin of rabbits. These investigations and findings reveal that conidia of Beauveria species have allergenic potential. In molecular studies, B. bassiana crude extracts possess numerous IgE reactive proteins, some of which are cross-reactive among allergens from otherfungi (Westwood et al. 2005). A strongly reactive potential B. bassiana specific allergen (35 kDa) was identified and confirmed by intradermal skin testing. Pathogenicity/T oxicity Besides allergy, one of the main concerns in the use of entomopathogenic fungi is the risk of infection to humans or mammals. On the other hand, B. bassiana itself or fungus diseased larvae of Bombyx mori have been used as medicants for hundreds of years in Chinese medicine (Mu \u00a8ller-Ko \u00a8gler 1965). Natural occurrence. Beauveria species have been rarely identified as agents of human infections, and in an overview on the emergence of less common, but medicallyimportant fungal pathogens on recipients, the genus Beauveria is not mentioned (Walsh et al. 2004; Strasser & Kirchmair 2006). Nevertheless, there are some cases where B. bassiana has been reported as the cause of mycotic keratitis in humans (Sachs et al. 1985; Low et al. 1997; Kisla et al. 2000; Sigler 2003) and in a rabbit cornea (Ishibashi et al. 1987). For example, Sachs et al. (1985) described the first case ofB. bassiana keratitis in a patient following the removal of a corneal foreign body.582 G. ZimmermannDownloaded By: [University of Laval] At: 15:01 2010However, the patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and antibiotics prior to the identification of mycotic elements. This therapy may have depressed the normal protective mechanisms. A fungal keratitis due to B. bassiana was also described in an 82-year-old woman (Kisla et al. 2000). The patient was treated successfully withtopical natamycin and oral fluconazole. The first documented human deep tissue infection with a Beauveria sp. in a patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy was reported by Henke et al. (2002). Antifungal therapy with itraconazole (200 mg orally twice daily) was successful. Recently, a second case of disseminated Beauveria infection in an immunosuppressed patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was reported from New Zealand (Tucker et al. 2004).The infection was successfully treated with amphotericin B and itraconazole. In both cases, the Beauveria isolates were unable to grow at 378 C, and the New Zealand isolate even did not grow at 358 C. In both cases, the patients were not exposed directly to the fungus, e.g. by use of a B. bassiana product. Thus, we can only speculate how these patients came into contact with the fungus. Tucker et al. (2004) hypothesised that their patient was exposed to B. bassiana while living in an agricultural area. Recently, the first case of empyema caused by B. bassiana in a 51-year-old man was reported in Turkey (Gu \u00a8rcan et al. 2006). The authors think that prolonged air leakage after lung operation was the primary cause of infection. The patient recovered without any antifungal treatment after the air leakage was secured. The isolated strain of B. bassiana did not grow at 378 C. Experimental data. During the development and registration of B. bassiana products for biocontrol, the fungus has been extensively tested for safety against several mammals. The first experiments were conducted by Schaerffenberg (1968). They included injection, inhalation and feeding tests with adult white rats. No toxic or pathogenic but allergic reactions were noticed. A commercially used strain of B. bassiana was administered to albino rats intragastrically and intraperitoneally and rabbits intravenously (Mel'nikova & Murza 1980). The LD 50number of spores animal was more than 1.1 /C291010, 2.2/C291010and 4.0 /C291010, respectively. Single administration of Boverindust rats resulted in an 50of 0.690.1 g kg/C281and more than 10 g kg/C281, respectively. The potential pathogenicity of B. bassiana to mice was studied by intramuscular injection of 2/C29108(high) and 2 /C29105(low) conidia (Semalulu et al. 1992). It was concluded that B. bassiana does not cause infection, multiply, nor survive for more than 3 days when injected into healthy mice. Summaries and EPA evaluations of toxicity/pathogenicity data are available for B. bassiana strains GHA and 74040 on the EPA oppbppd1/biopesticides/ingredients/tech_docs/tech_128924.htm /tech_128818. htm. The experiences of Mycotech Corporation (now Laverlam International, Butte MT) with the safety testing of their B. bassiana strain GHA are also presented by Goettel and Jaronski (1997). No infectivity or toxicity was demonstrated in any of thetests with rats and other vertebrates, The fungus was cleared from rats within 7 days after intratracheal application and within 3 days after intraperitoneal or peroral application. In an ocular irritation test with conidial powder, a moderate reaction, such as redness or swelling with no signs of infection was observed. Ocular introduction of two formulations, an oil flowable minimal irritation and dermal application of conidia to rabbits showed only transitory erythema. Some precise data on mammalian pathogenicity/toxicity of both Beauveria species are also presented by Copping B. ATCC 74040: Mammalian toxicity: No infectivity or pathogenicity was observed in rats after 21 days exposure to 1.8/C29109colony forming units kg/C281. Possible irritant to eyes, skin and respiratory system. Dermal, oral and inhalation studies with Naturalis-Lon rats indicated that the fungus is non- toxic Beauveria In rats, there was no toxicity, infectivity or pathogenicity from a single dose of 1.1 two well-known entomo- pathogenic fungi which have a worldwide distribution, and are used for biological control of pest insects for more than 100 years. This means that tons of fungusmaterial of both species have been produced and used during that time. The productshave passed the registration requirements in several countries, and are still widely usedfor biocontrol of pest insects. The present review documents, that there is a broad knowledge on B. bassiana and B. brongniartii , i.e. on their biology, their fate and behaviour in the environment, their effects on non-target organisms and on vertebrates, including mammals and humans. So far, no serious detrimental effectshave been observed after application of these fungi. On the basis of our actual andpresented knowledge, both Beauveria species, B. bassiana andB. brongniartii , should be considered as safe. Nevertheless, to avoid possible risks, certain vertebratepathogenicity/toxicity tests and relevant studies on non-target organisms should bemade within future registrations of new strains. Additionally, known protection measures during the production process and application are necessary to avoid allergic reactions. However, all risks can never be excluded. It is hoped, that this reviewprovides a fundamental basis of knowledge for scientists, as well as for producers,potential registrants and regulatory authorities for their future work and decisions onthe development and registration of these two fungi.

Yet, while there have been many theoretical investigations of how these factors may act, empirical data is more limited. We investigated the effects of parasite density and heterogeneity on parasite virulence and fitness using four strains of the entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae , and its leaf- ant host Acromyrmex echinatior as the model system. Results: The relationship between parasite density and infection was sigmoidal, with there being an invasion threshold for an infection to occur (an Allee effect). Although spore production was positively density-dependent, parasite fitness decreased with increasing parasite density, indicating within-host scramble competition. The dynamics differed little between the four strains tested. In mixed infections of three strains the infection-growth dynamics were unaffected by parasiteheterogeneity. Conclusions: The strength of within-host competition makes dispersal the best strategy for the parasite. Parasite heterogeneity may not have effected virulence or the infection dynamics either because the most virulent strain outcompeted the others, or because the interaction involved scramble competition that was impervious to parasite heterogeneity. The dynamics observed may be common for virulent parasites, such as Metarhizium , that produce aggregated transmission stages. Such parasites make useful models for investigating infection dynamics and the impact of parasite competition.Published: 14 November 2004 BMC Evolutionary Biology 2004, 4:45 doi:10.1186/1471-2148-4-45Received: 25 May 2004 Accepted: 14 November 2004 This article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/45 \u00a9 2004 Hughes et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

However, as the transmission stages of parasites tend to be clustered, the majority of host-par- asite interactions will rather involve multiple parasiteindividuals. This is particularly the case for those parasites that exhibit a semelparous life-history, releasing all their transmission propagules in a single event that normallycoincides with host death [1,2]. In the same models, transmission is assumed to follow the mass action princi- ple, ESI, where S and I are the densities of susceptible and infected individuals respectively and E is a constant describing the probability of infection [3]. Thus the prob-ability of a host becoming infected per unit time will bedirectly proportional to the number of parasites that itencounters. Host-parasite interactions will also ofteninvolve multiple genotypes of parasites, further compli-cating their dynamics [4,5]. The co-occurrence of multiple parasites within a single host makes within-host competition between the para-sites inevitable. Hosts represent limited resources andthere is a carrying capacity for the total biomass of para-sites that the host resources can support. The within-hostgrowth of the parasites will thus normally be density- dependent, decreasing as the carrying capacity is approached [6,7]. Interactions between different parasitegenotypes are often considered to result in increased viru-lence, but have also been predicted to lead to decreased virulence depending on the dynamics [4,8-11]. The out-come of interactions will depend critically on both the scale of competition and the relatedness of the parasites involved, with higher relatedness selecting for reducedcompetition, or even cooperation, and more local compe-tition offsetting this [12-14]. The nature of the within-host competition has further been characterized as a contin- uum between two extremes: superinfections, which exhibit contest competition with the most virulent para- sites eliminating those less virulent, and coinfections,where the parasites differ little in virulence and resourcesend up being shared amongst individuals via scramblecompetition (or in its purest form by parasites exploitingdifferent within-host niches and not competing at all)[8,15,16]. The mechanism of competition can be: (1) exploitation, with parasites competing for resources, (2) interference, with parasites, for example, producing antag-onistic compounds, or (3) apparent, being mediated bythe host immune system [5]. Exploitation competition isinevitable whenever parasites do not have completely sep- arate niches within the host, while interference competi- tion via antagonistic compounds drives, for example, the interaction between strains of entomopathogenic bacteriathat produce bacteriocins [17]. Apparent competition hasbeen argued to be the most important type [4], and canoccur even in invertebrates with their less complex immune systems. For example, malaria parasites suppress the immune response of their mosquito vector [18], andvarious entomopathogenic fungi have been shown to pro- duce immunodepressant compounds [19-23]. In spite of the fundamental importance of interactions between different strains of parasites, empirical studies of mixed infections are relatively rare and a number of themhave produced results that conflict with the theoretical predictions [5,24]. Most studies have found either that mixed infections are more virulent than single infections[25-29], or that virulence equalled that of the most viru- lent strain [23,25,30-32]. Interactions can be more com- plex though, and may also depend on environmentalconditions, host genotype, or on the parasite genotypes involved [25,32-35]. For example, the virulence of bacte- riocin-producing bacteria matches the winning strain onlywhen one strain can kill the other, but is reduced com-pared to single infections when both strains can kill each other [17]. Furthermore, consideration of virulence only does not provide a full picture of the complexity of theinteraction. The production of transmission stages may be increased [26-28,30] or decreased [31] during mixedinfections, and may also depend upon the order of infec- tion [32]. Although the finding that virulence matched that of the most virulent strain might suggest that that strain has outcompeted the less virulent strain, in somestudies the transmission stages produced were from theboth strains [29,31,33], or even entirely from the less vir- ulent strain [23]. Here we examine the infection dynamics of the parasite M. anisopliae var. anisopliae generalist entomopathogenic fungus that is known to infect leaf-cutting ants [36-41], as well as many other insects. Infection may be from sporu- lating cadavers or from spores dispersed in the soil.Metarhizium spores have a tendency to remain attached to one another, making even dispersed spores likely to beclustered, and soil has been estimated to contain as many as 1,000 to 50,000 spores g -1 [41]. Spores germinate and penetrate directly through the host cuticle without first growing over the surface of it as some other fungi do. Host individuals will thus often be infected by multiple para-site propagules. In addition, the group-living life-style ofleaf-cutting ants, as with other social insects, makes themespecially prone to being exposed to multiple infectionsunder natural conditions [42]. Inside the host, the para- site produces blastospores and then hyphal bodies that release immunodepressant and antibiotic toxins[19,21,22]. After a period of time the host dies by somecombination of the depletion of its resources due to theBMC Evolutionary Biology \u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017\u000f\u0003 4 \u0017\u0018 KWWS \u0012\u0012ZZZ\u0011ELRPHGFHQWUDO\u0011FRP\u0012\u0014\u0017\u001a\u0014\u0010\u0015\u0014\u0017\u001b\u0012\u0017\u0012\u0017\u0018 3DJH\u0003\u0016\u0003RI\u0003\u0014\u0015 (page number not for citation purposes)parasite infection, direct invasion of tissues by hyphae or the action of the parasite's toxins [21], and the parasite sporulates shortly after this. Metarhizium thus has a semelparous life-history and is an 'obligate killer' [1], pro- ducing transmission stages only after host death. Suchparasites represent excellent models for studying infec- tion-growth dynamics because the rate of successful infec- tions equates exactly to host mortality, the time of host death will relate to the number of hyphal bodies withinthe host and thus acts as a gauge of within-host growth,and because the lifetime reproductive output of the para-site is represented entirely by the spores produced uponhost death in contrast to other parasites that produce transmission stages continually [1]. Yet while applied studies using Metarhizium are common, fundamental studies of its infection dynamics are rare. There is a diversity of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae strains near leaf-cutting ant nests in Panama [41], indicating the potential for within-host competition between multiple parasite genotypes. We established and compared the dynamics of within-host competition in this system at twolevels. We first investigated competition between parasites of the same genotype by establishing whether the infec-tion rate of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae adhered to the mass action principle and whether parasite growth and fit- ness was density-dependent. We then examined whether the infection dynamics were consistent between differentstrains of parasite, and how the dynamics were affected byintraspecific within-host competition involving multipleparasite genotypes. We used two Panamanian strains thathad had the opportunity to coevolve with A. echinatior and one exotic strain that had never previously encoun-tered the host. A number of studies suggest that exoticstrains are less competitive during within-host interac-tions than are native strains that have coevolved with the host [43-48]. We define parasite virulence to be parasite-induced host mortality as measured by case mortality and time-of-death. This differs from the instantaneous mortal- ity rate used in many models but has been argued to be amore suitable measure of virulence [49]. Note thatbecause the ant hosts were adult individuals that do notgrow any further, the potential advantage to an obligate killer parasite of delaying host death to allow further host growth before semelparous reproduction [1], will not apply in this system. Results Experiment 1: intra-strain competition The dose of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae spores applied had a significant effect on ant mortality (Wald =131.1, d.f. = 10, P < 0.0001) (Figure 1). The colony of ori- gin did not affect either the dose-response relationship(Wald = 13.2, d.f. = 10, P = 0.213) or mortality overall(Wald = 1.56, d.f. = 1, P = 0.212). The mortality caused bythe lowest two doses did not differ significantly from that in the controls (Figure 1). There was also no significant difference in mortality between the highest three doses because mortality was close to 100% at all these doses.The dose-mortality relationship consequently followed asigmoidal pattern (F 3,7 = 162.5, P < 0.0001; Figure 2a). There was no effect of the time between death and theassessment of spore production upon either the propor- tion of sporulating (Wald = 1.97, d.f. = 1, P =0.16) nor the number of spores produced (F 1,127 = 1.13, P = 0.289). This supports the assumption that sporulation was complete at the time of assessment and also indicates that parasites that took longer to kill their host did not produce more spores. The proportions of cadavers sporu- lating were significantly less than expected based upon thenumber of ants estimated (from the control data) to havedied from other causes (F 1,17 = 8.55, P = 0.0095). This indicates that certain ants killed by Metarhizium failed to sporulate. Both the proportion of ant cadavers sporulating (Wald = 19.4, d.f. = 9, P = 0.022) and the mean number of spores produced per sporulating cadaver (F9,127 = 1.97, P = 0.048) increased significantly with dose (Figures 2band 2c). However the increase in spore production was relatively small, only doubling over the full range of dosesexamined. When the spore numbers produced were used to calculate k-values (which assess the density-depend- ence of growth, with a zero value indicating that spore production increases proportionally to dose and positivevalues indicating spore production is less than propor-tional to dose), it was found that k increased significantly with dose (F 1,9 = 231.1, P < 0.0001; Figure 2d). The slope of the relationship (0.8) was significantly less than 1 (t =2.42, d.f. = 8, P = 0.042). Correspondingly, the per capitafitness of the parasite decreased linearly with dose, while,in contrast, the probability of infection (calculated by multiplying the probability of death by the probability ofa cadaver sporulating) increased sigmoidally (Figure 2e). By multiplying these two variables, the overall fitness of the parasite can be calculated, and can be seen to decreasemore or less linearly with dose (Figure 2f). Experiment 2: inter-strain competition Ant survival was affected significantly by the concentra-tion of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae spores (Wald = 186.0, d.f. = 5, P < 0.0001), the strain (Wald = 9.42, d.f. = 3, P =0.024), and also the colony of origin (Wald = 13.5, d.f. =4, P = 0.009). There were no significant interactionsbetween strain and concentration (Wald = 11.8, d.f. = 15,P = 0.681). Mortality was generally positively correlatedwith dose, although the significance of pairwise differ- ences between doses did vary somewhat between strains (Figure 3). In none of the strains was there any differencein survival between the lowest two doses, and, with theexception of strain 02-73, there was also no difference inBMC Biology \u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017\u000f\u0003 4 \u0017\u0018 KWWS \u0012\u0012ZZZ\u0011ELRPHGFHQWUDO\u0011FRP\u0012\u0014\u0017\u001a\u0014\u0010\u0015\u0014\u0017\u001b\u0012\u0017\u0012\u0017\u0018 3DJH\u0003\u0017\u0003RI\u0003\u0014\u0015 (page number not for citation purposes)survival between the highest two doses. Overall, ant sur- vival was greatest when treated with the allopatric Ma275strain, followed by the 02-73 strain (obtained from a soil sample at the collection site), from which it did not differ significantly (Breslow statistic = 2.45, d.f. = 1, P = 0.118).Survival of ants treated with Ma275 was significantly greater than of those treated with either the 02-72 strain (obtained from an Atta worker) (Breslow statistic = 8.36, d.f. = 1, P = 0.004) or the mixture of all three isolates(Breslow statistic = 5.00, d.f. = 1, P = 0.025) (Figure 3). The survival distributions of ants treated with the different strains did not otherwise differ significantly (02-72 vs.mixture: Breslow statistic = 0.84, 02-73 vs. mixture: Breslow statistic = 0.26, 02-72 vs. 02-73: Breslow statistic = 2.04, d.f. = P =0.153). Although the proportion of ant cadavers sporulating was consistently high (>80%) in strain 02-73 and was posi- tively correlated with dose in the other strains (Figure 4a), the interaction between strain and dose was nonsignifi-cant (Wald = 8.92, d.f. = 15, P = 0.882), as were both themain effects (strain: Wald = 2.81, d.f. = 3, P = 0.422; dose:Wald = 5.49, 5, P = 0.359). Spore production fromthe sporulating cadavers was estimated by the ranking method described. It was found to be unrelated to the lag- time between death and ranking (F 1,270 = 0.489, P = 0.485) and to increase slightly with dose in all treatments(F 5,270 = 2.42, P = 0.036; Figure 4b). The relationship between spore production and dose did not differbetween strains (F 14,270 = 1.12, P = 0.342) and the strains also did not differ overall (F3,270 = 0.19, P = 0.903). The k- values for all three strains were positively correlated withthe number of spores applied (F 1,15 = 3612.9, P < 0.0001) and had similar slopes (F3,15 = 0.78, P = 0.523; Figure 4c). The values for Ma275, though, were significantly lower than for the other strains (F3,15 = 13.71, P = 0.0001). Discussion Parasite virulence, as measured by host mortality, was found to show a clear density-dependent pattern. This hasalso been recorded previously in Metarhizium [e.g. [50- 53]] and other parasites [6,7,54]. Rather than being a lin-ear relationship though, the pattern was sigmoidal. Mor- tality was not increased significantly by further increases in dose beyond 1 \u00d7 10 7 spores per ml.

All parasite-induced mortality was expected to have occurred by twenty days after treatment,even at the lower doses, and this assumption was sup- ported by the levelling out of mortality seen in both exper- iments. It follows from this that the infection rate ofMetarhizium is directly represented by the host mortality rate after twenty days. The lack of a difference in mortality between ants treated with the two lowest doses and the control ants suggests the occurrence of an Allee effect,with an invasion threshold for infection to be successful [54]. Such an effect has also been evidenced in some otherstudies of Metarhizium [e.g. [50,53]], and is a subtle effect that will only be detected when a sufficient range of doses is tested. Many models of host-parasite dynamics are based upon the mass-action principle, under which theinfection rate is a linear function of the density of para- sites a host individual encounters [3]. The sigmoidal pat-tern observed in the Metarhizium -Acromyrmex system indicates that, here at least, this principle applies only at intermediate doses. The Allee effect most probably relates to the effectiveness of the host defences against parasites. Leaf-cutting antdefences, as with most insects, consist of 'first-line'defences involving grooming and the secretion of antibi- otic compounds on to the cuticle, and 'second line' defences based upon the cellular and humoral immune responses [37,40,55-58]. Spores will interact independ-ently with the first line defences, the immune responsemay be saturated if it has to defend against very high num-bers of parasites. This effect will be exacerbated by the tox-ins that the hyphae of many Metarhizium strains produce to incapacitate the immune system [19,21,22,59]. Greaterdoses of infecting spores will more quickly produce alarger pool of mycelium, which will produce greater quantities of these toxins and thus make the immuneSurvival of ants in Experiment 2 treated with either Metarhizium anisopliae var Figure 3 Survival of ants in Experiment 2 treated with either Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae isolate (a) KVL 02-73, (b) KVL 02-72, (c) Ma275 or (d) a mixture of all three.

Neither the probability of a cadaver sporulating nor the number of spores it produced were related to the time ofhost death, indicating both that parasites did not gainincreased spore production by taking longer to kill the host, and that spore production was complete at the time of assessment. Both spore production and the proportionof cadavers sporulating were positively correlated with thewithin-host density of the parasite. However, the effi-ciency of the conversion of host biomass into parasitepropagules was negatively density-dependent, as demonstrated by the k-values. The number of spores pro- duced was less than proportional to increases in the doseof parasites applied, indicating the occurrence of density- dependent parasite growth and within-host competition. Although this competition was between genetically iden-tical parasites in the first experiment, it still resulted in areduction in parasite fitness because of the less efficient use of host resources. Were spore production to be unaf- fected by, or even inversely related to dose, as found in astudy with Beauveria [60], then this negative effect on fit- ness would be even greater. It is important to note that this is based only upon the cadavers that sporulated. As both the proportion of cadav- ers that sporulated and the number of ants that diedincreased with dose, there is a trade-off for the parasite(Figure 2e). Higher doses will result in more hosts dying and producing parasite spores, but where cadavers dosporulate, the per capita spore production will decrease as dose increases. Interestingly, this trade-off resolves itself such that increases in dose always result in a decrease infitness (Figure 2f). Although low numbers of parasitespores have only a small chance of successfully infecting a host, the strong effect of within-host competition makesdispersal the best strategy. This is even without taking into account the probability of at least one spore encountering a host, which will also be substantially increased by sporesdispersing (and thus having multiple chances to encoun-ter a host per unit time), rather than staying in a singleaggregation (and having only a single chance per unit time to encounter a host). In other studies of obligate killer parasites, even stronger effects of within-host com- petition between propagules of the same parasite clone have been found [7,60]. It therefore seems likely thatthese dynamics may be broadly similar for most semelpa-rous, obligate killer parasites, and that maximum disper-sal is the best strategy for these parasites, as well as any others that exhibit strong within-host competition. When the different strains of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae were compared in the second experiment, they were found to differ in their virulence. Interestingly, it was theexotic strain (Ma275), originating from a different geo- graphical location and from a different host order (Lepi- doptera) that had the lowest virulence, and the strainisolated from a leaf-cutting ant worker (KVL 02-72) that had the highest. Many studies have found Metarhizium strains to vary in virulence [e.g. [53,61]]. Differences in strain virulence may in part be due to the variation in the production of destruxins that occurs between strains, but other virulence factors are undoubtedly also important[59]. As virulence is defined here as parasite-induced hostmortality, the differences between strains could also bedue to differences in the proportions of spores germinat-ing and penetrating into the host rather than differences in within-host growth [62,63]. Although all strains had similarly high germination rates on artificial media, theinteraction with host cuticle is more complex and involvesvarious antibiotic compounds such as those produced bythe metapleural gland [56,64,65]. Differences betweenstrains in their susceptibility to such compounds wouldseem quite likely. Aside from the differences in virulence, however, the strains did not otherwise differ in their infec- tion dynamics. They showed similar spore production and identical density-dependent growth patterns. Thedynamics described above therefore appear to be consist- ent across strains, at least for those tested here. A fundamental assumption of most models of host-para- site relationships is that within-host competition is moreintense, and results in heightened virulence, when it involves more than one parasite genotype [8-10]. How- ever, in experimental studies virulence has often beenfound to be unaffected by parasite heterogeneity [24]. This was also the case in the current study, in which the virulence of the mixed infection was the same as that ofthe most virulent strain in the infection. In addition, theparasite k-value vs. dose relationship was identical for the mixed and single infections, indicating that the density-dependent growth patterns were unaffected by host heterogeneity. There are two possible explanations for the results. The most parsimonious is that the most virulent strain in the mixed infections simply outcompeted the other strains and drove them to extinction within the host. Such super-infection dynamics have previously been suggested for Metarhizium and other entomopathogenic fungi [32,66,67] and would be in accord with some models [6]. However other studies have found mixed infections toproduce transmission stages from more than one strain of parasite in spite of the overall virulence matching that of the most virulent strain [29,31]. It remains possible that the mixed infections in the current study did not involve any of the strains being competitively excluded and thatthe spores produced came from all the strains. To distin-guish between these possibilities it would be necessary toBMC Evolutionary \u0003\u0015\u0013\u0013\u0017\u000f\u0003 4 \u0017\u0018 monospore cultures from the sporu- lating cadavers, something would be an interesting objec- tive for future work. Importantly, the infection dynamics did not differ between the single and mixed infections. The occurrence of within-host competition, whether it involves the pro- duction of antagonistic compounds or is mediated by the host's immune system, might be expected to forceparasites to divert some resources from growth and theproduction of transmission stages to producing or copingwith competitive mechanisms. While there is some evi-dence for this [31], the production of transmission stages has been increased during mixed infections in many other studies [26-28,30]. Clearly the outcome will depend uponthe particular genotypes involved. If different strains pro- duce antagonistic compounds that are effective against one another, as in the study by Massey et al. [17], thenreduced transmission stages can be expected. If they donot, and if they exploit different within-host niches, pro- duce cooperative compounds (such as iron-binding agents [13,14]), or act synergistically to depress the hostimmune system, then increased transmission stages can be expected. The fact that spore production was the samein single and mixed infections in the current study there- fore suggests either that the most virulent strain outcom- peted the others without suffering any cost from the competitive interaction, or that the Metarhizium strains were engaged in scramble competition with dynamicsthat are impervious to interactions being inter- or intraclone. Conclusions The importance of within-host competition between par- asites is well illustrated by the Metarhizium-Acromyrmex system studied here. Even though the probability of a suc-cessful infection was increased substantially by parasitesoccurring in aggregations, the effect of competition between parasite propagules of the same clone makes dis- persal the best strategy. It seems likely that this is generallytrue for semelparous parasites. Further investigations ofthe impact of within-host competition on parasite fitnessare needed and should endeavour to establish where on the superinfection-coinfection continuum the interaction lies by identifying which parasites produce transmission stages. The fact that the production of transmission stages of semelparous parasites, such as Metarhizium, is concen- trated into a single bout, and thus that their lifetime fit-ness can be readily quantified, makes them excellent models for doing this. Methods General methodology Colonies of A. echinatior were collected from Gamboa, Panama, and maintained in the lab under controlled con-ditions (ca. 24\u00b0C, 70% RH) on a diet of bramble leaves (Rubus fruticosus ) and rice grains. For the experimental replicates, large workers (head width 2.1 to 2.4 mm) were removed from their colonies and placed individually in plastic pots (diameter: 2.5 cm, height: 4 cm) where they were maintained at 24\u00b0C with an ad libitum supply ofwater and sugar water. A number of isolates of M. anisop- liae var. anisopliae were collected from the vicinity of leaf- cutting ant nests at the same location in Gamboa, Pan-ama, and were cultured mature spores with asterile solution of 0.05% Triton-X and scraping off the spores with a glass rod. The spores were centrifuged and washed three times with sterile 0.05% Triton-X solutionwith intervening centrifugation steps. The concentration of spores was then quantified using a haemocytometer and diluted to the required concentration. The viability ofthe spore suspensions was checked by spreading 100 Pl of them on to Sabouraud dextrose agar plates and counting the proportions of spores that had germinated after 12-16 hours at 24\u00b0C. Spore viability was >95% in all cases. Ants were treated with M. anisopliae var. anisopliae by applying 0.5 P l of a spore suspension to their thorax using a micropipette. Spore suspensions were vortexed thor- oughly immediately prior to application to ensure spores were fully dispersed. Control ants had 0.5 P l of a 0.05% Triton-X solution applied in the same way. Following application, ant mortality was assessed daily for a periodof twenty days. Based on previous work [23,40,56], this time period was judged sufficient to ensure that all para- site-induced mortality had occurred by the end of the experiment. Dead ants were surface sterilised [68], andplaced in a petri dish lined with damp filter paper. Afterthe completion of the experiments, the cadavers were left for a further ten days in order to allow full sporulation of the parasite. The level of sporulation on the cadavers was then assessed by one of two methods. In Experiment 1, sporulation was quantified by directly counting thenumber of spores on the cadavers. The cadavers wereplaced in individual vials with 1 ml of 0.05% Triton-Xsolution and vortexed for 1 min to remove the spores intosuspension. The concentration of spores in the suspen-sion was then quantified with a haemocytometer. In Experiment 2, sporulation was estimated by examining the cadavers under a binocular microscope and givingeach a rank of between 0 (no spores visible) and 10(cadaver almost completely covered by spores) depending upon the level of sporulation. Based on data collected prior to these experiments, spore ranks estimated in this manner correlate well with the actual number of spores on the cadavers ( y = 0.159 x - 0.862, r 2 = 0.746, Spearman's r = 0.820, N = 73, P < 0.01) and thus provide a reliableestimate of spore production.BMC not for purposes)Experiment competition The experiment involved M. anisopliae var. anisopliae iso- late KVL 02-56, which had been isolated from the dump pile of an Atta colombica nest in Gamboa, Panama [41]. A spore suspension was made up and serially diluted five-fold to give concentrations from 1 \u00d7 10 8 to 5 \u00d7 103 spores ml-1 (equivalent to an average of 50,000 and 2.5 spores per ant respectively). Given that soil at the site in Panamahas been estimated to contain as many as 1,000 to 50,000spores g -1 [41], it seems likely that this range encompasses the natural doses that the ants are exposed to. Thirty antsfrom each of two colonies of A. echinatior (Ae47 and Ae109) were treated with each of these doses, or with the control solution, and their survival monitored for twenty days after application. The effect of dose and colony oforigin on ant mortality was analysed with a Cox propor-tional hazard regression model to examine the effect ofparasite density (dose) on virulence and infection rate.This incorporates both case mortality and the time ofdeath. Pairwise comparisons of the doses were done using Kaplan-Meir survival analyses and the Breslow statistic. The ant cadavers were left for ten days after the end of theexperimental period, in order to allow ample time for allcadavers to sporulate fully. The numbers of cadavers sporulating and the numbers of spores produced by these cadavers were assessed with binary logistic and general linear models respectively. These data were used to calcu- late k-values to assess whether parasite growth was density dependent, as done previously by Ebert et al. [7]: k i = log10 (M0 Di / Mi D0) where ki is the k-value at dose i, M is the number of spores produced, D is the number of spores applied, and M0 and D0 represent the number of spores produced and applied respectively at the lowest dose tested. A zero value for k indicates that the number of spores produced at dose i are exactly proportional to the increased dose (so, for exam- ple, a doubling of dose results in a doubling of the number of spores produced). The equation gives a posi- tive value for k when the number of spores produced at dose i are less than proportional to the increase in dose. Zero values for k thus indicate that spore production is independent of parasite density, while positive values of k indicate that spore production is negatively density dependent. Experiment 2: inter-strain competition To establish whether the dynamics recorded in the first experiment were consistent for different strains of the par-asite, three isolates of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae were compared. These were KVL 02-73 (isolated from soil atthe field site from which the ant colonies were collected), KVL 02-72 (isolated from an Atta colombica leaf-cutting ant worker), and the strain Ma275 (isolated from Cydiapomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Germany). The strains therefore represented a range in terms of theirpotential coevolution with A. echinatior , with the former two being likely to have had some interaction while Ma275 would not previously have encountered A. echina- tior. Each strain was diluted tenfold and tested at six doses from 5 \u00d7 10 8 to 5 \u00d7 103 spores ml-1. In addition, a mixed spore suspension was made up to examine inter-strain competition. The suspension contained equal numbers ofspores of each of the three strains. This was serially diluted and applied at the same doses as the individual isolates. Four ants from each of five colonies of A. echinatior (Ae48, 109, 143, 153 and 154) were treated with each dose of each isolate or with the control solution and their survival monitored for twenty days. The survival of the ants wasanalysed as in the preceding experiment to examine ifstrains differed in virulence and if the growth of eachstrain was density-dependent. Ten days after the end ofthe experimental period, spore production was assessedby ranking each cadaver for the amount of sporulation as described earlier. These ranks were used to estimate the actual number of spores produced and these values werethen used to calculate k-values. A regression analysis was carried out on these data in order to assess if the growth ofeach strain was density-dependent and whether the den-sity-growth dynamics differed between strains.

Ladybird beetles were divided into three groups and provided corn earworm eggs until control mortality exceeded 20%. The corn earworm eggs were untreated, treated with the inactive test substance or treated with the test substance. There was no significant difference between groups for the amount of eggs consumed. On Day 3, mortality for the group that consumed corn earworm eggs treated with the inactive test substance was significantly greater than the group that consumed untreated eggs. There were no other significant differences in mortality between groups for the remainder of the study. Bioterra ( Beauveria bassiana) was determined to be safe to administer to ladybird beetles at ten times the field application rate. ,1752'8&7,21\u0003 The objective of this study was to assess the acute toxicity potential of the test substance, Bioterra (Beauveria bassiana ), when administered to adult ladybird beetles in accordance with US EPA OCSPP 885.4340, which is intended to meet testing requirements of FIFRA 7 USC 136, et seq , and TSCA 2601. This study was conducted for Anatis Bioprotection according to the approved protocol and STILLMEADOW, Inc. SOPs. There we re no deviations from the protoc ol that affected the qua lity or outcome of the study. The protocol, raw data, this report and a sample of test substance are archived at STILLMEADOW, Inc.

With a field application rate of 400 mg/L of water of active ingredient (that is the equivalent to the 2 g/L of water for the formulated product), the 10X dose would be 4 g/L of water of active ingredient. An aliquot (0.4 g) of test substance was brought to 100 mL volume with deionized water (DI H 2O) and two drops of Tween 20 (Mfg: Spectrum, Lot: WP0135, Exp: Jan 2015) were added. The inactive test substance was rendered nonviable by autoclaving and administered in an amount equivalent to that of the test substance. Test Substance Administration Ladybird beetles were divided randomly into three groups. Each group consisted of fifty insects per container and there were three replicates per group. Group I - Untreated received untreated corn earworm eggs. Group II - Inactive received eggs treated with the inactive test substance. Group III - Bioterra received corn earworm eggs that had been treated by spraying the test substance over the eggs at 10X the field application rate. Observations The insects were observed daily for signs of pathogenicity, toxicity or mortality until mortality in Group I - Untreated exceeded 20%. Observations were inadvertently continued two days past that point. Total egg consumption was recorded on Day 3, 6 and 11 in one replicate per treatment.15017-11 Page 8 of 14 67,//0($'2:\u000f\u0003,QF\u0011\u0003352&('85(6 (cont.)
