Pediatricians are encouraged to vaccinate at every opportunity even if that means that practices may need to discard a partial vial if not completely used. Below are common questions and answers related to implementation of COVID-19 vaccine in your practice. Upcoming Commercialization of COVID-19 Vaccines When is COVID vaccine being commercialized? How should I prepare? COVID vaccines will transition from government purchase to the commercial market (\"usual process\") in fall 2023. The US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a [Commercialization Transition Guide](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/HHS-Commercialization-Transition-Guide-508.pdf) to help with planning. Product Dosing and Intervals What is the recommended interval between the doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series? How can I determine what my patient needs if they already received at least one monovalent COVID-19 dose? Please see the AAP [Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Quick Reference Guide](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/COVID Vaccine Dosing_Quick Reference.pdf?_ga=2.103374976.1489851643.1681910308-1528948628.1666202708) for dosing intervals. This resource offers the dosing intervals for unvaccinated children, partially vaccination children, and children who may have completed a series, but only received monovalent doses. Pages 3-5 offer dosing information for children with moderately or severely immunocompromising conditions. Who is eligible for an updated (bivalent) dose? All children ages 6 months and older should receive at least one dose of bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. Please see the [Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Quick Reference Guide](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/COVID Vaccine Dosing_Quick Reference.pdf?_ga=2.103374976.1489851643.1681910308-1528948628.1666202708) for more information. What do I do if the wrong product or dose is given to a child or adolescent? The [CDC Interim Clinical Considerations (Appendix C)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us-appendix.html#appendix-c) includes a table that outlines interim recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine administration errors and deviations. Which Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose should a child receive if they will have a birthday between doses in their series? In general, the vaccine product and size of the dose a child gets is based on how old they are on the day that they get the COVID shot. There are [some exceptions](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_2120-DM104004&ACSTrackingLabel=Updated%20Guidance%3A%20Interim%20Clinical%20Considerations%20for%20Use%20of%20COVID-19%20Vaccines&deliveryName=USCDC_2120-DM104004%22%20%5Cl%20%22transitioning-younger-older%22%20%5Cl%20%22transitioning-younger-older#transitioning-younger-older), however. A child turning from age 4 years to 5 years between Pfizer doses should receive all three doses with Pfizer maroon cap vials (for those ages 6 months - 4 years). Children receiving Moderna vaccine who turn from age 5 years to 6 years during their 2-dose vaccine series, follow dosing recommendations based on age at the start of the vaccine series. Can you \"mix and match\" vaccine products for one child? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine and the Moderna COVID vaccine are the two products that are authorized for children ages 6 months through 12 years old. In general, children should receive the same product for all doses recommended for their age in the vaccination series. One exception is that children who received a dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at age 5 may receive either a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for their second dose. There may be additional exceptions for some children ages 5 and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. [Please see the Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Quick Reference Guide](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/COVID Vaccine Dosing_Quick Reference.pdf?_ga=2.103374976.1489851643.1681910308-1528948628.1666202708) for more details. The CDC Interim Clinical Considerations for the Use of COVID-19 Vaccines, allows for a different COVID-19 vaccine to be used in the following exceptional circumstances when FDA authorization requires that a vaccine from the same manufacturer be used. A different COVID-19 vaccine may be administered (at a minimum interval of 28 days between the first and second doses). A Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) report is not required for these exceptional situations: - Same vaccine not available - Previous dose unknown - Person would otherwise not complete the vaccination series - Person starts but unable to complete a vaccination series with the same COVID-19 vaccine due to a contraindication Additional Resources: [AAP Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Dosing Quick Reference Guide](https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/COVID Vaccine Dosing_Quick Reference.pdf?_ga=2.208869714.1175554433.1656338224-1017967269.1654107285) [CDC Transitioning from a younger to older age group](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_2120-DM104004&ACSTrackingLabel=Updated%20Guidance%3A%20Interim%20Clinical%20Considerations%20for%20Use%20of%20COVID-19%20Vaccines&deliveryName=USCDC_2120-DM104004%22%20%5Cl%20%22transitioning-younger-older%22%20%5Cl%20%22transitioning-younger-older#transitioning-younger-older) Storage and Expiry Are the storage and handling requirements for COVID-19 vaccine different from routinely recommended vaccines? Storage temperatures for COVID-19 vaccines currently approved and authorized for emergency use vary as do the length of time vaccines can be stored at those temperatures. See [COVID-19 Vaccine Storage and Expiry](/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/covid-19-vaccine-storage--expiry/) for additional information. Additionally, the [CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/index.html) includes information on best practices for storing and handling COVID-19 vaccines. How do I determine the expiration date of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? Access the expiration date by scanning the QR code located on the vaccine carton. How do I determine the expiration date of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines? The expiration date for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines is NOT printed on the vaccine vial. The date that is listed on the vial is the manufacture date, and the QR code on the vaccine vial links to the EUA fact sheet. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine expires 18 months after manufacturing if stored frozen at ultra-cold temperatures (-90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C [-130\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F]). To calculate the expiration date, add 18 months to the manufacture date including the month of manufacture. For example, if the manufacture date is March 2022 (3/22), include March as one of the 18 months; the expiration date will be August 2023 (8/31/23). The vaccine can also be stored in the refrigerator (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F) for up to 10 weeks). See [COVID-19 Vaccine Storage and Expiry](/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/covid-19-vaccine-storage--expiry/) for additional information. How do I determine the expiration date of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine? The expiration date is NOT printed on the vaccine vial or carton. To determine the expiration date, and enter the lot number printed on the carton or vial into the \" [Expiry Date Checker](https://us.novavaxcovidvaccine.com/hcp)\" tool. Vaccine Administration Can COVID-19 vaccine be co-administered with other childhood or adolescent immunizations? Yes, the AAP supports co-administration of routine childhood and adolescent immunizations with COVID-19 vaccines (or vaccination in the days before or after) for children and adolescents who are behind on or due for immunizations ( [based on the CDC/AAP Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html)) and/or at increased risk from vaccine-preventable diseases. When co-administering with other vaccines, it is recommended that a different injection site (at least 1 inch apart) be used. If co-administered with a more reactogenic vaccine (eg. Adjuvanted or high dose influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine), consider using a different limb. Is co-administration acceptable for all populations of children and adolescents, including those who are immunocompromised? Since the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines, it is expected that the safety and efficacy will be similar to other vaccines that are co-administered. [ Immunocompromising conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html%22%20%5Cl%20%22Appendix-A#vaccination-people-immunocompromised) are not contraindications to receipt of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. In general, simultaneously administered vaccines are recommended to ensure optimal age-specific protection and fewer medical visits. As with all vaccines, patients should be informed about the likely timing of potential side effects and adverse events related to each vaccine. Are there any differences or concerns with co-administration of COVID-19 vaccine with live attenuated vaccines? No. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not live vaccines and no additional safety or efficacy issues are expected with co-administration with live attenuated vaccines. Co-administration is particularly important for children and adolescents who are behind on routinely recommended vaccines because it promotes timely receipt of vaccination and reduces the number of medical visits for the patient. Can I administer a COVID-19 vaccine to a patient who is currently or was recently sick with COVID-19? COVID-19 vaccination should be deferred for patients with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection until they recover from their acute illness and the criteria to discontinue isolation has been met. Patients who are asymptomatic may receive COVID-19 vaccine following their recommended isolation period. This also applies to people who become infected with COVID-19 between recommended vaccine doses. People who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a recommended dose of COVID-19 vaccine by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if infection was asymptomatic). [Studies](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2785919) have shown that increased time between infection and vaccination may result in an improved immune response to vaccination. How do I manage adverse events related to administration of COVID-19 vaccine? Anaphylaxis has been observed following receipt of COVID-19 vaccines, but this has been rare. Consider observing people with the following medical histories for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination to monitor for allergic reactions: - Allergy-related contraindication to a different type of COVID-19 vaccine - Non-severe, [immediate (onset within 4 hours) allergic reaction](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)after a previous dose of COVID-19 vaccine. - Anaphylaxis after non-COVID-19 vaccines or injectable therapies Patients should be seated or lying down during vaccinations, as syncope (fainting) may occur, as with any vaccine - especially in adolescents. Consider observing vaccine recipients - particularly adolescents - for 15 minutes after vaccination. If syncope develops, patients should be observed until symptoms resolve. Pediatricians and their teams should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of immediate-type allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and have the resources and skills to address these events at the time of vaccine administration. Healthcare providers who administer COVID-19 vaccines are required by law to report to VAERS: - Any adverse event (AE) listed in the [VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination](https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf)that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination - Any AE listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine - Vaccine administration errors, whether or not associated with an AE - Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome - Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Healthcare providers who administer COVID-19 vaccines are encouraged to report: - Any additional clinically significant AEs following vaccination, even if they are not sure whether the vaccine caused the event - Additional selected AEs and/or any revised safety reporting requirements per FDA's conditions of authorized use of vaccine(s) throughout the duration of any COVID-19 vaccine's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or any approved COVID-19 vaccine as outlined in [the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization) Information on how to report adverse events following vaccination can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/hcproviders/reportingadverseevents.html). A video overview of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and how to use it can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9bXB3R2qP8). Also consider explaining the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following receipt of Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, especially to males ages 12-39 years. Counseling should include the need to seek care if [symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html) develop after vaccination, particularly in the week after vaccination. See [CDC COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#myocarditis-pericarditis). Resources [Immunize.org Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens in a Community Setting](https://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf) [Interim Considerations: Preparing for the Potential Management of Anaphylaxis COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html) [Myocarditis and Pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html) Vaccine Coding and Payment Which CPT codes should I use? Will I get paid for vaccine administration? There are unique codes for each dose of each vaccine product. A full listing can be found at [COVID-19 Vaccine Administration: Getting Paid](/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/covid-19-vaccine-administration-getting-paid/). With new vaccine products or new vaccine recommendations, there may be a delay in CPT codes being valued and loaded into payer systems. As a result, practices might consider confirming that payers have updated their payment systems prior to submitting claims. Talking to Families How can pediatricians build trust with families who may express vaccine hesitancy? Parents and caregivers trust pediatricians. Pediatricians should listen to families' questions, take the information, and provide clear, consistent information. They should state what is currently known and unknown. They should not overemphasize \"potentials\" - neither potential risks nor potential benefits. More information on how to communicate effectively can be found at [Communicating with Families and Promoting Vaccine Confidence](/en/patient-care/immunizations/communicating-with-families-and-promoting-vaccine-confidence/). Pediatricians can also utilize resources in the [AAP COVID-19 Vaccine Communications Toolkit ](/en/news-room/campaigns-and-toolkits/covid-19-vaccine-toolkit/)to promote vaccine confidence. Consider ways that patients and families in your practice like to receive information and use these mechanisms to debunk common myths and answer frequently asked questions. [Strategies For Building Covid-19 Vaccine Confidence | The National Academies Press (nap.edu)](https://www.nap.edu/resource/26068/interactive/index.html) Do children and adolescents need special consent or assent to receive COVID-19 vaccines? State and/or local laws determine who is able to consent or assent for COVID-19 vaccines; the same as other vaccines. In most places and instances, a parent's consent is required for a child or adolescent to receive a vaccine. While this may not always require a signature, you may consider obtaining one for COVID-19 vaccines. Health care providers administering the vaccine should inform vaccine recipients of the following: (1) FDA has authorized emergency use of the vaccine in children under 12 years of age (2) known and potential risks and benefits related to emergency use (3) that they have the option to accept or refuse the product and (4) be informed of any available alternatives to the product and their known risks and benefits. Each recipient should receive a fact sheet that includes essential information about the vaccine. The fact sheets for health care professionals administering the vaccine as well as recipients were approved as part of the authorization and are available from the [FDA website](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/comirnaty-and-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine#additional). Vaccine Requirements Can my practice require staff to receive COVID-19 vaccine? Some practice employers want to know if they can require their staff to receive COVID-19 vaccine. The best resource for practices may be the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which provides guidance [here](https://info.bracewell.com/40/1129/uploads/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-the-ada--the-rehabilitation-act-....pdf) (see Section K on Vaccinations). The EEOC indicates that while employers may mandate COVID-19 vaccinations, this is subject to limitations. The [Health Action Alliance](https://www.healthaction.org/reopening-questions#1) has resources and an interactive decision tool to help determine if COVID-19 vaccine requirements are right for your workplace.
