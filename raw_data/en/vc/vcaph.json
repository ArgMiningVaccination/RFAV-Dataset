These findings are a critical suppl ement to the Ozaukee County Community Health Survey conducted through a partners hip between the Washington Ozaukee Public Health Department, Ascension Wisconsin, Aurora Health Care, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin . The Community Health Needs Assessment incorporates input from persons representing the broad interests o f the community served, and from those who possess special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Key informants in Ozaukee County were identified by the Washington Ozaukee Public Health Department, Ascension Wisconsin, Aurora Health Care, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, and Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin . These organizations also invited the informants to participate and conducted the interviews fr om June to September 2019 . The interviewers used a standard interview script that included the following elements: Ranking of up to five public health issues, based on the focus areas presented in Wisconsin's State Health Plan, tha t are the most important issues for the County; and For those five public health issues: o Existing strategies to address the issue o Barriers and challenges to addressing the issue o Additional strategies needed o Key groups in the community that hospitals shou ld partner with to improve community health o Identif ication of subgroups or subpopulations where efforts could be targeted o Ways efforts can be targeted toward each subgroup or subpopulation All informants were made aware that participation was voluntary and that responses would be shared with the Center for Urban Population Health for analysis and reporting. Based on the summaries provided to the Center for Urban Population Health, this report presents the results of the 2019 key informant interviews for Ozaukee County. The report first presents a summary of the health issue rankings, including a list of the five issues which were ranked most frequently by respondents. The next section describes the themes that presented themselves across the top ranked hea lth topics. Finally, summaries of the strategies, b arriers, partners, and potential targeted subpopulations described by participants are provided as well . 2 Limitations : Twenty -six key informant interviews were conducted with 29 respondents in Ozaukee Coun ty. Some interviews incorporated the views of more than one person from an agency or organization. The report relies on the opinions and experiences of a limited number of experts identified as having the community's pulse. However, responses may not be re presentative of the overall perception of community strengths and needs. It is possible that the results would have been substantially different if a different set of informants had been interviewed. Results should be interpreted with caution and in conjun ction with other Ozaukee County data (e.g., communi ty health survey and secondary data reports). A. Focus Area Ranking In 26 interviews, a total of 29 key informants were asked to rank up to 5 of the major health -related issues in their county from a list o f 15 focus areas identified in the State Health Plan. (See Appendix A for the full list of informants ). Key informants were also able to write in other health issue areas if they believed they were top health issue s for the county. The table below presents the results, including a summary of the number of times an issue was mentioned as a top five health issue, and the number of times an informant ranked the issue as the most important health issue. Importantly, not every informant ranked five issues , not every informant provided rankings within their top selections , and not every key informant discussed all of the iss ues they rated in their top five . In interviews with more than one participant, only one set of rankings was provided. The results in the table below reflect the 26 rankings . Key Informant Rankings Health Focus Area Top 5 Number 1 Mental Health 22 14 Substance Use & Abuse 19 4 Access to Health Care 12 2 Alcohol Abuse 10 2 Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) 6 2 Oral Health 6 1 Nutrition 6 0 Chronic Disease 5 1 Tobacco Use and Exposure 4 0 Reproductive and Sexu al Health 3 0 Injury and Violence 3 0 Physical Activity 3 0 Healthy Growth and Development 2 0 Communicable Disease 1 0 Environmental and Occupational Health 0 0 3 Three key informants wrote in and ranked among their top five these other health issues : obesity, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and middle and high school aged adolescents' \"mental health, stress and anxiety, social acceptance, and risks of impulsivity.\" Each of these received only one vote, and none were ranked as the respondent's top h ealth issue for the county. B. Top Five Health Issues The five health issu es ranked most consistently as top five health issue s for the County were: 1. Mental Health 2. Substance Use & Abuse 3. Access to Health Care 4. Alcohol Abuse 5. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Summaries of themes for each issue are presented below in the order listed in the table above . As a guide, issues ranked as the top five priorities for Ozaukee County a re marked with this thermometer symbol: C. General Themes It is important to not e that since the last release of this report in 2016 , the report has changed slightly. In 2016, the rankin gs and per spectives of 17 key informants were included in the repo rt, compared to 29 key inf ormants in 2019. The five top -ranked health focus areas have rem ained sim ilar, though the re are a few changes. In 2016, th e top issues were : 1. Alcohol and Other Drug Use, 2. Mental Health, 3. Chronic Disease Prevention and Management, 4. Access to Health Services, and 5. Nutrition . In 2019, Alcohol and Subst ance U se and Abuse were separated into two different health focus areas, though both remained ranked in among the top five, as did Mental Health and Access to Health Care . Adverse Childhood Experiences was added to the li st of health focus ar eas for the 2019 report , and emerged a s a top health priority for participants. In 2019, Nutrition and Chroni c Disease were ranked seventh and eigh th respectively. Some general themes emerged across health issue areas in 2019. Access to health care and to services was a cross -cutting them e related to almost every other health focus area, but e specially Mental Health, Substance Use and Abuse, Alcohol Abuse, Nutrition, and Oral Health . Th ough the county has many great providers and services, it is clear that not everyone has the opportunity to utilize them. Common issue s related to access are lack of transportation to get to services , lack of affordable options, insurance -related barriers ( e.g., low Me dicaid reimbursement for certain services , people cannot afford 4 co-payments or high deductibles), lack of appointments outside of traditional office hours, waiting lists to access services, and services that are not accessible for people with di sabilities or those who do not speak English. Across health issues it was also noted that the northern part of the county has fewer services than ot her par ts of the county. Across health focus areas, key informant s frequently named children and youth as a subgroup that may benef it from target ed efforts. T his also highlights the importance of schools and school districts in reachi ng chil dren and their families with education about a variety of health topics. It was also noted that children are und erserved in some health areas . For example, there is a shortage of child psychiatrists to manage mental health conditions and illnesses. Older a dults were also frequently named as a population that may need special attention. This is a growing segment of the population and key informants noted the need fo r more geriatricians and specialty care providers for older adults, a focus on Medicare and supplemental insurance coverag e, and the opportunity for senior centers, senior living sites, and the Aging and Disability Resource Center to focus on the needs of th is population. Finally, people with disabilities were mentioned as a subgroup requiring specific attention across health focus areas. Key i nformants noted the importan ce of making sure everything from exercise and coo king classes to dental appointme nts are accessible to children and adults with disabilities , including invisible disabilities and sensory issues. Across health focus areas, key informants mentio ned many partners across sec tors who ar e working to improve the county 's health , from school districts and law enforcement , to county agencies and business partners. Key inf ormants mentioned many strong, s uccessful collaborations and coalitions working on multiple health focus areas . Informants al so noted the need to keep working on collaborati ng more , strengthen ing and sustaining partnerships and coll aborations, and understanding what other organizations or sectors are doing to avoid duplicating services or competing for scar ce resources . D. Issue Summaries Mental Heal th Twenty -two key informants ' interview rankings included Mental Health as a top five health issue , and 14 of these ranked it as the top health focus area for Ozaukee County. Existing Strategies: Key informants noted there are a lot o f good service providers and resources in the county. Places like COPE, Just Listen, JCC Mequon, Ozaukee Family Ser vices, Ozaukee Community Thera pies, and N AMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) Ozaukee County were named as important resources in the county. In schools, there are social -emotional coaches , meetings with students to 5 provide referrals to outside counseling, and relational aggression and suicide prevention. One key informant explained that INVEST Mental Health is a com munity -based coalition in Ozaukee County comprised of multiple community partners who are working to improve ment al health in the community. The coalition launched \"Cultivate \" which is a movement to make communitie s more mental h ealth friendly. Port Washington and Saukville serve as the pilot communities for Cultivate. Several activities have be en underway including: Cultivate W ellness in Our Parks \u2014a six-week wellness program to promote physical and mental wellness, a community de pression screening, Change Direction - a marketing campaign to raise awareness of mental health issues, Cultivate Mental Wellness, a community conversation seri es focused on mental health, and mental health trainings including Cris is Interven tion Training ( CIT) training for law enforcement . They also explained that the Port Washington - Sauk ville School District has demon strated a commitment to mental health by providing a full -time psychologist in each school and perfor ming mental health screeni ngs with students to determine appropriate treatment and sup port , and Ozaukee Community Therapies will have 25 school -based mental health clinics in the fall of 2019. The health department also utilize s the sup port of UW - Milwaukee nursing studen ts to help crea te marketing and content for the Cul tivate website. One key informant n oted that Ozaukee Count y's non-profits that focus on mental health do a great job with minimal resources . Another key informant talked about Mental Health First Aid wi thin schools , noting a goal to train all employees and has been rec eiving requests to present at state and national conferences. NAMI provides families with advocacy, education, and support . Ozaukee County Human Services offer s crisis counselors . On Cente r serves as a drop -in safe spac e. Barriers and Challenges: Key informants named some barriers and challenges to improving ment al health such as lack of health insurance or low reimbursement rates, high deductibles, and co -payments , a lack of access to services and ap pointments outside of traditional business hours, long wait ing list s to see some types of providers, and some families are reluctant t o take referrals for thei r chil dren to mental health services or seek services themselves because of the stigma or negative perception of mental health issues . There is a general lack of knowledge about mental health issues and mental illness , and people may u nderstand one illness but not have any knowledge of other illnesses or issues. Sometimes people are pressured to take medications without exploring other options or complementary treatments. On a structural level, lack of funding was named a s a challenge. For example , one key i nformant noted the health department has very lim ited funds to support the work of its coalitions . Community -based organizations and non -profi t service providers also struggle in this area. Many organizations continue to work in silos through out the county and are not fully aware of what others are doing. INVEST Mental Health coalition is making efforts to identify c ommunity resource s for mental health , but is challenged by the lack of transp aren cy and responsiveness of some partners . Additionally, t here are no inpatient facilities in Ozaukee County. One key informant noted that m any services seem to be driven by cost, not necessarily by need. The lack of resources significantly hinders peopl es' abilities to find mental health services. Needed Strategies: Key informa nts recommended making resources av ailable at times outside of conventional business hours , provi ding more education for health care providers about resources in the 6 community and a list to refer to , providing parent education, implementing a s tigma -reduction campaign , increasing awareness of resources in the community, increasin g funding to the county to work on mental healt h and related issues and sustain current work , working with colleagues to increase the number of people going to school to become mental health providers and attracting them to work in the county , hosting communi ty conversations to decrease stigma and increase awareness, investing in earlier i dentification , intervention , and prevention at younger ages , investing in peer -to-peer trai ning, develop ing an overa ll behavioral health strategy for the cou nty, and build ing community cap acity to implement such a strategy . The health depa rtmen t would like to expand the Culti vate initiative in o ther communities, but additional staff may be required to make this possible. It is also important for this initiative and any other initiatives to be co -led by community partners . Community par tners should do better to engage with and learn from one another in order to avoi d du plication of services. There are some very strong collaborations in the community, but more collaboration is always needed. Community partners should work together to identify strategies that wi ll contribute to systems change, rather than one -time programming that has min imal impact. Key informants also suggested more Crisis Intervention Training . Focus more attention on senior citizens a nd their struggles as they age and have medical issues , lon eliness, isolation, and loss of indepen dence . Hire more geriatricians who work in mental health . Advocate for legis lation that allows license d professional coun selors to bill Medica re. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health systems , hospitals, health care provid ers, mental health providers , community org anizations like Just Listen , Starting Point, Ozaukee Family Services, and Northshore Center, organizations servi ng new mo thers, parents, school districts , veterans, the health department, NA MI Ozaukee County, Ozaukee Commu nity Therapies, Advocates of Ozaukee, Ozaukee County Human Services, libraries , faith -based communities, business leaders , local city /village gove rnment, service groups, RedGEN, Aging and Disability Resource Center , EMS, Cultivate, COPE, Unite d Way of Northern Ozaukee, long term care facilit ies, and adult protec tive services are the partners key informants named to work on mental health in the county. Subgroups/populations where efforts co uld be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Many key inform ants believed this is an issue that require s everyone 's engagement . Everyone can be educated in relevant resources and services to refer to , the s ymptoms to be aware of in themselves, their families, friends, and neighbor s, and appropriate ways to seek help when needed. Key informants also provided specific subpopulations to focus on such as te en athl etes who feel high pressure to succeed and may be using unhealthy coping mechanisms , and lesbian , gay, bisexual, tran s, gen der questioning students . Post -partu m moms may need extra support and efforts could be made to reach women in the hosp ital or at po st-partum appointments. Youth in general, young adults, fa milies, Latinx , Russian, and Asian c ommunit ies and fam ilies, veterans, low-income populations, and seniors were mentioned as special popu lations who may need more attention. One key informant mentioned the importan ce of inv iting members of these groups to be participants in making decisions about how to address these issues because it is important for them to have a voice in what is happe ning to them. It was suggested that low -income populations can be reached at food pantries, jail, schools, county offices, and non-profits workin g with populations at risk for mental illness. Busines s leaders should be 7 engaged to bring education and res ources to their employees and to promote these in the community. The aging and elderly population is going through significant life c hanges, loneliness and isolation , diminishing freedom and independence , fear of dem entia diagnosi s, and might need help adjusting and easing the burden . Veterans and those who have m ental il lness can be reached through outreach to the Veterans Administration or other veterans' groups. There is a need to focus on early intervention with children to change outcomes later in life. Substance Use and Abuse Nineteen informants in cluded Substance Use and Abuse in their top health issues for th e county , with four rating it the top issue for the county. Many of these key informants noted ther e is overlap in the strategies, barriers and challenges, and partnerships used to addres s Substance Use and Abuse and Alcohol Abuse, and to a lesser extent , Tobacco Use and Exposu re. Some also noted the necessity of addressing potential underlying Mental Health issues when addressing S ubstance Use and Abuse. Additionally , some of the common ly noted barriers and challenges to addressing Substance Abuse are issues of access, particularly a lack of t reatment facilities , support groups, and services, and lack of transportation to those that do exist, particularly in more rural and norther n areas of the county. Existing Strategies: There are a variety of strat egies in place to address Substan ce Use and Abuse in the county across different sectors . A behavioral health specialist is staffing the ED in Advocate Aurora Health 's hospital . Schools are providing education on this topic, s ocial emotional coaching , and health class es. Schools are also active in prevention and engaging in act ivities like Red Ribbon Week. When someone is incarcerated, they receive information regarding services for substance use resources upon their release and the po lice and justice s ystem are aware of res ources , but they have to get arrested to find out about the services and resources. The county has developed a heroin too lkit. There is a s trong desire from stakeho lders and community partners to work collaborat ively . There are medication collection drop box es and Drug Take Back Day events . An AODA gap an alysis was conducted to inform initiatives. Peer specialists and recovery coaches are recognized as an important part of recovery. There are great self -help gr oups that exist currently. Those ag encies can be very useful and helpful to those who actively seek it. Other strategies discussed include: Narcan availability, m ental health profession als, forums, and literature , a Vivitrol program, Hidden in P lain Sight , community awareness of these issues, and parents bei ng e ducated about warning signs . Barriers and Challenges: Some barriers to addressing this p roblem noted by key informants are a la ck of colla boration across the county, limited access to t reatment serv ices due to the high cost, few providers, low rates of reimbursement with Medicaid, lack of residential treatment programs in the county, limited resources for women, limited resources in the northern part of the county, lack of transportation, lack of appointments available outside of traditional business hours, and lack of aw areness of resources that d o exist. Stigma also exist around substance abuse , admitting behavior is problematic, and seeking 8 treatment. Educating students and parents can be difficul t if parents are in d enial that children are experimen ting with drugs and education curricula are out of date. Substance use and mental illness are frequently co -occurring and need to be addressed together. It is hard to prevent d rugs are coming through t he county on I -43. Prescription drugs pose a challenge because people don 't understand the dange rs or how quickly they can become dependent and pain relievers a re sometimes over -prescribed. Needed Strateg ies: Key informants suggested an i ncrease in the availabil ity of resources, educat ing providers on resources in the community , and creating a list for reference , drug impairment training for educational profession als, education for school staff on trends that law enfor cement is seeing , more support groups, more services in n orthern Ozaukee County, more transportation options, programs that people could walk to that are embedded in their community , a large campaign to reduce the stigma associated with addiction and treatment , adopting a holistic approach to address ing mental health and substan ce abuse together , more support in jail s with a plan for integration into the community, involvement from businesses as employees are trying to get help and work at the same t ime, incr ease d support and community awarene ss of substance use and resources , establishing a so ber living house for women , prioritiz ing best practice initiati ves that other communities have found to be effective, drug treatment court, adopting additional harm reduction strategies, implementing eviden ce-based alcohol, tobacco, and othe r drug abuse (ATODA) programming and curr iculum within school districts, increased funding and resources allocated toward affordable treatment options, administer Youth Risk Behavior Survey in Ozaukee County for better lo cal data, more medication assi sted treatment providers (suboxone), and home vi siting support for y oung families . Additional suggestions include strengthening prevention e fforts, invest more money i n prevention programs , decreasing duplication of services by government and non -profit s, promoti ng resou rces for people who are struggling before they are in the category of full dependence , combine efforts with other coalitions (I NVEST mental health ), impleme nting a drug court, and increa sing access to affordabl e Narcan for EMS and la w enforcem ent. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Respondents identified health systems, community groups and organizations like Just Listen , Ozaukee Family Services, and Starting P oint, law enforcement (supporting the work, not punitiv e), businesses , schools, food pantries , chamber s of commerce, faith communities , mental health providers, county government, youth and parents , the health department, WIC, the court system, NAMI Ozaukee, EMS, lobbying /civic advocacy groups , treatment providers, Family Resource Center in Grafton , Narcotics Anonymous groups/sites, individual s in recovery , and pharm acists as key partners to improve health. Subgroup s/populations wh ere efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Key informants suggested working with teachers in science and health c lasse s to educate students about the effects of substance use. Parents, you th, and young adults all need to be educated on how to identify su bstance use and abuse. It was also suggested t here should al so be more family -friendly sober activities for parents and kids to engage in. Families can a lso be reached where they are already gathered, such as at churches, youth groups, and communit y activities. Ever yone in the c ounty should be educated on the issue to challenge the stigma and change the community perception. It is important to target businesses to bring awareness and e ducation into workplaces to let employees know what resources are 9 available in the community ( i.e. post flyers in the lunch room, send mass email s to employees letting them know about resources they can access without having their empl oyer know) . Provide soc ial service providers with tr aining on how to work with families and children who have substance abuse issues or have family members wit h issues . Low-income residents can be reached at food pantries by post ing information about re sources in the community . Provide services and transportation to those who live in the northern or more rural parts of Ozaukee County. Access to Health Care Twelve key info rmants r anked Access to Health Care as a top-five health p riority for th e county , with two of them rating it as the ir top priority. Existing Strategies: Some services are available to fill gaps in health care for people who are un -insured or under -insured and to help people access services they need such as the Huiras Fami ly Ozaukee Community Clinic , case man agers in the emergency department to make sure patients have a primary care provider when they are d ischarge d, travelling mam mogram machines, clinical care m anagers for seniors, Interf aith Caregivers of Ozaukee County provides transportati on access to get to appointments , and Ozaukee F amily Services , county Human Services, and the count y Veterans Services Officer help to connect people to the services they need. In terms of prevention , the Washington Ozau kee Public Health Department provides health education, immunizations, and addresses needs identified by research. Health systems are also doing health education . Key informants mentioned community resources such as NAMI (the National Alliance on M ental Illness) Ozaukee, 211, and the Sober Ride program through the Tavern League . They also discussed law enforcement staff and the Sheriff 's office engaging in Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) . Barriers and Cha llenges: Barriers and challenges to accessing health care incl ude long waiting lists for appointments, providers turning away patients who are uninsured and cannot pay , lack of money to pay for co -payments , high costs of health insurance , high dedu ctibles , clinics and pharmacies are open limited hours, la ck of free clinics in the area, lack of transparency in health care prices, increas e in the costs of care for seniors , especially with supplemental coverage needed for prescriptions, oral health, home healt h, foot care, and eye care , Medicaid reimbursement rates are very low for some services, lack of child care may keep some people from attending appoint ments, and there are transportation difficulties with getting to appointments. One key informant sug gested a need to focus on making sure patients have a primary care provider when they are discharged from a ho spital. One potential challenge discussed is health care providers ' discomfort interacting with and treat ing people with disabilities . Ther e are cha llenges with communication between primary care providers, specialists, and patients. It is difficult to access treatment for alcohol and other drug abuse issues due to lack of facilities, long waiting lists, and the stigma associated with addiction . It is also hard to find counselors, 10 child psychiatrists, and mental health providers in general. People also may not know about services that are available or don 't know where to go to access services. Needed Strategies : Key informant provided these sug gesti ons for increas ing access to health car e from prevention to treatment, such as i ncrease case manager hours in emergenc y departments , find ways to partner with private transportation organizations, plan fo r how school districts can refer students and paren ts to help ( without favoring one health system or service over another ), increase the availability of family counseling, increase awareness of Impact 211 as a resource to direct people to services , bring more people to the table to partner to fill the gaps, offer more fl exible clinic schedules, establish a free clinic or a tra veling free clinic , engage in advocacy at the nation al, state, and local levels to resolve health access issues, invest in early assessment of individuals health needs, invest in a comm unity param edic program, engage in prev ention education on exer cise and healthy eating, prom ote awareness of hospita ls' financial assistance program s, establish better care coo rdination for patients with co -occurring disorder s or needs, invest in providing mental h ealth first aid for adults and youth, establish s chool -based clinics, and focus on minimiz ing premature hospital discharges to minimize readmissions . Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health care systems, the county health department, local government, free clinics , schools, the business community, pharmacies, transportation providers, schools and colleges who train health professionals and related workforce develop ment , non-profits who serve young families, low -income populations, and seni ors, county Human Services , senior centers, local agencies serving adults with disabilities (Portal , Inc.), county Veterans Services, and Interfaith Caregivers were suggested as community partners who can play a role in improving access to health care in t he county. Subgroups/populations whe re efforts could be targeted and ho w efforts can be targeted: Those most in need were identified as low -income populations, the aging and elderly , residents of the northern portion of the county, the homeless or those ex periencing housing instability, young families, adults with disabilities , people who do not have a driver license or have a sus pended license, people living with mental illness, and frequent users of t he emergency dep artments . Suggestions for closing gaps in access for these groups include education to cl ients and their families about services that exi st, better coordination of care, expanding Nurse Practitioner liai son program, reaching people through the courts, food pantries , workforce development servic es, Human Services, and through schools. It was suggested that hospitals could be more of a pillar by investing time and money to supp ort mental health in the community, for example. For adults with disabilities, one key inf ormant suggested creating a com mittee across health care p rofessions , providers, and patients and their families to determine what the needs are, what priorities should be, and determine outreach methods to address those needs across . Finally, it was recommended that resource directorie s and 211 should be better promoted. 11 Alcohol Abuse Ten informants ' rankings included Alcohol Abuse as a top he alth issue for the c ounty , with two rating it their top priority area. Existing Stra tegies: Currently there is a b ehavioral health specialist s taffing the Advocate Aurora emerge ncy department , making refe rrals to COPE , health classes are offered, great self -help groups are offered, i gnition interlock d evices are a great preventive tool to reduce vehicle crashes , law enforcement focusing on traffic stops and arrest ing intoxicated drive rs, there has been local media coverage about the impact of drun k drivin g and an increase in criminal charges r elated to driving while in toxicated . Prevention efforts are provided by the Ozaukee County Sheriff's Department , schools, and non-profits in the co unty that have a mission to serv e this issue. Barriers and Challenges: Some key informants noted the challenge of the cultural acce ptance of alcohol consu mption and how ever present it is at social gatherings and community functions, along with the stigma of admitting to problematic alcohol consumption and a de sire to seek help . Additionally, there are limited resources for treatment, few Alcoholics A nonymous meetings in the county, lim ited resources for women (e.g. no sober housing f or women) , lim ited resources in the northern part of the county, the expense of residential treatment , and a lack of transportation is a barrier (there aren 't always Uber o r Lyft drivers available in all parts of the county) . State law is lax on drivers w ho drive under the influence. People who have higher socioeco nomic status can cover up their behavior by paying off tickets . Lobbying on behalf of the Tavern L eague i s a challenge. Employees might be reluctant to admit to a problem or seek treatment for f ear of losing their job. Needed Strategies: Key informants suggested increasing the availability of resources, educat ing health care prov iders about resources in the community , and hav ing a list for reference . Other ideas in cluded having more transportatio n option s, both to prevent dr unk driving, and to transport people to support groups and treatment resources. It was also noted that it is importan t to have treatment options and resources embedded in the community where people a lready are and that are eas y to get to as a way to make accessing assistance easier at locations like community centers and librar ies where people go for many re asons . A more complex suggestion is creating cultural change to d e-normalize alcohol consu mption . There is a need for mor e resources and tr eatment options in the northern part of the county. The county needs a sober living house for women. Wrist bands at festivals can be used to identify people who are of drinking age . Businesses need to get invo lved , offering employee ass istance programs for people who are trying to g et help and work at the same time . One key informant recommended less duplication of services by government and non -profits and a more unified approach in the county . One strategy offered is to partner with law enforcement to provide early identification of alcohol abuse and assess t hose who violate the law by engag ing in alcohol -related crimes . Another suggestion is stricter punishments for driving while intoxicated. 12 Key Community Partners to Improve Health : Health systems, schools , business, law enforcement , local municipalities, county government, county H uman Services, the health department, the court system, food pantries, community groups and organizations like Family Sharing, Just Listen , and Starting Point , providers of services t o wome n, children, and families , organizations that work with legisl ators such as Moms Against Drunk Driving and groups that fight against alcohol related crimes, lobbying and civic advoc acy groups, Tavern League, and individu als in recovery were identified as the key partners to address alcohol abuse in the county. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Youth and teens could be reach ed through programming within the s chools and w orking with the sports coaches . Focus on the ec onomically disadv antaged, because those who are wealthy have more access to better treatment services . Key informants noted that a focus on prevention is especially important and investing in e arly treatment and preventive measu res could easily reduce alcohol abuse in the community. The north ern part of the county needs more resources. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) Adverse Childhood E xperiences (ACEs) was ranked as a t op health issue by six key inf ormant s, and two of those ranked it their top issue for the cou nty. Existing Strategies: Awareness, p revention , and early interventio n were named as existing strateg ies to address ACEs , inclu ding e ducat ing children through caregivers, timely intervention once they learn about ACE in a child, more referra l time for intervention, and current support for other community forensic investigation interview ers. School s taff are current through all DPI trauma modules (1 -6). Increased a wareness of ACEs, impact, and prevalence as service providers are becomi ng more aware and people are more sensitive when it's on their radar . Key informants also mentioned e ducating staff on trauma informed care and c ounselors work ing with indi vidual students to share coping str ategie s. Barriers and Challenges: Key informants noted d ifficulty making timely referrals, low awareness in the community in general , not enough police education, lack of general resources, mandatory reporters having reservations about reporting, the stigma arou nd trauma , a lack of understanding what trauma actually is, and a false perception that ACEs don 't exist due to high economic status , but families of high income and education still have issues . Key informants also shared that some community organizations aren't working together , are siloed , or are hesitant to collaborate . There is a challenge with confidentiality when school staff make a referral to CPS , then there doesn't seem to be as much follow - up back to the s chool. Needed Strategies: More law enfor cement collaboration, more engagement in the schools and with families , resilience education and training, parent education, continued education for school staff, 13 collaboration between govern ment entities for understanding , educate community service people to work together and understand the importance of it , engage non -profi t and for -profit sectors t o work together, widen education to all Ozaukee staff and community partners, and creat ing a Trauma informe d community were suggested as potential strategies t o address ACEs in the county. Key Community Partners to Improve He alth: School districts, law enforce ment, health systems , Department of Justice , student support service teams in school s, anyone who wor ks with children, local government, Kettle Moraine Cou nseling, Northshore , Services , Ozaukee Family Servi ces, local churches, Birth to Thr ee, and organizations that provide parenting classes are the key partners recommended by key inf ormants. Subgroups/populat ions where efforts could be targeted and how effo rts can be targeted: One key informant suggested focusing on youth and dome stic violence , drug -endangered children , and youth affected by sexual exploitation . These children can be served by increasing a ccess to resources for frontl ine workers, such as increased use of evidence -based materials or curricul a, and in school setting, teaching kids about ACEs , how common they are , and how they may be impacted by ACEs. It was note d that schools are very important to this effort. Oral Health Six respondents' rankings included Oral Health as a top health issue for the county , with one of them ranking it as their top priority area. Existing Strategies: If people have dental insurance or money to pay out -of-pocket fo r services and can get to appointment s, there are providers to serve them. Key inf ormants ' examples of exi sting strategies mostly focused on the wa ys people are able to access dental care without insurance, a nd such services are limited. The examples pro vided are some free clinics, including the Seton Dental Clinic in Milwaukee (especially with referrals thro ugh Ascension) , Seton 's mobile dental cli nic, cleanings offered by the Marquette School of Dentistry clinic, dentists who will provide s ervices to patients with Medicaid, and some lo cal dentists who will do pro bono dental work. Barriers and Challenges: The most frequently named barrier is lack of access to services due to a lack of providers who will take patients who have Medicaid insurance due to low reimbursement rates , the high cost of dental care, lack of providers for people who do not have insurance or money to pay out-of- pocket costs, long wait ing list s to get appo intments, and lack of trans portation to get to appointments. One key informant focused on the pediatric need, noting there are a significant number of kids who have never gone to the dentist, \"bottle rot \" is a problem for young children , there are kids who lose teeth because of domestic violence, and kids who don't have toothbrushes or other basic needs being met. 14 Needed Strategies: Key inf ormants recognized the need to increase access to services . Some suggestions to accomplish this include expanding the s ervices of the mo bile den tal clinic, creating a county fund to subsidi ze den tists to get more dentis ts to see patients with Medicaid, expand what is working in Washington County to Ozaukee County, change po licy to increase reimbursement through Medicaid, and investing in a transportation service. One key informant noted it would be important to design a dental clinic that is accessible to the needs of patients with disabilities , including those with sensory needs. Another area of focus should be prevention, with more education for children and parents about the importance of oral health and hygiene. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health care systems, dent ists, dental associations, Marquette University, Albrecht Free Clinic, Washing ton County free dental clinic, non-profits tha t support individuals with disabilities and y oung children, school s, food pantries , business leaders , Portal , Inc., Rotary in Port Washington, United Way of Northern Ozaukee, Aging and Disability Resource Center of Ozaukee County , Child Protective Services, and county government were name d as key partners to improve oral health in the county. Subgroups/populations where ef forts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Low-income people and neighborhoods in Port Washington and north, young families , people with disabilities, young kids, and children and adults with disabilities were some specific populations named for target ed outreach through Portal , Inc., Balan ce, Inc., Ozaukee County Aging and Human Services , the R otary , and United Way . Advertising at fo od pan tries, grocery stores, discount stores, and immigrant farms was offered as a way to reach some of these vul nerable populations . One key inf ormant noted there is a n eed for a county -level plan to address the se needs overall. Nutrition Six r espondents ' ranki ngs included Nutri tion as a top health issue for the county. Key informants discussed topics related to healthy food access , nutrition education , and breastfeeding . Existing Strategies: My Pl ate, Harvest of the Month program , community gardens, farmers ma rkets, food pantri es, nutrition classes at the YMCA, a grant for a farm to table program at the schools , improved quality of convenience meal options, strong community awareness of this issue , and strong collaboration among community organizations were nam ed as strategies i n place to address nutrition in the county . One key informant explained how the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Nutrition Program works through the Washington Ozaukee P ublic Health Departme nt: \"WIC's target audience includes pregnant, post -partu m, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children under five years old who meet income and nutrition risk requirements .\" They offer i ndividual nut rition counseling , individual breastfeeding support, education, a nd referrals , referrals to other a gencies , access to healthy foods and formula at local vendors , access to fresh, loca lly grown fruits and vegetables at farmers' market and farm stands , and access to breastfeeding supplies . WIC has transitioned to a more discrete e lectronic benefits card t o make transaction s more private and they have been making strides to remove barriers 15 by offering early or late clinic appointments, offering phone or online -based nutrition education contacts, and offering options for alternates to come in their place for appointments. Barriers and Challenges: Key informants named many individual -level barriers to improved nut rition , including lack of time, cost of food and limited financial resources , difficulty cooking recipes for one, anxiety about try ing new foods, an d not knowing what to do with certain food items , limited cooking skills, limited access to grocery stores and lack o f transportation to get there , ease of access to convenience foods, stigma around accessing nutrition a ssistance progr ams and food pantries , and a general la ck of education about nutrition. The health department is allotted a limited amoun t of resources and funding for nutrition programs. The WIC population struggles with exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding rates. More work needs to be done in prenata l education on baby behavior, supporting women as they retur n to work, and referrals for breastfeeding support. We are a food reduction society, many o f the unhealthy foods are stimulant heavy (fat, sugar, etc.), how food reacts with the body education, u nderstanding the biomechanical impact of people in general and those who are going through addic tion, food shame. Programs like FoodShare include unhealthy foods in card purchase abilities, but essentials such as toilet paper ar e not inc luded in purchase abilities . Food pantries have a difficult time getting fresh food and fruits, and most of the food donated is at the end of its shelf life or is not safe for consumption . Need ed Strategies : Increased a ccess to healthy food options, teach ing kids about gardening and healthy cooking, cooking classes that teach simple, but healthy recipes with lim ited ingre dients, education for people with disab ilities, f inancial resources to create an accessible preparation kitchen for class purposes at P ortal, Inc. guided b y a nutritionist and a chef , educati onal classes tailored to health care needs like diabetes, heart health, allergies and sensitivities, and work to improve systems change and food systems were identified as strategies that could improve nutrition in the c ounty . The local WIC office is working on building p artnerships and providing outreach to engage the part of the population who likely qualifies for WIC services but does not participate . Key Community Partners to Improve Health: School district s, grocer y stores, local restaurants, food pantries, farmers, Portal , Inc., Concordia University School of Health Professions, Cardinal Stritch special education program, health care systems, local government, the health department, WIC Program, YMCA, Aging and Dis ability Resource Center , Wellspring, United Way, UW-Extension Agriculture program , Hispanic community centers, chambers of commerce, low -income housing gro ups, Ozaukee County Human Services , day care providers , churches, parent groups, Boys and Girls Club, Ozaukee County Dairy Promotion , community gardening groups, 4-H, and nutritionist s were all named as key partners to improve health related to food and nutrition . Subg roups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Adult s with disabilities, senior citize ns, and people with low -income levels can be reached through Portal , Inc., Ozaukee County Aging and Disability Resource Center , and low-income housing locations. Parents, youth, Latinx communities , and ve terans may al so ne ed tailored outreach. Residents who may qualify for WIC need to be pregnant, post -partum, or breastfeeding women with infants and children under 5 16 years old who me et income and nutrition risk requirements and could potentially be reached through child car e providers and workplaces . The elderly population and retirees who don't have access to good food were also identified as a g roup with specific needs : find ways to provide transportation for then to access food or find strategies to get food to them. Chronic Disease Five respondents' rankings included Chronic Disease as a top health issue for the county, with one of them selecting it as their top issue. Existing Strategies: Related to managing chronic conditions , making sure patients have a primary ca re provider when they are discharged from the emergency department, a chronic disease case manager for day hours , hospital management of chronic diseases with specialty providers , trans itional care management, telehealth programs , and Ascensio n is working with uninsured patients to obtain financial assistance and establish them with a primary care provi der. For prevention of chronic disease, the Balance program at the YMCA, the diabetes prevention program (DPP), the Ascen sion clinic provides baseline labs for u ninsured patients, education classes for older adults, and the health department is starting an o besity committee and more education about phy sical activity and nut rition. Barriers and Challenges: Some of the barriers and challenges are i ssues of acces s such as lack of transportatio n to appointments, lack of health insurance, high co -payments and de ductibles even with insurance, language barriers between patients and providers or health systems , and clinic hours can be difficult to access when they over lap with work schedules . Some challenges have to do with health care processes, such as confirming patients being discharged have a primary care provider, inexperienced staff at all levels of care , lack of care coordination, medication recon ciliations are incorrect on transfer red patients , short stays in hospitals and observation status cause s transfers out too quickly and then people are readmitted , and lack of proper follow up leading to challeng es getting patient to come back . Challenges related to prevent ion program include lack of funding or staffing to operate the prog rams and difficulty filling the classes or groups . Other challenges include cultur al norms where a \"quick fi x\" is preferable to sustained healthy habits and there exists s ome stigma ar ound having certain chronic illnesses. Needed Stra tegies: At the health care systems -level, an i ncrease in hours a case man ager is availab le in the e mergency department at the hospital would be helpful , collaboration meetings across levels of care, quality ass urance in hospitals, growing Nurse Practitioner programs for senior care facilities , making appointmen ts more accessible by finding transportation solutions and expanding clinic hours , offering sliding fee scale payment options , and expan ding patient educa tion efforts. One respondent suggested outreach ef forts to older adults need to be increased . At the community level, it was suggested there could be more community education , inclu ding messaging at meal sites, restaurants, grocery store s Key Community Pa rtners to Improve Health: Health care systems and health care providers, including those training in health professions, insurance companies, health care quality depart ments , county 17 health department, free cl inics, senior centers , YMCA, schools, Aging and Disability Resource Center, Caregiver Connection, and the Alzheimer 's Association are key partners related to chronic disease prevention and management. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted : Key inf ormants suggested the following groups may need tar geted outreach related to chronic disease prevention and management: low -income populations, older adults , especially those who are isolated, adults aged 30 to 50 years, cardiac patients, long -term care patients, i mmigrants, and disabled young adults. It was suggested these groups could be reache d broadly through communication from schools, newspapers, community centers and senior centers, communication from the public health department , and the Aging and Disabilit y Resource Center. Particularly vulnerable groups may ben efit from support groups, prevention education, speakers on chronic disease topics, and education about services avai lable at low to no cost. Tobacco Use and Exposure Four key inf ormants included Tobacco Use and Exposure as a top health issu e for the county. Existing Strategies: School district s are active in prevention education and the FACT youth tobac co awareness group has been implemented in schools. O ther strategies include quit lines, medic ation, Wisconsin Wins program tactics, resources from American Lung Association, tobacco and vaping education , formation of the Tobacco -Free Suburban Milwaukee and Ozaukee coalition , policies to create smoke-free campuses at local busines ses, seminars at s chools like the Homestead High School Vaping Awareness Event, and law enforcement action . Barriers and Challeng es: There is a lack of awareness of the problem and o f resources to support quitting. There i s social stigma around these issu es in the county. Nicotine and tobacco are very addictive and dangerous for youth. There is still a lack of knowledge about vaping and a perception that it is safer than smoking cigarettes . Tobacco products are very accessible and there is much mar keting of these product s, especially to youth. The lack of smoke and o dor makes vaping harder to det ect than cigarette s. There aren't ordinanc es about vaping indoors in the county. Needed Strategies: There were several suggest ions about strategies that could address tobacco us e in the county including adopting a n ationwide campaign to focus ag ainst vaping , introducing an ordinance or policy against vaping in workplace s and school s, pass ing a law to increase the age of legal to bacco use and sale to 21 years , increasing parent ed ucation on vapi ng, increasing public awareness of free resources , increasing tax on all tobacco/nicotine products, implementing smoking cessation challenges amongst businesses (e.g. a challenge for the new year to get people to quit ), and implementing an additional insurance charge to disincentiv ize smoking. 18 Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Chambers of commer ce, festivals planners , schools and student groups, faith communities, primary care p roviders, hospital and health care systems, insurance com panies, organizations like the American Lung Association and American Cancer Society, and the health department are key partners to improve health. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Key informants recomm ended addressing children and youth, particularly middle school aged and younger, with education. One sugg estion was to educate parents as well. One sugges tion was to go where the people are, such as churches, Relay for Life, youth spor ts events, and Young Life. Another suggestion was to do lunch and learns with staff in he alth care settings regarding smoking cessation. A nother su ggestion was to reach out to the business community and develop strategies to disincentivize tobacco use in workplaces, for ex ample with tobacco -free campus policies . Reproductive and Sexual Health Three rankings included Reproductive and Sexual Health as a top heal th issue for the county. Existing Strategies: At the county level, the health department recentl y established the Washington Ozaukee Coalition for Sexual Wellness in response to the 2018 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data from six Washington County hi gh schools that showed a significant percentage of students reported not using condoms or birth c ontrol with sexual intercourse . While data reported were only for Washington County, the coalition has membership from both Washington and Ozaukee Co unties. The health department and coalition are also reviewing sexually tra nsmitted infection (STI) rates in Ozaukee County and are working to identify how to publicly share the data. There are several community agencies working to provide prevention education an d awareness in schools and in the community , which may include a variety of lessons including hea lthy relation ships , sexual violence, consent, and STIs. At the individual level, parent conversations are occurring, primary care providers are taking sexual histories , there are schoo l-based and faith -based sex education courses, and Advocates of Ozaukee offers education about sexual health, abuse, teen dating, and violence . Barriers and Challenges: Reproductiv e and sexual health is a very controversial and p oliticized topic for our community members and some communi ty partners and can be un comfortable t o discuss. There is a lack of knowledge and misinformation. Sharing of data is also a barrier. It is challenging to get some schools to share the Human Grow th & Development curriculum and until recently, it was a challenge to get schools on board to imp lement the YRBS due to fear of how the data will be shared. Needed Strategies: The Coalition for Sexual Wellness is taking small steps to open up this topic and partners are working together to develop goals and strategie s to address sexual health moving forw ard. There n eed to be continued efforts to share the importance of the work to address sexual health, especially for adolescents and teens, to share data and be tr ansparent about how it will be shared so there is a better understanding of STIs, to create educational a nd awareness campa igns, and b uild 19 relationships with partners and community members who are resistant to talking about sexual health. It was also suggested there need to be more f requent parent conversations , normalized discussion of sexual wellness , and better sex uality education curriculum in schoo ls. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Ozauk ee County school districts, health systems and primary care providers , the county health department , yout h-serving organizations like the Boys & Girls Club, af ter school programs, Lakeshore Regional Children's Advocacy Center, Adv ocates of Ozaukee, Ozaukee Family Services, Ozaukee Community Therapies, nurs es, Friends, Inc., fai th-based organizations, LGBTQ community/ representatives, the Washington Ozau kee Coalition for Sexual Wellness and parents were named as impor tant partners to improve health in this area . Subgroups/populati ons where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Key info rmants recommended a focus on yo uth with regard to comprehensive sexuality education, awareness rai sing campaigns, and human papilloma virus vaccines , and suggested youth need to be reached with positive messages via their paren ts and families, faith communities, and health care provider s. Parents of school-aged children also need to be reached with information about how to talk to their children about healthy sexuality . Other populations who may need tailored information are LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, t rans, and queer) youth, and parochial school s and their stud ents . Injury and Violence Three key informants included Injury and Violence as a top health issue for the c ounty . Key informants discussed a variety of topics related to injuries and violence , incl uding v iolent crime, sexua l assault, child abuse, and intimate partner violence . Existing Strategies : Key informants discussed s exual assault nurse examiner (SANE) process es at health systems , forensic interviews, increased involvement in reporting of Chil d Protective Services , education provided in schools and by Advocates of Ozaukee , including topics of d ating violence, sexual assault, and bullying. Barriers and Challenges: Key inf ormants suggested there is a lack of acknowledgement of injury and violence as issues in Ozaukee County, as well a s a b roader lack of acknowle dgement of these as public health issues. Some other barriers named by key informants include : no sexual assault kits (SANE programs) in Ozaukee County , the stigma around these issues, hea lth information privacy po licies, lack of funding, lack of law enforcement staffing , and issues with traffic crash es and speeding. Needed Strategies: Community conversations to increase awareness, prioriti ze issues, increase education , and support to law e nforcement that services a re available, bett er communication between health system s, and more proactive response to child abuse and injuries before there is a death. Project Crash , controlling alcohol and tobacco transactions, and installing child safety s eats were also offered as strategies that co uld imp rove health related to injuries and violence. 20 Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Health care providers, local government, medical examiner s, law enforce ment, schools and school boards, civic groups , community and business le aders, Advocates o f Ozaukee , faith communities , and child death review committees were named as important partners in Ozaukee County. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: Drug - enda ngered children, refugee o r ESL families and communities, and families with adults who have mental health challenges may need more targeted outreach to get information . It was also suggested juvenil es may need more targ eted education about human traffickin g. Physical Activity Thre e key informants r anked Physical Activity as a top five health priority area for Ozaukee County . Existing Strategies : Generally, there are g ym class es in schools, county parks , organized sports, the YMCA , and swimming and walking programs. Specific ally for people with disa bilities, the YMCA offers adaptive classes for children and seniors, Form and Fitness has an athletic trainer that is excellent with adults with disabilities , and Special Olympics offers a soft opportunity for co mpetitive spor ts. One key informant elabora ted on specific ways the county priorit izes physical ac tivity: Walk to School Day, Summer of Cycling , Cycling Without A ge, and Eat & Move Well is a successful action team comprised of num erous community partners across sectors that focuse s on increasing ph ysical activity in the county. Barriers and Challenges: At the individual level, some general challenges include lack of time to engage in activities, the financial costs of equipment, participation , and member ship, lack of knowledge ab out how to use equ ipment or what exercises are beneficial, online resource s that cost money, and lack of transportation to get to activities or facilities. Specific to adults and children with disabilities , sometimes equipment is not accessible for indivi duals w ith more ph ysical disab ilities, staff and other club members may not be comfortable with people with disabilities, and transportation limitations . At the county level, there is a lack of funding to support coalition work , improve in frastructure, an d expand transport ation services as well as walking and biking trails. Needed Strategies: In general there is a need for e ducation about easy options for how to be physically active at home, emphasizing the i mportance of physical activity at a younger age, promot ing the benefits of small in creases in physical ac tivity , and encourag ing businesses to look at how they can encourage their employees to be more physically active ( e.g. subsidiz ing gym membership s). One key informant sugg ested there is a desire to have exercise cla sses that are integrative as well as adaptive so peop le of al l abilities can exercise together . Perhaps this could be achieved at the beginners ' level of exercise for ease with adaptability, pace, comfort level, and confidence for all pa rticipants. At th e county and program lev el there is a need to identify funding for programs and in frast ructure to be expanded through out the county a nd to ensure s ustainability . Adopting a health equity too lkit was one suggesti on. Increase d collaborati on between communi ty resources and st rengthening of existin g 21 collaborations. A bike and pedestrian plan or Complete Streets initiative would help to ensure that there are safe walking and biking routes for residents . Key Community Partners to Improve Healt h: YMCA, fitness c lubs, senior groups and senior centers , the health department, school districts, larger businesses, Ozaukee County Parks, Recreation, & Culture , Portal , Inc., Concordia University, Cardinal Stritch, Marquette , Agin g and Disabil ity Resource Cente r, Boys and Girls Club, local police departments , local government and policy makers, and chamber s of commerce were identified as key partners in this area. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted a nd how efforts can b e targ eted: Adults with disabilities (including neurological disorders), veterans, and senior citizens. These groups can be reached through Portal , Inc., the Veterans Administration, and senior centers and senior housing complexes, resp ectively. Other population s who may need targeted outreach are Latinx communities, low income families, and youth. One key informant added: \"Although there is a strong collaboration already, we can always increase collaboration and partnerships on efforts .\" Healthy Growth and Dev elopment Two key i nformant s included Healthy Grow th and Development as a top health priority for the county and one of them discussed this issue in their interview. Existing Strategies: Public Health is doing the best they can wi th the resources they have , and health syste ms are providing education materials. Barriers and Challenges: Lack of transportation for families to get to medical appointments , lack of health insurance coverage for children, financial barriers, problems acce ssing nutritious foods , and a disconnect bet ween p atrol and investigators in law enforcement were named as barriers and challenges to improving health. Needed Strategies: Increased access to transportation and help getting children to their medical appoint ments, community education , more nurses in s chools , increased education for patrol law enforcement, and increased awareness of these issues in general were offered as suggestions. Key Community Partners to Improve Health: Schools, public health, transporta tion providers or ride sharing services , and libra ries hosting community talks. Subgroups/populations where efforts could be targeted and how efforts can be targeted: One vulnerable population are c hildren impacted by trauma and mental health issues . Educa tion should be provided to the people who ha ve contact with those children. 22 Other Health Issues Key informants were able to write -in other health issues they wanted to rank as top -five issues for the county. Mental health among Middle and High Schoolers One key informant wrote \"Middle and High School mental health: stress and anxiety, social accep tance, and risks of impulsivity. \" They noted that school presentations are available on these topics and school counselors are a vailable to provide referrals. S ome barriers and challenge s of note include lack of availability of positive peer mentors and professional counselors, peer pressure and negative, aggressive, emotionally and socially - charged peer interactions, especially with socia l media, the competitiv eness of sports and academ ics, access to gun s and drugs, stress and anxiety, and sexual identity trends. They recommended youth support groups and coping strategy workshops are potential strategies to address this, and should include some that are confere nce or retreat -like. They also suggested p eer mentors and professional mental health counselors need to be more readily available to youth within schools. T hey believe youth ages 12 -18 may be most in need or interve ntions in sc hools. Alzheimer 's and Deme ntia One key informant inc luded Alzheimer 's and Dementia in their rankings. Current strategies to address this issue include a Dementia Specialist a t the coun ty Aging and Disability Resource Center, awareness programs , walks, caregiver series , and coffees offered by the Alzheimer 's Association, an Emergency Department Gerontologist at Ascen sion, and State dementia programs. Noted c hallenges and barriers to addressing this is sue include care centers often having their hands tied for care. They need patien ts to come to them in stab le conditio n, with out need for chemical or physica l sedation to control behaviors. A crisi s team is not equi pped to deal with behaviors. Additional funding and staff power are needed to address the needs of individuals who often require one -on-one care, which is expensive for facilit ies that often do not have that level of staffing. Inpatient access to mental health specialists are needed for this population. Hospitals need education about care center regulations. There is a ne ed to re-think elder care and advocate for b etter rates for care center reimbursement . Dementia specialist s, mental health professionals, geriatricians, and affected patien ts and their families are the key groups to partner to improve health re lated to Al zheimer 's and dementia. E lderly with dem entia and their families may benefit from target ed outreach through home visits, or visits to care centers where they live, support groups for fam ilies, speakers, and meeting s at hospitals to coordinate care better for these individuals. Obesity One key inf ormant ranked Obesity in their top -five. They identifie d programs at recreation departments, schools ' promotion of physical activity, and health sy stems ' focus on population health measures as strategies in place to improve health. Some i dentified barriers and challenges include the nature of obesity as a personal issue where people do n't want to admit to being overweight . 23 Additionally, businesses are afrai d to tell employees they are overw eight due to legal and liability issues. They re commended wel lness initiatives in businesses and health plans, and schools balancing education and physical activity time as potential ways to improve health. Key partners to work together on this issue are schools, YMCA, par ks and recreation departm ents, health clubs and related org anizations, and insurance companies. One subpopulation that may need extra attention are seniors , with a focus of staying independent and healthy so they can age in place . Seniors can be best reached at senior centers. Comm unicable Disease Communicable Disease was ranked as a top five health issue by one key informant , though they did not provide examples of existing strategies, barriers and challenges, needed strategies, key partners, and affected subpopulations . Environm ental and Occupati onal Health None of the key informants ranked Environmental and Occupational Health as a top five health issue for Ozaukee County. Existing strategies, barriers and challenges, needed strategies, key partners, a nd affected subpop ulations were not discusse d. 24 Appendix A. Interview Participants for Ozaukee County Key Informant Interview Participants Twenty -nine individuals participated in 26 key informant interview s about our community's most pressing hea lth needs. The or ganizatio ns listed here incl ude many that serve low -income, minority, and medically underserved populations.
