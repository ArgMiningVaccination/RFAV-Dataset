With adequate vaccine supply secured from the federal government, the vaccine program will be significantly expanded to meet the demand for booster doses, while still prioritizing first, second and pediatric doses. Starting next week, booking for booster doses will open to people age 30 and older. Appointments can be booked for at least 168 days after completing a primary series. \"Two years into this pandemic, rising case counts and a highly transmissible new variant demonstrate why vaccination continues to be critical to keep us safe and to move us forward,\" said Premier Tim Houston. \"To provide more Nova Scotians with the additional dose of protection they need, we are increasing our efforts and adding more clinics and immunizers to get vaccine into arms as quickly as possible.\" Pharmacies will continue to be key in delivering COVID-19 vaccine across the province. The following additions will take place over the next couple weeks, to expand capacity: - community vaccine clinic in Central zone starting January 6 at the Halifax Forum. Appointments will go live early next week. Additional clinics are being explored in other health zones - hybrid testing/vaccine clinics using existing Primary Assessment Centre locations in Northern, Eastern and Western Zones by mid-January. Testing and vaccine appointments will be provided at different times of day - drop-in mobile outreach clinics will also be deployed to increase vaccination capacity where needed. Vaccine will also be delivered through a clinic at the IWK, through various physician clinics and to healthcare workers via Nova Scotia Health clinics. The Province is working with the Nova Scotia Health Authority to enlist the services of anyone who is able to help administer vaccine, including existing and retired healthcare professionals. Anyone who has the expertise to administer a vaccine, or those interested in helping in a clinic in a non-medical role, can express their interest to support at [https://www.nshealth.ca/covidjobs](https://www.nshealth.ca/covidjobs) . \"Booster doses are an important part of further protecting yourself and others from the virus,\" said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's Chief Medical Officer of Health. \"I want to thank the team working to increase the amount of vaccine we can deliver across the province and those who will come forward to help immunize and work in clinics. Once again, we need your support and I know you will answer the call.\" As additional clinics come online, they will be added to the list of clinics on the COVID-19 booking page.
