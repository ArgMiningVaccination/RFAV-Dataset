The word is sometimes used casually to describe any low mood, but depression is much more serious, and it affects every area of a person's life. Symptoms of depression include sleeplessness, a lack of energy, loss of interest in once-loved activities, and a persistent sad mood. As always, our focus is not just treating the symptoms, but helping people discover true healing. If you or someone you love is struggling with depression, the professionals at 100% Chiropractic recommend trying our June supplement, the NutriPack MOJO, for emotional health paired with the physical benefits of seeing a chiropractor for depression symptoms. NutriPack MOJO We're highlighting this supplement this month because of its remarkable ability to support brain health. Not only is it one of the natural supplements that is beneficial for depression, but it also helps with symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and recovery following concussions. The nutrients in NutriPack MOJO are carefully selected to encourage a healthy, balanced brain, and paired with the natural benefits of seeing a chiropractor, depression symptoms decrease through a comprehensive approach to mental, physical, and emotional health. Here's a rundown of some of natural supplements that appear in the NutriPack MOJO, and how they help to improve depression symptoms. - Omega Pure Omega 3 fatty acids are vital for brain health and development. They've been shown to improve cognitive function and memory. - Probiotics People tend to think of probiotics in relationship to digestive health. However, many of the neurotransmitters that are used in the brain are created in the gut. An imbalance in these important neural signalers can cause dysfunction in concentration, memory, and mood. Supporting your digestive health is supporting your brain. - Vitamin D This nutrient is sometimes called a neuro-steroid because of its anti-inflammatory effect on the nervous system. Vitamin D deficiency is very common in modern society, and it has been correlated with depression. - Curcumin A powerful antioxidant, curcumin seems to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a brain-protective substance that is produced in the body. Low levels of BDNF have been shown to cause shrinking in the hippocampus and are associated with depression. Curcumin also seems to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine, two very important neurotransmitters that affect mood. - Magnesium This is another nutrient that many people don't get enough of. This powerhouse mineral supports brain health, and deficiency is often linked with anxiety. Chiropractic Care for Depression All of these nutrients work together to target brain acuity and physical performance, so it is an obvious step to merge those efforts with visits to your chiropractor for help with depression. An adjustment doesn't just improve spine alignment; it also enables the nervous system function at its best. The gentle support of chiropractic treatments has been known to reduce anxiety and improve mood. This care is a healthy way to help your brain and body recover from depression.
