Applying for SSP You must submit an application for federal SSI benefits to the Social Security Administration (SSA). This serves as your application for SSP benefits. SSA shares this information with New York State, who will determine your eligibility for SSP benefits. There is no online SSI Application. Please schedule an appointment with a local Social Security office to file an application. [Social Security Office Locator](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp); or - Call 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), Monday through Friday 7 am to 7 pm. For more information on how to apply for SSI benefits, visit [www.ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/). Eligibility You are eligible for SSP benefits if you: - Are an adult who is age 65 or older; or are blind or disabled; or are a child under the age of 18 who has a physical or mental impairment; and - Reside in New York State; and - Have limited income and resources; and - Are a citizen or a qualified alien, or otherwise meet citizenship requirements. Benefits Monthly benefit amounts vary depending on a variety of factors including: - living arrangements, - income; and - county of residence. View Maximum Monthly Benefit Amounts by Year: How You Receive Benefits If you receive both SSI and SSP benefits, you will receive your SSP benefits the same way you chose to receive your SSI benefit. If you receive SSP benefits but do not receive SSI benefits, you can choose how to receive your benefits. We strongly encourage you to receive benefits through direct deposit, which is safe, fast and convenient. If you currently have a representative payee for your SSI benefits, that person will also manage your SSP benefits. If you want to change your representative payee, you must contact SSA. If you receive SSP but do not receive SSI benefits, you can assign or change a payee by calling SSP at 1-855-488-0541. Medicaid Eligibility If you are eligible for SSP, you will automatically be eligible for Medicaid. Reporting Changes to Your Case You must report changes that may impact your benefits.
