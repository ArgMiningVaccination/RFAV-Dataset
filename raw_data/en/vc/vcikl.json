Swim suits, towels, [organic snacks](https://mindfulmomma.com/organic-snacks/) - check! Sounds like you're ready to head out for some fun in the sun. But what about the sunscreen? If you still using conventional, chemical sunscreens - the kind found at most drugstores or mass merchants - now's a good time to make the switch to a natural, non-toxic sunscreen brand. Why Non-Toxic Sunscreen Matters Most conventional sunscreen products on the market contain worrisome chemical ingredients that may lead to health problems like hormone disruption, allergies or even ironically, cancer, which sunscreen is purportedly trying to prevent. Many sunscreens also make misleading SPF claims that may put you at risk of sun damage. One of the most troubling aspects of chemical sunscreen ingredients is that they are absorbed into the bloodstream after only one use, and can be detected in blood weeks after application. To be safe, you should avoid the following chemical sunscreen ingredients as much as possible: - Oxybenzone (this one is the WORST!) methoxycinnamate) - Homosalate - Octisalate - Octocrylene Fortunately advocacy groups like the Environmental Working Group (EWG) have evaluated thousands of sunscreens for safety and created a ratings scale that allows us to make safer choices. Each year the EWG comes out with a [Sunscreen Guide](http://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/), which is definitely worth a read. Sunscreen ratings range from 1 - 10, with 1 being the gold standard and 10 meaning don't touch it with a ten foot pole! A note about benzene in sunscreen: A recent report by Valisure, found a known human carcinogen called benzene in 78 popular sunscreen products. You won't find benzene on the ingredient list because it is a contaminant from the manufacturing process. Unfortunately there is no way to know if a particular sunscreen does not contain benzene, unless the company has a policy of spot testing for contaminants. The only company I know that does this is Beautycounter. You'll find the Beautycounter sunscreen below (it's my favorite!) and you will find [the list of sunscreens with benzene here](https://www.valisure.com/wp-content/uploads/Valisure-Citizen-Petition-on-Benzene-in-Sunscreen-and-After-sun-Care-Products-v9.7.pdf) (on page 12 of the report). What to Look for in Non-Toxic Sunscreen I may receive commissions from purchases made through links in this article including Amazon Affiliates. [Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) With guidance from the EWG, here are some things to look for in safer sunscreens. Active Sunscreen Ingredients The active ingredients in a sunscreen should be minerals, not chemicals. Mineral-based sunscreens like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are physical sun blockers, meaning they act as a barrier on the skin, but are not absorbed into the skin. They do an excellent job blocking UV light and ultimately protect you from the threat of skin cancer. It's also important the the minerals used are non-nano sized particles, due to concerns that extremely small nanoparticles may be absorbed into the skin and bloodstream. Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients Even when you are buying mineral sunscreen, you need to pay attention to the other, inactive ingredients in a sunscreen lotion or spray. Beware of paraben preservatives, artificial fragrances and other potentially harmful chemicals that may cause endocrine disruption or lead to other health concerns. (Here's a list of some other important [ingredients to avoid in personal care products](https://mindfulmomma.com/toxic-ingredients-in-beauty-personal-care-products/).) Instead, look for natural ingredients (and some organic ingredients) that have beneficial properties for your skin. The best sunscreens will be either unscented or lightly scented with natural essential oils. Broad Spectrum To properly protect skin from the sun, a sunscreen needs to provide protection from both UVA and UVB rays. UVB rays are associated with skin burning and UVA rays are associated with skin aging and damage. Sunscreens that protect from both types of rays are known as broad spectrum sunscreens. In addition, avoid sunscreens with SPF over 50 because high SPFs give us a false sense of security and can lead to overexposure of both UVA and UVB rays. Water Resistance If you are active and/or planning to be in the water, it is important to consider the water resistance of the product. All water resistance claims must be tested in water for either 40 or 80 minutes. Reef Safe Another important feature of a good sunscreen is that it is safe for coral reefs and marine life. Sunscreens that contain chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate have been [shown to contribute to the bleaching of coral](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00244-015-0227-7?wt_mc=Affiliate.CommissionJunction.Authors.3.EPR1089.DeepLink&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=commission_junction_authors&utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_deeplink&utm_content=deeplink&utm_term=3987228) which puts it under severe stress and can cause the coral to die. A reef-safe sunscreen uses physical sunscreen blockers like zinc oxide, instead of those toxic chemicals. Clear Sunscreen Formula One of the biggest complaints about mineral sunscreen is that it is difficult to rub into the skin. I've found that there's been a huge improvement on this front - even compared to a few years ago. It is now possible to find mineral sunscreen that is easy to apply and rubs in easily - yay! Look for clear zinc sunscreen formulas to ensure they are easy to rub in without leaving a white residue on your skin. [Find my favorite sunscreens for kids that rub in easily here.](https://mindfulmomma.com/safe-sunscreens-that-rub-in-easily/) A quick note about spray sunscreens - the EWG recommends that we avoid all spray sunscreens due to inhalation concerns, as well as concern that it may not provide an adequate coating on the skin to ensure proper protection. But I get it - spray sunscreens are super easy and sometimes the only way we can get sunscreen on our kids. My kids used to BEG me for spray sunscreen! Both [Beautycounter](https://www.beautycounter.com/micaelapreston?goto=/product/countersun-mineral-sunscreen-mist-spf-30) and [Babo Botanicals](https://www.amazon.com/Babo-Botanicals-Continuous-Fragrance-Sunscreen/dp/B01ALT5MKW?crid=5R6GXJVF6FSC&keywords=babo+botanicals+sunscreen+spray&qid=1687545642&sprefix=babo+botan+sunscreen+spray%2Caps%2C592&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=73886627324087c3c5ea0327c6b46233&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are the safest sunscreen sprays I've found.

Since we all have different needs for sunscreen, I put together this sunscreen guide covering products for babies and kids, active folks, bargain brands, sensitive skin and even my favorite facial sunscreen brands. All of these sunscreens are mineral-based formulas made with good quality, plant-based ingredients, and non-nano zinc oxide (and that skip the harmful ingredients and sunscreen chemicals). They all rate well on the EWG sunscreen database - with either a 1 or 2 rating. The one exception is the spray sunscreen, which is rated a 3 due to concerns about spray inhalation.
