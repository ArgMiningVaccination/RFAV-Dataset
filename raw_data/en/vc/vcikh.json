for your Open Access plan. This Point-of-Service (POS) plan provides Preferred benefits when you use BCBSVT Network Providers, but includes another, lower level of benefits (\"Standard Benefits\") for some services outside of the BCBSVT Network. Chapter One explains what you must do to get benefits through your health plan. Your Outline of Coverage or Summary of Benefits and Coverage shows what you must pay Out-of-Pocket. Read this entire chapter carefully as it is your responsibility to follow these guidelines. Failure to follow these guidelines may mean your Plan will not provide benefits. General Guidelines As you read this document, please keep these facts in mind: \u0083Capitalized words have special meanings. See Definitions in Chapter Nine to understand your coverage. The terms \"You\" and \"Your\" are defined but they are not capitalized in text. \u0083Your Plan will only pay benefits for services defined as Covered. \u0083For some services, y ou must use Network Providers . \u0083Certain services are excluded from coverage under your Plan. You'll find General Exclusions applicable to all services in Chapter Three. Additionally, exclusions that apply to specific services may appear in other sections of this document. \u0083Services that are not Medically Necessary are not covered by your Plan. You may appeal the decision. See page 28 for more information. \u0083This is not a long-term care Policy as defined by Vermont State law at 8 V.S.A. \u00a78082 (5). \u0083You must follow the guidelines in this document even if this coverage is secondary to other health care coverage for you or one of your Dependents. \u0083Your Plan Administrator may interpret and apply the terms of your Coverage. Your Plan may determine if you have coverage for care. Your Plan Administrator may also decide how much coverage you have. This applies even when a Provider has prescribed or recommended a service.Prior Approval Program In most circumstances, your Plan only approves services from Non-Network Providers at the highest level of benefits (Preferred benefits) if appropriate services are not available within the Network. You may request Prior Approval to see a Non-Network Provider if there is not a Network Provider with appropriate training and experience to provide the Medically Necessary services needed to meet your particular health care needs. In this case, if you get Prior Approval, Cost -Sharing will be the same as if the service was obtained by a Network Provider. You will not be required to pay any difference between the Provider's charge and what we pay. If a Non-Network Provider bills you for the difference, please notify us by calling our customer service team at the number on the back of your ID card. Your Plan also requires Prior Approval for certain services and drugs even when you use Network Providers . They appear on the list later in this section. Your Plan does not require Prior Approval for Emergency Medical Services. BCBSVT Network Providers should get Prior Approval for you. If you use a Non-Network Provider or an out- of-state Provider, it is your responsibility to get Prior Approval. Failure to get Prior Approval could lead to a denial of benefits. If you use a BCBSVT Network Provider and the Provider fails to get Prior Approval for services that require it, the Provider may not bill you. The Prior Approval list can change. To get the most up-to-date list, visit BCBSVT's website at www.bcbsvt.com/priorapproval or call customer service at the number on the back of your ID card. How to Request Prior Approval To get Prior Approval, you or your Network Provider must provide supporting clinical documentation to BCBSVT. When receiving care from a Non -Network Provider, it is your responsibility to get Prior Approval. Forms are available on BCBSVT's website at www.bcbsvt.com/priorapproval . You may also get them by calling customer service at the number on the back of your ID card. Any Provider may help you fill out the form and give you other information you need to submit your request. The medical staff at BCBSVT will review the form and respond in writing to you and your Provider. If the request for Prior Approval is denied, you may appeal this decision by following the steps outlined in Chapter Four, Claims. 2Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Prior Approval List You need Prior Approval for services printed on this Prior Approval list. This list includes, but not limited to: \u0083adoptive immunotherapy including CAR-T and gene therapy visits and Implantable and Reconstructive procedures except breast reconstruction for patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer; \u0083dental services, please see page 22 for details; \u0083Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and supplies with a purchase price of $500 or more; \u0083electrical and ultrasound stimulation, including Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation \u0083Non -Network services when there is not a Network Provider with appropriate training and experience to provide the Medically Necessary services needed to meet your particular health care needs. \u0083nutritional counseling after three initial visits if you have a diagnosis for metabolic disease or an eating disorder (Prior Approval does not apply if you have diabetes.); \u0083orthognathic Surgery; \u0083orthotics and prosthetics \u0083radiation treatment electronic brachytherapy; \u0083radiology services (certain services including CT, CTA, MRI, MRA, MRS, PET, echocardiogram and nuclear cardiology); \u0083Rehabilitation (Skilled Nursing Facility, Inpatient Rehabilitation treatment for medical conditions, intensive Outpatient services or Residential Treatment Programs for mental health and substance use disorder conditions); \u0083certain surgical procedures and related services (examples include bariatric (obesity) Surgery, disc arthroplasty, lumbar spinal fusion, Sacroiliac joint \u0083wheelchairs.

Professional services may include a registered nurse, licensed social worker, or other licensed health care Professional practicing within the scope of their license and/or certified as a case manager. If your Plan approves benefits for care provided by Non -Network Providers and/or treatment Facilities for Inpatient and Outpatient care, your Plan may require you to participate in Case Management prior to receiving ongoing care and services. To find out more information about the program, call (800) 922-8778.3Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Choosing a Provider For many services, you may use any Provider. For some services, you must use Network Providers. You may have higher Cost-Sharing when you use Non-Network Providers. To access a Network Provider when in Vermont, you must use BCBSVT Network Providers. It includes a wide array of Primary Care Providers (PCP), Specialists and Facilities in Vermont and in bordering communities in other states. Outside of Vermont, you will use the BlueCard Network (PPO), which includes Providers that contract with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans. If you want a list of BCBSVT's Network Providers or want information about one, please visit www.bcbsvt.com/find-a-doctor to use the Find -a-Doctor tool. Use the Network drop-down menu and select BCBSVT Network Providers to find a list of Providers. If you live or travel outside of the BCBSVT Provider Network area please visit: \u0083provider.bcbs.com ; and \u0083use your three-letter prefix, located on your ID card, to find a Network Provider using the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association's Find-a-Doctor tool. You may also call customer service at the number on the back of your ID card. BCBSVT will send you a paper Provider directory without charge. Both electronic and paper directories give you information on Provider qualifications, such as training and board certification. You may change Providers whenever you wish. Follow the guidelines in this section when changing Providers. Network Providers Network Providers will: \u0083secure Prior Approval for you; \u0083bill BCBSVT directly for your services, so you don't have to submit a claim; \u0083not ask for payment at the time of service (except for Deductible, Co -insurance or Co payments you owe); and \u0083accept the Allowed Amount as full payment (you do not have to pay the difference between their total charges and the Allowed Amount). Although you receive services at a Network Facility, the individual Providers there may not be Network Providers. Please make every effort to check the status of all Providers prior to treatment by using the Find -a-Doctor tool on BCBSVT's website or call customer service at the number on the back of your ID card.Primary Care Providers If you live in Vermont, you must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) from BCBSVT's Network of Primary Care Providers when you join the Open Access Plan. To get Preferred benefits for most services, you must receive services from your PCP or another Network Provider. You have the right to designate any PCP who is available to accept you or your family members. Each family member may select a different PCP . You may select a pediatrician for your Child. Your coverage does not require you to get referrals from your PCP . You must get Prior Approval for certain services (see page 2). For instance, if appropriate services are not available with a Network Provider, you must get Prior Approval to receive the highest level of benefits. If you do not live in Vermont, you do not need to choose a PCP . BCBSVT encourages you to do so because it benefits your health to have one Provider coordinate your care. You only pay the PCP Co -payment listed on your Outline of Coverage or your Summary of Benefits and Coverage if you use a Provider who practices in a PCP office and is one of the get Prior Approval to use Non -Network Providers to receive Preferred benefits. For some services, your Plan provides standard benefits. For other services (see list below), you receive no benefits when you use Non-Network Providers. Your Plan reserves the right to direct you to contracted Providers. In most circumstances, your Plan only approves services from Non-Network Providers at the highest level of benefits (Preferred benefits) if appropriate services are not available within the Network. You may request Prior Approval to see a Non-Network Provider if there is not a Network Provider with appropriate training and experience to provide the Medically Necessary services needed to meet your particular health care needs. In this case, if you get Prior Approval, the Cost-Sharing will be the same as if the service was obtained by a Network Provider and you will not pay the balance between the Provider's charge and the Allowed Amount.4Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) If you get Prior Approval to use a Non-Network Provider for reasons other than when there is not a Network Provider who can provide the Medically Necessary services, your Plan pays the Allowed Amount and you pay any balance between the Provider's charge and what your Plan pays. You must also pay any applicable Cost -Sharing amounts (Deductibles, Co -insurance and Co- payments). See your Outline of Coverage or your Summary of Benefits and Coverage . If you use one of the following Provider types that is not a Network Provider, your Plan will not cover your care and you must pay the full cost: \u0083athletic trainers; \u0083cardiac rehabilitation counseling Providers (including registered dieticians, licensed nutritionists, certified diabetic educators, medical doctors, naturopaths, doctors of osteopathy and nurse Providers (if your Plan includes routine vision benefits); \u0083Skilled Nursing Facilities; and \u0083Telemedicine Providers. Standard Benefits You may be eligible for standard benefits if you receive certain services from a Provider who is not in BCBSVT's Network (a Non -Network Provider) without receiving Prior Approval from BCBSVT. To get standard benefits, you must meet the General Guidelines in this section. You may receive standard benefits for the following services without using a Network Provider or getting Prior Approval if you follow all other guidelines in this document: \u0083office visits (other than for Primary Care); \u0083home care; \u0083General Hospital care (except for services on the Prior Approval list in this document, which always require Prior Approval); \u0083Outpatient care in a General Hospital or ambulatory surgical center; \u0083Skilled Nursing Facility services; and \u0083therapy services. For all other Non -Network services, you must receive Prior Approval or your care will not be Covered. Refer to the Non-Network Providers section above for more information. When not following the guidelines for Preferred benefits, try to use a Provider that has a participating agreement with BCBSVT or a local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan. Out ofArea Providers If you need care outside of Vermont, you may save money by using Providers that are Network Providers with their local Blue Plan. See the BlueCard\u00ae Program section below. You must get Prior Approval for most Non -Network care. BlueCard\u00ae Program In certain situations (as described elsewhere in this document), you may obtain health care services outside of the Vermont service area. The claims for these services may be processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program1. Typically, when accessing care outside of the service area, you will obtain care from health care Providers that have a contractual agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, you may obtain care from health care Providers that have contracts with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans (e.g., Participating or Preferred Providers). If you obtain care from a contracting Provider in another geographic area, BCBSVT will honor their contract with you, including all Cost-Sharing provisions and providing benefits for Covered services as long as you fulfill other requirements specified in this document. The Host Blue will receive claims from its contracting Providers for your care and submit those claims directly to BCBSVT. BCBSVT will base the amount you pay on these claims processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program on the lower of: \u0083The billed Covered charges for your Covered services; or \u0083The price that the Host Blue makes available to BCBSVT. 1 In order to receive Network Provider benefits as defined for ancillary services, ancillary Providers such as independent clinical laboratories, Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers and specialty pharmacies must contract directly with the Blue Plan in the state where the services were ordered or delivered. To verify Provider participation status, please call customer service at the number listed on the back of your ID card.5Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Special Case: Value-Based Programs If you receive Covered services under a value-based program inside a Host Blue's service area, you may be responsible for paying any of the Provider incentives, risk sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are part of such an arrangement. Out-of-Area Services with non -contracting Providers In certain situations, you may receive Covered health care services from health care Providers outside of the service area that does not have a contract with the Host Blue. In most cases, BCBSVT will base the amount you pay for such services on either the Host Blue's local payment or the pricing arrangements under applicable state law. In some cases, BCBSVT may base the amount you pay for such services on billed Covered charges, the payment BCBSVT would make if the services had been obtained within BCBSVT's service area or a special negotiated payment. In these situations, you may owe the difference between the amount that the non -contracting Provider bills and the payment BCBSVT makes for the Covered services as set forth above. For contracting or non -contracting Providers, in no event will you be entitled to benefits for health care services, wherever you received them, that are specifically excluded from, or in the excess of, the limits of coverage provided by the Plan. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Program If you are outside the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, (the \"BlueCard Service Area\"), you may be able to take advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Program when accessing Covered services. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Program helps you get care through a network of Inpatient, Outpatient and Professional Providers, the network is not hosted by Blue plans. When you receive care from Providers outside the BlueCard Service Area, you will typically have to pay the Providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these services. If you need medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the BlueCard Service Area, please call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center at (800) 810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at (804) 673-1 177 , 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An assistance coordinator, working with a medical professional, can arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. Inpatient Services In most cases, if you contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center for assistance, hospitals will not require you to pay for covered Inpatient services, except for your Cost-Sharing amounts. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center to begin claims processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for Covered services. Outpatient Services Physicians, urgent care centers, and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard Service Area will typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for Covered services. Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core Claim When you pay for Covered services outside the BlueCard Service Area, you must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, you should complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core International claim form and send the claim form with the Provider's itemized bill(s) to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following the instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of your claim. The claim form is available from BCBSVT, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If you need assistance with your claim submission, you should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core Service Center at (800) 810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at (804) 673-1 177 , 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How BCBSVT Chooses Providers BCBSVT chooses Network Providers by checking their backgrounds. BCBSVT uses standards of the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA). BCBSVT chooses Network Providers who can provide the best care for BCBSVT Participants. BCBSVT does not reward Providers or staff for denying services. BCBSVT does not encourage Providers to withhold care. Please understand that BCBSVT's Network Providers are not employees of BCBSVT. They just contract with BCBSVT . 6Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Access to Care Your Plan requires its Network Providers in the State of Vermont to provide care for you: \u0083immediately when you have an Emergency Medical Condition; \u0083within 24 hours when you need Urgent Services; \u0083within two weeks when you need non -Emergency, non -Urgent Services; \u0083within 90 days when you need Preventive Services (including routine physical examinations); \u0083within 30 days when you need routine laboratory services, imaging, general optometry, and all other routine services. If you live in the State of Vermont, you should find: \u0083a Network Primary Care Provider (like a family practitioner, pediatrician or internist) within a 30-minute drive from your home; \u0083routine, office-based mental health and/or substance use disorder treatment from a Network Provider within a 30-minute drive; and \u0083a Network Pharmacy within a 60-minute drive. You'll find specialists for most common types of care within a 60-minute drive from your home. They include optometry, laboratory, imaging and Inpatient medical Rehabilitation Providers, as well as intensive Outpatient, partial hospital, residential or Inpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment services. You can find Network Providers for less common specialty care within a 90-minute drive. This includes kidney transplantation, major trauma treatment, neonatal intensive care and tertiary-level cardiac care. BCBSVT's Network Providers offer reasonable access for other complex specialty services including major burn care, organ transplants and specialty pediatric care. BCBSVT may direct you to a specialty Network Provider to ensure you get quality care for less common medical procedures. For many types of care, you may use Non -Network Providers. If you do use a Non -Network Provider, you may pay more for the cost of your care. After hours and Emergency Care Emergency Medical Services In an emergency, you need care right away. Please read the definition of an Emergency Medical Condition in Chapter Nine.Emergencies might include: \u0083broken bones; \u0083heart attack; or \u0083poisoning. You will receive care right away in an emergency. If you have an emergency at home or away, call 9-1-1 or go to the nearest doctor or emergency room. You don't need Prior Approval for emergency care. If an out-of-area hospital admits you, call BCBSVT as soon as reasonably possible. If you receive Medically Necessary, Covered Emergency Medical Services from a Non -Network Provider, BCBSVT will cover your emergency care as if you had been treated by a Network Provider. You must pay any Cost- Sharing amounts listed in your Outline of Coverage as if you received those services from a Network Provider. These may include Deductibles, Co -insurance or Co-payments. If a Non -Network Provider requests any payment from you other than your Cost-Sharing amounts, please contact BCBSVT at the number on the back of your ID card, so that BCBSVT can work directly with the Provider to resolve the request. Care After Office Hours In most non -emergency cases, call your Provider's office when you need care, even after office hours. Your Provider (or a covering Provider) can help you 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Do you have questions about care after hours? Ask now before you have an urgent problem. Keep your doctor's phone number handy in case of late-night illnesses or injuries. BCBSVT also offers Telemedicine services that allow you to see a licensed Provider via computer, tablet or telephone anytime. See Telemedicine Services on page 18. How Your Plan Determines Your Benefits When BCBSVT receives your claim, it determines: \u0083if your Plan covers the Medical services you received; and \u0083your benefit amount. In general, your Plan pays the Allowed Amount (explained later in this section). BCBSVT may subtract any: \u0083benefits (explained below); \u0083amounts paid or due from other insurance carriers through coordination of benefits (see Chapter Five).7Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Your Deductible, Co -insurance and Co -payment amounts appear on your Outline of Coverage and your Summary of Benefits and Coverage . Your Plan may limit benefits to the Plan Year maximums, which are also shown on these documents. Payment Terms Allowed Amount The Allowed Amount is the amount your Plan considers reasonable for a Covered service or supply. Notes: \u0083Network Providers accept the Allowed Amount as full payment. You do not have to pay the difference between their total charges and the Allowed Amount. \u0083If you use a Non -Network Provider, your Plan pays the Allowed Amount and you must pay any balance between the Provider's charge and what your Plan pays. Cost-Sharing Cost-Sharing are the costs for Covered services that you pay out of your own pocket. This includes Deductibles, Co -payments, and Co -insurance, or similar charges, but it doesn't include premiums, any balance between the Provider's charge and what your Plan pays for Non -Network Providers, or the cost of non -Covered services. All information about your Deductible amounts, type of Deductible, Co-payments and Co -insurance amounts, and type of Out-of-Pocket Limits is shown on your Outline of Coverage and your Summary of Benefits and Coverage . Deductible You must meet your Deductibles each Plan Year before your Plan make payments on certain services. Your Plan applies your Deductible to your Out-of-Pocket Limit for each Plan Year. You may have more than one Deductible. Deductibles can apply to certain services or certain Provider types. When your family meets the family Deductible, no one in the family needs to pay Deductibles for the rest of the Plan Year. Aggregate Deductible Your Plan may have an Aggregate Deductible. If your Plan has this Deductible, and you are on a two-person, parent and Child or family plan, you do not have an individual Deductible. Covered expenses must meet the family Deductible before any of your family members receive post- Deductible benefits unless a single individual on the plan meets their Out-of-Pocket Limit, in which case your Plan pays 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for eligible services for that individual for the rest of the Plan Year. Stacked Deductible Your Plan may have a Stacked Deductible. If your Plan has this Deductible, and you are on a two -person, parent and Child or family plan, a covered family member may meet the individual Deductible and begin receiving post-Deductible benefits. When your family's Covered expenses reach the family Deductible, all family members receive post-Deductible benefits. Co-payment You must pay Co -payments to Providers for specific services. You may have different Co -payments depending on the Provider you see. Your Provider may require payment at the time of the service. Your Plan applies Co -payments toward your Out-of-Pocket-Limit for each Plan Year. Co-insurance You must pay Co -insurance to Providers for specific services. Your Plan calculates the Co -insurance amount by multiplying the Co -insurance percentage by the Allowed Amount after you meet your Deductible (for services subject to a Deductible). Your Plan applies your Co -insurance toward your Out-of-Pocket Limit for each Plan Year. Out-of-Pocket Limit Your Plan applies your Deductible, your Co -payments and your Co -insurance toward your Out-of-Pocket Limit. After you meet your Out-of-Pocket Limit, you pay no Co -insurance or Co -payments for the rest of that Plan Year for Covered services. When your family meets the family Out-of-Pocket Limit, all family members are considered to have met their individual Out-of-Pocket Limits. You may have separate Out-of-Pocket Limits for certain services (and if you have a Prescription Drug coverage, you may have separate Out-of-Pocket Limits for pharmacy benefits).8Guidelines for Coverage University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Aggregate Out-of-Pocket Limit Your Plan may have an Aggregate Out-of-Pocket Limit. If your Plan has this limit, and you're on a two -person, parent and Child or family plan, and you do not have an individual Out-of-Pocket Limit, your family members' Covered expenses must reach the family Out-of-Pocket Limit before your Plan pays 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for eligible services. When your family's expenses reach this amount, your Plan will begin to pay 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for the rest of the Plan Year for Covered services. Some two-person, parent and Child or family plans include individual Out-of-Pocket Limits. If your Plan does, a covered family member may meet the individual Out -of-Pocket Limit and your Plan will begin to pay 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for that covered family member. Stacked Out-of-Pocket Limit Your Plan may have a Stacked Out-of-Pocket Limit. If your Plan has this limit, and you are on a two-person, parent and Child or family plan, a covered family member may meet the individual Out-of-Pocket Limit and your Plan will begin to pay 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for his or her services. Additionally, any combination of covered family members may meet the family Out -of-Pocket Limit and your Plan will begin to pay 100 percent of the Allowed Amount for all family members' eligible services for the rest of the Plan Year for Covered services. Plan Year Benefit Maximums Your Plan Year benefit maximums are listed on your Outline of Coverage and your Summary of Benefits and Coverage .

Self-Pay Allowed by HIPAA Federal law gives you the right to keep your Provider from telling your Plan that you received a particular health care item or service. You must pay the Provider the Allowed Amount directly. The amount you pay your Provider will not count toward your Deductible, other Cost-Sharing obligations or your Out-of-Pocket Limits.Third Party Premium Payments Third parties, including Hospitals and other Providers, are not allowed to make your premium payments. Your Plan reserves the right to reject such payments. Your Plan only accepts premium and Cost -Sharing payments made by Participants or on behalf of Participants by the following: \u0083The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program; \u0083local, state, or federal government programs, including grantees directed by a government program to make payments on its behalf, that provide premium support for specific individuals; \u0083Indian tribes, tribal organizations/governments, and urban Indian organizations; \u0083Immediate Family Member; \u0083religious institutions and other not- for profit organizations when: the assistance is provided on the basis of the insured's financial need; the organization is not a health care Provider; and the organization is financially disinterested (that is the organization does not receive funding from entities with a financial interest in the payment for services).9Covered Services University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) CHAPTER TWO Covered Services This chapter describes Covered services, guidelines and policy rules for obtaining benefits.

Claim Submission BCBSVT must receive your claim within 12 months after you receive a service, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. If you file a claim more than 12 months after you receive a service, your Plan may not provide benefits. Your claim must include all information necessary to administer your benefits. This includes information relating to other coverage you have. Network Providers will usually submit claims on your behalf if this is your primary coverage (see Chapter 5). When you use Non -Network Providers, you must file your own claims. You can find a Member Claim Form at www.bcbsvt.com/member/member-forms or request one by calling the customer service number on the back of your ID card. Release of Information BCBSVT may need records, verbal statements or other information to administer your benefits. By accepting your benefits under your Plan, you give BCBSVT the right to obtain, from any source, any information it needs. Approval of your benefits depends on you providing sufficient information, even if your Plan pays for benefits before you do. To avoid duplicate payments, BCBSVT may inform other entities that provide benefits about your claim. A signed Authorization to Release Information form from any Dependent over the age of 12 is required before discussing any claims with you. Cooperation You must fully cooperate with your Plan and BCBSVT to receive benefits. BCBSVT may require you to provide signed or recorded statements. You must provide all reasonably required information. Otherwise, your Plan may deny benefits.Payment of Benefits Your Plan pays Vermont Network Providers directly. Your Plan usually pays out -of-state Network Providers directly. Your Plan usually pays you when you use Non -Network Providers. Your Plan reserves the right to pay Non -Network Providers directly. If your Plan pays you directly, you are responsible for paying your Non -Network Provider. You may not assign or transfer your benefit rights under this document to another party, including a Non -Network Provider, without the Plan's express written consent. Any attempt to assign by you without express written consent shall be deemed void and the assignee shall acquire no rights. Regardless of the prohibition on assignment, the Plan may, in its sole discretion, pay a Non -Network Provider directly for Covered services. Any payments made by the Plan will discharge its obligation to pay for Covered services. The Plan's payment to a Non -Network Provider, routine processing of a claim form, issuing payment at a Non -Network Provider rate, or denying informal or formal appeal(s) does not constitute a waiver by the Plan and the Plan shall retain a full reservation of all rights and defenses to enforce this provision For information on how your Plan determines your benefit amount, see Chapter One. The fact that your Plan provides benefits in one instance does not obligate your Plan do so again. Payment in Error/Overpayments If your Plan provides more benefits than it should, your Plan has the right to recover the overpayment. If your Plan pays benefits to you incorrectly, your Plan may require you to repay them. If so, you will be notified. You must cooperate with your Plan and BCBSVT during recovery. Your Plan may reduce or withhold future benefits to recover incorrect payments. Regardless of whether your Plan seeks recovery, a wrong payment on one occasion will not obligate your Plan to provide benefits on another occasion. How BCBSVT Evaluates Technology Your Plan has delegated to BCBSVT the responsibilities to establish medical policies to facilitate the administration of benefits. BCBSVT's Medical Policy committee (consisting of doctors, nurses, and other Professionals) meets periodically to establish, review, update and revise medical policies. Medical policies document whether a new or existing health care technology has been 26Claims University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) scientifically validated to improve health outcomes for specific illnesses, injuries or conditions. Outcomes could include length or quality of life or functional ability. Your Plan does not cover technology that is Investigational or Experimental. To be Covered a technology must: \u0083have final approval from the appropriate governmental regulatory bodies; \u0083be of such a nature as to be able to permit conclusions concerning its effect on health outcomes; \u0083be documented in peer-reviewed literature to measurably improve net health outcomes; \u0083be as beneficial as any established alternatives; and \u0083be attainable outside the Investigational setting. BCBSVT may rely on numerous sources of information and expertise when reviewing a new technology or application. Complaints and Appeals When You Have a Complaint Customer Service You may make an inquiry to BCBSVT's customer service team at any time if you have concerns. This is usually the best, first course of action. BCBSVT's customer service team can solve most problems. Contact BCBSVT's customer service team at the number printed on the back of your ID card. Please have your ID card handy when you call. Also, call if you need help understanding the denial of coverage for a service. If You Don't Agree with a Coverage Decision You are entitled to several levels of review of coverage decisions: \u0083You may make a complaint with customer service . You can make a medical complaint if you have problems with the medical care or advice that you got from your doctor. You may also make a non -medical complaint. Non -medical complaints might be about: Plan's times for visits; After-hours access to your doctor; or The service at your doctor's office. \u0083You may file a first-level internal appeal . You may do this without making a complaint to customer service. If you make a complaint with customer service as outlined above, the complaint counts as the first-level internal appeal. Your Plan requires that you file a first level appeal before you take judicial action. \u0083If you don't agree with the decision after your first-level appeal, you may file a second-level internal appeal . You may choose to meet with reviewers in person or by phone. Your health care Provider may participate. BCBSVT will work with you to schedule a time for this appeal. This appeal is voluntary and free to you. Your decision to pursue or not to pursue a second- level appeal will not affect your right to pursue other avenues. \u0083In some circumstances, you may request that the State of Vermont do an independent external review of the decision. You do this by calling the State at (800) 964 -1784. Reviewers Reviewers are selected for their clinical expertise and/ or their benefits knowledge. In some cases, your health care provider may call BCBSVT to discuss your case with the Provider reviewer. This usually happens prior to the first-level internal appeal. A separate reviewer conducts each level of appeal above. None of the reviewers will be the person who first denied your claim. If your first-level appeal is clinical in nature, at least one of the reviewers will be the clinical peer of the health care Provider that provided, or seeks to provide, the service that is the subject of the appeal. Timing of Appeals If your appeal involves Emergency Medical Services or Urgent Services, a review of your appeal will be conducted as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after receipt. When you file an appeal to extend Urgent Services that were previously approved and you are currently receiving (Urgent Concurrent review), the review of your appeal will occur within 24 hours. You must make the appeal at least 24 hours before the care previously approved will end or your appeal will be treated as a regular appeal. For other appeals related to services not yet provided, you will be notified of the decision within 30 days of receiving your appeal. For all other appeals, you will be notified of the decision within 60 days of receiving your appeal request. When you file an appeal about a denial of benefits, you must do so within 180 calendar days of when you receive the denial. When you file a second-level appeal, you must do so within 90 calendar days of the decision. When requesting an independent review, you must do so within 120 days of the decision. If you opt for an internal second-level appeal, the time you spend pursuing it will not count toward the 120 days.27Claims University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) How to Request an Appeal You or someone you name to act for you (your authorized representative) may request an appeal review. Your doctor may serve as your representative. At any time, you can get help with filing your appeal from BCBSVT's customer service team. You can also get help from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation at (800) 964-1784. To file an emergency or urgent concurrent appeal, call the number on the back of your ID card.

Information About Your Claim If you appeal, you will receive instructions on how to supply relevant information. You may submit documents, records or other information about your appeal. You may request copies of information about your claim (free of charge) by contacting BCBSVT at the number on the back of your ID card. BCBSVT will provide this immediately for an urgent or concurrent appeal or within two business days for other appeals. After the Decision If your appeal is urgent or concurrent, after a decision has been made, you and your health care Provider (if known) will be notified by phone right away with follow up in writing within 24 hours. In all other cases, you will be notified of the decision by mail. At any point during the appeal review process, the initial decision may be overturned. If the decision is overturned, your Plan will provide coverage or payment for your health care item or service.

It applies, for instance, when a person covered under your Plan has other coverage. Remember, you must disclose information about all other coverage to BCBSVT. Coordination of Benefits This chapter applies when another health plan or insurance policy provides benefits for some or all of the same expenses as your Plan. (For the purposes of this chapter, the other party is called a \"payer.\") Your benefits may be reduced so that the sum of the reduced benefits and all benefits payable for Covered services by the other payer does not exceed your Plan's Allowed Amount for Covered services. Your Plan coordinates benefits based on coverage, not actual payment. Your Plan treats the following benefits as \"payment\" from another payer: \u0083any benefits that would be payable if you made a claim (even if you don't); and/or \u0083benefits in the form of services. When two payers coordinate benefits, one becomes \"primary\" and one becomes \"secondary.\" The primary payer considers the claim first and makes its benefit determination. The secondary payer then makes payment based on any amount the primary payer did not Cover. Your Plan determines whether it is the \"primary\" or \"secondary\" payer according to guidelines of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The guidelines say that, in general, if the other payer has no coordination of benefits provision or has a different provision than your Plan, that payer is primary. If the other payer uses the NAIC provisions, your Plan determines who is primary as follows: \u0083the payer covering a patient as an employee (Participant) is primary to a payer who covers him or her as a Dependent; \u0083if a Child or Incapacitated Dependent is the patient, your Plan uses the NAIC \"Birthday Rule,\" which makes the coverage of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the calendar year (without regard to year of birth) the primary payer; and \u0083when the above two rules don't apply, the coverage with the earliest effective date is primary and the other is secondary. Coordination of Benefits for Children of Divorced Parents If two or more plans cover a Dependent Child of divorced or separated parents, a court often decrees that one parent should be responsible for the health coverage of the Child. In that case, the plan of the parent with that responsibility is primary. If no such decree exists, benefits are determined in this order: \u0083the plan of the parent with custody of the Child; then \u0083the plan of the Spouse/Party to a Civil Union of the parent with custody (if he or she covers the Child); then \u0083the plan of the parent who does not have custody of the Child; and finally \u0083the plan of the Spouse/Party to a Civil Union or Domestic Partner of the parent who does not have custody. If a court decrees that parents will share custody of the Child, without stating that one parent is responsible for health care expenses for the Child, your Plan uses the \"Birthday Rule\" described above. In an Accident If you have an accident and you are covered for accident-related expenses under any of the following types of coverage, the other payer is primary and your Plan is secondary: \u0083any kind of auto \u0083financial responsibility insurance coverage that you did not purchase; or \u0083any other property and liability insurance providing medical expense payments. Reimbursement If another health plan provides benefits that your Plan should have paid, BCBSVT has the right to reimburse the other health plan directly. That payment satisfies your Plan's obligation. Medicaid and Tricare Your Plan will always be \"primary\" payer to Medicaid or Tricare (for military personnel, military retirees, and their Dependents). Tricare and Medicaid are always secondary payers.29Other Party Liability University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Your Plan's Right to Subrogation If another person or organization caused or contributed to your illness or injuries, or is supposed to pay for your treatment (such as another carrier), then your Plan has a right to collect back for the benefits provided by your Plan. This is called the \"right of subrogation.\" In this section, the person or organization shall be referred to as a \"third party.\" The third party might or might not be an insurer. Your Plan's right of subrogation means that: \u0083If your Plan pays benefits for your health care services and then you recover expenses fo r those services from a third party through a suit, settlement or other means, you must reimburse your Plan before any other party. Your Plan will have a lien on your recovery from a third party up to the amount of benefits paid. \u0083Regardless of whether the other party admits liability and regardless of whether the funds you recover are specified for recovery as medical expenses your Plan may recover anything it paid. \u0083You must reimburse your Plan whether or not you have been \"made whole\" by the third party. Your Plan reserves the right to reduce what you owe to cover a share of attorneys' fees and other costs you incur in the process. Your Plan will be responsible for only those fees to which it agrees to pay in writing. \u0083Your Plan reserves the right to bring a lawsuit in your name or in its name against a third party or parties to recover benefits your Plan advanced. Your Plan may also settle its claim with a third party. \u0083This right of subrogation extends to any kind of auto, workers' compensation, property or liability insurance providing medical expense payments. \u0083You must cooperate with BCBSVT and furnish information and assistance that your Plan requires to enforce its rights. \u0083You must take no action interfering with your Plan's rights and interest. \u0083If you refuse to reimburse BCBSVT or your Plan, or fail to cooperate, either entity may take legal action against you. Your Plan or BCBSVT on behalf of your Plan may seek reimbursement from the funds you recovered from a third party, up to the amount of benefits it paid. You must also pay attorney's fees and collection expenses incurred by your Plan or BCBSVT at the direction of your Plan. Your Plan may reduce or withhold future benefits to recover what you owe. \u0083You agree that you will not settle your claim against a third party without first notifying BCBSVT. In some cases, your Plan will compromise the amount of its claim. Neither BCBSVT nor your Plan shall be responsible for expenses incurred by you in pursuit of yo ur Plan's rights. Cooperation You must fully cooperate to protect your Plan's rights to coordination, reimbursement or subrogation. Cooperation Includes: \u0083providing BCBSVT all information relevant to your claim or eligibility for benefits under your Plan; \u0083providing any actions needed to assure your Plan is able to obtain a full recovery of the costs of benefits provided; \u0083obtaining BCBSVT consent before providing any release from liability for medical expenses; and \u0083not taking any action that would prejudice BCBSVT or your Plan's rights to coordination, reimbursement or subrogation. If you or your Dependent fails to cooperate, you will be responsible for all benefits your Plan provides and any costs incurred in obtaining repayment.30Membership Rights University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) CHAPTER SIX Membership Rights Statement of Rights As a Participant in your Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA provides that all plan participants shall be entitled to: Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits \u0083Examine, without charge, at the plan administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all documents governing the plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration. \u0083Obtain, upon written request to the plan administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated summary plan description. The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. \u0083Receive a summary of the plan's annual financial report. The plan administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. Continue Group Health Plan Coverage \u0083Continue health care coverage for yourself, spouse or dependents if there is a loss of coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event. You or your dependents may have to pay for such coverage. Review this summary plan description and the documents governing the plan on the rules governing your COBRA continuation coverage rights. For more specific information, see page 31. You will not be eligible for subsidies through an Exchange offering Qualified Health Plans (like Vermont Health Connect) if you elect to continue your Group health plan coverage. Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries In addition to creating rights for plan participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the employee benefit plan. The people who operate your Plan, called \"fiduciaries\" of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a (pension, welfare) benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. Enforce Your Rights If your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $1 10 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in Federal court. If it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous. Assistance with Your Questions If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the plan administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the plan administrator, you should contact the nearest office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.31Membership Rights University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) Active Military Service Upon receipt of written request, BCBSVT will suspend coverage for active service military members. Your Plan will repay any subscription rates paid by someone actively serving in the military according to the proportion owed. Fraud, Misrepresentation or Concealment of a Material Fact If you or your employer (if applicable) obtain or attempt to obtain coverage or benefits through fraud, your Plan is void. If you are disenrolled due to fraud, BCBSVT will not provide any extension of benefits after your Plan is canceled. If you or any family member commits fraud, BCBSVT may use all remedies provided by law and in equity, including recovering from you any benefits provided, attorneys' fees, costs of suits and interest. Warning: It is a crime punishable by fines and imprisonment under Vermont law to make a claim under this Plan that contains material false statements or hides material information. Plan Reinstatement A canceled Plan may be reinstated solely at the discretion of your Plan and only on such terms and conditions as your Plan decides. Medicare Please note that this is not a Medicare supplement Contract. Your Plan will not provide benefits if you are Medicare-eligible unless otherwise required or permitted by federal law. Contact your employer to determine whether you can join the Medicare supplement plan offered through your Group. Court ordered Dependents In the case of an order issued in compliance with Vermont's Child medical support order law, the effective date will be three days after you mail the court order to BCBSVT or when BCBSVT receives the court order, whichever is sooner. If the court order specifies a different effective date, BCBSVT will use that date. BCBSVT will calculate any additional subscription costs from the effective date of enrollment. Please remember your request for Dependent coverage under any court order must include proof of the court order.Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSO) The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93) mandates that Group health plans provide benefits according to qualified medical child support order requirements. Contact your Plan Administrator to obtain, without charge, a copy of the QMCSO procedures. Continuation Coverage Rights Under COBRA You're getting this notice because you are gaining coverage under a group health plan (the Plan). This notice has important information about your right to COBRA continuation coverage, which is a temporary extension of coverage under the Plan. This notice explains COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it. When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. Please share this Notice with any individuals covered by the Plan, such as your spouse and dependent children. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you and other members of your family when group health coverage would otherwise end. For more information about your rights and obligations under the Plan and under federal law, you should review the Plan's Summary Plan Description or contact the Plan Administrator. Please review elsewhere in this document or contact your Plan Administrator for further information on your continuation coverage rights under COBRA . You may have other options available to you when you lose group health coverage. For example, you may be eligible to buy an individual plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. By enrolling in coverage through the Marketplace, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, you may qualify for a 30-day special enrollment period for another group health plan for which you are eligible (such as a spouse's plan), even if that plan generally doesn't accept late enrollees. What is COBRA continuation coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when it would otherwise end because of a life event. This is also called a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. 32Membership Rights University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Please review elsewhere in this document or contact your Plan Administrator for further information on electing COBRA continuation coverage. If you're an employee covered by the Plan, you'll become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: \u0083Your hours of employment are reduced, or \u0083Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If the Plan covers employee's spouses, your spouse will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: \u0083You die; \u0083Your hours of employment are reduced; \u0083Your employment ends for any reason other than gross misconduct; \u0083You become entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or \u0083You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. If the Plan covers dependent children, your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because of the following qualifying events: \u0083The parent-employee \u0083The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u0083The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); \u0083The parents become divorced or legally separated; or \u0083The child stops being eligible for coverage under the Plan as a \"dependent child.\" Please review elsewhere in this document or contact your Plan Administrator for further information on qualifying events.When is COBRA continuation coverage available? The Plan will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualified beneficiaries only after the Plan Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. Please review elsewhere in this document or contact your Plan Administrator for further information on when COBRA continuation coverage is available. How is COBRA continuation coverage provided? Once the Plan Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage that generally lasts for 18 months due to employment termination or reduction of hours of work. Certain qualifying events, or a second qualifying event during the initial period of coverage, may permit a beneficiary to receive a maximum of 36 months of coverage. There are also ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended: Disability extension of 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage If you or anyone in your family covered under the Plan is determined by Social Security to be disabled and you notify the Plan Administrator in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to get up to an additional 1 1 months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage. Please review elsewhere in this document or contact your Plan Administrator for further information on disability extension of COBRA continuation coverage. Second qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage If your family experiences another qualifying event during the 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if the Plan is 33Membership Rights University of Vermont Open Access Summary Plan Description (280-394) properly notified about the second qualifying event. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children getting COBRA continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies; becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); gets divorced or legally separated; or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the Plan as a dependent child. This extension is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. Are there other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage? Yes. Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov . If you are a Vermont resident, you can also learn about many of these options through Vermont Health Connect at https://portal.healthconnect.vermont.gov or by contacting Vermont Health Connect at (855) 899-9600.
