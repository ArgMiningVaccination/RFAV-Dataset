INTERACTIONS FAQS A: The vegetarian enzymes used in Similase\u00ae are produced through the fermentation of fungal organisms, including Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Saccharomyces. Some of the vegetarian enzyme products contain maltase, which is derived from malt barley. If a product contains maltase, it is not gluten-free. A: There are many scientific systems used for measuring enzyme activity. The most common enzyme measurement systems are Food Chemical Codex (FCC), United States Pharmacoepia (USP), and Federal Internationale Pharmaceutique (FIP). Each different enzyme measurement system has an enzyme assay method with its own units of measurements. For example, one of the enzyme measurements from protease is HUT (Hemoglobin Unit Tyrosine). Here are some common enzyme activity abbreviations:HUT = hemoglobin unit tyrosine PC = Bacterial Protease Unit DU = apha-amylase dextrinizing unit LU = lipase units PU = phytase units ALU = acid lactase unit CU = cellulase units INVU = inverted unitLacU = lactase activity unit SUPPORTS DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION OF NUTRIENTS* Similase is a comprehensive, proprietary blend of digestive enzymes to support the digestion of all food types.* Our formula provides comprehensive support for digestion and assimilation of nutrients from the diet.* Similase is a proprietary blend of microbial enzymes that are active across a broad pH range in the gastrointestinal tract.* As a result, Similase provides support of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fiber digestion.* SUPPORTS DIGESTION AND ASSIMILATION OF NUTRIENTS* Similase is a comprehensive, proprietary blend of digestive enzymes to support the digestion of all food types.* Our formula provides comprehensive support for digestion and assimilation of nutrients from the diet.* Similase is a proprietary blend of microbial enzymes that are active across a broad pH range in the gastrointestinal tract.* As a result, Similase provides support of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fiber digestion.* INGREDIENTS 563mg Microbial HUT -- Lactase I, II: FCC (pH 4.5); 1,600 ALU -- Lipase I, II: FCC (pH 7.0): 2,200 FIP -- CU Sucrase (Invertase): FCC (pH 4.5): 936 SU -- Phytase): FCC (pH 5.5): 1.7 FTU ** Daily Value (DV) not established Percent daily value is based on a 2000 calorie diet Other Ingredients Similase\u00ae Does Not Contain Dairy Colors Artificial Flavors Preservatives Other Details UPC: 871791000605 SKU: 74239 DIRECTIONS Similase\u00ae Directions and/or DosageAdults take 2 capsules at the beginning of each meal, up to 3 times daily, or as recommended by a healthcare professional.
