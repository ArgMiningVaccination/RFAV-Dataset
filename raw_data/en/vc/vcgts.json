Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana conceded defeat Friday in their fight to block two anti-abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last month to end constitutional protection for abortion.

On Thursday, the exploration of a new abortion law began with a meeting of a 14-member, Republican-dominated House committee.

In post-Roe America, money is now even more determinative of who can get an abortion and who can't, and abortion funds are emerging as an even more crucial mechanism to provide poor women in red states the opportunity to access care if they want or need it.

Since early childhood, she's had to deal with the mental and physical challenges of cerebral palsy and partial paralysis on the left side of her body after brain surgery. But her determination, drive and willingness to learn and teach other kids ways to tackle those challenges recently won her an award from Brain Injury Services, a nonprofit that provides services to people with brain injuries in Northern Virginia.

In the moment, it can be difficult to figure out how serious your injury is, what you should do next and what symptoms might signal a possible emergency.

In recent years, though, Murray has forgotten to turn off the ignition of his car before entering his Potomac townhouse. He has had to remind himself that his two young children were in the back seat. A light drinker, he has gone on benders. He has checked himself in at a hotel for no apparent reason. He lost his balance on a run along the C&O Canal, tumbling into a tree and rolling into the water. At 56, Murray is among the former athletes likely to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma.

The Supreme Court, for its part, regularly resisted attempts at politicization, insisting on stare decisis.
