Version 9 (Updated August 18, 2020) CS249275-AThis checklist is a step-by-step guide to help clinic coordinators/supervisors overseeing vaccination clinics held at satellite, temporary, or off- site locations follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and best practices for vaccine shipment, transport, storage, handling, preparation, administration, and documentation. These CDC guidelines and best practices are essential for patient safety and vaccine effectiveness. This checklist should be used in any non-traditional vaccination clinic settings, such as workplaces, community centers, schools, makeshift clinics in remote areas, and medical facilities when vaccination occurs in the public areas or classrooms. Temporary clinics also include mass vaccination events, walk-through, curbside, and drive-through clinics, and vaccination clinics held during pandemic preparedness exercises. A clinic coordinator/supervisor at the site should complete, sign, and date this checklist EACH TIME a vaccination clinic is held . To meet accountability and quality assurance standards, all signed checklists should be kept on file by the company that provided clinic staffing. This document also contains sections, marked in red, that outline best practices for vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. For continued up-to-date guidance, please visit www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html. INSTRUCTIONS 1. A staff member who will be at the vaccination clinic should be designated as the clinic coordinator/supervisor. This person will be responsible for completing the steps below and will be referred to as \"you\" in these instructions. 2. Review this checklist during the planning stage of the vaccination clinic\u2014well in advance of the date(s) when the clinic will be held. This checklist includes sections to be completed before, during, and after the clinic. 3. Critical guidelines for patient safety and vaccine effectiveness are identified by the stop sign icon: . If you check \"NO\" in ONE OR MORE answer boxes that contain a , DO NOT move forward with the clinic. Follow your organization's protocols and/or contact your state or local health department for guidance BEFORE proceeding with the clinic. Do not administer any vaccine until you have confirmed you can move forward with the clinic. 4. Contact your organization and/or health department if you have any concerns about whether vaccine was transported, stored, handled, or administered correctly, whether patients' personal information was protected appropriately, or other responses that you have marked as \"NO\" in rows that do not have the . 5. This checklist should be used in conjunction with CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf. For information about specific vaccines, consult the vaccine manufacturer's package insert. 6. This checklist applies ONLY to vaccines stored at REFRIGERATED temperatures (i.e., between 2-8\u00b0 Celsius or 36-46\u00b0 Fahrenheit). 7. Sign and date the checklist upon completion of the clinic or completion of your shift (whichever comes first). ( If more than one clinic coordinator/ supervisor is responsible for different aspects of the clinic, you should complete only the section(s) for which you were responsible. ) 8. Attach the staff sign-in sheet (with shift times and date) to the checklist (or checklists if more than one clinic supervisor is overseeing different shifts) and submit the checklist(s) to your organization to be kept on file for accountability.

Vaccine was shipped directly to the facility/clinic site, where adequate storage is available. ( Direct shipment is preferred for cold chain integrity .) VACCINE TRANSPORT (IF IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO SHIP VACCINES DIRECTLY TO THE FACILITY/CLINIC SITE) YES NO N.A. Vaccines were transported using a portable vaccine refrigerator or qualified container and packout designed to transport vaccines within the temperature range recommended by the manufacturers (i.e., between 2-8\u00b0 Celsius or 36-46\u00b0 Fahrenheit for ALL refrigerated vaccines). Coolers available at general merchandise stores or coolers used to transport food are NOT ACCEPTABLE . See CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit for information on qualified containers and packouts : www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling- toolkit.pdf. The person transporting the vaccines confirmed that manufacturer instructions for packing configuration and proper conditioning of coolants were followed. (Your qualified container and packout should include packing instructions. If not, contact the company for instructions on proper packing procedures.) The person transporting the vaccines confirmed that all vaccines were transported in the passenger compartment of the vehicle (NOT in the vehicle trunk). A digital data logger with a buffered probe and a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing was placed directly with the vaccines and used to monitor vaccine temperature during transport. The amount of vaccine transported was limited to the amount needed for the workday. VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING (UPON ARRIVAL AT FACILITY/CLINIC) YES NO N.A. If vaccines were shipped, the shipment arrived within the appropriate time frame (according to manufacturer or distributor guidelines) and in good condition. If the vaccine shipment contained a cold chain monitor (CCM), it was checked upon arrival at the facility/clinic, and there was no indication of a temperature excursion (i.e., out-of-range temperature) during transit. CCMs are stored in a separate compartment of the shipping container (a CCM may not be included when vaccines are shipped directly from the manufacturer). Note: CCMs are for one-time use and should be thrown away after being checked. Upon arrival at the facility/clinic (either by shipment or transport), vaccines were immediately unpacked and placed in proper storage equipment (i.e., a portable vaccine refrigerator or qualified container and packout specifically designed and tested to maintain the manufacturer- recommended temperature range). Follow the guidance for unpacking and storing vaccines specified in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf . Upon arrival at the facility/clinic, vaccines were still within the manufacturer-recommended temperature range ( i.e., between 2-8\u00b0 Celsius or 36-46\u00b0 Fahrenheit for ALL refrigerated vaccines). Upon arrival at the facility/clinic, vaccines remained protected from light (per manufacturer's package insert) until ready for use at the vaccination clinic. Upon arrival at the facility/clinic, expiration dates of vaccines and any medical equipment (syringes, needles, alcohol wipes) being used were checked, and they had not expired. CLINIC PREPARATION AND SUPPLIES YES NO N.A. A contingency plan is in place in case vaccines need to be replaced. The plan addresses scenarios for vaccine compromised before arrival at the clinic and for vaccine compromised during clinic hours. An emergency medical kit (including epinephrine and equipment for maintaining an airway) is at the site for the duration of the clinic. All vaccination providers at the site are certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), are familiar with the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, know their role in an emergency, and know the location of epinephrine and are trained in its indications and use. There is a designated area at the site for management of patients with urgent medical problems (e.g., fainting). Adequate infection control supplies are provided, including biohazard containers and supplies for hand hygiene. If administering injectable vaccines, adhesive bandages, individually packaged sterile alcohol wipes, and a sufficient number of sterile needles and syringes and a sharps container are provided. Staff members administering vaccines have reviewed vaccine manufacturer instructions for administration before the vaccination clinic. If using a standing order protocol, the protocol is current and available at the clinic/facility site. A process for screening for contraindications and precautions is in place. A sufficient number of vaccine information statements (VISs or Emergency Use Authorization [EUA]) forms, if required) for each vaccine being offered is available at the clinic/facility site.

A designated clean area for vaccine preparation has been identified and set up prior to the clinic. A qualified individual has been designated to oversee infection control at the clinic. PREVENTING TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19 AT THE CLINIC YES NO N.A. Sufficient supply of PPE for staff is available, including face masks, gloves, and, if appropriate, eye shields. Sufficient supply of face coverings is available for visitors and patients who may not have one. Sufficient hand sanitizer is available so that staff and patients can repeatedly practice hand hygiene. Cleaning supplies are available so workspaces can be cleaned regularly (note the amount needed may be more than normally required). (See EPA's Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19.) Additional controls, such as counters and plastic shields, are in place to minimize contact where patients and staff interact (e.g., registration or screening areas). Signs, barriers, and floor markers to instruct patients to remain 6 feet apart from other patients and clinic staff have been set up before the clinic. Sufficient supply of thermometers to check patient temperatures prior to entering the vaccination clinic and COVID symptom checklists. DURING THE CLINIC (Please complete each item while the clinic is occurring and review at the end of your shift.) VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING (AT FACILITY/CLINIC) YES NO N.A. Vaccines are being kept in proper storage equipment that maintains the manufacturer-recommended temperature range ( i.e., a portable vaccine refrigerator or qualified container and packout specifically designed and tested to maintain correct temperatures when opened and closed during the clinic). Vaccine temperature is being monitored during the clinic using a digital data logger with a buffered probe (placed directly with vaccines) and a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing. Follow the monitoring guidance specified in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/toolkit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf. If vaccines are being stored in a storage unit at the site, vaccine temperature data are being reviewed and documented a minimum of 2 times during each clinic workday (preferably at the beginning and middle of an 8-hour shift) to ensure they remain at correct temperatures ( i.e., between 2-8\u00b0 Celsius or 36-46\u00b0 Fahrenheit for ALL refrigerated vaccines ). If you are a VFC provider, check with your state immunization program for specific requirements for vaccine temperature monitoring during mass vaccination clinics . If vaccines cannot be stored in a storage unit at the site, they are being kept in the portable vaccine refrigerator or qualified packout with a temperature monitoring device (with a probe in a thermal buffer) placed as close as possible to the vaccines, and temperatures are being read and recorded at least once an hour . The container is being kept closed as much as possible. Vaccines are being protected from light during the vaccination clinic per the manufacturer's package insert. VACCINE PREPARATION YES NO N.A. Expiration dates of vaccines (and diluents, if applicable) are being checked again during preparation, and only vaccines that have not expired are being administered. (Note: If you are using multidose vials, be sure to review beyond use dates, along with expiration dates.) Vaccines are being prepared in a clean, designated medication area, away from any potentially contaminated items. If using reconstituted vaccines, they are being prepared according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Vaccines are being prepared at the time of administration. If vaccines are predrawn from a multidose vial, only the contents of 1 multidose vial are being drawn up at one time by each staff member administering vaccines (the maximum number of doses per vial is described in the package insert). If using single-dose or multidose vials, syringes are being labeled with the name of the vaccine. Once drawn up, vaccines are being kept in the recommended temperature range. ( Questions about specific time limits for being out of the recommended temperature range should be referred to the manufacturer .) VACCINE ADMINISTRATION YES NO N.A. Vaccine information statements (VISs or Emergency Use Authorization [EUA] forms, if required) are being provided to every patient, parent, or guardian before vaccination (as required by federal law). All patients are being screened for contraindications and precautions for the specific vaccine(s) in use before receiving that vaccine(s).

Staff is using proper hygiene techniques to clean hands before vaccine administration, between patients, and anytime hands become soiled. www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/providers/index.html If gloves are being worn by staff administering vaccines, they are being changed and hands are being cleaned using proper hygiene techniques between patients. Staff is triple-checking labels, contents, and expiration dates or beyond use dates (as noted in the manufacturer's package insert, if applicable) before administering vaccine. Vaccines are normal in appearance (i.e., not discolored, without precipitate, and easily resuspended when shaken). Each staff member is administering only the vaccines they have prepared. If more than one vaccine type is being administered, separate preparation stations are set up for each vaccine type to prevent medication errors. Vaccines are being administered using aseptic technique. Staff is administering vaccine to the correct patient (e.g., if a parent/guardian and child or two siblings are at the vaccination station at the same time, patient's name and date of birth are verified prior to vaccination). Staff is administering vaccines using the correct route per manufacturer instructions. Staff is administering the correct dosage (volume) of vaccine. Staff has checked age indications for the vaccines and is administering vaccines to the correct age groups. For vaccines requiring more than 1 dose, staff is administering the current dose at the correct interval. Follow the recommended guidelines in Table 3-1 of the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization: www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/timing.html#t-01. If vaccine administration errors are observed, corrective action is being taken immediately. Any persons with a needlestick injury, a vaccine administration error, or an urgent medical problem are being evaluated immediately and referred for additional medical care if needed. Patients are being encouraged to stay at the clinic for 15 minutes after vaccination to be monitored for adverse events. This is especially critical at drive-through or curbside clinics where drivers are being vaccinated. ADMINISTRATION OF INJECTABLE VACCINES (In this section, N.A. is ONLY an option if the clinic is EXCLUSIVELY using non-injectable vaccines, such as live, attenuated influenza vaccine.) YES NO N.A. A new needle and new syringe are being used for each injection. (Needles and syringes should never be used to administer vaccine to more than one person.) Single-dose vials or manufacturer-filled syringes are being used for only one patient. Vaccines are being administered following safe injection practices. For walk-through clinics, seats are provided so staff and patients are at the same level for optimal positioning of anatomic site and injection angle to ensure correct vaccine administration. Staff is identifying injection site correctly. (For intramuscular route: deltoid muscle of arm [preferred] or vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh for adults, adolescents, and children aged 3 years; vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh [preferred] or arm for children aged 1-2 years; vastus lateralis muscle of anterolateral thigh for infants aged 12 months. For subcutaneous route: thigh for infants aged <12 months; upper outer triceps of arm for children aged 1 year and adults [can be used for infants if necessary].) Staff is inserting needles quickly at the appropriate angle: 90\u00b0 for intramuscular injections (e.g., injectable influenza for subcutaneous rubella vaccine). YES NO N.A. Multidose vials are being used only for the number of doses approved by the manufacturer. Vaccines are never being transferred from one syringe to another. COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT111CHECKLIST ofBest Practices for Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site Locations 5If you check \"NO\" in ONE OR MORE answer boxes that contain a , DO NOT move forward with the clinic. \u00bbFollow your organization's protocols and/or contact your state or local health department for guidance before proceeding with the clinic. \u00bb Do not administer any vaccine until you have confirmed that it is acceptable to move forward with the clinic.YES NO N.A. Used needles and syringes are being immediately placed in a sharps container following administration. (Needles are NOT being recapped.) VACCINE DOCUMENTATION YES NO N.A. Each vaccination is being fully documented with name of person vaccinated; vaccination date; vaccine type, lot number, manufacturer; patient receipt of vaccine information statement (VISs or Emergency Use Authorization [EUA] form), including edition date and date VIS was provided; injection site; vaccination route; dosage; and name, title, and office/company address of person who administered the vaccine . Your state's immunization information system (IIS) was used to document vaccinations administered. ( CDC recommends using your state's IIS to document vaccinations.) Patients are receiving documentation for their personal records and to share with their medical providers. PREVENTING TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19 AT THE CLINIC YES NO N.A. All staff and patients have their temperature checked before entering the clinic and are answering the COVID screening questions before entering the clinic. All patients are wearing a face covering. Face masks should not be placed on children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. All staff is wearing recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, gloves (optional for subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, required for intranasal and oral vaccinations), and eye protection (based on level of community transmission). See www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html for current guidance. Social distancing guidance is being followed, including signs, banners, and floor markers to instruct staff and patients where to stand, shields as appropriate when the 6-foot minimum distance cannot be observed, and one-way traffic flow. All areas are being wiped down and cleaned more frequently than normal cleaning that takes place during vaccine preparation and administration and between patients. AFTER THE CLINIC (Please complete each item after the clinic is over.) POST-CLINIC ACTIONS YES NO N.A. Temperature of remaining vaccine was checked and recorded at the end of clinic. If not still at manufacturer-recommended temperature (i.e., between 2-8\u00b0 Celsius or 36-46\u00b0 Fahrenheit for ALL refrigerated vaccines ), follow your organization's protocols and/or contact your state or local health department for guidance. Any remaining vaccine in provider predrawn syringes, opened multidose vials, or activated manufacturer-filled syringes (MFSs) was properly discarded. An MFS is activated when the sterile seal is broken (i.e., cap removed from needle or needle added to the syringe). If absolutely necessary, a partially used multidose vial may be transported to or from an off-site/satellite facility operated by the same provider, as long as the cold chain is properly maintained, the vaccine is normal in appearance, and the maximum number of doses per vial indicated by the manufacturer has not already been withdrawn, or the beyond use date indicated by the manufacturer has not been met. However, a partially used vial cannot be transferred from one provider to another or across state lines or returned to the supplier for credit . Viable, unused vaccine was placed back in proper storage equipment that maintains the manufacturer-recommended temperature range at the end of the clinic day and was not stored in a dormitory-style or bar-style combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances. (This includes vaccine transported for a multi-day clinic to a remote location where adequate storage at the site is not available.) Any needlestick injuries were recorded in a sharps injury log and reported to all appropriate entities (e.g., local health department and your organization). Any vaccine administration errors were reported to all appropriate entities. All biohazardous material was disposed of properly. POST-CLINIC DOCUMENTATION YES NO N.A. Vaccinations were recorded in the jurisdiction's immunization information system (IIS) where available. If not submitted to an IIS, vaccination information was sent to primary health care providers as directed by an established procedure based on state or jurisdiction regulations. Any adverse events were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): vaers.hhs.gov/index. All patient medical information was placed in a secured storage location for privacy protection. The staff sign-in sheet was attached to this document (with shift times, clinic location, and date). N.A. means Not Applicable. This checklist was adapted from materials created by the California Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Immunization Action Coalition.COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT112CHECKLIST ofBest Practices for Vaccination Clinics Held at Satellite, Temporary, or Off-Site Locations 6ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND RESOURCES If you are concerned that CDC guidelines were not followed during your vaccination clinic held at a satellite, temporary, or off-site location, contact your organization and/or state or local health department for further guidance.

INever handle dry ice or LN 2with bare hands. IUse cryogenic gloves, which are designed specifically for working in freezers below -80\u00b0C and for handling containers or vials stored in these freezers. ICryogenic gloves need to be loose-fitting so that they can be readily removed if LN 2splashes into them or a piece of dry ice falls into them. IAlways use appropriate eye protection. IDo not use or store dry ice or LN 2in confined areas, walk-in refrigerators, environmental chambers or rooms without ventilation. A leak in such an area could cause an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. INever place a cryogen on tile or laminated counters because the adhesive will be destroyed. INever store a cryogen in a sealed, airtight container at a temperature above the boiling point of the cryogen; the pressure resulting from the production of gaseous carbon dioxide or nitrogen may lead to an explosion. IFor more information about specific cryogens, read the Material Safety Data Sheet for the substance in question. continued on page 2QuickFactsLaboratory Safety Cryogens and Dry Ice Cryogens are substances used to produce very low temperatures [below -153\u00b0C (-243\u00b0F)], such as liquid nitrogen (LN 2) which has a boiling point of -196\u00b0C (-321\u00b0F), that are commonly used in laboratories. Although not a cryogen, solid carbon dioxide or dry ice which converts directly to carbon dioxide gas at -78\u00b0C (-109\u00b0F) is also often used in laboratories.

COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT125 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 1 Data Import Documentation Data Import Instructions for Providers Reporting to Vaccine Finder COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT126 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 2 Table of Contents Overview System Methodology User Flows Data Dictionary Administrative Fields COVID -19 Vaccine Inventory Fields VaccineFinder Inventory Display Fields VaccineFinder Provider Accessibility Fields Requirements for Externally Generated Files for Upload Appendix COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT127 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 3 Overview Background and Scope The Locating Health platform is the administrative tool that COVID -19 vaccination providers may use to import required COVID -19 vaccine data and provider information into Vaccine Finder . This document is specific to updates made to the Locating Health platform, in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Preventio n (CDC ), Boston Children's Hospital , and Castlight Health to meet the needs of the current COVID -19 V accination Program . This document is only relevant for COVID -19 vaccination provider s that have completed provider enrollment and have registered in CDC's Vaccine Tracking System ( VTrckS ) with the Special Project Provider flag for COVID -19 in the ExIS file . Entities reporting on-hand vaccine inventory quantities to Vaccine Finder are jurisdictional awardees, provider organizations, pharmacies, and individual providers. Separate documentation will be available for retail pharmacies currently reporting vaccine supply through secure file transfer protocol (SFTP ) to Vaccine Finder through the Locating Health platform. How Locating Health Works for COVID -19 Vaccines The COVID- 19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement requires providers to report supply information as directed by CDC. Organizations or provider locations receiving COVID -19 vaccines should re port on-hand vaccine inventory quantities daily to Vaccine Finder using the new COVID Locating Health Provider Portal (https://covid.locating.health ). 1. The COVID Loca ting Health Provider Portal allows providers registered in CDC's VTrckS to report COVID -19 on- hand vaccine inventory on a daily basis to Vaccine Finder . Entities can choose to report inventory for all provider locations in their organization , or they may choose to enable reporting for each individual location. The reporting structure identified by each organization must be maintained for the duration of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. 2. All registered entities on the new COVID Locating Healt h Provider Portal should log in daily and submit on-hand COVID -19 vaccine inventory information for their provider locations. 3. COVID Locating Health will report daily on-hand COVID -19 vaccine inventory quantities for each provider location directly to Vaccine Finde r. 4. When vaccine is more widely available, providers will be notified that the Vaccine Finder public -facing website (www.vaccinefinder.org ) will be turned on to show COVID -19 vaccin ation locations . This will inform the public where they may go to receive a COVID - 19 vaccination. Providers will be able to choose whether their location is displayed on the website . For participating providers, the Vaccine Finder website will show the COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT128 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 4 provider's location, contact information, and the latest available data on COVID -19 vaccine availability to the public. Inventory quantities will not be available to the public. 5. COVID -19 vaccination providers will need to create a new account in the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal specifically for COVID -19 vaccine information. There will initially be two Locating Health Provider Portals : Locating Health Provider Portal for reporting seasonal and routine vaccine availability COVID Locating Health Provider Portal for required daily reporting of on -hand COVID -19 vaccine inventory quantities System Methodology To provide COVID -19 vaccine inventory data to the Locating Health platform, the participating entity will register to access and log into the new COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . Once the entity is securely logged in, they may upload on-hand inventory in a .csv file or enter this information manual ly through a user interface. Entities will be able to view and download previously entered on-hand vaccine inventory quantities from the last update and sample file formats directly from the web portal. The COVID Locating Health Provider Portal provides both methods for use at any time and partnering entities may decide which option is most feasible for their provider s. Entities will be required to submit on -hand inventory information for each vaccine through the COVID -19 Locating Health Provide r Portal on a daily basis. Inventory levels will be reported to CDC through Vaccine Finde r at 5:00 am Eastern time daily. Only the most recently entered on-hand inventory at that time will be reported. File Upload Format (*.csv) Formatted files with current inventory information will be available on the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal to download for reference and edit for re -upload. Each row within the .csv (RFC -4180 comma -separated values) file represents one single vaccination re cord for a provider. To allow for a combined .csv of multiple providers and/or vaccines, each row asks for the provider details in full. This allows the system to match and locate the provider to add the vaccinations without having to worry about multiple rows of data simultaneously. Manual Input A user interface will also be available on the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal for entities to log on-hand inventory manually. There will be a drop -down menu for each location for which that entity is approved to report supply. There will be a row for each vaccine available under each provider location. COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT129 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 5 User Flows Provider Organizations 1. Provider organizations with multiple locations in a single ju risdiction will be given the choice to report supply data at the organization level or enable reporting for each individual provider location (e.g., a clinic headquarters office reporting on behalf of satellite clinics vs. a satellite clinic reporting for their individual location ). 2. Provider organizations registered in CDC's VTrckS will receive an email with a unique registration link from the new COVID Locating Health Provider Portal at the organization contact email address submitted in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program provider enrollment form . 3. The organization contact will then follow the link to register for a secure COVID Locating Health Provider Portal account. During the onboarding process, the organization will be asked how they would like to r eport supply for their organization. a. If an organization enables individual provider location s to report inventory , new registration emails will be sent to each location contact listed in the provider enrollment form so that they can create an account. Each location will only have access to edit on-hand inventory information for their individual provider location. For details , see the individual provider user flow below. The organization onboarding will end at this point. b. Organization s that choose to report inventory for their provider locations must meet the following criteria: i. Organizations must report COVID -19 vaccine inventory data for all COVID -19 vaccination providers associated with their organization . ii. Organizations must report COVID -19 vaccine inventory daily for the duration for the COVID- 19 vaccin ation program . iii. Organizations must be capable of providing all required fields listed in the data directory below . 4. Organizations reporting for all their provider entities will log into the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal and can access a template file prefilled with their CDC approved, pre-enrolled provider locations. 5. Organizations will be required to log invent ory data for all provider locations in their jurisdiction using the file upload mechanism in the secure COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . These data will be reported back to Vaccine Finde r and CDC directly. The ability to manually update on-hand invent ory data for providers will also be available to organizations through the portal. COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT130 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 6 6. The COVID Locating Health Provider Portal may be accessed at any time to view or download current inventory data. Individual Provider Locations 1. Provider locations that organizations registered in CDC's VTrckS to report COVID -19 vaccine inventory data individually will receive an email with a unique registration link from the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . The email will be sent to the provi der location contact email address provided in the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program provider enrollment form . 2. The provider contact will then follow the link to register for a secure COVID Locating Health Provider Portal account. 3. Individual provider locat ions will log into the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal and can access a user interface to see current COVID -19 vaccine inventory data and update on-hand inventory each day . 4. Provider locations will be required to log inventory data daily though the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . These data will be reported back to Vaccine Finde r directly. 5. The COVID Locating Health Provider Portal may be accessed at any time to view or download current supply data. COVID-19 VACCINE PROVIDER TOOLKIT131 Revision 2.0. 2 - December 3, 2020 7 Jurisdictions 1. Jurisdictions interested in reporting COVID -19 inventory data for provider locations in their jurisdiction must meet the following conditions: a. Jurisdictions must report COVID -19 vaccine inventory data for all approved COVID -19 vaccination providers in their jurisdiction. b. Jurisdictions must report COVID -19 vaccine inventory daily for these providers for the duration for the COVID -19 vaccin ation program. c. Jurisdictions must be capable of providing all required fields listed in the data directory below. 2. The window of time for awardees to opt -in for jurisdiction -level inventory reporting to Vaccine Finde r closed on November 16th, 2020 . For jurisdictions that did not opt -in before this deadline, Vaccine Finde r will onboard their providers to report directly to VaccineFinder. Please note that your reporting method must be maintained for the duration of the COVID -19 vaccination program. . 3. Once CDC confirms that a jurisdiction will report vaccine inventory for its vaccination providers , the jurisdiction contact will receive an email with a unique registration link from the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . 4. The jurisdiction contact will then follow the link to register for a sec ure COVID Locating Health Provider Portal account. 5. Once registered and logged into the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal , the jurisdiction will be able to access a template file prefilled with the CDC -approved, pre - enrolled provider locations in their jurisdiction. Jurisdictions may also generate a file directly from their Immunization Information System (IIS) for upload into Vaccine Finde r. See Requirements for Externally Generated Files for Upload . 6. Jurisdictions will be required to log inventory data for all provider locations in their jurisdiction using the file upload mechanism in the secure COVID Locating Health Provider Portal . Data collected through the COVID Locating Health Provider Portal will be reported back to Vaccine Finde r and CDC directly. Alternatively, the ability to manually update on-hand inventory information for providers will also be available to jurisdictions through the portal. 7. The COVID Locating Health Provider Portal may be acc essed at any time to view or download current inventory supply.

V AERS collects and reviews reports of adverse events that occur after vaccination. An \"adverse event\" is any health problem or \"side effect\" that happens after a vaccination. V AERS cannot determine if a vaccine caused an adverse event, but can determine if further investigation is needed. VAERS provides valuable information V AERS is an early-warning system that detects problems possibly related to vaccines. The system relies on reports from healthcare providers*, vaccine manufacturers, and the general public. Reporting gives CDC and FDA important information to identify health concerns and ensure vaccines are safe in order to protect the public's health. V AERS staff evaluate reports of adverse events V AERS defines a \"serious adverse event\" as life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of an existing hospitalization, permanent disability or death. Once adverse events are identified using V AERS, they may be monitored in other immunization safety systems to confirm if a particular adverse event is related to a vaccination and identify any specific risk factors. Anyone can report to V AERS Anyone can submit a report to V AERS, including patients, family members, healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers and the general public. CDC and FDA encourage anyone who experiences an adverse event after receiving a vaccine to report to V AERS. How to report to V AERS Y ou can report to V AERS online at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index. For further assistance reporting to V AERS, visit https://vaers.hhs.gov/index or contact V AERS directly at info@V AERS.org or 1-800-822-7967. V AERS data are available to the public V AERS data can be downloaded at https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index or searched at http://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html. Privacy is protected and personal identifying information (such as name, date of birth and address) is removed from the public data. * Healthcare providers are encouraged to report all clinically significant adverse events after vaccination to VAERS even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. They are also required to report to VAERS adverse events found in the Reportable Events Table (RET) at https://vaers.hhs.gov/resources/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf For more Get your smartphone.
