It is accompanied by sometimes diarrhea, weight loss and malabsorption of nutrients. Medication unfortunately worsens the condition. What causes ulcerative colitis? Ulcerative colitis disease always starts with a gut issue; it is an autoimmune condition; so the good cells of the body attack themselves. In Shonali's opinion, incorrect foods have a lot to do with the progression of gut issues, leading up to it. What is Shonali's USP (Uniqueness)? On an ulcerative colitis diet with Shonali, her approach is to first put you through a regimen of absorption; since most people in this condition have stopped absorbing nutrients from their food. Post which she starts building you up first by cleansing the gut, using foods and then by strengthening the gut introducing foods that will start the gut repair process. She balances the use of fiber from foods in such a way that it does not trigger the condition. How does Shonali help? Her approach relies on the tenets of Macrobiotic philosophy: using the oriental system of 'facial diagnosis,' and touch meridian diagnosis (if needed) to analyze the strength and health of your organs. Her framework (like Ayurveda) relies on using the foundation of analyzing your constitution (that which you were born with: blueprint from your parents) and condition (that which you have created growing up). Macrobiotic philosophy uses the 'yin' and 'yang' elements of 'energy' or 'prana' to help her diagnose everything you are or do. This is her training and USP and how she actually zeroes in on your diagnosis and further prognosis. Shonali is based in mumbai and is presently working online in ver 35 countries. She is the only one who works with you, and there are no assistants or other nutritionists between you and her. She conducts her own follow ups and meetings personally; as she believes turning your health condition around is a 'personal' business; and only she has been trained to diagnose your condition and monitor the progress one-on-one. The macrobiotic approach is integrative, alternative and comes under the branch of lifestyle medicine, using foods as medicine to reverse and cure your health ailment/disease. TESTIMONIALS I stumbled across Shonali Sabherwal's book, \"The Detox Diet\". Her foreword in the book convinced me of consulting her for my gut problems and I am so glad that I took the right decision. None of the other nutritionists whom I had consulted before her, really understood my health condition so well. I have ulcerative colitis, and have just lived with the problem for many years now. Shonali's profound knowledge in her field and professionalism is exceptional. I started seeing amazing results within a month of starting her program. My digestive issues like constipation, bloating, nausea reduced considerably. I lost the extra flab and my body looks more toned, I feel more energized. And yes, I am not having premenstrual acne or breakouts anymore and my skin is glowing. I can't thank Shonali enough for this invaluable advice which will benefit me for the rest of my life. She has been a silver lining in my journey to health and happiness. \"I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, with a tendency towards Crohn's disease. I approached Shonali to help me resolve this crisis, my stomach was bloated and hard; I looked pale and my weight was not budging. Her approach of isolating foods and elements that did not work for me was truly amazing. She also found out I was histamine intolerant. Like a scientist she worked with me, asked me questions, followed up, went into my kitchen and spoke to my cooks. She came up with a plan, that started restoring gut health and it took me 8 months to go into complete remission from this ailment. It was like I had an Angel for those 8 months watching over every step I took.\" I have been suffering from ulcerative colitis since 6 years now. I was on allopathy medication since I got diagnosed, and my condition progressively worsened over the years. Medication wasn't helping me and was only making my condition worse and making me more anxious and frustrated. I consulted a dietician (before Shonali) who claimed to be a Gut Microbiome Specialist, but I wasn't guided well and I ended up in a bigger soup. I met Shonali when I was at my lowest; both physically and emotionally. She helped me with a very basic and an easy diet to start with and ensured that I wasn't hungry or craving anything during this period. She knows the psychology of my ailment, the psychology of the foods and understands my psychology - and uses all these 3 to treat me. Shonali knows exactly how each food group will work, to make my condition better or worse. My condition has improved a lot and I am really hopeful that with her help and guidance I am going to be in a better place soon. She has not only been a nutritionist to me but a life coach; and is in the know of all my emotional issues that stem from my gut. She has always been a call away. Thank you so much Shonali; for being a guide, a mentor and most importantly a friend I could confide in. I owe a lot to you. More than I could ever express in words. I had consulted Shonaalii around 6 months back in June 2021 for my Ulcerative Colitis issue which I had been struggling with for almost 10 years. I had frequent flare ups where I had to run to the toilet 6-8 times a day and could not concentrate on my work or any daily activities. I had lost almost 15 kgs and was worried about my health and future. Before approaching Shonalii, I had tried all types of doctors and other nutritionists in the past who guided me in a wrong way and this made my condition worse. After starting Shonali's consultation, I could see the difference after 3 weeks but I purposely waited for 6 months to check if the symptoms are reoccurring. Now, after 6 months I can say that her diet and guidance has worked for me. There were no flares ups, bloating, or indigestion and I have started gaining weight. I must say that Shonali has the proper knowledge not only about different foods & diet but also about mental, physical health, lifestyle changes one needs to make to regain health. She has immense knowledge about the exact foods to include and eliminate specific to any disease. Ailments [ACIDITY](/consultations/list-of-ailments/acidity/) "}
