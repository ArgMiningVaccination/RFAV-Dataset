I specialize in working with special needs children. Some of the conditions I treat include abdominal pain, celiac disease, common nutrition issues, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux and inflammatory bowel disease. My mentors in high school, college and medical training inspired me to go into pediatrics. I believe that if we can prevent or reduce a disorder's impact, we can help a child lead a full and productive life. I take care of the child first and deal with the rest of the stuff later. I talk with my patients and families about their questions and then directly address their concerns. At Cincinnati Children's, we use a team approach to care. I work with other doctors, nurses and fellows to diagnose conditions and provide the most effective treatments. My job also involves research and teaching at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. I study functional pediatric gastroenterological disorders to better understand the conditions and create holistic approaches to treatments. I am honored to be the recipient of many teaching and clinical awards, including: When I'm not working, I love to play sports of all sorts. I'm a dog lover and have two now. I am a history buff \u2014 especially military history. I'm proud of my military medical service with the Navy and Marine Corps. MD: Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA, 1970.
