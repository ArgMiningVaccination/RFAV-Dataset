One [small 2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27333231) However, a [2018 review of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494172/) Symptoms like nausea and vomiting are also [commonly](/health/morning-sickness) present in the early stages of pregnancy. One [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5960050/) Researchers have also considered whether peppermint oil may have an effect on symptoms of [nausea](/health/cancer/chemotherapy-nausea-tips) in patients with cancer who are receiving [chemotherapy](/health/chemotherapy) treatment. A [2021 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33197662/) The takeaway Results from small studies are mixed on the effectiveness of aromatherapy with peppermint oil to help with nausea.

Researchers found that a 1 percent solution of peppermint oil led to improvements in how long itchiness lasted and the severity of the itch. A [2014 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289931/) [minoxidil (Rogaine)](/health/does-rogaine-work) and control compounds. The researchers found that a 3 percent solution of peppermint oil led to the growth of thick, long hair in mice after 4 weeks of treatment, similar to results from using minoxidil. In a [2016 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27131832/) The takeaway Peppermint oil may help soothe itchy skin. More research is needed on peppermint oil's ability to stimulate hair growth in humans. Against bacteria and yeast Peppermint oil also has mild antimicrobial properties. Various studies have been performed to determine its effectiveness against different types of bacteria and fungi. The results have been mixed.
