Since the initial publication, there have been many advances in pediatric health care and within the nursing profession. Much of that knowledge has been captured here in this revised and updated second edition of Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy! Revising this edition required a team of dedicated nurse experts from different regions of the country who worked to ensure that this book contained relevant information that is useful in everyday practice. In order to provide safe, quality care to the pediatric patient, nurses need to have an understanding of some common pediatric conditions. The primary goal of the second edition of Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy! is to provide the nurse interested in pediatrics with increased knowledge about pediatric health care conditions as they relate to nursing practice. This edition of Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy! provides an introduction to topics essential to pediatrics for nurses with limited pediatric experience and serves as a refresher for nurses already caring for children in a variety of settings. This book is also a valuable resource for students on their pediatric clinical rota-tions. Students will appreciate the easy-to-read format and the \"Advice from the experts.\" Even the most experienced nurses will find a means to enhance their knowledge. All 15 chapters have revised, and I am sure that the revisions have significantly en- hanced the scope and value of the book. The second edition of Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy! begins with a chapter introducing the reader to pediatric nursing. This chapter defines the role of the pediatric nurse, the philosophy of family- centered care, and standards of care for pediatric nursing. The next chapter reviews factors that influ-ence growth and development, how to assess and manage pain in the pediatric patient, and the needs of the hospitalized and special needs child. The next three chapters re-view developmental aspects of pediatric care related to infants, early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Chapters 6 to 15 review commonly encountered pediatric conditions relevant to various body systems\u2014for example, cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal. Each chapter provides you with an abundance of practical, useful information. An easy-to-read format and witty artwork are presented to aid and engage the reader. Illustrations are presented to help you visualize the pathophysiology of the condition. \"Memory joggers\" provide useful tips to help you remember important information. In addition, the second edition of Pediatric Nursing Made Incredibly Easy! has several icons to draw your attention to important issues.

Role of the pediatric nurse Pediatric nursing involves providing care for infants, children, and adolescents on a continuum from health to illness to recuperation and, when needed, rehabilitation. However, providing care to the pediatric population doesn't stop with the pediatric patient; pediatric nursing should incorporate parents and other family members into the child's care. This philosophy is known as family-centered care . Family-centered care Family-centered care acknowledges the parents as the constant in the child's life and as experts in the care of their child, whether in the hospital or at home. In family-centered care, the family's input is the major driving force behind the development of the child's care plan. In addition, the needs of the child and his family are taken into account in family-centered care. Interventions are geared toward respecting, supporting, and encouraging the family's ability to par- ticipate in the care of their child throughout illness and recovery.Just the factsIntroduction to pediatric nursing1 In this chapter, you'll learn: the role of the pediatric nurse the philosophy of family-centered care standards of care for pediatric nursing types of family structures sociocultural influences that affect pediatric health.

Empowering is allowing parents to maintain, or helping them to develop, a sense of control over their child's care. Enabling refers to the practices that help family members to acquire the new skills necessary to meet the needs of their child. These two concepts foster the teamwork between the fam- ily and health care professionals that serves to benefit the child, both physically and emotionally. (See Benefits of family- centered care .) Standards of care Pediatric nursing care is governed by standards. The American Nurses Association (ANA), the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP), and the Society of Pediatric Nurses (SPN) have developed a document which outlines the scope and standards of pediatric nursing practice to ensure that each pedi-atric patient receives safe and effective care. (See Standards of pediatric nursing care and professional performance .) Room for improvement In 2010, there were 74.1 million children younger than 18 years old living in the United States. Children younger than 16 years of age compose 24% of the total population. Although children's health has improved dramatically over the last century, there's still work to be done. Childhood morbidity and mortality rates, key indicators of the health of a population, provide the nurse with essential informa- tion about how and where to direct care for individual patients and the community at large. Childhood morbidity Morbidity is defined as the number of people in a population who are faced with a specific health problem at a particular point in time. Because these statistics aren't compiled on an annual basis, it's difficult to compare them from year to year. It is important to remember that it is during the middle childhood and early adoles- cent times that the children are usually healthy, but they develop habits that will influence their health later in life. Morbidity rates for many illnesses that previously caused severe problems for children, such as poliomyelitis and measles, have been dramatically reduced through immunizations. Other conditions studied in relation to morbidity include obesity, injuries, acute illness, HIV infection, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).Benefits of family-centered care Family- centered care benefits the child and family as well as the health care professional. Benefits to families\u0081 Less stress and heightened feelings of confidence and competence in caring for their children\u0081 Less de-pendence on professional caregivers\u0081 Empower-ment to develop new skills and expertise in the care of their children Benefits to health care professionals\u0081 Greater job satisfaction\u0081 Empower-ment to develop new skills and expertise in pe-diatric Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 2 Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 2 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Standards of pediatric nursing care and professional performance By adhering to these guidelines, jointly developed by the ANA, NAPNAP , and the SPN, the pediatric nurse can serve as an advocate for patients and their families. These guidelines should be upheld to ensure that professional care is provided to all patients. Scope of practice The scope of practice section of the document discusses the different areas of pediatric nursing practice and the different settings where pediatric nurses practice. Also discussed in this section are education and certification of pediatric nurses. The Differentiated Areas of Pediatric Nursing Practice include: \u0081 The Pediatric Nurse: Generalist\u0081 The Advanced Practice Pediatric Nurse\u0081 Pediatric Clinical Nurse Specialist (PCNS)\u0081 Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP)\u0081 Neonatal Nurse Practitioner (NNP) The Settings for Pediatric Nursing Practice include: \u0081 Inpatient and Acute Care and Palliative Care Settings\u0081 Ambulatory Care Settings\u0081 Community Health and School Settings \u0081 Transport Settings \u0081 Camp Settings Standards of care Comprehensive pediatric nursing care focuses on helping children and their families and communities achieve their optimum health potentials. This goal is best achieved within the framework of family-centered care and the pediatric nursing process, including primary, second-ary, and tertiary care coordinated across health care and community settings. The jointly published document includes 16 standards that govern the practice of the pediatric nurse.\u0081 Standard 1. Assessment\u0081 Standard 2. Diagnosis\u0081 Standard 3.

Childhood mortality Mortality refers to the number of deaths from a specific cause in a given year. Accidents are the leading cause of death in all age-groups of children (older than age 1) in the United States. Infant mortality rates are the number of infant deaths during the first year of life per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality rates have decreased dramatically in the United States, but the nation still lags behind other developed countries that have even lower infant mortality rates. Many of the nations with lower infant mortality rates also have national health programs in place. Researchers aim to improve these vital statistics for all populations in the United States. National health initiatives The current focus on health promotion and disease prevention has prompted national initiatives, such as Healthy People 2020 , aimed at improving children's health. Solid start For the past three decades, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has issued a national health agenda called Healthy People , aimed at improving the health of people living in the United States. The Healthy People goals were devel- oped to provide evidence-based, 10-year national objectives for improving health. The first set of national targets for health was released in 1979 and was entitled, Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention . The target date for the attainment of these goals was 1990. Since then, the goals have been updated every 10 years. Building on success Healthy People 2020 (http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default .aspx) was released in December 2010, with the stated mission to identify nationwide health improvement priorities by increasing public awareness of determinants of health, disease, and disability; providing measureable goals and objectives to determine progress Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 4 Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 4 5/22/14 7:23 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.5ROLE OF THE PEDIATRIC NURSE in attaining the health improvement priorities; engaging multiple sectors to improve practices based on evidence and knowledge; and identifying critical research, evaluation, and data collection. Thirteen new topics or priority areas were added for Healthy People 2020 that were not included in Healthy People 2010 . Of the 13 areas, several are particularly relevant to children and adoles- cents: adolescent health; early transgender (LGBT) health; and sleep health. In kids' corner The National Vaccine Program is a health initiative that's espe- cially significant to children's health. National Vaccine Plan serves as a guide to ensure all Americans have access to vaccines so that disease can be prevented. Healthy People 2020 objectives Healthy People 2020 aims to have a society where people live longer and healthier lives. There are over 417 objectives related to the pediatric population. Here are some of the Healthy People 2020 objectives related to the pediatric population: \u0081 Increase the number of individuals going to a single health care provider for care.\u0081 Increase the number of adolescents getting yearly physical, dental, and vision examinations.\u0081 Increase number of adolescents involved in extracurricular activities at school.\u0081 Increase the number of adolescents who have a positive adult role model to talk to. \u0081 Increase number of children with disabilities who receive adequate care.\u0081 Increase the number of schools that have ad-equate health education for children in schools.\u0081 Increase education related to unintentional injury, use of tobacco products, unplanned pregnancy, STIs, alcohol use or other drugs, in-adequate nutrition, and lack of physical activity.\u0081 Increase use of vehicle restraint usage in all age-groups.\u0081 Increase the number of moms breast-feeding and support for them while breast-feeding.\u0081 Increase amount of time children spend in daily physical education and recess at school.\u0081 Increase number of children who limit screen time activities to 2 hours or less per day.\u0081 Increase number of high school students who get sufficient sleep.\u0081 Increase number of students who are free of substance abuse.\u0081 Maintain and increase vaccination coverage for all ages of children.\u0081 Reduce number of adolescents affected by violent crime.\u0081 Reduce number of children and adolescents with high blood pressure.\u0081 Reduce number of otitis media cases.\u0081 Reduce number of new cases HIV/AIDS cases.\u0081 Reduce number of cases of immunization-preventable diseases.\u0081 Reduce incidence of bullying and violence among all age-groups.\u0081 Reduce rate of fetal and infant deaths.\u0081 Reduce number of children who have dental caries.\u0081 Reduce number of hospital visits or emer-gency department (ED) visits for children who have asthma.\u0081 Reduce number of adolescents who are binge drinkers.

Individuals don't have to have blood relationships in order to be a family. Today, many different family structures exist in our society: the nuclear family, binuclear family, and the blended family. Each type of family may provide a unique set of challenges to the nurses who care for their children. When conducting a pediatric history, remember to ask about who lives in the home. Nuclear family A nuclear family (also known as a traditional family ) consists of spouses and their child or children (biological or adopted). The nuclear family serves as a support system for its members, who share roles and responsibilities as well as financial obligations. One disadvantage of some nuclear fami-lies is the absence of additional support that may be needed in times of crisis. A binuclear family is becoming more common as more parents remarry and share custody and care of the children. A binuclear family consists of each parent and their new spouses, sharing custody and raising of the child. Each couple has their own household in which the child spends his or her time. The child may have to learn two sets of rules\u2014which can some-times be quite confusing. Blended family A blended family consists of parents with a child or children from a previous relationship who marry and live together. Add two or more children, mix well . . . A blended family provides emotional support and allows for shared roles within the household. It also provides the opportu-nity for the family members to learn how to work together and discover new ways of accomplishing tasks. . . . but don't spread too thin Financial responsibilities can be shared but can also produce strain if support must be provided to the previous spouse or children of either adult, or both.

All Rights Reserved.7A CLOSER LOOK AT THE FAMIL Y Being a single parent can be rewarding\u2014and exhausting!Cohabitation family A cohabitation family is one in which two adults and a child or children live together as a nuclear family while the adults remain unmarried. This type of family provides emotional and financial support to its members. However, the risk exists that one indi- vidual may feel threatened by the partner's real or perceived lack of commitment. Extended family An extended family (also called a multigenerational family ) includes at least one parent; a child or children; and any combi- nation of grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins. In this type of family, the group provides the support. A potential disadvantage of an extended family is the con- flict that may arise about roles; confusion may occur about which adult is viewed as the child's mother or father, or who should make decisions regarding the child's care. Single-parent family A single-parent family is composed of one parent living at home with a child or children. Because of such factors as the rise in divorce rates, the single-parent family is becoming more common. Bonded . . . In a single-parent family, the parent and child are each other's source of support. This can create close bonds but can also lead to strain for the single parent in terms of the parental role he or she plays. If a child becomes ill, child care difficulties may arise. There may also be financial con-straints related to limited income. . . . and ready for a nap The single parent can become exhausted from being re- sponsible for all of the tasks involved in raising children. Single parenting can also lead to low self-esteem, as the parent tries\u2014and sometimes fails\u2014to provide everything for the child that some two-parent families are able to provide. Communal family In a communal family , adults and their children choose to live with a group of people (not relatives) who become the extended Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 7 Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 7 5/22/14 7:23 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.8INTRODUCTION TO PEDIATRIC NURSING My family doesn't make decisions without me. In my ethnic group, what the man says, goes. Foster care is based on the idea that the foster home will be a temporary one for the child.family. The relationship is usually one of religious beliefs or social values. The parent usually gives up the parental role, and the leader of the group makes decisions for the child. Disadvantages of this family structure include the tendency to provide medical care within the group rather than seek-ing outside for professional help for health-related matters. Foster family A foster family is designed to care for a child whose bio- logical or adoptive parents can't do so. Foster parents may or may not be related to the child in foster care. If the foster parents are related to the child, the placement is generally referred to as kinship care. Ideally, foster care is provided on a temporary basis until the biological or adoptive parent can resume his or her role. Unfortunately, the foster child may be shuffled from foster family to foster family, lacking the sta- bility that comes from being with the same family (biological, adoptive, or foster) for an extended period. It can also be difficult to determine who's responsible for making deci-sions about the foster child's health care. Sociocultural influences on pediatric health Sociocultural influences on pediatric health \u0081 family's health-related beliefs and practices. Ethnicity Ethnicity refers to belonging to or believing in a group with the same customs, languages, and characteristics. The United States is known for its ethnic diversity. The pediatric nurse must be aware that different ethnic groups tend to view health care differently. Father knows best In some ethnic groups, the adult male is the deci- sion maker. When a child is brought in for treat-ment, no decisions can be made until he arrives. Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 8 Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 8 5/22/14 7:23 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Chil- dren from these ethnic groups may be up and walking or convers-ing, or may appear stoic, despite being in pain. This can make it difficult for the nurse to assess, or even detect, pain. Hold the pickles, hold the meat Diet is another area in which ethnic influence can be strong. For instance, caffeine and meat products may be removed from the diet. The pediatric nurse should do a thorough assessment of the family's beliefs in order to provide the most com- plete care and avoid offending the family. Remember, not every member of the culture will participate in all aspects of the culture. This is why it is important to do a cultural assessment. (See Putting cultural care into practice .) Socioeconomic factors Socioeconomic influences on pediatric health result from in- come levels that don't meet the needs of the child and family. Poverty is the lack of money or resources necessary for survival. Approximately 22% of children in the United States, or 16.4 mil- lion children, live in families with incomes below the federal pov-erty level. People who live in areas with low socioeconomic levels have fewer accessible health care facilities available to them. Planes, trains, and automobiles The availability of transportation to a health care facility can have a tremendous impact on whether parents or caregivers will seek care for themselves and their children. Cultured pearls Putting cultural care into practice Awareness and knowledge are the first steps toward incorporating cultural care into your daily nursing practice. To facilitate cultural care on your practice setting, develop a cultural reference manual that includes:\u0081 brief descriptions of pertinent cultures\u0081 views on health, illness, diet, and other matters \u0081 lists of interpreters (including American Sign Language interpreters), ethnic community ser-vices, and other sources for quick reference.

When both parents work because of socioeconomic reasons, they may not be able to take time off for their child's illness.Calling in sick Another area of concern arises when both parents work, as is common in today's economy. One or both parents may not be able to afford to take time off from work to bring their child to the health care provider's office or hospital, or may risk their job by doing so. If they can't take time off, and health care isn't available after working hours, the child may not receive the care he or she needs. Religion Religious beliefs can affect when, where, and even if an individual will seek health care. Because religious beliefs guide health care practices for many people, the pediatric nurse must be aware of what beliefs the individual holds and should help ensure that these needs are met in a way that provides the child with the needed care. School School typically reinforces the concepts of right and wrong, or moral values. School commonly helps children learn rules and regulations and introduces them to the concept of an authority figure other than their parents. A child who has a negative experience with school may fear the hospital setting, thinking it will be the same as school. The child whose school experiences are positive will be likely to apply these experiences to the health care environment. It is important for the pediatric nurse to remember that some children are homeschooled. Peer influences Peer relationships are the relationships a child has with other individuals in the same age-group. A child's ability to be part of a peer group is influ- enced by his having the same beliefs or attitudes as the others in his group. With the use of social media and cellular phones, friends are only a screen away. Nurses must remember that with the use of social media, there is a potential for cyberbullying. Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 10 Meadows-Oliver_Ch01.indd 10 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.11 A child may try to change his beliefs or behaviors to feel a part of the group or norm. He may partake in behaviors that risk his health to conform to the group. For example, a child's experi- mentation with smoking, drinking alcohol, or using drugs can be heavily influenced by the behaviors of his peers. Health-related beliefs and practices Health-related beliefs and practices of the family have a strong influence on how often they will seek health care for their child. If family members hesitate to seek health care for themselves, they commonly won't seek care for their child until he becomes seri- ously ill. Once bitten Sometimes, a family's health-related beliefs and practices are based on previous experiences with health care. Negative experiences can make family members reluctant to seek care for themselves and for their child. These experiences may include: \u0081 real or perceived poor quality of care \u0081 real or perceived insensitivity of health care professionals \u0081 physical or emotional pain or trauma \u0081 death of a family member in a health care facility. The pediatric nurse can help to make a family's health-related beliefs more positive by:\u0081 asking family members about their past health care experiences and acknowledging their concerns\u0081 stressing the ways the current situation differs from past situations \u0081 encouraging family members to participate actively in their child's health care and praising them for the care they're already providing.

On your admission assess- ment, the mother tells you that her family is composed of herself, the patient (her daughter), her new husband, and her stepson. What type of family is this? A. Nuclear family B. Cohabitation familyC. Blended familyD. Foster family Answer: C. A family composed of a mother with children from a previous relationship who marries a father with children from a previous relationship is called a blended family . 3. A 5-year-old is in the hospital after having an appendectomy. A full liquid diet is ordered for the child. A carbonated soda, chicken broth, milk, and ice cream are on his food tray. The mother states that the child isn't permitted to have these foods because she doesn't allow him to have foods containing sugar. Which action is the nurse's best response? A. Explain to the mother that these are the only foods allowed after surgery. B. Respect the mother's wishes and remove the food. C. Discuss the nutritional value of these foods after surgery.D. Review with the mother what foods are allowed and include her in the menu selection. Answer: D. By allowing the mother to participate in making decisions about the child's care, the nurse is fostering family- centered care. 4. Relationships that a child has with others in his age-group are known as: A. peer relationships. B. family relationships.C. sibling relationships.D. caregiver relationships. Answer: A. Peers are those in a person's own age-group. Peers can heavily influence the behavior of a child as he attempts to conform to the norms of the group.

Growth implies an increase in size, such as height and weight. Develop- ment refers to the acquisition of skills and abilities that takes place throughout life. (See Patterns of development , page 14.) Growth and development are essential parts of the pediatric nursing assessment. Problems that may initially seem insignificant might actually have severe consequences in later life if not dealt with early. Stages of development There are five stages of development during childhood: Infancy is the period from birth until age 1. The toddler stage is the period from ages 1 to 3. The preschool stage lasts from ages 3 to 6. School-age refers to children ages 6 to 12. Adolescence is the period from ages 13 to 19. Some experts now consider the period of adolescence from ages 10 to 25 due to recent research on brain development.

As a child matures, he develops a readiness to master new, age-appropriate tasks. Task master A child's ability to master these tasks is affected by environmen-tal, social, cultural, and relational factors. Without the appropriate stimuli or environment, these tasks might not be accomplished, and development may be arrested or may occur in a maladaptive manner. Family The family in which a child is raised greatly influences his devel- opment. For example, a child who has been abused or neglected may experience delays in learning trust as well as disorders of attachment and problems with feeding and sleeping. Repeated epi- sodes of maltreatment or emotional deprivation have been shown to also have a physical impact, decreasing a child's rate of growth. Health status A child's physiologic state can significantly affect his develop- ment. Children with chronic health conditions may experience developmental lags in acquiring skills relating to cognition, com- munication, adaptation, and social and motor functioning. The Patterns of development This chart shows the patterns of development and their progression and gives examples of each. Pattern Path of progression Examples Cephalocaudal From head to toe Head control precedes the ability to walk. Proximodistal From the trunk to the tips of the extremitiesThe neonate can move his arms and legs but can't pick up objects with his fingers. General to specific From simple tasks to more complex tasks (mastering simple tasks before advancing to those that are more complex)The child progresses from crawling to walking to skipping.

My parents can't afford lessons. Who knows how far my talent would have taken me!extent to which a health condition affects a child's development depends on the severity of the illness. Socioeconomic status A family's socioeconomic status can have a significant impact on a child's growth and development. Ain't got no culture Parents who must work long hours to provide basic neces-sities may have little time or money to help their child achieve his highest level of functioning through enriching experiences. Travel as well as cultural and educational outings\u2014to the library, museum, or zoo\u2014may not be possible. I could have been a contender A lack of time and funds can also limit a child's ability to pur- sue such special interests as art, music, and sports. Cultural background A family's cultural beliefs and circumstances also affect a child's growth and development. Culture influences the way children are socialized, learn values, and experience the world. The child's developing beliefs, customs, mode of communication and dress, and actions are influenced by and vary according to culture. Normal to me, taboo to you Practices vary from culture to culture; what's acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another. It's extremely important for nurses to become knowledgeable about and respectful of cultural beliefs that differ from their own. This knowledge enables nurses to develop strategies for effective interven-tions. (See Cultural influences on developmental assess- ment , page 16.) Basic necessities A child must have such basic necessities as sleep, rest, and proper nutrition to reach his highest potential. Children need more sleep than adults, and nurses should keep in mind that sleep deprivation can impact performance on growth and development assessments. Chronic sleep deprivation yields negative physiologic consequences. Ya know, I think I need to take it easy and get some more sleep so I can reach my highest potential.

Nutritional guidelines, such as the MyPlate guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), should be taught to children and their parents to help them achieve optimum nutrition needed for normal growth and development. (See www .ChooseMyPlate.gov .)Cultured pearls Cultural influences on developmental assessment Tools for measuring development might not take into account cultural influences. For example, Southeast Asian children may be considered delayed in the area of personal-social development on the Denver II test because of a lack of familiarity with games such as pat-a-cake, a game well-known to other cultures. No single tool can take into account all the factors that contribute to the patient's develop- ment. Variables that will impact assessment of a child's development must be considered when performing developmental screenings.

This process is similar to the pat- terns of biological development (cephalocaudal, proximodistal, general to specific). (See Theories of development .) Psychosocial development A developmental framework for the entire life span was first pro- posed by Erik Erikson in 1959. Erikson's psychosocial theory has been further refined but essentially remains the same today. Erikson believed that the psychosocial development of an individual is a function of ego (the conscious part of the personality\u2014 and the part that most immediately controls thought Growing pains Theories of development The child development theories discussed in this chart shouldn't be compared directly because they measure different aspects of development. Erik Erikson's psychosocial-based theory is the most commonly accepted model for child develop-ment, although it can't be empirically tested.

(Can I get grounded for that?)and behavior) as well as social and biologic processes. At given times in the life cycle, the interaction between these processes cause psychosocial crises by placing a demand on the individual. In order for the person to grow, he must resolve these crises and master the task at hand. He trusts me, he trusts me not These tasks occur in eight different stages, five of which pertain to childhood. Each stage is characterized by a specific positive identity issue, such as trust in the infancy stage, and a contrasting negative attribute that may emerge from that issue, such as mis- trust in the infancy stage. The prominence of either positive or negative attributes determines mastery of the crisis. Weighing the pros . . . If the positive attribute emerges, the individual has a better chance of experiencing unimpaired development. . . . and the cons If the negative attribute predominates, the individual may have problems with later attitudes and personal strength. Some negative attributes are, however, necessary to completely master the task at hand. As the person deals with each task, he assumes both increased vulnerability and increased potential, which garners new strength and pushes him on to the next level. Hopeful today, caring tomorrow Optimal development depends on the proper resolution of each task in the appropriate sequence. For example, the trust developed in infancy leads to a sense of hope, which forms a foundation for the emerging trait of fidelity in adolescence, and an ability to care in adulthood. Stages of psychosocial theory The five childhood stages of psychosocial theory are: trust versus mistrust (birth to age 1) . The child develops trust as the primary caregiver meets his needs. autonomy versus shame and doubt (ages 1 to 3) . The child learns to control his body functions and becomes increasingly independent, preferring to do things himself. initiative versus guilt (ages 3 to 6) . The child learns about the world through play and develops a conscience. industry versus inferiority (ages 6 to 12) . The child enjoys working on projects and with others and tends to follow rules; Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 19 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 19 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.20 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE competition with others is keen, and forming social rela- tionships takes on greater importance. identity versus role confusion (ages 12 to 19) . Changes in the child's body are taking place rapidly, and the child is preoccupied with how he looks and how others view him; while trying to meet the expectations of his peers, he's also trying to establish his own identity. Cognitive development According to Jean Piaget, cognitive or intellectual acts occur when an individual is adapting to and organizing the per-ceived environment around him. Piaget thought a child moves through four stages of cognitive development. As he moves through each stage, he builds on structures gained from the previous stages, moving from relatively simple to very complex operations. Some people never grow up! Piaget noted that all individuals have the capability to achieve the most advanced levels of functioning, although not all will reach the final stages of development. No problem too big It's through experience with the environment that development is pushed ahead. The child incorporates new ideas, skills, and knowledge into familiar patterns of thought and action. When faced with a problem that's new or too complex to fit into his existing pattern of thought, the child accommodates (draws on past experiences that are closest to his current problem to solve it). Sensorimotor stage The sensorimotor stage spans birth to age 2. During this stage, the child progresses from reflex activity, through simple repetitive be-haviors, to imitative behaviors. Concepts to be mastered include: \u0081 object permanence \u2014the understanding that objects and events continue to exist, even when they can't be seen, heard, or touched directly\u0081 causality \u2014the relationship between cause and effect \u0081 spatial relationships \u2014the recognition of different shapes and the relationships between them (for example, placing a round object in a round hole). Who am I? What's my role? Will my skin ever clear up? I made it through Erikson's other four stages, but I could have done without number five!

(If this is just magical thinking, I'm in big trouble.)Preoperational stage The preoperational stage starts at age 2 and ends around age 7. This stage is marked by egocentricity (the child can't comprehend a point of view different from his own). It's a time of magical thinking and increased ability to use sym- bols and language. Concepts to be mastered include:\u0081 representational language and symbols \u2014re-presenting a reality into internal knowledge through language acquisition, using symbolic play such as riding a broom like horse \u0081 transductive reasoning \u2014generalization to the extent that items that share characteristics are labeled the same. Concrete operational stage During the concrete operational stage (ages 7 to 11), the child's thought processes become more logical and coherent. He can use inductive reasoning (using facts gathered from one or more specific experiences to draw a general conclusion about a situ- ation) to solve problems but still can't think abstractly. The child is less self-centered during this stage. Concepts to be mastered include sorting, ordering, and classifying facts to use in problem- solving. Formal operational thought stage The formal operational thought stage, which runs from ages 11 to 20, is characterized by adaptability and flexibility. The adolescent can think abstractly, form logical conclusions from his observa- tions, and establish and test hypothe ses. Concepts to be mastered include abstract ideas and concepts, possibilities, inductive rea- soning, and complex deductive reasoning. Psychosexual development Development of human sexuality is influenced by physical, emo- tional, and cultural aspects in the society in which we live. This sexuality is part of the total person, which develops over time. It's expressed through many avenues, including a person's attitudes, feelings, beliefs, and self-image. Sexual feelings Sigmund Freud theorized that sexual feelings are present in some form from the newborn period through adulthood. He felt human nature has two sides: rational intellect and irrational desires. Freud's theory of psychosexual development is fairly controver- sial, yet it is still used. He focused more on the abnormal mind and function rather than on the normal functioning of children and tied the development of personality to sexual development.

All Rights Reserved.22 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE Between the id, ego, and superego, there's always a battle going on. Are you up for the challenge?Id, ego, and superego According to the psychosexual theory, personality is com- posed of three entities: The id, the largest portion of the mind, is the center of our primitive instincts and requires immediate gratification. (The neonate is the epitome of the id.) The ego develops in infancy and is the conscious, rational part of the personality; it's less inward seeking than the id, and recognizes the larger picture. (The ego acts as a censor to the id; if there's conflict between the id and the ego, neuroses may develop.) The superego represents the person's conscience and ideals; therefore, it's in continuous battle with the id. Five stages of development Freud proposed five stages of development; these stages center around the early years of the person's life and the parent-child relationship. At each stage, sexual energy, what Freud called instinctual libido , is focused on a different area of the body. Each stage also centers on a conflict that must be resolved before the child can progress to the next stage. If the conflict isn't resolved, the child becomes fixated in that stage and devel- opment is arrested. I can't get no . . . satisfaction Satisfaction must be achieved before a person can move on to the next stage. If he isn't fully satisfied, it's possible he may never fully complete the stage. How the individual responds to others depends on which stage he's in. This was a hallmark theory in the field of psychology, although it's relatively limited in its scope. Oral stage In the oral stage (birth to age 1), the child seeks pleasure through sucking, biting, and other oral activities. Oral stimulation reduces tension and provides sensual satisfaction. Anal stage The anal and urethral areas are of great interest in the anal stage (ages 1 to 3). The child goes through toilet training and learns to control his excreta. Phallic stage During the phallic stage (ages 3 to 6), the child is interested in his genitalia and various sensations and discovers the difference So many stages, so little time. Thanks to Dr. Freud, I have my work cut out for me. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 22 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 22 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

This is known as the Oedipal (boys) or Electra (girls) complex . Latency period In the latency period (ages 6 to 12), the child expands on traits developed in earlier stages and concentrates on playing and learn-ing. The child doesn't focus on a particular area of the body during this stage. The Oedipal or Electra complex resolves, and the child forms close relationships with other children of the same age and gen- der. Energy is directed toward physical and intellectual quests. Genitalia stage The production of sex hormones becomes intense during the genitalia stage (ages 12 and older), and the reproductive system reaches maturation. During this stage, the adolescent develops the capacity for object love and maturity. Moral development Lawrence Kohlberg's ideas of moral reasoning (the basis for ethi- cal behavior) are based on the work of Piaget and the American philosopher John Dewey. Born free . . . of morals, that is! Kohlberg's theory is based on the premise that, at birth, all beings are devoid of morals, ethics, and honesty. Then, through different stages, the family, and then the larger society, instills values, mo- rality, and a sense of right and wrong. As the child's intelligence and ability to interact with others mature, his patterns of moral behavior mature as well. Kohlberg, along with Piaget, believed that most moral develop- ment occurs through social interaction; he felt that development could be promoted through formal education. Can we talk? According to Kohlberg, it's important to present a person with moral dilemmas for discussion, which helps him see the rea-sonableness of the next higher stage and progress toward it. Kohlberg based this discussion approach on the insight that a per- son develops as a result of cognitive conflicts in his current stage. Three levels of moral development Kohlberg proposed three levels of moral development through which the person must pass. As the child comprehends and under-stands a stage, he can then progress to the next stage. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 23 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 23 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

We all have to find a way to deal with it.Preconventional level of morality At the preconventional level (ages 2 to 7), the child attempts to follow rules set by those in authority. He tries to adjust his behavior according to good and bad and to right and wrong. Conventional level of morality At the conventional level (ages 7 to 12), the child seeks confor-mity and loyalty. He attempts to justify, support, and maintain the social order, and he follows fixed rules. Postconventional autonomous level of morality At the postconventional level (ages 12 and older), the adolescent strives to construct a personal and functional value system inde-pendent of authority figures and his peers. Caring for the hospitalized child Hospitalization is a major stressor for any individual, but especially for a child. The child is in an unfamiliar sur-rounding, with unfamiliar people. His routine is disrupted, and he isn't able to do things he normally does. Added to these stressors are the fear, pain, and discomfort associated with the child's illness or injury and, in many cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic interventions used to treat the child. What's more, even a minor illness may be per- ceived by the family as life-threatening. This perception can trigger fears that may overwhelm the family's coping skills and lead to crisis. Developmentally appropriate interventions should be geared toward helping the child and his family cope with this very stressful time. No place like home Separation of the child from his parents, siblings, and usual support systems further adds to the emotional stress and discom-fort a child feels when hospitalized. Parents (and siblings) should be encouraged and allowed to spend as much time as possible with the hospitalized child. When policy permits, arrangements should be made for a parent to spend the night in the child's room or close by. Minimizing the trauma of hospitalization Preparing a child for hospitalization and any interventions will help the child cope more effectively and make it easier for him to trust the health care professionals responsible for his care. I'm trying to follow my parents' rules, but this preconventional stuff isn't easy. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 24 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 24 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.25CARING FOR THE HOSPITALIZED CHILD Always be prepared When possible, it's ideal to prepare the child for admission to the hospital. The timing of the preparation and the amount of teaching given depend on the child's age, developmental stage, personality, and the length of the procedure or treatment. Young children may need only a few hours of preparation, whereas the older child may benefit from several days of prepara- tion. The use of developmentally appropriate activities will also help the child cope with the stress of hospitalization. (See The importance of play .) Specialist on the job Many hospitals have a child life specialist on staff, who can arrange a preadmission visit for the child and his parents. Dur- ing these visits, the child and his parents tour the pediatric unit, helping to familiarize the child with the sights, sounds, and smells of the hospital. The child life specialist, an expert in child devel-opment, then explains, step-by-step, what the child can expect\u2014 especially relating to any planned procedures\u2014and can also stay with the child during those procedures. Keep it in the family To reduce the fear that accompanies hospitalization, the nurse can help the child and family cope by:\u0081 explaining procedures \u0081 answering questions openly and honestly \u0081 minimizing separation from the parents\u0081 structuring the environment to allow the child to retain as much control as possible. Patient- and family-centered care is an approach to health care that recognizes that the child patient and the family are integral members of the health care team. It allows the family to remain as involved as possible and helps give the child and his family a sense of control in a difficult and unfamiliar situation. It may also help The importance of play One of the most important aspects of a child's life is play. Play can become even more important to a child who's hospitalized. It can serve several functions:\u0081 Play is an excellent stress reducer and tension reliever. It allows the child freedom of expression to act out his fears, concerns, and anxieties.\u0081 Play provides a source of diversional activity, alleviating separation anxiety.\u0081 Play provides the child with a sense of safety and secu- rity because, while he's engaging in play, he knows that no painful procedures will occur.\u0081 Developmentally appropriate play fosters the child's nor-mal growth and development, especially for children who are repeatedly hospitalized for chronic conditions.\u0081 Play puts the child in the driver's seat, allowing him to make choices and giving him a sense of control.

The child needs reassurance that the illness isn't his fault and that fear is a normal response. All children should be encouraged to express their feelings. Caring for the special needs child All children go through times in their lives when parents, family, and others need to adapt to certain outside influences. How the child copes with these influences, either positive or negative, is determined by his strengths, personality, developmental stage, and support systems. Chronic illness and disability When a child has a chronic illness or is disabled, family members experience additional stress that has lasting impli-cations for the child, his parents, and his siblings. Flexibility required Chronic or terminal illnesses, disabilities, or acute conditions that impact daily living require the family and the child to adapt their normal process of living and being; they also require health care professionals to adapt their usual way of providing care. On the rise Almost 20% of the pediatric population has a condition that would qualify them as having a special health care need. This percentage is increasing because of improved technology, health care, and treatments that increase survival rates. Barriers to optimal care level Children with special needs commonly require continuous and complex care. Oversight of care is usually provided by specialists who may or may not take into account alterations in development or the child's response to the illness. Occasion- ally, this may mean that the child doesn't receive preventive health services. Other barriers to optimal health care in the special needs child include financial, health care system, and knowledge barri- ers. For these reasons, it's especially important for the nurse to help ensure that the child is up-to-date on immunizations, well-child checkups, and routine health care. Impact on the family The diagnosis of a chronic condition may cause extreme distress in the family. Parents grieve over the loss of their \"healthy\" child Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 26 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 26 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

This view may hinder the child in meeting the tasks required for him to grow and develop as normally as possible. Helping the family understand the condition and its impact on normal growth and development will help the child achieve his highest level of functioning. The complexity of care that a special needs child may have also increases the burden of care on the family or may further isolate a family from outside support systems. This added stress may increase the risk for child abuse and other forms of victimization to the child. Hey, what about me? Having a sibling with a chronic condition may elicit feel- ings of stress, helplessness, guilt, or depression. Siblings should be included in the family assessment of coping and should be provided with appropriate support. Older siblings commonly participate in providing care to a special needs child at home as much as the parents do. They must be in-cluded when providing care and teaching to the child. Nursing strategies Care and nursing interventions should be adapted to the child's level of development. Consult the experts Parents and families are the people that know the most about their child. When planning interventions, the nurse should take into consideration the family's expertise in provid- ing care for their child; the parents should be consulted for advice about the child's routine, care preferences, and special needs. Be all that you can be The child should receive special needs care, as appropriate, and interventions aimed at promoting the child's ability to reach his maximum potential. A little help, please It's important to remember that a child with a disability or chronic ill-ness faces many challenges. Encouraging the use of such resources as support groups will help the child and family interact with others who are experiencing, or who have managed, the same issues. Understanding that the child's condition realigns the hopes and expectations of the family and the assigned roles within that fam- ily, the nurse can help provide interventions to help the child and family cope. To this end, the nurse can show respect and caring by: \u0081 supporting family coping strategies\u0081 providing education in a forthright, honest manner\u0081 brokering access to health services\u0081 promoting preventive health measures.

A perception exists in our society that children aren't supposed to die. For the nurse, this can be a painful and awkward situation. Dealing with a terminal illness An understanding of how the child and his family have managed health and illness in the past may provide the nurse with clues about how the family will cope with having a dying child. Impact on the family The death of a child is viewed by most people as the worst possible thing that can happen to a parent. Family members of a terminally ill child must deal with a range of emotions while still trying to deal with everyday needs, such as those related to jobs, the household, and the needs of their other children. To stay or to go\u2014that is the question These stressors can bring families closer together, but they can also tear families apart. It isn't unusual for parents to have marital stress after the death of a child, at a time when they need each other's support more than ever. Recent statistics show less than one-third of marriages end in divorce after the death of a child. It's a roller coaster ride Parents may experience a range of emotions, from fear and anger (sometimes directed at health care providers) to guilt and disabling grief even before their child dies. Siblings may feel unloved or forgotten, as their parents focus their attention on the dying child. They may then feel guilty about having those feelings. Nursing strategies The child who's dying has the same emotional and developmental needs as any other child of the same age\u2014as well as other needs related to his poor prognosis. The nurse should develop care plans based on family input to meet these needs at the child's develop- mental level\u2014realizing that the ill child may have some regression in his or her developmental level.

All procedures and therapies should be explained before carrying them out. Maximum control Pain control is an essential component in the management of a terminally ill child. The nurse should serve as the child's advocate to ensure that the child receives the most effective pain manage- ment possible. Helping families cope The nurse can help the family cope during this very difficult time by:\u0081 encouraging all family members to express their feelings, even though they might be difficult to hear \u0081 allowing families to spend as much time as possible with the dying child (including overnight stays)\u0081 allowing and encouraging parents to continue to take an active role in their child's care. Strong like a bull? Not always! The nurse can also help the family cope by: \u0081 reminding parents that they don't always have to be strong and that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness \u0081 helping parents to talk with their child about dying in a develop- mentally appropriate manner if he's ready to do so\u0081 providing parents and siblings with information about support groups and professionals who can help them with their grief \u0081 contacting other health care professionals (social work- ers, child life specialists, play therapists, art and music or pet therapists) and volunteers who may be able to help the child, his siblings, and his parents with coping and with concrete daily needs (such as transportation, sibling care, and special arrangements)\u0081 reassuring parents that you understand how difficult this must be but avoiding such phrases as \"I know how you feel\"\u0081 remaining as accessible and available as possible and facilitating contact and communication with other individuals on the child's health care team. Nurses have the unique opportunity to impact the child in every stage of life. Using the principles of caring for the whole person will help the child and his family deal with the most difficult stage, that of the dying child. An art, music, or play therapist can help a child cope. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 30 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 30 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Whaah!Pain in the pediatric patient Pain is a subjective experience; for infants and children, it's possibly the most bewildering and frightening occur-rence in their young lives. Until age 3 or so, children can't grasp abstract concepts, such as time, cause and effect, and quantification. Consequently, it's impossible for them to understand why pain occurs or that relief is just around the corner. They know only that something hurts right now. My kingdom for a word What makes the experience particularly distressing is that infants and young children lack the language skills needed to tell someone that they're in pain, where it hurts, and how much, or to ask for help. In this respect, infants and children are uniquely depen- dent on the ability of their parents and health care providers to recognize the physiologic and behavioral signs of pain and to react by relieving their pain. Similarly, children could reasonably expect these same caregivers to anticipate and prevent or mini-mize painful experiences whenever possible. Assessing pain A growing number of health professionals who work with chil- dren talk about pain as a fifth vital sign, one that should be as-sessed early and often to ensure prompt, effective relief. Assessing pain in infants and young children requires the coop- eration of the parents and the use of age-specific assessment tools. If the child can communicate verbally, he can also aid the process. Health history and physical examination Normal clinical assessment involves a health history that in- cludes a description of any pain and palliative measures and a comprehensive physical examination. When assessing infants and children, you must rely on parents for the health history and background on experience with pain. Wanna play 20 questions? To help you better understand the child's pain, ask the parents these questions:\u0081 What kinds of pain has your child had in the past? \u0081 How does your child usually respond to pain? \u0081 How do you know your child is in pain?\u0081 What do you do when he's hurting? Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 31 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 31 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.32 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE Anything you can tell me will help me understand your child's pain.\u0081 What does your child do when he's hurting? \u0081 What works best to relieve your child's pain?\u0081 Is there anything special you'd like me to know about your child and pain? No wonder they call 'em vital The child's vital signs can be pain indicators. Elevated pulse, blood pressure, or respirations can be signs of pain and stress. However, findings here must be viewed in conjunction with other assessment data because nonpainful stimuli can elicit changes in vital signs as well. For example, just touching an infant can speed or calm the child's pulse rate. Assessment tools A number of proven assessment tools have been designed for a young patient. Many of these tools seek to quantify the child's pain, one of the harder things to accomplish during assessment and observation. Using an assessment tool will help, but quantify- ing pain in the infant or preverbal child will still be difficult. Where's that toolbox? Pain assessment tools are described as being unidimensional (measuring or assessing one indicator) or multidimensional (measuring or assessing multiple indicators). Composite measures of pain include physiologic, behavioral, sensory, and cognitive indicators. These tools tend to be especially useful when assessing children under age 3 or older children with cognitive deficits. P ainful measures Because of the complexity of assessing pain in infants, there's no single pain measurement tool that works well for all patients. However, four multidimensional tools for measuring pain in in- fants have proved to be quite effective. These four tools are the: CRIES Neonatal Postoperative Pain Measurement Scale Neonatal Infant Pain Scale Premature Infant Pain Profile (See Measuring pain in infants .) COMFORT Scale. The CRIES inventory is one of the easier tools to use. Five separate factors are scored on a scale of 0 to 2. Infants with a score of 0 would be pain-free. A total score of 10 would indicate extreme pain. All of the assessment tools for infants and young children were developed to help assess acute pain. Currently, no tools exist to help measure chronic pain in infants and young children. The Memory jogger To help you stay fo-cused when as-sessing pain in the young pa-tient, remember the mnemonic QUEST : Q\u2014Question the child's parents (and the child, too, if he's old enough to respond). U\u2014Use ap- propriate pain assessment tools. E\u2014Evaluate the child's behavior. S\u2014Secure the parents' active participation in treatment.

Speaking of pain For the child capable of speaking, typically age 3, the task is some-what easier. Several simple and effective pain-measuring scales can help the child identify a level of pain. These include a: \u0081 faces pain-measuring scale \u0081 visual analog scale\u0081 chip pain-measuring tool.

Here's how to use each one: Faces scale (examples: Faces Pain Scale, Wong-Baker FACES\u00ae Pain Rating Scale, etc.) The child age 3 and older can use any of the faces scales to rate his pain. When using this tool, make sure he can see and point to each face and then describe the amount of pain each face is experiencing. If he's able, the child can read the text under the picture; otherwise, you or his parent can read it to him.Avoid saying anything that might prompt the child to choose a certain face. Then, ask the child to choose the face that shows how he's feeling right now. Record his response in your assessment notes. Happy because he doesn't hurt at allHurts just a little bit Hurts a little more Hurts even more Hurts a whole lot Hurts the most Visual analog scale A visual analog pain scale is simply a straight line with the phrase \"no pain\" at one end and the phrase \"the most pain possible\" at the other. Children who understand the concept of a continuum can mark the spot on the line that corresponds to the level of pain they feel. No pain The most pain possible Chip toolThe chip tool uses four identical chips to signify levels of pain and can be used for the child who understands the basic concept of adding one thing to another to get more. If available, you can use poker chips. If not, simply cut four uniform circles from a sheet of paper. Here's how to present the chips:\u0081 First say, \"I want to talk with you about the hurt you might be having right now.\"\u0081 Next, align the chips horizontally on the bedside table, a clipboard, or other firm surface where the child can easily see and reach them.\u0081 Point to the chip at the child's far left and say, \"This chip is just a little bit of hurt.\"\u0081 Point to the second chip and say, \"This next chip is a little more hurt.\"\u0081 Point to the third chip and say, \"This next chip is a lot of hurt.\" \u0081 Point to the last chip and say, \"This last chip is the most hurt you can have.\"\u0081 Ask the child, \"How many pieces of hurt do you have right now?\" (You won't need to offer the option of \"no hurt at all\" because the child will tell you if he doesn't hurt.)\u0081 Record the number of chips. If the child's answer isn't clear, talk to him about his answer; then record your findings. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 34 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 34 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Until I can say it, this is the best way I can let you know.Behavioral responses to pain Behavior is the language infants and children rely on to convey information about their pain. Areas of behavior that change because of pain include body positioning, facial expression, patterns of eating and sleeping, attention level, and vocalization. Look at that face! In an infant, facial expression is the most common and consis- tent behavioral response to all stimuli, painful or pleasurable, and may be the single best indicator of pain for the provider and the parent. Studies indicate that facial expression is a more reliable pain indicator than crying, heart rate, or body position and movement. Facial expressions that tend to indicate that the infant is in pain include:\u0081 mouth stretched open\u0081 eyes tightly shut\u0081 brows and forehead knitted (as they are in a grimace)\u0081 cheeks raised high enough to form a wrinkle on the nose. Older signs In young children, facial expression is joined by other behav- iors to convey pain. In these patients, look for such signs as:\u0081 narrowing of the eyes \u0081 grimace or fearful appearance \u0081 frequent and longer lasting bouts of crying, with a tone that's higher and louder than normal\u0081 less receptiveness to comforting by parents or other caregivers \u0081 holding or protecting the painful area. Hush-a-bye, why do you cry? Enlist the parents' help in interpreting the child's crying. Pain may be the cause, but hunger, anger, fear, or a wet diaper can also elicit crying. Typically, parents can distinguish among the different cries of their child and help narrow down the possible causes. Crying associated with pain is distinguished by frequency, du- ration, pitch, and intensity. Cries of pain are usually short, sharp, higher in pitch, tense, harsh, nonmelodious, and loud. Silent cry On the other hand, some infants don't cry in response to pain, even pain associated with an invasive procedure. Also, some treatments make crying impossible. Intubated infants, for ex- ample, can't produce an audible cry because the endotracheal tube passes through their vocal cords. However, these infants still exhibit the facial expressions that accompany crying\u2014mouth opened wide and eyes tightly closed, insinuating crying.

Do you need a translation? Ask my Mommy.Looks can be deceiving It's a mistake to rely too heavily on observed behavior alone when assessing pain in young patients. Some children will suffer pain rather than report it or allow others to see that they're in pain. Others are adept at distracting themselves and may appear pain- free. Some children may have been conditioned to not show pain because of negative consequences if they do. Some children will sleep soundly, not because they have no pain, but because they're physically and emotionally exhausted. Translation needed A child who has mastered the rudiments of language can provide some useful information. However, keep in mind that his language skills are very basic and that he may not understand words you use; you may call it pain, but he may think of it as a hurt or boo-boo. Find the words that work best by talking with his parents and with the child himself. Check the mirror Remember that children who are just learning to talk have a great deal more skill in reading the facial expressions and body language of their parents and caregivers. After all, they've been reading this language since birth. Be sure your expression and body posture are conveying a message consistent with your words. If you or his parents appear concerned, he may feel there's something to fear, and this may color his description of the pain he's feeling. Managing pain Infants and young children may experience acute pain, cancer pain, or chronic pain associated with an underlying disorder. Pain management is most effective when it prevents, limits, or avoids noxious stimuli and involves administering analgesics. Regardless of the underlying cause, pain management for these young patients seeks to: \u0081 identify and relieve existing pain \u0081 anticipate and prevent or minimize pain related to hospitaliza- tion, procedures, and treatments\u0081 optimize pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce stress, increase comfort, and enhance healing. Pharmacologic intervention Pharmacologic therapy is the mainstay of pain management for an infant or a child. Selection of the medications, dosages, and ad-ministration routes depends on the specific needs of the patient.

Get ready to wipe out some pain.Opioid analgesics Opioid analgesics are highly effective pain relievers and constitute the core of most pharmacologic interventions to manage acute pain (especially postoperative pain) in infants and children. Choose your weapon among the opioids used most commonly in these patients. While they're thought to be equivalent, mor- phine may provide better sedation and a lower risk of chest wall rigidity than fentanyl. Tramadol has less respiratory depression than morphine but is not quite as strong. . . . and pick a route Opioid makes it rela- tively easy to find an acceptable route. Although we've learned much about the pharmaco- dynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids in young children, many practitioners still resist prescribing them. Hip hooray for PCA! Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) can be useful in managing pain in the young patient, provided the parents are involved and they (and, if appropriate, the child) are trained in the theory and proper use of this equipment. PCA allows the patient to maintain a therapeutic level of the prescribed opioid analgesic at all times. It has proven effective in children ages 5 and older. Parent-controlled analgesia is an effective way to allow the use of I.V. PCA for children younger than age 5 and for those with a developmental delay. Nonopioid analgesics Nonopioid (NSAIDs), are prescribed to man-age mild to moderate pain. In instances of severe pain, nonopioid analgesics can be used in conjunction with opioid analgesics to reduce the required dosage of the opioid drug. Infants and children metabolize nonopioid analgesics in a simi- lar manner and rate as adults; consequently, the selection criteria, effects, and possible adverse effects are comparable to adults. Acetaminophen anyone? Acetaminophen is the drug of choice for treating mild pain. It has the added benefit of helping reduce fever and is very safe, even for neonates. Acetaminophen has few adverse effects or contra- indications. However, long-term use can increase the risk of liver Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 37 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 37 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.38 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE damage, and overdosing can be lethal. It's also possible to reach a point at which additional doses no longer provide an analgesic effect. On the plus side, acetaminophen is available in suppository, liquid, and chewable tablet form, making it easy to administer and appropriate for most situations. Caution the parents to not use combination medications (such as cough and cold remedies that may also contain acetaminophen) to prevent the risk of overdose. Who said NSAIDs? NSAIDs relieve mild to moderate pain, reduce fever and also act as anti-inflammatory agents. Commonly prescribed NSAIDs, for use in children. Possible adverse effects of NSAIDs include inhibition of platelet aggregation and GI irritation. Combining or alternating therapy Although alternating ibuprofen and acetaminophen is a very com- mon practice, it is not recommended. Current studies looking at fever management have not found any significant advantage for alternating medications versus using a single medication. Studies of alternating the two for pain management in children are lim-ited. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend combining or alternating medications due to the risk of confusion causing an inappropriate or over dose to be given. Adjuvant therapy Adjuvant therapy is defined as a pharmacologic agent that is added to another medication to increase its effect. Although there are very few studies of the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy in infants and children, doctors prescribe a range of medications as adjuvant therapy, usually when treating cancer pain in infants and children. Positive results from such therapy have made adjuvant therapy more acceptable as a constructive facet of pain manage- ment in other chronic conditions as well, such as neuropathies, headache, myofascial pain, and recurrent abdominal pain. Types of drugs used for adjuvant therapy, and their therapeutic effects, include:\u0081 antianxiety medications, such as lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium), and midazolam (Versed), which are used to enhance the effect of opioids \u0081 which are used treat neuropathies caused by certain diseases or trauma\u0081 corticosteroids, which help alleviate severe inflammation and bone pain\u0081 neuroleptic drugs, which are antipsychotic, tranquilizing, seda-tive, and analgesic, to help relieve pain associated with cancer, certain neuralgias, phantom limb, and muscular discomfort Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 38 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 38 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.39PAIN IN THE PEDIATRIC PATIENT There's nothing like a little relaxation to relieve stress in patients\u2014and in nurses too!\u0081 tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), which are sometimes used to manage headache and chronic pain\u0081 topical or local anesthetics, which are given before procedures, such as I.V. insertion, to reduce procedural pain. Many of the previously mentioned medications can have seri- ous side effects or even a paradoxical response. Make sure you help the parents understand the importance of using the medica- tion properly and to report any adverse effects right away. Nonpharmacologic interventions For the infant, child, or youth, nonpharmacologic interventions pick up where drug therapies stop\u2014by reducing stress and anxiety and increasing comfort and security. Typically, these measures are just as critical to the patient's well-being as pain relief. Nonpharmacologic interventions cause no adverse effects, require no special equipment, and can be used at any time. These interventions have another benefit: They can give the parents an opportunity to shine in the care of their child. Cognitive-behavioral therapies Cognitive-behavioral interventions for the infant include po- sitioning, containment or swaddling, distraction, touching, and gentle massage. Wrap 'em up Placing an infant in a midline or supine position has a calming effect, as does wrapping him snugly in a soft blanket. Providing distraction\u2014for example, with a bedside mobile or a safe, colorful toy or stuffed animal\u2014helps the infant focus on some- thing enjoyable rather than his pain. You're getting sleepy\u2014very sleepy For a toddler, distraction, hypnosis, guided imagery, gentle mas- sage, snuggling with Mom and Dad, and curling up in bed listening to a story are all methods of moving the child's focus away from his pain toward more serene, safe, and comforting thoughts. Physical therapy Thermotherapy is the most common form of physical therapy used with infants. Applying warm and cold to painful areas can make them feel better. Heat promotes circulation, and cold helps reduce swelling and provides a limited amount of numbing. Complementary therapies Complementary therapies , such as music or aromatherapy, are gaining acceptance because of the influence music and aromas can have on emotions and state of mind.

Children aren't little adults. Their bodies absorb, distribute, and metabolize medications differently.Charms to soothe For the infant or child, soothing music has a calming effect and can help him drift off to sleep at nap time. More lively music can stimulate memories or encourage singing, which distract the child for a time. Smells that remind him of Mom, Dad, or Grandma's house can be comforting as well. Sucking on sucrose For the infant, nonnutritive sucking using a pacifier, a pacifier dipped in sucrose, or a small bottle of water containing su-crose is effective in reducing pain associated with procedures. Nonnutritive sucking with or without sucrose can be used to calm the infant before the procedure as well as afterward. Preparing pediatric medications Medications are used throughout the life span to treat health problems (including pain), combat disease, and promote health. Many health care professionals have expressed concerns about medication use in infants and children. These concerns are gradu- ally beginning to fade, primarily because our understanding of medications' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in infants and young children has significantly improved in recent years. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics The pharmacokinetic (how a drug acts and how it moves through the body) and pharmacodynamic (study of drug mechanisms that produce biochemical or physiologic changes in the body) properties of medications include: \u0081 absorption\u2014how the drug is absorbed or moved into the bloodstream\u0081 distribution\u2014how the drug is distributed or transferred to another site \u0081 protein-binding capacity\u2014a measure of the drug's efficiency\u0081 metabolism\u2014the process of converting the drug into a useful form\u0081 elimination\u2014the removal of the drug from the body. Medication metabolism in young children It's important to understand how the unique physiology of young children affects pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynam-ics. Infants and young children are still developing physiologi- cally, which affects the way their bodies absorb, distribute, and metabolize drugs. The metabolism of an infant or young child differs significantly from that of an older patient. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 40 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 40 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Consult a formulary or drug handbook to verify a drug dose. (When in doubt, call the pharmacist.) Keep your patient's weight in kilograms at his bedside so you won't have to es- timate it or weigh him in a rush. Acid, protein, and water . . . oh my! A better understanding of how medications are used and me- tabolized in children will lead to safer medication administra-tion in the pediatric population: \u0081 Because gastric acidity doesn't stabilize until approximately age 3, the absorption and concentration of drugs that require an acid environment to be fully assimilated may be affected.\u0081 Protein-binding, which aids in the distribution of drugs in the body, is lower in infants and children than in older patients. \u0081 Compared to adults, infants have proportionately more water weight and extracellular water, less fat, and less muscle tissue. In infants, hepatic (liver) metabolism is slower and renal clear-ance is delayed. These factors can increase the potential for drug toxicity. Dosage calculations To calculate and verify the safety of pediatric drug dosages, use either the dosage per kilogram of body weight method or the body surface area (BSA) method. Other methods, such as those based on age, are less accurate and typically aren't used. Whichever method you use, remember that, as a nurse, you're professionally and legally responsible for checking the safety of a prescribed dose before administration. (See Trio of timesaving tips .) Dosage per kilogram of body weight Many pharmaceutical companies provide information about safe drug dosages for pediatric patients in milligrams per kilo-gram of body weight. This measurement is the most accurate and common way to calculate pediatric dosages. Pediatric dosages are usually expressed as mg/kg/day or mg/kg/dose . Based on this information, you can determine the pediatric dose by multiplying the child's weight in kilograms by the required number of milligrams of drug per kilogram. Shifting weight Most pediatric patients' weights are measured in kilograms. If you must convert from pounds to kilograms before calculating the dosage per kilogram of body weight, remember that 1 kg equals 2.2 lb.

The suspension that's available is penicillin V potassium 125 mg/5 ml. What volume should you administer for each dose? Here's how to solve this problem using ratios and fractions: \u0081 First, convert the child's weight from pounds to kilograms by setting up this proportion: X : 55 lb : : 1 kg : 2.2 lb \u0081 Multiply the extremes and the means: X lb /H11005 1 kg /H11003 55 lb \u0081 Solve for X by dividing each side of the equation by 2.2 lb and canceling units that appear in both the numerator and the denominator.

Dosage by BSA The BSA method is used to calculate safe pediatric dosages for a limited number of drugs. (It's also used to calculate safe dosages for adult patients receiving extremely potent drugs that need to be administered with absolute precision, such as antineoplastic or chemotherapeutic agents.)

BSA is critical when calculating dosages for pediatric patients or for drugs that are extremely potent and need to be given in precise amounts. The nomogram shown here lets you plot the pa-tient's height and weight to determine the BSA. Here's how it works:\u0081 Locate the patient's height in the left column of the nomogram and his weight in the right column.\u0081 Use a ruler to draw a straight line connect-ing the two points. (The point where the line intersects the surface area column indicates the patient's BSA in square meters.)\u0081 For an average-sized child, use the simplified nomogram in the box. Just find the child's weight in pounds on the left side of the scale and then read the corresponding BSA on the right side.

I think the apple juice will go quite nicely with my acetaminophen today.Allowing choices gives the child a sense of control. I have the height. Now I need the weight and the BSA. Will this be on the final exam?The plot thickens Calculating dosages by BSA is done in two steps: \u0081 Plot the patient's height and weight on a chart (called a nomo- gram ) to determine the BSA in square meters (m2). (See What's in a nomogram? ) \u0081 Multiply the BSA by the prescribed pediatric dose in mg/m2/day. Here's the formula: child's dose in mg /H11005 m2 /H11003 pediatric dose in mg m2/day The BSA method is also used to calculate a child's dose based on the average adult BSA\u20141.73 m2\u2014and an average adult dose. The formula looks like this: child's BSA in m2 child's dose (mg) /H11005 average adult BSA (1.73 m2) /H11003 average adult dose Administering pediatric medications The methods used to prepare drugs and administer them to pedi- atric patients differ from the methods used for adults, depending on which route is used. There are specific administration guide- lines and precautions for each route as well. (See Giving medica- tions to children , page 46.) Oral route Infants and young children who can't swallow tablets or capsules are given oral drugs in liquid form. When a liquid preparation isn't available, you may, generally, crush a tablet and mix it with a small amount of liquid. However, it's important that you don't:\u0081 mix crushed tablets in essential fluids, such as infant formula, because this could lead to feeding refusal \u0081 crush enteric-coated drugs or timed-release capsules or tablets because crushing destroys the coating that causes drugs to release at the right time or prevent stomach irritation. A spoonful of sugar These suggestions will help to make administering pills and liquids easier for the child and the nurse:\u0081 Allow the child as much choice as possible (for instance, which pill to take first or which beverage to drink).

Hold the infant with his head elevated to prevent aspiration. Nasal route Administering a nasal medication to a child may not be as dif- ficult as it sounds. Parents can also be instructed in giving nose drops and giving medication with a nasal inhaler. Drop in the bucket? To administer nose drops:\u0081 Warm the medication to room temperature and warn the child that he may taste the medication. Wash your hands. \u0081 Draw up the proper amount of medication into the dropper. \u0081 Have the child gently blow his nose if he's able, or clean away secretions with a washcloth. \u0081 Tilt the child's head back. (In small children, this can be accomplished by having the child lie on his back with a small pillow placed between the shoulders and tilting his head back over the top of the pillow.)\u0081 Push up gently on the child's nose.\u0081 Instruct the child to breathe through his mouth while the medication is being placed in the nose. (For infants, be sure to instill the drops in one naris at a time because infants are obligate nose breathers.)\u0081 Without touching the dropper to the nose, aim the dropper toward the back of the nostril and place the correct number of drops in each side of the nose.\u0081 Keep the head tilted back for at least 1 minute (count to 60) and then allow the child to spit out any medication that has run down the back of his throat. The nose knows To give medication with a nasal inhaler: Wash your hands. \u0081 Place the tip of the inhaler inside the child's nostril. \u0081 Have the child inhale; then administer the medication.Advice from the experts Giving medications to children When giving oral and parenteral medications to children, safety is essential. Keep these points in mind:\u0081 Check the child's mouth to make sure he has swal-lowed the oral medication.\u0081 Carefully mix oral drugs that come in suspension form.\u0081 Give intramuscu-lar (I.M.) injections in the vastus lateralis muscle of infants who haven't started walking.\u0081 Don't inject more than 1 ml into I.M. or subcutaneous sites.\u0081 Rotate injection 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Knowing what to expect makes interventions less frightening.\u0081 Have the child hold his breath for a few seconds and then ex- hale through his mouth.\u0081 Don't allow the child to blow his nose for at least 3 minutes. Up your nose with a . . . sprayer To administer a nasal spray: Wash your hands. \u0081 Plug one nostril and place the tip of the sprayer a short distance into the opposite nostril. \u0081 Have the child hold his breath; then administer the medication.\u0081 Tell the child to hold his breath for a few more seconds and then exhale through his mouth. \u0081 Make sure the child keeps his head tilted back for at least 1 minute, and don't allow him to blow his nose. Optic route The administration of eye drops or eye ointment can be difficult for the child because of his natural instinct to blink. Tell the child and parents that eye ointment may cause blurred vision for a short time. The eyes have it To administer eye drops or ointments: \u0081 Warm the medication to room temperature. Wash your hands. \u0081 Clean the eye of all secretions and residual medication. \u0081 Tilt the child's head back and have the child look at the ceiling.\u0081 Using your thumb and index finger, gently pull back the lower lid to expose the conjunctival sac. \u0081 Without touching the dropper or bottle to the eye, administer the drops into the conjunctival sac, not directly into the eye. When administering an eye ointment, apply the ointment from the inner canthus to the outer canthus of the eye.\u0081 Have the child close his eyes for a few minutes; then wipe away excess ointment. \u0081 If a second type of eye drop or an eye ointment is required, wait 5 minutes before administering the second medication. Otic route Because younger children are more prone to developing ear infec- tions than older children or adolescents, eardrops may be used frequently in young children.

To administer eardrops: Wash your hands. \u0081 Place the child on his side, with the affected ear facing up. \u0081 Clean away secretions or residual medication. \u0081 Straighten the ear canal. (In children younger than age 3, hold the ear and gently pull down and back. In children older than 3, gently pull the pinna up and back.) \u0081 Instill the correct number of drops into the ear without touching the dropper to the ear. (Try to let the drops run down the side of the canal rather than dropping into the center of the canal.)\u0081 Have the child lie on his side for at least 1 minute. Rectal route Rectal suppositories may be needed for a child who has been vomiting or who can't receive his medications orally. The rectal suppository should be firm. If it isn't, run it under cold water before unwrapping it. How it's supposed to go To administer a suppository: Wash your hands. \u0081 Remove the suppository from its wrapper. \u0081 Assist the child into the Sims' position (on his left side with his right knee flexed and close to his chest).\u0081 Dip the suppository into water or a water-soluble lubricant such as K-Y jelly. \u0081 Wearing gloves, gently separate the buttocks to expose the anus. \u0081 Gently insert the smooth, rounded end of the suppository into the anal orifice.\u0081 Push the suppository into the rectum (approximately 1 /H11033 [2.5 cm]) until there's no resistance. (Use your smallest finger in a child younger than age 3.)\u0081 Remove your finger, ensuring the suppository remains in place. \u0081 Hold the child's buttocks together for 5 minutes to prevent expulsion of the medication.\u0081 Keep the child in the Sims' position for approximately 20 minutes. NG, OG, or gastrostomy route Administration of nasogastric (NG), orogastric (OG), and gastros- tomy medications or feedings follows the same principles. Tube placement is checked by inserting 5 cc of air into the tube while Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 48 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 48 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

To administer NG, OG, or feedings: Wash your hands. \u0081 Aspirate and measure stomach contents to determine the amount of residual stomach contents and then return the contents to the stomach to prevent an electrolyte imbalance.\u0081 Pinch or clamp the tubing closed to prevent air from entering the stomach. \u0081 Remove the plunger from the barrel of the syringe and attach the barrel to the gastric tube.\u0081 Fill the tube with the medication or formula.\u0081 Allow the medication or formula to infuse slowly, holding the tube no more than approximately 6 /H11033 (15.2 cm) above the stomach. \u0081 Flush with water (use a minimal amount, no more than 30 cc) to clean the tubing and prevent obstruction. \u0081 Clamp the end of the tubing when finished. Inhalation route Aerosol medications are commonly used in treating respiratory illnesses such as asthma or bronchiolitis. Advantages of using this route include delivering the medication directly to the site of action, a faster onset of action, and less systemic side effects. The most commonly used methods of giving aerosolized medications are via a metered-dose inhaler or through a nebulizer. Using an inhaler Most children are not able to coordinate the steps required to use a metered-dose inhaler properly and therefore need to use a spacer with the inhaler. Teach the parents and the child the steps for ensuring all the medication is delivered to the airways. Many inhalers have a counter attached so it is easy to know how many doses are available. To use an inhaler with a spacer: Take off the protective caps of both the inhaler and the spacer. Shake the inhaler to ensure the medication is mixed. Place the inhaler into the open end of the spacer, opposite the spacer mouthpiece or mask. Have the child completely exhale by blowing out all his breath. Put the spacer mouthpiece in the child's mouth and have him seal his lips around it (or place the mask around the mouth and nose).

All Rights Reserved.50 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE Push the inhaler canister once to release the medication into the spacer. Have the child breathe in slowly through his mouth, inhaling the medication that is trapped in the spacer. Some spacers will make a sound if the child breathes in too fast. If the child is able, tell the child to hold his breath for 10 seconds. Take the spacer out of the child's mouth (or the mask away from the face) and have him breathe out slowly. Wait at least 1 full minute before taking any additional puffs that may be ordered. If using a steroid inhaler, teach the child to rinse his mouth after finishing the dose. Replace the caps. Rinse the spacer and inhaler canister rou- tinely to prevent a buildup of medication. If using a mask spacer for an infant or young child, have the parent place the inhaler in the soft ring opposite the mask and then place the mask securely over the child's nose and mouth to form a good seal. Keep the mask firmly in place while the child takes six breaths. Wait 1 minute between each puff ordered. Using a nebulizer Nebulizers work by turning the medication into an aerosol mist that is easily breathed in. In many cases, nebulizers are not needed if an inhaler is used properly. To use a nebulizer, teach the parent or older child how to use the machine properly. Hook up the hose to the air compressor. Fill the medication cup with the proper dose of medication. Attach both the hose and the mouthpiece to the medication cup. Place the mouthpiece in the child's mouth. Have the child breathe in through his mouth until all the medi- cation is gone. This can take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. A mask may be used for smaller children. Nose clips may also be used if it is hard for the child to remember to only breathe through his mouth. Also teach the parents and child to rinse out the medication cup and mouthpiece and let them air dry after each use. I.M. and S.C. routes I.M. and subcutaneous (S.C.) routes are commonly used when medications are better absorbed outside of the gastric system. Children commonly fear needles and need reassurance when re- ceiving parenteral medications. Help the child cope by explaining how he can help, applying ice on the injection site, or teaching distraction techniques. Allowing the parents to hold and comfort the child may make the job easier for you and less traumatic for the child.

Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris For a child younger than age 3, you'll typically use the vas-tus lateralis or rectus femoris muscle for an I.M. injection. Constituting the largest mus-cle mass in this age-group, the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris have fewer major blood vessels and nerves. Ventrogluteal and dorsoglutealFor a child who can walk and is older than age 3, use the ventrogluteal and dorsoglu-teal muscles. Like the vastus lateralis, the ventrogluteal site is relatively free of major blood vessels and nerves. Before you select either site, make sure that the child has been walking for at least 1 year to ensure sufficient muscle development. Deltoid For a child older than 18 months who needs rapid medication results, consider using the deltoid muscle. Because blood flows faster in the deltoid muscle than in other muscles, drug absorp-tion should be faster. Be careful if you use this site because the deltoid doesn't develop fully until adolescence. In a younger child, it's small and close to the radial nerve, which could be injured during needle insertion. Vastus (ventrogluteal) Brachial Kluwer.

For the critically ill child in cardiac arrest or shock, the administration of fluids and medications may be lifesaving. For the child in whom venous access can't be quickly established, intraosseous infu- sion may be necessary. (This occurs most commonly in children younger than age 5.) Fluids and medications that are infused into the medullary space of the long bones quickly enter the venous circulation. (See Performing intraosseous administration .) The most common site for intraosseous infusion is the medial surface of the proximal tibia. Other sites include the distal tibia and the distal femur. When the needle has been placed into the bone, fluid resusci- tation should be instituted by injecting fluid under pressure via a syringe. Standard I.V. pumps and tubing may be used to deliver the fluids. Gravity may help infuse the fluid if the patient is hemody- namically stable. It's important to remember that extravasation is common around the site, especially with prolonged placement and pressure infusion. I.V. therapy I.V. therapy commonly is used to give both fluids and medications to an ill child. Extreme caution and care must be taken in giving Performing intraosseous administration In an emergency, intraosseous drug administration may be used for a critically ill child younger than age 6.

To avoid the epiphyseal plate, direct the needle at a perpendicular or slightly inferior angle. After penetrating the bony cortex and inserting the needle into the marrow cavity, you'll feel no resistance, you'll be able to aspirate bone marrow, the needle will remain upright without support, and the infusion will flow freely without subcutaneous infiltration. If bone or marrow ob-structs the needle, replace the needle by passing a second one through the cannula. When the needle is properly inserted, stabilize and secure it with gauze dressing and tape. Discontinue when a secure I.V. line is established. Tibial tuberosity 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.54 CONCEPTS IN PEDIATRIC NURSING CARE A mobile child is a happy child. Most kids can become experts at getting around with an I.V . pole. It just takes a little teaching and some supervision.the prescribed amounts of fluids and medications. The rate of flow should be checked frequently, and a pump system is recom-mended. Because extravasation of fluid or phlebitis may develop quickly, the site must be checked frequently. Access granted The venous system may be accessed either peripherally or centrally. After the access device is in place, the site must be kept secure and protected to provide the necessary fluids and medications. On a short leash The nurse must consider the sensitivity of the child's skin and limit the use of tape. The nurse should also consider the child's developmental needs, such as the desire to ex- plore, and take steps to ensure his safety while giving him as much freedom as possible after the I.V. is in place. Venous access devices Commonly used peripheral I.V. sites include the hands and arms; however, in some children, these might not be the most readily accessible peripheral sites. By foot or by scalp . . . we shall prevail The feet (greater saphenous vein) or even a scalp vein in the neonate may be used. Always use the smallest needle size possible. For children, this is typically a 24G or 25G needle. Have no fear\u2014no tourniquet here Smaller children may be fearful of a tourniquet. In this in-stance, venous distention may be obtained simply by grasping and applying pressure to the area proximal to the vein. Long-term I.V. therapy Long-term I.V. therapy is best accomplished with a vascular access device. Such devices include infusion ports, catheters, and cannulas. The type that's most appropriate in a particular situ- ation depends on the type and length of treatment as well as the diagnosis. Children with cancer who require chemotherapy, blood transfusions, fluids, and nutrition are usually given an implant-able device such as a port.

These catheters may remain in place for months. The nurse must check the site frequently for signs and symptoms of infection, patency, proper functioning, and placement. Infusion pumps Infusion pumps are commonly used in pediatric patients. The pump doesn't depend on gravity for flow; instead, it maintains a preselected volume delivery by adding pressure to the system when necessary. If the pressure required to deliver the fluid ex- ceeds a maximum pressure limit, an alarm sounds. Infiltrate and irritate Unfortunately, the use of pumps carries the danger of infiltration or vein irritation caused by the medication or solution adminis-tered under pressure. When the pump has delivered the exact volume prescribed, an alarm sounds. Many facility policies dictate the time lapse allowed for checking the pump, the I.V. site, and the volume of solution infused. Calculating pediatric fluid needs Children's fluid needs are proportionally greater than those of adults, so children are more vulnerable to changes in fluid and electrolyte balance. Because their extracellular fluid has a higher percentage of water, chil- dren's fluid exchange rates are two to three times greater than those of adults, leaving them more susceptible to dehydration. Calculation trio Determining and meeting the fluid needs of children are important nursing responsibilities. You can calculate the number of milliliters of fluid a child needs based on: \u0081 weight in kilograms \u0081 metabolism (calories required)\u0081 BSA in square meters. Although results may vary slightly, all three methods are appropriate. Keep in mind that fluid replacement can also be affected by clinical conditions that cause fluid retention or loss. Children with these conditions should receive fluids based on their individual needs. Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 55 Meadows-Oliver_Ch02.indd 55 5/22/14 8:56 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Fluid formula for tiny tots . . . A child who weighs less than 10 kg requires 100 ml of fluid per kilogram of body weight per day. To determine this child's fluid needs, first convert his weight from pounds to kilograms. Then multiply the results by 100 ml/kg/day. Here's the formula: weight in kg . A child weighing 10 to 20 kg requires 1,000 ml of fluid per day for the first 10 kg plus 50 ml for every kilogram over 10. To determine this child's fluid needs, follow these steps: \u0081 Convert his weight from pounds to kilograms. \u0081 Subtract 10 kg from the child's total weight and then multiply the result by 50 ml/kg/day to find the child's additional fluid needs. Here's the formula: (total kg /H11002 10 kg) /H11003 50 ml/kg/day /H11005 additional fluid need in ml/day \u0081 Add the additional daily fluid need to the 1,000 ml/day required for the first 10 kg.

To deter-mine this child's fluid needs, follow these steps: \u0081 Convert the child's weight from pounds to kilograms. \u0081 Subtract 20 kg from the child's total weight and then multiply the result by 20 ml/kg to find the child's additional fluid needs. Here's the formula: (total kg /H11002 20 kg) /H11003 20 ml/kg/day /H11005 additional fluid need in ml/day \u0081 Because the child needs 1,500 ml of fluid per day for the first 20 kg, add the additional fluid need to 1,500 ml.

I'm counting calories, and it has nothing at all to do with my thighs!Fluid needs based on calories You can calculate fluid needs based on calories because water is needed for metabolism. A child should receive 120 ml of fluid for every 100 kilocalories (kcal; also called calories ) of metabolism. Calorie-conscious calculation To calculate fluid requirements based on calorie requirements, follow these steps:\u0081 Find the child's calorie requirements. You can take this from a table of recommended dietary allowances for children, or you can have a dietitian calculate it.\u0081 Divide the calorie requirements by 100 kcal because fluid requirements are determined for every 100 calories. \u0081 Multiply the results by 120 ml (the amount of fluid re- quired for every 100 kcal). Here's the formula: fluid requirements in ml/day /H11005 calorie requirements /H11003 120 ml 100 kcal Real-world problem This problem will help sharpen your skills for calculating fluid needs based on calories. Use the preceding information to solve it. Daily dilemma Your pediatric patient uses 900 calories/day. What are his daily fluid requirements?\u0081 Set up the formula inserting the appropriate numbers and sub- stituting X for the unknown amount of fluid: X /H11005 900 kcal /H11003 120 ml 100 /H11005 9 /H11003 120 ml X /H11005 1,080 ml The patient needs 1,080 ml of fluid per day. Fluid needs based on BSA Another method for determining pediatric maintenance fluid requirements is based on the child's BSA. To calculate the daily fluid needs of a child who isn't dehy- drated, multiply the BSA by 1,500, as shown in this formula: fluid maintenance needs in ml/day /H11005 BSA Kluwer.

Your patient is 36 /H11033 tall and weighs 40 lb. If his BSA is 0.72 m2, how much fluid does he need each day?\u0081 Set up the equation, inserting the appropriate numbers and substituting X for the unknown amount of fluid. Then solve for X: X /H11005 0.72 m 2 /H11003 1,080 ml/day The child needs 1,080 ml of fluid per day. Quick quiz 1. A 2-year-old can be expected to sleep: A. 12 to 14 hours a day with most of it during the night and one long nap during the day. B. 14 to 15 hours a day, usually 4 to 6 hours at a time and two to three naps during the day. C. 10 to 12 hours a day with no naps. D. 8 to 10 hours a day with one nap during the day. Answer: A. A toddler can be expected to sleep 8 to 10 hours a night with a long nap during the day to equal 12 to 14 hours. Infants sleep more total hours throughout the day but in shorter time frames. By the time a child reaches kindergarten, he sleeps a long time at night and typically does not need a nap. Teens require 8 to 10 hours of sleep daily but may need a nap during periods of growth. 2. According to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development, a 7-year-old who enjoys working with others and helping his parents on weekend projects is in what stage? A. Autonomy versus shame and doubt B. Initiative versus guiltC. Industry versus inferiorityD. Identity versus role confusion Answer: C. Industry versus inferiority occurs from approxi- mately ages 6 to 12. During this time, the child enjoys being help-ful and relationships become more important. Autonomy versus shame and doubt occur through toddlerhood. Initiative versus guilt happens in 3- to 6-year-olds, and identity versus role confu-sion occurs during adolescence.

She recognizes at this age, the child: A. has no concept of death whatsoever. B. knows the words \"dead\" and \"death\" but the concept of forever has no value. C. understands the universality and irreversibility of death. D. has an adult perception of death but is focused on the here and now. Answer: B. A 6-year-old is in early childhood and cannot grasp the concept of forever but does know words relating to death. As he matures, the more concrete the concept of death becomes. It isn't until adolescence that the child has an adult perception of death yet he remains focused on the present. Scoring If you answered all three items correctly, bravo!

During the first year of life, the infant progresses from a neonate, totally dependent on the world around him, to a baby who can interact with and process change within his surroundings. Tremendous physiologic, cognitive, and emotional development also occurs. System development From birth to age 1 year, remarkable changes occur in the infant's neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems. Neurologic system The central nervous system (CNS) is the fastest growing system during the infancy stage, as brain cells continue to de-velop in both size and number. The effects of a poor environment, including nutritional deprivation, can't be reversed when experi- enced during this early 61 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.62INFANCY I think my neurons are starting to myelinate. Today, I hold my head up. Tomorrow, the world! As soon as I get out of here, my heart and lungs will start to function just like my mom's!Hold your head up! Myelinization refers to the development of a myelin sheath around nerve fibers. Myelin enables quick, efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Myelinization of the neu- rons occurs in a cephalocaudal (head-to-toe) direction, although it takes up to 2 years for the entire process to be completed. An infant progresses from being unable to hold up his head to being able to hold himself in an upright position, sit, and keep his head erect. Extreme CNS makeover As myelinization reaches the extremities, the infant can put weight on his legs and use them to stand up. As the brain and CNS develop, more sophisticated cognitive and behavioral skills follow. Converge, stare, and search Vision development is also tremendous. At birth, the newborn prefers facial features, but by 8 weeks, the baby is alert to moving objects and is attracted to bright colors and lighted objects, such as toys with flashing lights and an otoscope light. Convergence and following with the eyes are jerky and inexact. By ages 4 to 6 months, the baby has bifocal vision and can stare and search. By age 1 year, distance vision and depth perception have markedly improved. Cardiovascular and respiratory systems The cardiovascular and respiratory systems undergo dramatic changes at birth. Because of placental oxygenation, the fetus shunts a majority of blood away from the lungs while in utero. Cardiopulmonary drama At birth, a cascade of physiologic changes occur, and deoxygenated blood begins to circulate to the lungs, where it receives oxygen and is then pumped out to the rest of the body through the left ventricle of the heart. Within moments, the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are functioning at essentially the same way as those of an adult. Immune system The immune system develops over the first year of life. The neonate depends on maternal antibodies received in utero or via breast milk for immunologic protection. By ages 6 to 8 weeks, an antigen-antibody response is maturing and can be triggered, for example, by immunizations, and by age 9 months, the infant is developing his own immunity.

Although patterns of growth and development will occur in a predictable order, it's important to remember that the rate at which they occur may vary among children of the same age. Also remember that the most reliable way to interpret growth measure-ments is to follow their trend over time using growth charts. Pedi-atric growth charts have been used in the United States since 1977. Growth charts consist of a series of percentile curves that depict the distribution of selected body measurements in infants and children. Many infants have their length, weight, and head circumferences measured and plotted on standardized growth charts. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that nurses and other pediatric health care providers use the World Health Orga-nization's (WHO) growth standards to monitor growth for infants and children ages 0 to 2 years in the United States and use the CDC growth charts for children age 2 years and older in the United States. Height, weight, and head circumference Intrauterine growth is assessed by measuring height, weight, and head circumference. These parameters are also the basis of growth evaluation for the rest of the infant and toddler period. Height Until the child is age 24 months, height, or length, is measured in the supine position, from the top of the head to the bottom of the heel. When measuring the infant, it's important to keep his body as straight as possible to achieve an accurate measurement. An infant's length is best measured using a stadiometer. Trunk first, legs to follow At the end of the first year, the infant's birth length has increased by 50%, with growth of approximately 1 /H11033 (2.5 cm) per month for the first 6 months, followed by about \u00bd /H11033 (1.3 cm) per month for the second 6 months. Most of this growth occurs in the trunk rather than in the legs. Weight Weight ideally is measured on an infant scale with a bucket-type area in which the infant can lie down or sit. Weight is the primary indicator of nutritional status; changes in weight can also be used to assess hydration status. The average infant will double his birth weight by age 5 months, and triple it by age 1 year. Head circumference Head circumference , or occipital frontal circumference, is mea- sured by placing a measuring tape around the largest diameter of Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 63 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 63 5/22/14 7:25 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.64INFANCY the head, from the frontal bone of the forehead to the occipital prominence at the back of the head. Don't get a big head A head circumference that's smaller, or lags behind the height and weight of an infant, may indicate inadequate brain growth. A head circumference that increases rapidly may indicate an increase in ventricular fluid and intracranial pressure (hydrocephalus). (See Measuring height and head circumference .)Advice from the experts Measuring height and head circumference These illustrations show the correct (supine) positioning for measuring length and the proper location for measuring head circumference. Measuring height Because of an infant's tendency to be flexed and curled up, these tips will help make assessing an infant's height (length) both easy and accurate:\u0081 Using one hand, hold the infant's head in the midline position.\u0081 Hold the knees together with your other hand and gently press them down toward the table until they're fully extended.\u0081 Using an infant stadiometer, measure the length from the top of the infant's head to his heels. Measuring head circumference To obtain an accurate head circumference measurement:\u0081 Use a paper measuring tape to avoid stretching (as can hap-pen with a cloth tape).\u0081 Use landmarks\u2014typically, place the tape just above the infant's eyebrows, and around the occipital prominence at the back of the head to measure the largest diameter of the head.\u0081 Take into consideration the shape of the infant's head and make adjustments as needed to measure the largest diameter.

The anterior fontanel is formed at the intersection of the sagittal, frontal, and coronal suture lines. The average size of the anterior fontanel is 2 cm by 2 cm at birth. It remains open for up to 18 months and gradually closes as the head grows. The posterior fontanel is formed at the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid suture lines. The average size of the pos-terior fontanel is 1 cm by 1 cm at birth. It's usually closed by age 2 months.Locating the fontanels The locations of the anterior and posterior fontanels are depicted in this illustration of the top of a neonatal skull. Frontal suture Reserved.66INFANCY P alpation and pulsation In infancy, the fontanels are assessed by palpation. The fontanel should feel soft and flat. You may be able to see pulsations at the anterior fontanel; this is a normal finding. A bulging or tense fon- tanel may indicate increased intracranial pressure. A sunken fontanel indicates dehydration. The nurse may auscultate the fontanel to assess for bruits. Teeth Most neonates don't have teeth. Occasionally, a \"natal tooth\" will be present at birth and should be evaluated by a pediatric dentist because they may become loose and pose a risk of aspiration. Neonatal teeth are teeth that erupt within the first 28 days of life. A little drool, a big eruption The average age at first tooth eruption is 8 months. Most infants start drooling and mouthing hard objects months beforehand. (See Sequence of tooth eruption .) Gross motor development Gross motor skills refer to the child's development of skills that require the use of large muscle groups. (See Developmental milestones .) They include: \u0081 posture \u0081 head controlGrowing pains Sequence of tooth eruption A child's primary teeth typically erupt in a predictable order, as described here: Age Tooth eruption 6 to 10 months Central lower incisors 8 to 10 months Central upper incisors9 to 13 months Lateral upper incisors10 to 16 months Lateral lower incisors Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 66 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

The infant will attain gross motor control in a cepha- locaudal manner, progressing from the head to the toes. He can lift the head, then sit, stand, and, eventually, walk. Fine motor development Fine motor skills refer to the infant's ability to use his hands and fingers to grasp an object. As the infant grows, he begins to refine his fine motor skills to grab small objects and feed himself. Normal infant reflexes Much of a neonate's behavior is controlled by reflexes. At ages 4 to 8 weeks old, many of these reflexes reach their peak\u2014especially the sucking reflex, which affords nutrition (and, therefore, survival) and psychological pleasure. At age 3 months, the most primitive reflexes begin to disappear, except for the protective and postural reflexes (blink, parachute, cough, swallow, and gag), which remain for life. (See Infant reflexes .) Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 68 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 68 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.69A CLOSER LOOK AT THE INFANT Infant reflexes This chart lists normal infant reflexes, how they're elicited, and the age at which they disappear. Reflex How to elicit Age at disappearance Trunk incurvature When a finger is run laterally down the neonate's spine, the trunk flexes and the pelvis swings toward the stimulated side.2 months Tonic neck ( fencing position)When the neonate's head is turned while he's lying supine, the extremities on the same side extend outward while those on the opposite side flex.2 to 3 months Grasping When a finger is placed in each of the neonate's hands, the neonate's fingers grasp tightly enough to be pulled to a sitting position.3 to 4 months Rooting When the cheek is stroked, the neonate turns his head in the direction of the stroke.3 to 4 months Moro ( startle reflex)When lifted above the crib and suddenly lowered (or in response to a loud noise), the arms and legs symmetrically extend and then abduct while the fingers spread to form a \"C.\"4 to 6 months Sucking Sucking motion begins when a nipple or gloved finger is placed in the neonate's mouth.6 months Babinski's When the sole on the side of the small toe is stroked, the neonate's toes fan upward.2 years Stepping When held upright with the feet touching a flat surface, the neonate exhibits dancing or stepping movements.Variable I cry, therefore I am . . . expressing my needs; trying to get attention; or feeling frustrated, afraid, or just plain cranky.Psychological development Psychological development involves language development and socialization as well as play and cognitive development. Language development and socialization Language development and socialization begin as soon as the neonate is born. Initially, the neonate communicates primarily through crying and socializes through some of the reflexive be- haviors such as the grasp reflex. However, he'll make tremen- dous strides in these areas during his first year of life. Cry me a river The infant cries to express needs. During the first 3 months, crying usually signals a physiologic need such as hunger. As the Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 69 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 69 5/22/14 7:25 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.70INFANCY infant grows, he may cry for attention, from fear, or from frus- tration during the trials of mastering new skills. Parents usually become adept at translating their child's cry. Infants who cry frequently and are difficult to console may be at increased risk for abuse. To help parents prepare for and effec- tively deal with crying infants, the pediatric nurse should:\u0081 reinforce that there are times when infants cry for no reason at all \u0081 assess how parents cope with fussy periods and offer support as needed\u0081 teach parents comforting techniques, such as holding, swad-dling, and massaging. Smile and say \"eh\" An infant's vocalization develops from cries. By age 2 months, the infant can produce single-vowel sounds, such as \"ah\" and \"eh,\" and he begins to develop a social smile. The social smile is the infant's first social response; it initiates social relation- ships, signals the beginning of thought processes, and further strengthens the bond between parent and child. By ages 3 to 4 months, the infant can coo and gurgle and laugh in response to his environment. Stranger danger By age 6 months, the infant begins to experiment with sounds and attempts to imitate others. He can discern one face from another and exhibits stranger anxiety\u2014he's wary of strangers and clings to or clutches his parents. Separation anxiety may also develop at this period and peaks around 9 months. I'd like to buy a vowel By ages 7 to 9 months, the infant can verbalize all vowels and most consonants but speaks no intelligible words. He'll focus intently on the mouth of someone speaking to him. He can also understand simple commands such as the word \"no.\" He may imitate the expressions of others and may be able to play pat-a-cake. He can recognize and respond to his own name. Infant of few words By ages 10 to 12 months, the infant can say about 5 words but can understand up to 100 words. He can wave good-bye and enjoys rhythm games. If the child experiences delays in vocalization, he should be evaluated for hearing loss. (See Language and social development .)

From birth to age 3 months, infants enjoy having their body parts touched and moved and looking at objects with contrasting colors. They develop the ability to grasp objects and move them, so rattles are great toys at this time.Growing pains Language and social development This chart highlights the language and social development of an infant from birth to age 1 year.

It includes play, an integr al part of infant development. Age Object permanence Causality Play 0 to 4 months \u0081 Objects out of sight are out of mind\u0081 Continues to look at hand after object is dropped out of it\u0081 Creates bodily sensations by actions (for example, thumbsucking)\u0081 Grasps and moves objects such as a rattle\u0081 Looks at contrasting colors 4 to 8 months \u0081 Can locate a partially hidden object\u0081 Visually tracks objects when dropped\u0081 Uses causal behaviors to recreate accidentally discovered interesting effects (for example, kicking the bed after the chance discovery that this will set in motion a mobile above the bed)\u0081 Reaches and grasps an object and then will mouth, shake, bang, and drop the object ( usually in this order) 9 to 12 months \u0081 Object permanence develops\u0081 Can find an object when hid-den but can't retrieve an object that's moved in plain view from one hiding place to another\u0081 Knows parent still exists when out of view but can't imagine where they might be (separation anxiety may arise)\u0081 Understanding of cause and effect leads to intentional behavior aimed at getting spe-cific results\u0081 Manipulates objects to inspect with eyes and hands\u0081 Has ability to process informa-tion simultaneously instead of sequentially \u0081 Ability to play peek-a-boo dem-onstrates object permanence This isn't bad. Maybe a little salt will help when I'm older. Mimicking Mommy From ages 4 to 9 months, infants explore the world by using their senses: looking and touching. They tend to put everything within reach in their mouths. They enjoy being read to and will display more reciprocal play, such as talking back to and mimick- ing adult vocalizations. Social butterfly By ages 9 to 12 months, increased mobility allows infants to seek out new stimuli, including people, for interaction. They enjoy social games, such as peek-a-boo, tickling, and swinging. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 72 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd Kluwer.

Hey, I'm only 9 months old\u2014that stuff comes later.Cognitive development Cognitive development refers to the intellectual abilities of a child\u2014his thinking, reasoning, and ability to problem-solve and understand. Cognitively, the infant develops the ability to perform very sophisticated mental operations. Even the neonate can pro- cess and react to stimuli in the environment around him. Over time, he develops social skills and a sense of object permanence (the realization that objects continue to exist even when they can't be seen) and causality (un- derstanding that a particular action, or cause, leads to an effect). (See Cognitive development and play .) Trust begins to develop during this stage. Tempera- ment emerges as the infant displays the inborn character-istics that influence activity level, response to new people and situations, and adaptability to change. On stage with Piaget According to Jean Piaget's stages of early cognitive development, infants are in the sensorimotor stage, which lasts from birth to age 2 years. In this stage, infants are discovering relationships between their bodies and the environment. They rely on their senses to learn about the world around them, and they learn that the external world isn't an extension of themselves. Maintaining health Keeping an infant healthy involves: \u0081 providing proper nutrition\u0081 ensuring adequate sleep and rest \u0081 providing a safe environment. Nutrition guidelines Breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula is recommended for the first 12 months of life. Human milk consumed through breast-feeding is considered optimal for neonates. Even so, not all mothers can or choose to breast-feed. Medical conditions, cul- tural background, anxiety, use of certain medications, drug abuse, and other factors can prevent a woman from breast-feeding. In these cases, bottle-feeding with iron-fortified infant formula is an acceptable alternative. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 73 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 73 5/22/14 7:25 PM Rights Reserved.74INFANCY Breast-feeding Breast-feeding is widely supported in the medical community. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Dietetic Association recommend breast-feeding exclusively for the first 6 months and then in combination with infant foods until at least age 1 year. (See Advantages of breast-feeding .) I demand my 10 to 15! How long a breast-fed infant nurses at each feeding is very individ- ual. In general, a neonate should nurse on demand, approximately 8 to 10 times per day for at least 10 to 15 minutes at each breast. The duration of feeding may increase and the frequency may de- crease as the infant gets older and after solid foods are introduced. Parents should be assured that they can feel confident their infant is receiving enough breast milk if he's growing appropri- ately. Keep in mind that intake is adequate if: \u0081 weight loss after birth is normal (less than 10% of birth weight)\u0081 the infant regains the weight lost after birth by age 2 weeks\u0081 the infant has six to eight wet diapers or more per day\u0081 there's a minimum weight gain of 15 g (0.5 oz) per day in the first 2 months of life. Advantages of breast-feeding It's a well-known fact that breast-feeding is best for an infant. Here are some of the reasons. Passive immunity Human milk provides passive immunity from mother to infant. Colostrum is the first fluid secreted from the breast (within the first few days after delivery) and provides immune factor and protein to the neonate. Many components of breast milk protect against infection\u2014it contains antibodies (especially immunoglobulin A) and white blood cells that protect the infant from some forms of infection. Breast-fed babies also experience fewer aller-gies and food intolerances as well as a lower risk for obesity in childhood. Digestibility Breast milk provides essential nutrients in an easily digestible form. It contains lipase , which breaks down dietary fat, making it easily avail-able to the infant's system.Brain development The lipids in breast milk are high in linoleic acid and cholesterol, which are needed for brain development. Low protein content Cow's milk contains proportionally higher concentrations of electrolytes and protein than are needed by human infants. It must be cleared by the immature kidneys and thus isn't recommended until a baby is at least 12 months old. Convenient and cost-free The woman who breast-feeds saves the money and time that would be needed to buy and prepare formula.

All Rights Reserved.75MAINTAINING HEALTH Recommended vitamin supplements Breast-fed infants should receive oral supplementation of vita- min D, 400 units per day. At 4 months of age, exclusively breast-fed infants should also be supplemented with 1 mg/kg per day of oral iron until iron-containing complementary foods are introduced. Formula feeding Formula feedings can provide adequate nutrition when the mother shouldn't or can't breast-feed her infant. Some mothers may feel guilty about being unable to breast-feed or about mak- ing the decision not to breast-feed. The pediatric nurse should support, and never judge, the mother who can't or who chooses not to breast-feed and should reassure her about the nutritional value of infant formulas. Infant formulas are constituted to provide the proper variety and amount of carbohydrates, protein, fats, and micronutrients needed for healthy growth and development. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the composition, labeling, and inspection of infant formula to ensure infant safety. (See Tips for preparing formula .) No moo cows, please Women are strongly urged to use commercially prepared formulas rather than regular cow's milk because cow's milk:\u0081 doesn't meet all of an infant's nutritional needs \u0081 can be difficult to digest \u0081 can strain the infant's renal system.It's all relative Tips for preparing formula Provide parents with these tips for properly preparing infant formula: \u0081 Wash your hands before preparing formula.\u0081 If your water source is safe, mix formula with room temperature tap water. If your water source is not safe or you are unsure, use fluoridated bottled water or boil water for no longer than 1 minute then let it cool for 30 minutes to room temperature. \u0081 Wash utensils in warm, soapy water and rinse them well to ensure they're safe to use.\u0081 Avoid using microwave ovens to warm formula; they fail to sanitize utensils and cause uneven heating, which increases the risk of burns.\u0081 Discard a prepared bottle of formula after it's been offered to the infant or has sat at room tem-perature for longer than 1 hour.\u0081 Cover and store opened cans of liquid formula in the refrigerator; discard after 48 hours. Oops! I think that was diaper number seven. I'm definitely getting enough breast milk. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 75 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 75 5/22/14 7:25 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.76INFANCY When an infant reaches 4 to 6 months of age, you can start feeding him solid foods. The trick is getting it in his mouth!Unlocking the secret formula Most formulas are based on cow's milk proteins, although prepa- rations based on soy proteins and casein hydroxylate are avail-able for infants who can't tolerate cow's milk-based preparations. There are also special formulas for infants with such diseases as phenylketonuria and other metabolic disorders. Formula comes in powder form, concentrated liquid, and ready-to-feed forms. Ready-to-feed formulas are convenient and prevent problems based on incorrect dilution and preparation but are more expensive. Special care should be used so that formula isn't improperly mixed or stored, which can be hazardous to the infant. Weaning The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dental Association recommend that infants be weaned from the bottle to the cup by age 1 year. In preparation for weaning, and to promote the developmental step toward independent feeding, the cup should be introduced by age 9 months in all infants. This is usually done gradually, by omitting one bottle at a time and replacing it with a cup over a period of several days to weeks. Slow and steady to bottle-ready How long a mother continues to breast-feed is an individual choice; if a mother chooses or needs to switch from breast to bottle, it is accomplished similarly to the weaning from bottle to cup. One breast-feeding session per day is replaced with a bottle-feeding until, over a period of days to weeks, the transition occurs. This gradual weaning approach helps prevent en- gorgement in the mother and decreases her risk of masti-tis. An infant can also be weaned from breast-feeding to a cup, eliminating the need for bottles. Introducing solid foods The age at which solid foods are introduced into an infant's diet depends on such factors as the nutritional need for iron, the infant's physiologic capability to digest starch, and his physical ability to chew and swallow. Rice is nice By age 4 to 6 months, an infant should be mature enough to begin eating iron-fortified cereal mixed with formula or breast milk. Rice cereal is the best to begin with be- cause it's least likely to cause allergies. (See Solid foods and infant age .) Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 76 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 76 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.77MAINTAINING HEALTH Fingers before forks By about age 8 or 9 months, the infant should be able to sit up and grasp objects, so introducing finger foods at this time can help promote self-feeding. (See Teaching points for feeding and nutrition .) Sleep and rest guidelines The AAP recommends that all infants be positioned on their backs for every sleep (including naps) until they can roll over and determine their own sleeping position. Since its inception, this simple maneuver has significantly decreased the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In addition to providing safe sleep guidelines for the prevention of SIDS, the AAP recommendations focus on safe sleeping environments to prevent sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs) Solid foods and infant age This table gives an overview of solid foods that are appropriate for the developing infant. Age Type of food Rationale 4 to 6 months Rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula is a traditional choice; however, strained vegeta-bles (offered first) and fruits are just as good.Rice cereal is easy to digest and less likely than wheat to cause an allergic reaction.Vegetables are offered first be-cause they may be more readily accepted than if introduced after sweet fruits. 7 to 8 months Strained meats, cheese, yogurt, rice, noodles, puddingProvide an important source of iron and add variety to the diet 8 to 9 months Finger foods (bananas, soft crackers)Promote self-feeding 10 months Mashed egg yolk (no whites until age 1); bite-size cooked food (no foods that may cause choking)Use of bite-size pieces to de-crease risk of choking (Avoiding foods that may cause choking is the safest option, even though the infant chews well.) 12 months Foods from the adult table (chopped or mashed according to the infant's ability to chew foods)Provide a nutritious and varied diet that should meet the infant's nutritional needsIt's all relative Teaching points for feeding and nutrition Stress these feeding and nutrition points to the parents of an infant:\u0081 Watch for behaviors that indicate feeding preferences. If the infant rejects a food initially, offer it again later and many more times as tastes change!\u0081 Keep the infant in an upright feeding position.\u0081 Don't try to make the infant eat more to finish the serving or portion. \u0081 Initially, offer iron-fortified rice cereal.\u0081 Introduce new foods one at a time, waiting 5 to 7 days between them so that if a food allergy develops, it will be ap-parent which food triggered the allergic reaction.\u0081 Avoid grapes and grape halves and cut up hot dogs until the infant has adequate chewing and swallowing skills.\u0081 Limit 100% pure fruit juice to no more than 4 oz per day.\u0081 Avoid other sweetened beverages.\u0081 If the infant has a history of food allergies, delay offering eggs, wheat-based products, peanut and tree nuts-based products, and citrus fruits.\u0081 Avoid honey and other unpasteurized products because they may put infants at risk for infantile botulism. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 77 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 77 entrapment, suffocation, and asphyxiation. Soft mate- rials, even if covered by a sheet, should not be placed in the crib under a sleeping infant. Objects such as quilts, bumper pads, comforters, and blankets should be kept out of infant's sleeping environment. Clothing designed to keep infant warm without covering the head (such as a sleep sac) can be used. There is no evidence that wedges, positioners, special mattresses, and spe- cial sleep surfaces reduce the risk of SIDS or that they are safe. Because of an increased risk of entrapment or suffocation, infants should not be placed to sleep on beds. Room sharing without bed sharing is recommended to decrease the risk of SIDS. Bed rails should not be used due to a risk of strangula-tion. The sleep area should be kept free from dangling cords, window- covering cords, or electrical wires. Sitting devices such as car seats, strollers, and swings are not recommended for routine sleep. If a baby is being carried in a sling, it is es-sential that the head and face be visible and that the infant's nose and mouth are clear of obstructions. To sleep, per chance to . . . wake up and eat! Certain expectations for sleeping through the night can be made for each age-group in infancy:\u0081 From birth to age 4 months, an infant will wake to feed at night from 0 to 3 times. Because breast milk is digested faster than formula, breast-fed infants commonly will wake up to feed more frequently than bottle-fed infants.\u0081 At ages 4 to 6 months, infants are beginning to be physiologi- cally capable of sleeping (without feeding) for 6 to 8 hours at night. Infants may awaken during this sleep period but should be able to calm themselves and return to sleep. (See Sleep requirements in infancy .) Napping From birth to age 3 months, infants may take many naps per day. However, an infant shouldn't be allowed to sleep longer than 4 hours at a time during the day because this will lead to more nighttime awakenings to feed. From ages 4 to 9 months, the infant will have transitioned to two naps per day (one in the morning and one in the after- noon). Total naptime should add up to about 2 to 3 hours. By ages 9 to 12 months, most infants will have transitioned to only one nap, for a total of 1 to 2 hours of napping time. Dental hygiene Gentle care can be given to the infant's gums and new teeth. Wiping the teeth and gums with a soft washcloth and water alone provides adequate cleaning when the infant has only a few teeth.Growing pains Sleep requirements in infancy This chart shows the amount of sleep per 24 hours (including nighttime and naps) needed by infants from ages 1 week to 12 months.

All Rights Reserved.79INJURY PREVENTION While pooling in here is fun, pooling around the teeth is no laughing matter.Hold the paste Once teeth have erupted, they can be cleaned with a small, soft- bristled toothbrush and water. Toothpaste shouldn't be used because the infant would swallow it. Ingesting fluoridated toothpaste can cause nausea and fluorosis, a gray discoloration of the permanent teeth. A dental home should be established by 12 months of age, but dental care begins with the first tooth eruption. Fluoride supple- ments may be needed in areas where the water supply contains inadequate fluoride (less than 0.3 ppm) or none at all. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that fluo-ride supplements be given to infants who need them beginning at age 6 months. Preventing dental caries during infancy In addition to being a condition associated with dietary fac- tors, early childhood caries can be transmitted from mother to baby by the bacteria Streptococcus mutans . To keep an infant's smile healthy, teach the parents how to avoid dental caries with these tips:\u0081 Don't put an infant to bed with a bottle at night or at nap-time because pooling of carbohydrate-rich fluids (including breast milk and formula) or other sweetened liquid around the infant's teeth can cause decay. If an infant must be put to bed with a bottle, fill the bottle with water only.\u0081 Don't allow the infant to carry a bottle filled with milk, formula, juice, or other sweetened liquid to use as a pacifier throughout the day. Again, frequent exposure to carbohydrate-rich liquids to the teeth can occur, leading to decay. Bottles that contain liquids other than water should be offered only at mealtimes.\u0081 Transition the infant to a cup beginning around 9 months and completed by the time of his first birthday. Cup-drinking doesn't permit pooling of liquids around the teeth.\u0081 Don't offer the infant a pacifier dipped in sugar or honey.\u0081 Provide regular care of the infant's teeth and gums.\u0081 Encourage mothers to chew gum or mints with xylitol listed as the first ingredient (3 to 5 times daily) because xylitol has been shown to inhibit the growth of S. mutans . Injury prevention Injury prevention during infancy centers around automobile safety, preventing aspiration and falls, and childproofing the infant's environment. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 79 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd Rights Reserved.80INFANCY Here's a great strategy for childproofing. Get down on your hands and knees, crawl around a bit, and see how much trouble you could get into!Child passenger safety The use of child restraints in automobiles has reduced the risk of injury by 71% to 82% compared to just using a seat belt for the same-age child. Infants and toddlers should always ride in a rear- facing car safety seat until age 2 years or until the child achieves the highest weight or height allowed by the manufacturer of the car seat. Aspiration Because infants become adept at placing objects in their mouths for exploration, they're at risk for aspiration. To prevent aspiration: \u0081 Feed infants in a slightly upright position.\u0081 Burp infants in an upright or prone position. \u0081 Cut solid foods into very small pieces when the infant starts eating solids.\u0081 Avoid foods and other things that can be choking hazards. (See Choking hazards .) Falls Even a neonate is at risk for falling. As the child becomes mobile, the risk of falls increases. To prevent falls, encourage parents to:\u0081 never leave an infant unattended, especially on a changing table, bed, sofa, or counter \u0081 place gates at the top and bottom of staircases\u0081 put up window guards or other window safety devices on windows above the first floor level \u0081 avoid placing infants in walkers because they can tumble over an uneven surface or the leg of a chair or table or fall down stairs. Childproofing After an infant is mobile, it's too late to childproof. Here are some tips for childproofing, based on the infant's age. At birth: \u0081 Turn down the thermostat on the water heater to 120\u00b0 F (48.9\u00b0 C) or lower. (See Dangers of high temperature water .) Choking hazards These foods can easily cause choking and should be avoided during infancy:\u0081 hot dogs\u0081 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.81HEALTH PROBLEMS \u0081 To prevent an accidental scalding burn, never drink hot liquids while holding the infant.\u0081 To prevent drowning, never leave the infant alone in the bath. \u0081 Install smoke detectors. \u0081 Install a carbon monoxide monitor outside the infant's room.\u0081 Use flame-retardant pajamas.\u0081 Remove firearms from the home. (If this isn't an option, use trig- ger locks or lock the firearm and ammunition in separate areas.) By age 4 months: \u0081 Cover all electrical outlets. \u0081 Tape down all electrical cords (or place them behind furniture).\u0081 Install childproof locks on all cabinets.\u0081 Place all medicines and cleaning agents in high cabinets with locks to prevent accidental ingestions. \u0081 Remove all breakable items from tabletops and shelves within the infant's reach.\u0081 Keep small toys and other small items off the floor. Accidental ingestions Although not a common cause of death in infancy (16 deaths in 2011), accidental ingestions are easily preventable by placing all toxic substances such as cleaning supplies and medications in upper or locked cabinets. In addition, the American Association of Poison Control Centers has a national poison emergency hotline that can be called toll-free 24 hours a day: 1-800-222-1222. Every household should have this number in an easy to find location or already entered into the phone so that it can be accessed quickly. Health problems Health concerns during infancy include: \u0081 colic\u0081 failure to thrive \u0081 regurgitation \u0081 SIDS.Dangers of high temperature water Teach your patients' parents to cool it\u2014the water heater thermostat, that is! When the hot water temperature is set at 150\u00b0 F (65.6\u00b0 C), it takes only 2 seconds of exposure for an adult to suffer a full-thickness burn. Because infants have thin skin, it takes even less time for them to suffer a full-thickness burn. By turning the water temperature down to a maximum of 120\u00b0 F (48.9\u00b0 C), parents can drastically reduce the risk of injury; at 120\u00b0 F, it takes 10 minutes for a burn to occur.

It works for an infant with colic, too!Colic Time spent crying per day increased from birth and peaks for all infant around 6 weeks of age and then starts to decline. Some infants cry more than others. Colic is defined as a daily period of crying for 3 hours or longer, during which the infant is virtually inconsolable. These episodes usually occur in the late afternoon or evening. About 10% to 20% of infants suffer from colic. What causes it No one knows for sure what causes this behavior. How it happens Although long thought to be related to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, current theories about the origins of colic lean toward CNS maturation. The process of CNS maturation can cause difficulties with the infant's ability to self-regulate (especially relating to overstimulation and an inability to self-calm). What to look for In an otherwise healthy infant, he may have colic if he: \u0081 cries and is inconsolable\u0081 fails to calm in response to normally calming maneuvers ( holding, rocking) \u0081 isn't hungry (refuses the breast or bottle)\u0081 doesn't need changing (has a dry diaper) \u0081 has no fever or other medical rea-son for crying. Complications Colic produces no complications unless a caregiver gets so frus- trated that she harms the infant. Fussy infants who are difficult to care for are at increased risk for abuse. How it's treated Colic is a clinical diagnosis, meaning no tests exist to help diagnose colic. There's no medical cure for colic, except time. Most infants \"outgrow\" it or sufficiently mature so that symptoms disappear or markedly improve by age 3 months. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 82 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 82 5/22/14 7:25 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.83HEALTH PROBLEMS What to do Because of the potential for abuse when caregivers become frustrated with an inconsolable infant, the pediatric nurse should make every effort to help parents deal effectively with an infant with colic. Decreasing rapidly changing stimulation seems to be the most effective intervention for an infant with colic. Any strat- egy might work, but the key is to keep the stimulation consis- tent for at least 5 minutes so the infant can adjust to it. Rapidly trying different \"fixes\" only increases stimulation and makes matters worse. (See Tips for reducing colic .) When all else fails and parents are at their wits' end, suggest that they place the infant on his back in the bassinet or crib, shut the door, leave the room, and do something to calm down (for example, meditation, listening to music). The parents should be encouraged to call a family member, friend, or the infant's health care provider if help is needed to cope with the crying. The parent should not return to the infant's room until he or she is calm enough to care for the infant. Failure to thrive Failure to thrive (FTT) is a state of undernutrition diagnosed when an infant isn't growing at the expected rate. FTT is char- acterized by failure to maintain weight for length above the 5th percentile on age-appropriate growth charts. It can also be de- tected from a deviation in an already established growth curve. What causes it The cause of FTT is often multifactorial including medical, psychosocial, and environmental factors. How it happens If caloric intake is less than that required for nutritional needs, growth and development suffer. Inadequate calorie intake is often caused by problems with feeding. Family issues such as a parent with mental health problems, lack of knowledge or poverty, as well as neglect or abuse can also be associated with FTT. FTT caused by inadequate calorie absorption may be due to malabsorptive pathology or metabolic disorders. Excessive use of calories can occur with chronic illness such as congenital heart disease or chronic pulmonary disease of prematurity.It's all relative Tips for reducing colic Providing parents with these tips may help them relieve their infant's colic behavior.

All Rights Reserved.84INFANCY You're a little too little, little one.What to look for An absence of weight gain or a loss of weight is the first growth parameter to be affected; a drop in height percentile is the next sign, followed by a drop in head circumference. A drop in per- centile over time or between visits warrants further investigation. What tests tell you No definitive tests for FTT exist. However, after taking a history and performing a comprehensive exam, you should be able to determine whether medical causes are a possibility. All possible medical or pathologic causes should be ruled out. Complications Complications of FTT can include developmental delay, growth retardation, impaired bonding, and altered family relationships. How it's treated All factors impacting the infant's nutrition should be addressed. If a pathologic cause is determined, treatment focuses on the underlying disease process. If indicated, treatment is also di- rected toward changing the surroundings. A change in the infant's environment might be as drastic as removing him from the home or as simple as educating a caregiver on breast-feeding or proper mixing of formula or reading the infant's cues more accurately. What to do When providing care to an infant hospitalized with FTT, the nurse should:\u0081 weigh the child on admission to determine baseline weight and continue to weigh daily during treatment \u0081 properly feed and interact with the child to promote nutrition and growth and development\u0081 provide the infant with visual and auditory stimulation to pro- mote normal sensory development \u0081 teach the parents effective parenting skills to increase their knowledge of routine child care practices, such as comfort mea-sures, age-appropriate developmental tasks, and play activities\u0081 praise the parents for positive interactions with the infant and avoid judgmental statements and actions. Regurgitation Regurgitation , also referred to as spitting up or a wet burp , is considered normal infant behavior. Most infants will spit up at least occasionally. Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 84 Meadows-Oliver_Ch03.indd 84 5/22/14 7:25 PM 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.85HEALTH PROBLEMS What causes it Regurgitation in infants is most commonly caused by swallowing air or by overfeeding. However, it can also be caused by gastro-esophageal reflux disease or pyloric stenosis. How it happens A wet burp involves either dribbling of undigested liquids from the mouth and esophagus, or the expulsion of those liquids with the force of a burp. What to look for Spitting up in infancy may be characterized by:\u0081 white, curdled liquid plopping or running out of the corners of the mouth or, occasionally, coming from the nose \u0081 a \"burp\" of air that sometimes precedes the regurgitation. The infant with regurgitation may: \u0081 be fussy during feedings \u0081 grimace, cry, and pull away from the bottle or breast \u0081 occasionally refuse to eat. What tests tell you Testing can rule out gastroesophageal reflux disease and pyloric stenosis, two common causes of regurgitation in infants. Probing the problem The definitive test for gastroesophageal reflux is called a pH probe . Because the pH of the stomach is so acidic (pH of 1 to 3), a probe placed in the esophagus will demonstrate the presence of stomach acid if reflux if present. Slow stomach If projectile vomiting is reported, pyloric stenosis may be sus- pected. An ultrasound of the area may demonstrate delayed or slowed stomach emptying, a thickened sphincter, or complete closure of the sphincter. Surgical treatment is necessary. Complications Complications of regurgitation are rare but it may include aspira- tion pneumonia and failure to gain weight. How it's treated If an infant is growing well, is generally happy, and isn't bothered by spitting up, regurgitation can be left to improve with time.Memory jogger When caring for an infant with re-gurgitation, remember to BERP him: B\u2014Burp the infant frequently.

What to do When providing care to an infant with regurgitation:\u0081 Evaluate feeding methods (amount of burping, air in nipple with formula feeding). \u0081 Burp the infant frequently; feed smaller amounts more fre- quently and don't overfeed.\u0081 Place or hold infant in an upright position after feeding to help food stay down. \u0081 Reassure caregivers that spitting up may improve with time. Sudden infant death syndrome and sleep-related infant deaths SIDS is the sudden death of a previously healthy infant when the cause of death isn't confirmed by a postmortem examination. It's the most common cause of death between ages 1 month and 1 year. However, the incidence of SIDS has declined dramati- cally by more than 50% since 1990, which is mostly attributed to the 1992 initiative to put babies on their backs, called the \"Back to Sleep Campaign\" now relabeled the \"Safe Sleep Campaign.\" The safe sleep campaign focuses on a safe sleeping environment that reduces the risk of all sleep-related deaths including SIDS. What causes it Although the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, currently a triple- risk model includes development, vulnerabilities, and environ-mental stressors. Several factors, including exposure to tobacco smoke and long QT syndrome, have been shown to be associ- ated with an increased risk of SIDS. (See Risk factors for SIDS .) How it happens Current theories focus on neurologic immaturity related to the infant's inability to sense and regulate oxygenation status, ultimately leading to respiratory arrest. The syndrome can't be prevented or explained; the infant usually dies during sleep without noise or struggle.

A thorough postmortem investigation must rule out all other causes of death. Complications Sudden death is the sole medical complication of SIDS. However, SIDS affects the family members of the infant who dies of SIDS. Parents may need counseling or some other form of help to cope with their loss. How it's treated There is, of course, no way to treat a condition that, by its definition, is sudden death without warning. There are, however, measures that can be taken to decrease the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths including: \u0081 putting the infant on his back to sleep for every sleep; side sleeping is not advised\u0081 using a firm sleep surface \u0081 room sharing without bed sharing \u0081 removing pillows, quilts, stuffed toys, or any other soft surfaces from the infant's crib or sleeping environment\u0081 keeping the infant warm while sleeping, but not overheated\u0081 not smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs\u0081 breast-feeding\u0081 considering offering a pacifier at nap and bedtime \u0081 immunizing per recommendations. What to do When dealing with a family whose infant has just died of suspected SIDS in the emergency room:\u0081 Be aware that assessment, planning, and implementation related to the parents' needs should begin as soon as they arrive in the emergency department.\u0081 Provide the family with a room (for privacy) and a staff member who can stay with them and provide support. \u0081 Stay calm and let the parents express their feelings. (In their need to blame someone or something for the tragedy, they may express anger at emergency department personnel, each other, or anyone involved with the infant's care.)\u0081 Prepare the family for how the infant will look and feel.\u0081 Let the parents touch, hold, and rock the infant, if de-sired. Allow them to say good-bye. \u0081 Contact spiritual advisors, significant others, or other sup- port systems\u0081 Provide literature on sudden unexplained infant death and support groups.

Toddlerhood Toddlerhood, from ages 1 to 3 years, is the stage in which children start displaying independence and pride in their accomplishments. They intensely explore their environ- ment, trying to figure out how things work. It's also the time when they begin to display negativism and have temper tantrums. Physical development During the toddler stage, physical growth is character- ized by:\u0081 growth rate that slows during the second year of life \u0081 possible limited food intake, which may concern parents, so they need to be reassured this is normal\u0081 steady growth on a growth curve that's more steplike than linear, demonstrating growth \"spurts.\" Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 89 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

A few more growth spurts ought to do it!Height, weight, and head circumference From ages 1 to 2: \u0081 Toddlers grow approximately 3\u00bd /H11033 to 5 /H11033 (9 to 12.5 cm) per year (with growth mostly in the legs, rather than in the trunk, like infants). \u0081 Toddlers gain about 8 oz (227 g) per month.\u0081 Head circumference increases about 1 /H11033 (2.5 cm) per year. \u0081 Anterior fontanel usually closes (between 12 and 18 months). Two's take off By age 2: \u0081 Birth weight has usually quadrupled; average weight is 27 lb (12.3 kg). \u0081 Head circumference is usually equal to chest circumference.\u0081 The child is about half of adult height, with an average height of 34 /H11033 (86.4 cm). Three's relax From ages 2 to 3, toddlers: \u0081 grow 2 /H11033 to 2\u00bd /H11033 (5 to 6.5 cm) \u0081 gain about 3 to 5 lb (1.5 to 2.5 kg) \u0081 show slowed increases in head circumference (less than \u00bd /H11033 [1.3 cm] per year). Teeth By approximately 33 months, all deciduous teeth have erupted and the child has about 20 teeth. The child should already be brushing with a small, soft-bristled toothbrush (with parental supervision) and may use a scant amount of fluoride toothpaste or, if needed, fluoride supplements. Gross motor development Gross motor activity develops rapidly in toddlers. One-year-olds can:\u0081 walk alone using a wide stance \u0081 begin to run but fall easily. By age 2, the toddler can: \u0081 run without falling most of the time \u0081 throw a ball overhand without losing his balance \u0081 jump with both feet \u0081 walk up and down stairs\u0081 use push and pull toys.

I guess 2-year-olds are too smart to wear jeans that are two sizes too small. Foo, da-da, po-po, moop. Hey, I'm only 1. If you got 25% of that, I'm right on target.Fine motor development Fine motor development begins slowly; however, by age 2, the toddler has generally mastered some fairly complex fine motor skills. A 1-year-old can: \u0081 grasp a very small object. A 2-year-old can: \u0081 build a tower of four blocks \u0081 scribble on paper \u0081 drop a small pellet into a small, narrow container\u0081 use a spoon well and drink well from a covered cup\u0081 undress himself. Psychological development A child develops a more elaborate vocabulary, a sense of autonomy, and socially acceptable play skills during the toddler stage. Language development and socialization As the toddler learns to understand and, ultimately, commu-nicate with the spoken word, he develops the social skills that will allow him to interact more effectively with others. Language During toddlerhood, the ability to understand speech is much more developed than the ability to speak. Now we're talking By age 1:\u0081 The child uses one-word sentences or holophrases (real words that are meant to represent entire phrases or ideas). \u0081 The toddler has learned about four words. \u0081 Twenty-five percent of the 1-year-old's vocalization is understandable. Talk about progress! By age 2: \u0081 The number of words learned has increased from about four (at age 1) to approximately 300. \u0081 The child uses multiword (two- to three-word) sentences. \u0081 Sixty-five percent of speech is understandable.\u0081 Frequent, repetitive naming of objects helps toddlers to learn appropriate words for objects.

How am I doing?)Socialization During toddlerhood, children develop social skills that deter- mine the way they interact with others. As the toddler develops psychologically, he can: \u0081 differentiate himself from others \u0081 tolerate being separated from a parent\u0081 withstand delayed gratification\u0081 control his bodily functions \u0081 acquire socially acceptable behaviors \u0081 communicate verbally\u0081 become less egocentric. Erikson's developmental theory As discussed in chapter 2, Erikson believed that each develop- mental stage is characterized by a particular psychosocial crisis (positive versus negative) that must be resolved before the child can master the task at hand. Putting the \"no\" in autonomous According to Erikson's developmental theory, autonomy versus doubt and shame is the developmental task of toddler- hood. In this context, Erickson maintains that:\u0081 Toddlers are in the final stages of developing a sense of trust (the task from infancy) and are ready to start asserting some control, independence, and autonomy.\u0081 Negativism is displayed in the toddler's quest for autonomy. \u0081 Ritualism , a need to maintain sameness and reliability, gives the toddler a sense of comfort. \u0081 The child's significant other is the \"paternal\" person in his (or her) life.\u0081 Development of the ego creates a conflict for the child, specifically, how to deal with the impulses of the id (which requires immediate gratification), while learning socially acceptable ways to interact with the environment. \u0081 Development of the superego , or conscience, begins with the incorporation of the morals of society. (See Toddler development .) Play Play is the work of children. It's through play that the child learns about his own capabilities and develops the skills needed to interact with others and his environment.Growing pains Toddler development At the toddler stage, children begin to master:\u0081 individuation (dif-ferentiation of self from others)\u0081 separation from parents\u0081 control of body functions\u0081 communication with words\u0081 acquisition of socially acceptable behaviors\u0081 lesser egocen-tricity when inter-acting 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.93TODDLERHOOD New rules, new game During the toddler stage: \u0081 Play changes considerably as the toddler's motor skills develop; he uses his physical skills to push and pull objects; to climb up, down, in, and out; and to run or ride on toys. \u0081 A short attention span requires frequent changes in toys and play media.\u0081 Toddlers increase their cognitive abilities by manipulat- ing objects and learning about their qualities, which makes tactile play (with water, sand, finger paints, clay) important. (See Toddler toys .) \u0081 Many play activities involve imitating behaviors the child sees at home, which helps them learn new actions and skills.\u0081 Play becomes more social but not necessarily interactive. Parallel play During the toddler stage, children commonly play with others without actually interacting. In this type of parallel play , children play side by side, commonly with similar objects. Interaction is limited to the occasional comment or trading of toys. This form of play helps the toddler develop the social skills needed to move into more interactive play. Cognitive development According to Piaget's developmental theory, a child moves from the sensorimotor stage of infancy and early toddler-hood (birth to age 2) to the longer, preoperational stage (ages 2 to 7). Piaget made several observations about this transitional time in the young child's life.\u0081 Tertiary circular reactions refers to the 13- to 18-month- old child's use of active experimentation (trial and error); he uses newly acquired skills and knowledge to reach previously unattainable goals and discover new objects and areas. Familiar at home, foreign at the store \u0081 The toddler may be aware of the relationship between two events (cause and effect) but may not be able to transfer that knowledge to a new situation. (For example, a toddler might need to reinvestigate the function of a familiar object or the identity of a familiar person over and over again when he encounters that object or person in a new, out-of-context setting.) That's using my head \u0081 From about ages 18 to 24 months, the toddler will look for new ways to accomplish tasks through mental calculations.Toddler toys Safe toys that promote a toddler's exploration include:\u0081 play dough and modeling clay \u0081 building blocks\u0081 plastic, pretend housekeeping toys, such as pots, pans, and play food\u0081 stackable rings and blocks of varying sizes\u0081 toy telephone\u0081 wooden puzzles with big pieces\u0081 textured or cloth books\u0081 plastic musical instruments and noise-makers\u0081 toys that roll, such as cars and trains\u0081 tricycle or riding car\u0081 fat crayons and col-oring books\u0081 stuffed animals with painted faces (button eyes can pose a chok-ing hazard). A toddler's favorite toy can change at the drop of a hat. Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 93 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 93 5/22/14 7:26 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.94EARL Y CHILDHOOD I'm hungry and I want my mom. If I make lots of noise, my mom will wake up and the French toast is mine! How's that for problem solving?\u0081 Object permanence advances as toddlers are more aware of the existence of objects that are out of sight, such as behind closed doors, in drawers, and under tables. \u0081 Toddlers begin to use language and are able to think about objects or people when they aren't present. Sincerest form of flattery \u0081 Imitation displays deeper meaning and understanding of the toddler's role in the family as the child observes and helps with household activities and identifies with the same-sex parent.\u0081 Toddlers begin to use preoperational thought , with increas- ing use of words as symbols. \u0081 Problem solving, creative thinking, and some understanding of cause and effect begin during the toddler years. Keys to health Guidelines for nutrition, sleep and rest, and dental hygiene should be followed to maintain a toddler's good health. Nutrition Nutrition guidelines for toddlers include:\u0081 a decrease in protein requirements from infancy (to 1.2 g/kg/day)\u0081 caloric requirement of approximately 100 kcal/kg/day \u0081 considerable need for vitamins and minerals, such as iron, calcium, and phosphorus. Developing healthy eating habits The eating habits learned during the toddler years can set the stage for many years to come. Positive experiences with food and family meals are likely to set a foundation for a healthy, pleasurable \"relationship\" with food. On the other hand, negative experiences\u2014power struggles, unpleasantness, food given or withheld to control behavior\u2014may predispose the toddler to future food-related problems, such as overeating, extremely picky eating, and even an increased risk for eating disorders. You eat what you are A toddler's developing eating habits are influenced by a range of factors, including:\u0081 physiologic anorexia, which occurs at approximately age 18 months (when growth slows), and results in decreased appetite and a picky, fussy eater with strong taste preferences Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 94 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 94 5/22/14 7:26 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.95TODDLERHOOD It's just about the time when toddlers stop needing to take naps (around age 3) that their parents could really use them! \u0081 need to imitate family members (toddlers may refuse to eat a particular food that parents or siblings choose not to eat)\u0081 being easily overwhelmed by large portions \u0081 inability to sit through a long meal without becoming fidgety or disruptive at times\u0081 food used as a reward or sign of approval (which may encour-age overeating for nonnutritive reasons) \u0081 food that's forced or mealtimes that are consistently unpleasant (which may keep the child from developing the sense of pleasure usually associated with eating). Food preparation Most toddlers eat the same food that's prepared for the rest of the family. Here are a few \"toddler truisms\" to help make mealtime enjoyable: \u0081 Serving size should be approximately 1 T of solid food per year of age (or one-fourth to one-third the adult portion size) so as not to overwhelm the child with larger portions.\u0081 Frequent, nutritious snacks are more likely to promote proper nutrition than are three large meals per day. \u0081 Most toddlers prefer to feed themselves; they're skill-ful at handling finger foods but are still messy with soft foods as they're learning to use a spoon. Sleep and rest Parents are usually pleased to hear that most toddlers sleep through the night without awakening. A consistent routine, such as a set bedtime, a light snack, reading, and a security object, helps toddlers prepare for sleep. Good night, sleepyhead Sleep requirements change slightly as a toddler grows and approaches the preschool stage.\u0081 From ages 1 to 2, a toddler needs 10 to 15 hours of sleep every 24 hours. \u0081 The 2- to 3-year-old needs 10 to 12 hours of sleep per night.\u0081 During toddlerhood, naps gradually decrease to one per day; at age 3, toddlers usually don't need a nap. Dental hygiene When teeth begin to break through the gumline, a child should begin brushing his teeth with a small, soft-bristled toothbrush (with parental assistance). Fluoride toothpaste should be avoided until the child is 2 years old. When used earlier, before the child can spit out toothpaste, ingested fluoride leads to fluorosis, which can Rights Reserved.96EARL Y CHILDHOOD Fluoride Fluoride is a mineral that reduces the incidence of tooth decay. It's found naturally in water, certain foods, and drinks made with fluoridated water. Unless the water supply has adequate fluoride (more than 0.6 ppm), children age 2 and older may need to receive a daily fluoride supplement. Before recommending fluoride supplements, consider other potential fluoridated water sources such as the child care center or a relative's house that the child frequents. When administering supplements or teaching the caregiver to do so, keep in mind that:\u0081 The supplement should be taken on an empty stomach and the child shouldn't eat or drink for 30 minutes afterward.\u0081 The supplement should remain in the child's mouth for 30 seconds before swallowing (if possible). \u0081 Use of fluoride products can lead to accidental poisoning; fluoride-containing toothpastes, supplements, and rinses must be stored out of the reach of young children. Low-cariogenic diet A low-cariogenic diet is important for developing strong, healthy teeth because caries need fermentable sugars, especially sucrose, to develop. The following information will help parents identify and minimize high-cariogenic foods in their child's diet: \u0081 Sticky or hard foods are more cariogenic than others because they remain in the mouth longer.\u0081 Refined table sugar, honey, molasses, corn syrup, and dried fruits such as raisins are highly cariogenic. \u0081 It's more important to limit the frequency of sugar consumption than the total amount consumed. Timing is everything \u0081 Sweets that are consumed immediately after a meal are less damaging than sweets that are eaten as snacks.\u0081 \"Early childhood caries\" (ECC) may occur when a child is routinely given a bottle of milk or juice at naptime or bedtime or uses the bottle as a pacifier while awake (a bottle of water may be used if needed). Breast-feeding has also been associated with ECC when the child frequently falls asleep at the breast. Coping with concerns A toddler is prone to developing troubling behaviors relating to toilet training, temper tantrums, and discipline. Negativism and periods of separation anxiety may manifest through physical behaviors such as temper tantrums.

All Rights Reserved.97TODDLERHOOD Toilet training For toilet training to be successful, the child must display three signs of toilet training readiness: First, the child must have control of the rectal and urethral sphincters. Second, the child must have a cognitive understanding of what it means to hold his stool and urine until he can go to a certain place at a certain time. Third, the child must have a desire to delay his immediate re- ward for a more socially accepted action. It's in his head, too Physical readiness for toilet training occurs at ages 18 to 24 months when myelinization of pyramidal tracts and condi-tioned reflex sphincter control are intact. Despite physical read- iness, however, many children aren't cognitively ready to begin toilet training until they're between ages 36 and 42 months. Ready, set, go potty! When physically and cognitively ready, the child can start toilet training. The process can take 2 weeks to 2 months to complete successfully. It's important to remember that there's considerable variability from one child to another. Other signs of readiness for toilet training include:\u0081 periods of dryness for 2 hours or more, indicating bladder control \u0081 child's ability to walk well and remove clothing \u0081 cognitive ability to understand the task\u0081 facial expression or words suggesting that the child knows when he's about to defecate. Step by step Steps to toilet training include: \u0081 teaching words for voiding and defecating\u0081 teaching the purpose of the toilet or potty chair \u0081 changing the toddler's diapers frequently to give him the experi- ence of feeling dry and clean\u0081 helping the toddler make the connection between dry pants and the toilet or potty chair \u0081 placing the child on the potty chair or toilet for a few moments at regular intervals and rewarding successes\u0081 helping the toddler understand the physiologic signals by pointing out behaviors they display when they need to void or defecate\u0081 rewarding successes but not punishing failures.

I suggest a good pair of earplugs.Temper tantrums As they assert their independence, toddlers demonstrate \"temper tantrums\" or violent objections to rules or demands. These tan-trums include such behaviors as lying on the floor and kicking his feet, screaming, and holding his breath. Hush little baby, don't throw a fit Tantrums can occur at any time of the day but commonly occur before bedtime. The active toddler may have trouble slowing down and, when placed in bed, resists staying there. Assessment of temper tantrums in a toddler should include the following questions: \u0081 How often do tantrums occur?\u0081 What circumstances provoke tantrums? \u0081 How does the child behave during tantrums? \u0081 How does the child behave between tantrums?\u0081 Are expectations of the parent consistent with the child's devel-opmental age?\u0081 Have there been any recent changes in the home?\u0081 Does the child have other behavior problems? Dealing with tantrums Dealing with a child's temper tantrums can be a challenge for parents who may be frustrated, embarrassed, and exhausted by their child's behavior. If tantrums occur in public places, parents may feel as if they're being judged by others and viewed as inept at parenting and unable to control their child's behavior. Annoying but normal The nurse should reassure parents that temper tantrums are a normal occurrence in toddlers and that the child will outgrow them as he learns to express himself in more productive ways. This type of reassurance should be accompanied by some concrete suggestions for deal-ing effectively with temper tantrums:\u0081 Provide a safe and childproof environment. \u0081 Hold the child to keep him safe if his behavior is out of control.\u0081 Give the toddler frequent opportunities to make developmentally appropriate choices.\u0081 Give the child advance warning of a request to help prevent tantrums.\u0081 Remain calm and be supportive of a child having a tantrum. \u0081 Ignore tantrums when the toddler is seeking attention or trying to get some-thing he wants.

A toddler's negativism can push a parent's patience to the limits. \u0081 Help the toddler find acceptable ways to vent his anger and frustration. When to get help Parents should be advised to seek help from a health care provider when problematic tantrums:\u0081 persist beyond age 5 \u0081 occur more than five times per day \u0081 occur with a persistent negative mood\u0081 cause property destruction\u0081 cause harm to the child or others. Negativism Negativism refers to persistent negative re- sponses to requests and is typical of toddlers as they strive for autonomy. \"No\" and \"Me do\" become the responses to almost everything, and the toddler's emotions are very strongly expressed with rapid mood swings. No, non, nein! Negativism commonly becomes exasperating for parents, who may find it easier to give in to the behavior than to deal with it constructively. Unfortunately, this reinforces the child's negative ways of interacting with others. Apple or grape? Negativism can usually be reduced by giving the child appropriate choices. It's hard to say \"no\" when the question is, \"Would you like apple juice or grape juice?\" Discipline Toddlers must be under direct supervision of a caregiver at all times. A childproof environment must be provided as they can move quickly and skillfully and are always exploring their surroundings. Frustration-free zone Most discipline for toddlers involves taking measures to make the environment safe and age-appropriate, which reduces the frequency of frustration-producing situations that require a \"no\" from parents.

Unacceptable behavior\u2014hitting sister. Penalty: 2 minutes in a neutral setting.Tackle the triggers Behavior management for toddlers includes attending to their needs to reduce fatigue and hunger triggers, as most inappropriate behavior occurs when the toddler is tired or hungry. Discipline guidelines include: \u0081 setting up routines and creating and adhering to a consistent schedule \u0081 providing an environment that limits opportunities for negative behavior and giving positive feedback for good behavior\u0081 using behavior modification, or posi-tive reinforcement, for good behavior and brief time-outs (with reasonable limits) for inappropriate behavior \u0081 recognizing individuality in the toddler's temperament\u0081 allowing toddlers to start attempting to solve some of their own problems\u0081 understanding and recognizing feelings of frustration, boredom, and anger\u0081 having the patience to allow toddlers to express themselves and to provide distraction when they're bored\u0081 avoiding physical punishment, threats, and criticism (remem-bering that toddlers' behaviors are generally the result of normal development, such as exploring and experimenting with their environment). Time-outs When using time-outs in response to a toddler's inappro- priate behavior, keep these guidelines in mind:\u0081 Make sure the child knows the rules ahead of time. \u0081 Give the child a simple explanation of why the behavior requiring a time-out is unacceptable.\u0081 Place the child in a neutral or uninteresting environment.\u0081 Limit the time-out to 1 minute per year of age (anything longer becomes frustrating and loses its intended effect). \u0081 Reset the timer for one additional time-out if the child acts unacceptably.\u0081 If the child is having trouble resolving his behavior problem on his own, try discussing the offense calmly and constructively and, if appropriate, helping the child determine ways to \"fix\" the result of the bad behavior (such as clean up a mess or apologize to a hurt friend). \u0081 After a successful time-out, praise the child for his improved behavior.

As the child matures to toddler age, he may still protest being left with someone other than a parent, close friend, or relative. Parents should be reassured that separation anxiety is a nor- mal, expected behavior that is actually necessary for developmen- tal growth, and that children usually progress beyond these fears with time and support. Anxiety antidote The following information and advice will help parents deal with their toddler's separation anxiety:\u0081 Toddlers should be allowed to explore at their own rate with close adult supervision. They're normally ready to venture away from their parents for short periods and are curious about strangers.\u0081 A toddler should be allowed to \"warm up\" to a new person. To do so, the parent should hold or stand near the child at a \"safe\" distance from the stranger, allowing the child to observe the new person from the safety of his parent's presence. (If the parent welcomes the new person, the toddler will likely do the same.) Separation from parents can be a major stressor for toddlers, and this stress can be even more severe when a child is ill or hospitalized. To tod- dlers, nurses (and other health care professionals) are not only strangers but also strangers in a strange environment. Slow, low, small, and clear These measures can reassure a toddler who's hospitalized or undergoing a medical procedure:\u0081 Start by talking to the parent in a soft voice while maintaining a safe distance from the child; avoid sudden movements or reaching for the child.\u0081 Approach the child at his eye level; you may be more likely to be accepted in a stance that makes you appear smaller and less threatening. \u0081 Minimize separation between the child and parent to the extent possible. (A parent's presence during a painful or frightening procedure, such as an injection, blood drawing, or intravenous [I.V.] insertion, will reassure the child that nothing truly bad will happen to him.)\u0081 If separation can't be helped (such as in the operating room or during a radiologic examination), tell the child where his parent is waiting for him, and reassure the child that his parent knows exactly where he is.

All Rights Reserved.102EARL Y CHILDHOOD \u0081 If a child is hospitalized and his parents must leave the hospital, reassure the child that his parents will return, and tell him when they'll return in terms he can understand (for example, \"Your parents will be back after Sesame Street \" or \"Your parents will be back at lunchtime\"). Preschool During the preschool stage (ages 3 to 5), children are gaining new initiative and independence and have well-developed language skills. Physical development Physical development is slow and steady during the preschool stage, with most growth occurring in the long bones of the arms and legs. Height and weight \u0081 Preschoolers grow about 2\u00bd /H11033 to 3 /H11033 (6.5 to 7.5 cm) per year; their average height is 37 /H11033 (94 cm). \u0081 Weight gain is 3 to 5 lb (1.5 to 2.5 kg) per year; the average preschooler weighs 32 lb (14.5 kg). Teeth By the preschool years, the development of the child's primary (or deciduous ) teeth is complete. Prepare the child and parents for the loss of these \"baby\" teeth and replacement with secondary (or permanent ) teeth, which usually begins to occur at age 6 years. Gross motor development A 3-year-old can: \u0081 stand on one foot for a few seconds\u0081 climb stairs with alternating feet \u0081 jump in place \u0081 perform a broad jump\u0081 dance, but with somewhat poor balance\u0081 kick a ball \u0081 ride a tricycle. Fabulous 4 and 5 A 4-year-old can: \u0081 hop, jump, and skip on one foot\u0081 throw a ball overhand \u0081 ride a tricycle or bicycle with training wheels. Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 102 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 102 5/22/14 7:26 PM 5-year-old can: \u0081 skip, using alternate feet \u0081 jump rope \u0081 balance on each foot for 4 to 5 seconds. Fine motor development A 3-year-old can: \u0081 build a tower of 9 to 10 blocks and a 3-block bridge\u0081 copy a circle and a cross \u0081 draw a circle with facial features (but usually not a stick figure) \u0081 use a fork well. A 4- or 5-year-old can: \u0081 build a tower of 10 blocks \u0081 copy a square and trace a cross and a diamond \u0081 draw a person or stick figure with three or more parts\u0081 use scissors to cut out a picture following an outline\u0081 lace shoes (may be unable to tie a bow). Psychological development During the preschool years, the child functions more socially as he is able to learn and follow rules and perhaps has entered a daycare or nursery school setting, which enhances social development. Many of the thought processes a preschooler will go through are essential to prepare him for kindergarten and the school years ahead. Psychosocial development According to Erikson's psychosocial theory, children between ages 3 and 5 have mastered a sense of autonomy and are now fac-ing the task of initiative versus guilt . During this time: \u0081 The child's significant other is the family. \u0081 A conscience begins to develop, and dealing with the concept of right and wrong becomes a major task for preschoolers.\u0081 A sense of guilt arises when the child feels that his imagination and activities are unacceptable or that they clash with his parents' expectations.\u0081 The preschooler uses simple reasoning and can tolerate longer periods of delayed gratification. Language development and socialization By the time a child reaches preschool age: \u0081 His vocabulary increases to about 900 words by age 3 and 2,100 words by age 5.

Why do I keep asking why?\u0081 He or she may talk incessantly and ask many \"why\" questions. \u0081 He usually talks in three- or four-word sentences by age 3; by age 5, he speaks in longer sentences that contain all parts of speech. Come one; come all Socialization continues to develop as the preschooler's world expands beyond himself and his family. Significant others now include grandparents, siblings, and preschool teachers (although parents remain central). Regular interaction with same-age children is necessary for the preschooler to further develop social skills. Play Play changes as children move into preschool years, and the paral- lel play of toddlerhood is essentially replaced by more interactive, cooperative play. Ch-, ch-, ch-, ch-, changes! Other changes in play include:\u0081 more associative play , in which there's interaction between the children as they play together \u0081 better understanding of the concept of sharing \u0081 enjoyment of large motor activities, such as swinging, riding tricycles or bicycles, and throwing balls\u0081 more dramatic play, in which the child lives out the dramas of human life (in the context of the preschool years) and may have imaginary playmates. (See Preschool play .) Cognitive development Preschoolers exhibit preoperational thought by using symbols or words to represent objects and people and by thinking about objects and people as well. Preschool play Suggested play activities for preschoolers include: \u0081 running and jumping in an open space\u0081 creative play with dress-up clothes, pretend kitchens, and dolls\u0081 art activities with paints, paper, crayons, blunt scissors, and markers\u0081 trips to the museum, park, fire station, zoo, library, and shopping mall \u0081 swimming and other individual sports and activities to encourage gross motor development\u0081 puzzles and toys to aid fine motor development and stimulate imagination.

It's wrong to put your sister's head in the toilet because your mom won't let you watch TV for a whole week if you do.Piaget's cognitive theory divides the preoperational phase into two stages during the preschool years: the preconceptual phase and the intuitive thought phase . It's all about me! The preconceptual phase, from ages 2 to 4, begins in the toddler stage and extends into the preschool stage. During this phase, the child is able to: \u0081 form beginning concepts that aren't as complete or logical as an adult's are\u0081 make simple classifications\u0081 rationalize specific concepts but not the idea as a whole \u0081 exhibit egocentric thinking (evaluating each situation based on his feelings or experiences, rather than the feelings of others). Call it children's intuition The intuitive thought phase begins at age 4 and extends into school age (age 7). During this phase, the child: \u0081 can classify, quantify, and relate objects (but can't yet under- stand the principles behind these operations) \u0081 uses intuitive thought processes (but isn't able to fully see the viewpoints of others)\u0081 uses many words appropriately (but without true understanding of their meaning). Moral and spiritual development Kohlberg's preconventional phase of moral development spans the preschool and school age stages, extending from ages 4 to 10. During this phase: \u0081 Conscience emerges and emphasis is on external control.\u0081 The preschooler's moral standards are those of others, and he understands that these standards must be followed to avoid punishment for inappropriate behavior or gain rewards for good or desired behavior.\u0081 The preschooler behaves according to what freedom is given or what restriction is placed on his actions.\u0081 Children ages 4 to 7 are more focused on meeting their own personal needs than on the desires of others. Spirituality Children learn about faith and religion from significant people in their lives, such as their parents or religious teachers.

All Rights Reserved.106EARL Y CHILDHOOD Friends at the top Although preschoolers can imagine the physical characteristics of a supreme being, they commonly treat Him as an imaginary friend. They can understand the basic plot of simple religious stories but typically don't grasp the underlying meanings. Religious principles are best learned from concrete images in picture books and small statues such as those seen at a place of worship. During this stage, children may view an illness or hospitalization as a punishment for some real or perceived bad behavior. Keys to health Guidelines for nutrition, sleep, and dental hygiene should be followed in order to maintain a preschooler's good health. Nutrition The daily caloric requirement for preschoolers is 85 to 90 kcal/kg/day or about 1,700 to 1,800 calories per day. Daily fluid intake should average 100 ml/kg, depending on the preschooler's activity level. Make pleasant conversation By age 5, the focus on the \"social\" aspects of eating can begin. Parents should encourage table conversation, good table manners, and a willingness to try a variety of foods. Preschoolers are old enough to help with meal preparation and cleanup and usually enjoy doing so. No food fights Parents should be discouraged from using food as a bribe, reward, or threat, which can set the stage for unhealthy attitudes about food and eating. Food preferences Many 3- to 4-year-olds have strong taste preferences. The child may want to eat only one thing, or a narrow range of foods, over and over. Emphasis should be placed on the quality of the food eaten rather than the quantity to prevent emotional struggles over food. To promote healthy eating habits, parents should encourage the child to eat fruits and vegetables (raw are usually preferred over cooked).

All Rights Reserved.107PRESCHOOL Sleep and rest By the time a child reaches the preschool stage, sleep patterns have been established (during toddlerhood). Normal sleep patterns for preschoolers consist of 10 to 12 hours at night and, if not already stopped at age 3, one daytime nap or rest period. Monsters under the bed Despite these well-established patterns, sleep-related problems may reappear during preschool years, including:\u0081 Dreams and nightmares become more real as magical thinking increases and a vivid imagination develops. \u0081 Problems falling asleep may occur due to overstimulation, sepa-ration anxiety, fear of the dark or monsters, or use of medications such as stimulants. \u0081 Nighttime waking may occur due to nightmares and night terrors as well as the child's inability to soothe and comfort himself.\u0081 Sleepwalking may occur if the child hasn't had enough sleep or is experiencing unusual stress. Dental hygiene Preschoolers have developed the fine motor skills needed to use a toothbrush properly and should be encouraged to brush two to three times daily. Parents should still supervise the child's brushing (assisting, as necessary) and perform flossing. As in toddlerhood, cariogenic foods should be avoided. The preschool years are an excellent time to encourage good dental hygiene habits. Parents should administer fluoride supple- ments if the water supply isn't fluoridated. In addition, they should schedule a first dental visit so the child can become comfortable with the routine of preventive dental care. The child should then visit the dentist at 6- to 12-month intervals. Coping with concerns Parents may be concerned about their preschoolers in the areas of discipline and fears. They may also have concerns about their child's readiness to start formal schooling. Discipline Parents commonly have questions about how best to discipline young children. Here are some pointers about appropriate methods of discipline: \u0081 Authority figures should administer discipline firmly, consistently, and fairly. Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 107 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 107 5/22/14 7:26 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.108EARL Y CHILDHOOD Preschoolers are commonly afraid of large animals.\u0081 The child should be given simple explanations about why a certain behavior isn't appropriate.\u0081 Time-outs (generally 1 minute per year of age) can be used to help the child relieve intensity, regain control, and think about his inappropriate behavior.\u0081 Discipline shouldn't be confused with punishment. Discipline refers to the process of managing behaviors\u2014good and bad\u2014to achieve desired outcomes. Punishment is a single action taken in response to a specific behavior. Fears Children experience more fears during the preschool years than at any other time. Common fears include:\u0081 the dark \u0081 ghosts \u0081 being left alone\u0081 animals (particularly large dogs)\u0081 body mutilation, blood oozing out of cuts (children consider bandages very important to keep body contents inside)\u0081 pain and objects or persons associated with painful experiences. Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters! No amount of logical persuasion will help allay these fears, which leaves many parents perplexed about how to help. Parents can help their child overcome his fears by: \u0081 actively involving him in finding practical solutions to dealing with his fears, such as using a night-light and keeping the closet door open or closed (to keep monsters under control) \u0081 desensitizing the child to the object of his fear by exposing him to the object in a safe situation (for example, allowing him to watch a large dog interact with children who aren't fearful but never forcing him to approach or touch one unless he's ready)\u0081 giving it time (by age 5 or 6, most children will have overcome these types of fears). Preschool and kindergarten readiness Factors to consider when assessing for preschool readiness include:\u0081 visual, perceptual, cognitive, social, and behavioral abilities (such as gross and fine motor skills, visual processing, spatial- body awareness, auditory language, memory, general knowledge, Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 108 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 108 PM Kluwer.

(See Selecting an appropriate preschool .) Kindergarten In general, a child is ready for kindergarten when he:\u0081 can dress himself (except for tying shoes)\u0081 can copy a square \u0081 can count six objects when asked \"How many?\" \u0081 knows the letters of the alphabet and can count to 20\u0081 can answer simple questions such as \"What's a table made of?\"\u0081 can manage his emotions and behavior when away from homeIt's all relative Selecting an appropriate preschool Criteria to consider when selecting a preschool include accreditation, daily activity schedule, teacher qualifications, overall environment, and parent recommendations. Accreditation \u0081 Is the preschool up-to-date with its state license?\u0081 Does the National Association for the Educa-tion of Young Children accredit the preschool?\u0081 Does the preschool clearly define its goals and philosophy of teaching? Daily activity schedule \u0081 Does your child prefer to play outdoors or indoors?\u0081 Are plenty of rest periods or quiet activities scheduled throughout the day?\u0081 Are the children stimulated by a variety of activities or are they easily distracted by visi-tors because of boredom?\u0081 Are the children encouraged to express themselves individually?\u0081 Are nutritionally balanced snacks and meals provided?Teacher qualifications \u0081 Are the teachers trained in early childhood development?\u0081 Is there a high staff turnover rate?\u0081 Do the teachers appear friendly and approachable?\u0081 Are the teachers actively engaged with the children or are they passively supervising? Environment \u0081 Does an adult always supervise the children?\u0081 Will your child work well with the noise level in the preschool?\u0081 Is the preschool clean, and are good sanitary habits practiced there?\u0081 Are emergency plans in place and updated regularly in the event of a fire, medical emer-gency, or other crisis? Parent recommendations \u0081 What are the opinions of other parents whose children attend the preschool?\u0081 Have other parents expressed concerns or reported problems with the preschool?

Injury prevention Injuries are the number one cause of death in toddler and pre- school age-groups. For this reason, much emphasis should be placed on injury prevention and safety awareness. Aspiration Aspiration can easily occur in toddlers because they're still ex-ploring their environments with their mouths. Toddlers may ingest small objects, while the small size of their oral cavities increases the risk of aspiration while eating. Preventive measures include: \u0081 learning the Heimlich maneuver (making sure the maneuver is age-appropriate)\u0081 avoiding large, round chunks of meat such as hot dogs (slic- ing them into short, lengthwise pieces is a safer option) \u0081 avoiding fruit with pits, fish with bones, hard candy, chewing gum, nuts, popcorn, whole grapes, and marshmallows\u0081 keeping easily aspirated objects out of a toddler's environment\u0081 being especially cautious about what toys the child plays with (choosing sturdy toys without small, removable parts). (See Aspiration risks .) Burns Burns can easily occur in toddlers and preschoolers because they're tall enough to reach the stovetop and can walk to a fireplace or a woodstove to touch. Hot stuff Preventive measures include:\u0081 setting the hot water heater thermostat at a temperature less than 120\u00b0 F (49\u00b0 C)It's all relative Aspiration risks Toddlers explore their environment by putting things in their mouths. Foods and other items that can place a toddler at risk for aspiration include:\u0081 small foods, such as popcorn, peanuts, whole grapes, cherry tomatoes, chunks of hot dogs, raw carrots, hard candy, bubble gum, long noodles, dried beans, and marshmallows\u0081 small toys, such as broken latex balloons, button eyes, beaded necklaces, and small wheels\u0081 common house-hold items, such as broken zippers, pills, bottle caps, and nails and screws.

Suffocation Suffocation can easily occur in toddlers and preschoolers exposed to objects that can occlude the airway. A child may place such an object over his head or get tangled in an object such as a cord or string. Suffocation can also occur if a child becomes enclosed in a small space with a limited oxygen supply. Preventive measures are extremely important and include: \u0081 storing plastic bags, latex balloons, strings, and ribbons out of the child's reach \u0081 never allowing the child to play with latex balloons, which can burst into small pieces that can be easily aspirated (supervised play with Mylar balloons is acceptable)\u0081 keeping strings and cords (such as those on hooded clothing or window coverings) out of the child's reach\u0081 discarding old appliances, such as refrigerators and ovens, or removing the doors from old appliances that must be stored (to prevent a child from becoming trapped)\u0081 choosing safe toy boxes or chests without heavy, hinged lids.

Unfortunately, they may also be subjected to neglect and abuse. Child abuse and neglect Child abuse and neglect can occur as acts of commission or omission by a caregiver. These acts can prevent children from actualizing their potential for growth and development. What causes it Risk factors that may predispose a child to abuse or neglect may involve the parent or the child. Vicious cycle Risk factors involving the parent include:\u0081 history of being abused as a child\u0081 substance abuse \u0081 low self-esteem \u0081 difficulty controlling aggressive impulses\u0081 being a domestic violence victim or abuser\u0081 youth or inexperience \u0081 having limited support \u0081 having unrealistic expectations of the child\u0081 being overly demanding or overprotective. It was an accident Risk factors involving the child include: \u0081 being unresponsive or overactive\u0081 having frequent accidents, illnesses, or slow recovery from illness \u0081 being excessively negative \u0081 being born prematurely. Other risk factors include a history of abuse of the child's sib- lings and stressful environmental factors, such as divorce, poverty, unemployment, and inadequate housing. How it happens Child abuse is a widespread problem and is part of a larger problem of violence. Many children die each day as a result of maltreatment: \u0081 Approximately 35% of all child abuse cases involve parental substance abuse.

All Rights Reserved.116EARL Y CHILDHOOD Every finding is a clue when you suspect abuse.\u0081 One of every four parents who grew up in a violent home goes on to seriously injure a child.\u0081 As domestic violence rates increase, the number of children who suffer from abuse will likely increase as well (children of battered women are at higher risk for abuse than other children).\u0081 Many child abusers were abused as children and may not know healthier ways to discipline a child or to show love. It's the law If abuse is suspected, health care providers, including doctors, nurses, and dentists, are legally required to report their suspicions to Child Protective Services. What to look for Physical indicators of abuse and neglect include:\u0081 unexplained fractures (children younger than walking age rarely have fractures because their bones are still pliable) \u0081 bruises with specific patterns, over soft tissue areas, back, or genitals, in various stages of healing (because bruising caused by accidents most commonly occurs over bony prominences in children) \u0081 bald spots (however, most infants normally have a bald spot over the occipital prominence of the skull since the inception of the \"Back to Sleep\" campaign to prevent sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS])\u0081 welts from belt buckles or other distinctive instruments\u0081 cigarette burns as well as \"glove-,\" \"sock-,\" or doughnut-shaped burns from dipping extremities in hot water or holding a child's bottom in hot water \u0081 human bite marks larger than 1 /H11033 (2.5 cm) (because they would not likely come from another child at that size)\u0081 retinal hemorrhages indicating shaken baby syndrome (different from scleral hemorrhages)\u0081 inappropriate dress, poor hygiene, or untreated medical needs\u0081 failure to thrive. Acting it out Behavioral indicators include: \u0081 withdrawn, passive, apathetic, or depressed moods\u0081 habit-related disorders such as excessive sucking or rocking. When things don't add up Other findings include:\u0081 conflicting reports from caregiver and child about how injuries occurred Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 116 Meadows-Oliver_Ch04.indd 116 5/22/14 7:26 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.117HEALTH PROBLEMS \u0081 inappropriate delay in seeking treatment for injuries \u0081 inconsistency between the history of the injury and the child's developmental level \u0081 inappropriate response of the child to the injuries. What tests tell you There's no definitive test to detect child abuse or negligence. How- ever, many laboratory tests and X-rays may be indicated, such as:\u0081 hemoglobin and lead levels, because children who have been abused may not have had routine health care and are at higher risk for anemia and lead poisoning\u0081 complete blood count to rule out any blood disorders\u0081 laboratory studies to rule out sexually transmitted diseases whenever sexual abuse is suspected \u0081 radiographic studies to diagnose suspicious injury or trauma\u0081 skeletal X-ray survey to examine the entire body for evidence of fractures occurring at various times with various levels of healing. (X-rays may indicate previous nonaccidental trauma that is ongo-ing and predates the incident that brought the child to the health care provider's attention.) Calling in the cavalry Child Protective Services should be contacted to document the suspected injuries. When visible lesions are present, color photo-graphs should be taken and the image should include: \u0081 ruler for accurate measurement \u0081 name of child\u0081 name of person taking photo\u0081 written description of lesion. Complications Complications of child abuse and neglect come in various forms depending on severity. Children can suffer a wide range of physi-cal complications and lasting emotional effects. How it's treated Child abuse is treated by first identifying it as a problem. After the injury is treated, the child's safety must be ensured if there's any suspicion of abuse or violence. What to do The nurse should always be assessing children and care providers for potential domestic violence. In individual instances:\u0081 Complete a thorough assessment of all body systems while comforting and reassuring the child to the extent possible.

The \"A\" team \u0081 Collaborate with the multidisciplinary health care team about immediate and long-term interventions to prevent further abuse.\u0081 Work with the caregiver on changing the situation that led to the abuse and refer him or her to an agency or program that special- izes in working with similar families.\u0081 Teach the parents relevant child development principles, give them anticipatory guidance, and serve as their role model. \u0081 Provide the child with positive attention and age- appropriate play activities.\u0081 Reassure the child that nothing that happened was his fault and that you're there to help, not hurt him. Lead poisoning Lead poisoning, or plumbism , is a toxic condition that's caused by ingestion or inhalation of lead or lead-containing com- pounds. Children at risk for lead poisoning are those between the ages of 6 months and 6 years; the incidence peaks from ages 2 to 3. What causes it Lead poisoning can result from: \u0081 chronic ingestion of lead-based paint, dust, or caulking chips in older homes \u0081 ingestion of particles that fall from work clothes of parents who have at-risk jobs, such as those in construction, lead smelting, or ceramic and stained glass making\u0081 inhalation of fumes from leaded gasoline or batteries \u0081 use of unglazed pottery or ceramics \u0081 drinking water from older, lead-containing plumbing\u0081 certain folk remedies\u0081 deficient parental interaction and supervision, such as insuffi-cient feeding and poor hygiene practices.

All Rights Reserved.119HEALTH PROBLEMS How it happens Children can ingest lead from numerous sources within the environment. Poisoning can occur from repeated exposure over a period of time, with toxic effects generally seen when more than 0.5 mg of lead is absorbed daily. Occasionally, a child may ingest large amounts of lead at one time by swallowing some-thing that contains lead or being given a large dose of lead such as that found in a traditional Mexican folk remedy (azarcon [lead tetroxide]). Venous blood lead levels are used to gauge the severity of the lead poisoning. What to look for Risk screening for lead poisoning should begin at age 6 months, with a verbal risk assessment performed at every well-child visit until age 6. Children should receive a capillary fingerstick to screen for elevated blood lead levels at ages 1 and 2 years (and beyond if at risk for lead poisoning). A little snooping Ask questions about the child's exposure to well water, the prox- imity of the residence to major highways, the parents' occupa-tions and hobbies, and whether and how often folk remedies are used. Casting judgment During the assessment, care should be taken not to judge or blame parents who may already be feeling guilty or even fearful that their children might be removed from their home. Clinical assessment In addition to the verbal assessment for risk of environmental exposure, the child should be assessed for symptoms of lead ingestion, including: \u0081 failure to gain weight \u0081 developmental lags\u0081 behavioral changes, such as pica (ingestion of nonedible sub- stances), lethargy, and decreased interest in surroundings \u0081 vague symptoms that come and go, including colicky, abdominal pain. What tests tell you A child with a blood lead level greater than 5 mcg/dl requires inter- vention such as parental education and an environmental assess-ment for the source of the lead exposure.

How it's treated Treatment goals include separating the child from the lead source and reducing the blood lead levels. Chelation 'til completion For children with venous blood levels of 45 mcg/dl or higher, pharmacologic treatment is necessary. Pharmacologic treatment consists of chelation therapy to remove lead from the circulating blood. Chelation therapy involves the administration of chelating agents such as succimer (Chemet) or dimercaprol (BAL in Oil). These agents bind with the lead and excrete it from the body. (As it's removed from the blood, lead is released from the organs to establish a new equilibrium with the blood lead level.) Chelation therapy should be used for children with levels of 45 mcg of lead per deciliter of blood or above. What to do \u0081 Administer chelating medication as ordered. \u0081 Teach parents how to eliminate sources of lead from the child's environment and to discourage children from eating dirt or paint chips. \u0081 Encourage good nutrition because this will reduce the chances of lead absorption.\u0081 Instruct parents on medication administration and age- appropriate growth and developmental needs (assist with referrals for developmental programs as appropriate). In addition, provide parents with these prevention tips: \u0081 Allow tap water to run for 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or mixing formula.\u0081 Don't store food in an open can nor use cookware or ceramic dishes that may contain lead. \u0081 Teach the child to carefully wash his hands with hot, soapy water before eating.

The school-age years can be a spectacular journey filled with joys and successes as the child continues to grow and mature. They can also be marked by challenges, as the child struggles to make sense of physical and psychologi- cal changes, his emerging identity, and the way he sees himself and is viewed by others (especially his peers). Physical development Physical growth at this time in a child's life is rela- tively slow and smooth.Just the facts In this chapter, you'll learn: physical, psychosocial, cognitive, and moral development of school-age children and adolescents keys to health maintenance in middle childhood and adolescence common concerns of school-age children and adoles-cents and their parents injury prevention for school-age children and adolescents common health problems during middle childhood and adolescence.

Physical growth is slower during school age, but grace and agility make a stellar appearance.Height and weight Growth slows considerably during middle childhood. During this stage, height increases an average of 2 /H11033 (5 cm) per year, and weight increases an average of 6 lb (2.5 kg) per year. However, during this time, the typical school-age child slims down and becomes more agile and graceful. Ladies first Girls tend to develop slightly faster than boys; although boys are, on average, taller and heavier than girls until the ado-lescent growth spurt. Fine motor skills By age 7, the brain has nearly completed its growth (at approximately 90%) and basic neuromuscular mechanisms are in place. No more excuses Development of small-muscle and eye-hand coordination increases, leading to the skilled handling of tools, such as pencils and papers for drawing and writing. The child can then spend the remainder of this period refining physical and motor skills and coordination. Pubertal changes The pubertal growth spurt begins in girls at about age 10 and in boys at about age 12. Jumpin' in feet first Different areas of the body reach their peak growth at different times. Changes are easily recognized in the feet, which are the first part of the body to experience a growth spurt. Increased foot size is followed by a rapid increase in leg length and then trunk growth. Leggy and hippy During this time, leg growth increases more dramatically than trunk growth in boys. In addition, although girls have a greater growth spurt in hip width, boys exceed girls in other areas of bone growth. No turning back In addition to bones, gonadal hormone levels increase and cause the sexual organs to mature. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 124 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 124 5/22/14 7:28 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.125SCHOOL AGE Preparation for menses In girls, the first menstruation, called menarche , usually starts around age 12 but can occur as early as age 9 and still be consid- ered normal. The menstrual cycle may be irregular at first. Secondary sexual characteristics may start to develop\u2014 including breasts, hips, and pubic hair\u2014and girls may experience a sudden increase in height. Nurses may find that this provides an excellent opportunity to educate school-age girls about breast self-examination and sexual responsibility. Teeth Loss of primary teeth and eruption of the first secondary teeth occur during the school-age years. Because of their size, second-ary teeth may, for a while, appear disproportionately large in rela- tion to the child's other, smaller facial features. Psychological development Attending school marks an acceleration in the separation of the child from his parents. It introduces the child to a new set of authority figures (teachers, school administrators) and strength- ens the concept of peer relationships. Psychosocial development The school-age child enters Erikson's stage of industry versus inferiority. In this stage, the child wants to work and produce, accomplishing and achieving tasks. However, if too much is expected of him, or if he feels unable to measure up to set stan- dards, the negative attributes of inadequacy and inferiority may prevail. Language development and socialization The school-age child has an efficient vocabulary and begins to correct previous mistakes in usage. He begins to understand the double meanings of words and becomes proficient at giving others directions without using physical signals. Pick a clique In the first and second grades, peers are increasingly significant to the child. His need to find his place within a group becomes important. Same-sex cliques are established during this period, and com- petition becomes more common, as does bragging over accom- plishments. The child may be overly concerned with peer Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 125 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 125 2015 Rights Reserved.126MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE A school-age child's enthusiasm for learning is contagious!however, parental guidance continues to play an important role in the child's life. Handle with care: Sensitive to ridicule The child's world expands as interests and activities outside the home take on an expanded role in his life. He's more independent, inside and outside the home. He understands the reasons for rules and becomes more sensitive to criticism and ridicule. Play The child's personality has become structured, and he's ready to be a partner in play with his friends. The child in this age-group typically has two to three best friends, who may change frequently. Most of his energies are devoted to school and his friends. Cognitive development School and learning are viewed by the school-age child as an exciting experience. The major developmental tasks at this time are achievement in school and acceptance by peers. Expectations in the classroom have intensified, and require concentration, attendance, and complex auditory and visual processing. The school-age child is in Piaget's concrete-operational period, a time in which the child uses thought processes to experience and understand events and actions. Children at this age are less egocentric and can see things from another's point of view. Try to remember Reorganization of the frontal brain , which is used for selective attention, occurs between ages 5 and 7. The ability to reason and memorize improves, and the child tends to use mnemonic strate- gies to remember new information. In addition, the following occurs:\u0081 Magical thinking diminishes around this time, and the child has a much better understanding of cause and effect. \u0081 The child begins to accept rules but may not necessarily under- stand them.\u0081 Memory skills are continually improving, along with an increased attention span. The child is ready for basic reading, writing, and arithmetic.\u0081 Abstract thinking begins to develop during the middle elemen-tary school years. \u0081 Parents remain very important during this time.

All Rights Reserved.127SCHOOL AGE Moral and spiritual development In general, the first level of moral thinking is put into practice at the elementary school level, and the school-age child is in Kohlberg's conventional level. The child behaves according to socially acceptable norms because an authority figure tells him to do so. This obedience is compelled by the threat of punishment (external factors). \"Because I said so\" At ages 11 to 12, as the child begins to approach adolescence, school and parental authority is questioned and, occasionally, even challenged or opposed. The importance of the peer group intensifies, and rough, bold, or even brazen behavior becomes increasingly common. The peer group becomes the source of behavior standards and models. Mom's still the bomb Parental guidance, love, and support are absolutely essential for the development of values during this time. The child at this age needs the opportunity to make decisions within defined boundaries. Ideally, those boundaries are set by responsible adults in the child's life. Earth-bound Spiritual lessons should be taught in concrete terms during this stage. Children have a hard time understanding supernatural re-ligious symbols. Repeated religious rituals, such as praying and attending church services, may comfort them. Keys to health During the school-age years, the child's understanding of cause and effect, coupled with his need for parental (and peer) approval, provides an excellent opportunity to continue teaching about the need to make healthy lifestyle choices. Parents should continue to teach their children about the importance of:\u0081 proper nutrition\u0081 sleep and rest \u0081 exercise \u0081 dental hygiene. Nutrition Children should be encouraged to eat a variety of healthy foods, such as lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and grains, to ensure proper nutritional intake.Memory jogger When it comes to teaching chil-dren about being healthy, tell parents to remember these things to care for their PEDS : Proper nutrition Exercise Dental hygiene Sleep.

Childhood obesity is increasing, and measures should be taken to avoid high-fat, high-sugar, low-protein foods. (See Encouraging proper nutrition .) Sleep and rest Requirements for sleep and rest are unique and relate to the child's activity level and physical health. School-age children generally don't require an afternoon nap, and compliance at bedtime becomes easier. Children should develop healthy sleep habits by not having a television in their bedrooms. Things that go bump in the night Sleepwalking and sleeptalking may begin during this stage, and parents should take measures to ensure the child's physical safety during these episodes. Nightmares are usually related to a real event in the child's life and can usually be eradicated by resolving any underlying fears the child might have. Exercise and activity Exercise and other forms of physical activity should be en- couraged to help the child begin healthy habits for a lifetime. Doing so may also prevent childhood obesity. Children who are interested in sports should be encour- aged to join sport teams or participate in sporting events. Sport teams and events are usually same-sex events at this age level, making them less intimidating. Those who aren't inter- ested in team sports and whose family are unable to meet the time or financial demands should be encouraged to participate in regular family play, walks, or bike rides. Children should learn the importance of daily activity, and parents should limit sedentary activities such as playing video games. Clicking the remote doesn't count Parents should encourage physical exercise after school in- stead of more sedentary activities such as watching television or playing video games. Dental hygiene During the school-age years:\u0081 Teeth should be brushed at least twice a day and, if possible, after meals. \u0081 Drinking water should contain fluoride or fluoride supple- ments should be given.It's all relative Encouraging proper nutrition To ensure that chil- dren continue to develop and main-tain healthy eating habits, encourage parents to:\u0081 stock the pantry and refrigerator with healthy choices for after-school snacks (raw vegetables, low-fat yogurts, fresh fruits)\u0081 avoid taking chil- dren to fast-food establishments where high-fat foods are abundant\u0081 teach children how to read nutri-tion labels while shopping at the grocery store\u0081 involve children in planning and preparing meals for the family\u0081 offer candy and other sweets as an infrequent privilege rather than a reward for good behavior\u0081 change their own eating habits to model good dietary habits for their children.

Coping with concerns During school age, the child's life revolves around home and family, school, and peers. School-age children (and their parents) are commonly faced with concerns about school and after-school supervision. School phobias School phobias may also be called school refusal or school avoidance . A child's refusal to go to school may be a sign of a separation anxiety, which occurs in families that are particularly close and caring or in a child who relies heavily on the support of his family. It may also occur after a particular trauma, such as the death of a pet, illness within the family, or a move to a new school. In these cases, the child may be more fearful of leaving home than he is of going to school. He may, for example, be afraid that something bad will happen to a parent, sibling, or pet if he isn't there to protect them. Scary school Refusal to go to school may also be related to fear of the school itself and what the child experiences there. Parents should talk to their child and try to determine the underlying cause of his fear. Possible reasons for school phobias include: \u0081 being the target of a bully\u0081 anxiety about academic achievement\u0081 having problems adapting to the school structure. Stealing Stealing is attractive to the younger school-age child who simply wants items for himself. The child has a limited sense of what belongs to someone else and will commonly lie to cover up the offense. Low on dough A sense of responsibility for one's actions begins to take shape at the end of middle childhood. Stealing at the end of middle childhood is commonly a sign that something is lacking in that child's life. Possible causes include a lack of:\u0081 financial means\u0081 attention from a parent or caregiver \u0081 sense of property rights.

A child who knows that his own property is respected is more likely to understand the importance of respecting the property of others. Adolescence Adolescence is defined as the developmental stage between ages 13 and 19. Physical development Adolescence is a time of change. As physical changes occur, adolescents struggle with the conflict between asserting their independence and still relying on their parents. Terrible teens Many adults view the changes that occur during ado-lescence with great fear and trepidation. Although not always the case, it may be a turbulent time for the adoles- cent and his parents. Height and weight During this time, a teenager's weight almost doubles and his height increases by 15% to 20%. Girls may grow 3 /H11033 to 6 /H11033 (7.5 to 15 cm) per year until age 16. Boys may grow 3 /H11033 to 6 /H11033 per year until age 18. Major organs double in size; the exception is the lym- phoid tissue, which decreases in mass. Boys attain greater strength and muscle mass, but motor coordination lags behind growth in stature and musculature. Motor coordination catches up as strength improves. Development of secondary sex characteristics The pituitary gland is stimulated at puberty to produce androgen steroids responsible for secondary sex characteristics. (See Beginning sexual maturity in girls and Beginning sexual maturity in boys , page 133.)

Body hair appears in the pubic area and under the arms, and menarche occurs. The ovaries, present at birth, remain inactive until puberty. Boys will be boys . . . until they're men Male secondary sexual development consists of genital growth and the appearance of pubic and body hair. Androgens and estrogens The trigger that starts puberty is unknown. What's clear is that, for some reason, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which triggers the anterior pituitary gland produce hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH initiate the ovulation cycle in girls and promote tes-ticular maturation and sperm production in boys. Tanner staging The development of secondary sex characteristics occurs in an anticipated sequence for girls and boys, and is divided into distinct stages, called Tanner stages . Although the timing of the stages is different for each individual, the sequence remains the same. Menstruation and spermatogenesis During early adolescence (ages 11 to 14), most girls achieve men-arche. Most boys achieve active spermatogenesis at ages 12 to 15. Teeth The secondary (permanent) teeth are all present during the early adolescent years. The four third molars (also called wisdom teeth ) may need to be extracted if impaction occurs. Psychological development Psychological development during adolescence revolves around socialization. As the teen ventures into the world outside his own family and is exposed to other viewpoints, peers become increas- ingly important and independence is tested. Psychosocial development Adolescence is the period of identity development, according to Erikson, as the child enters the stage of identity versus role con-fusion. Changes in the adolescent's body are taking place rapidly, and he's preoccupied with how he looks and with how others Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 134 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 134 5/22/14 7:28 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.135ADOLESCENCE Oh! My teenage Romeo!view him. While trying to meet the expectations of his peers, he's also trying to establish his own identity. Early adolescence During early adolescence, the teen begins to show more interest in the opposite sex, although the peer group usually consists of same-sex friends. That's what friends are for Friends become much more important, and interest in family and family activities decreases. Rebel with a question Conformity to peer group standards is of utmost importance at this time. This may lead to rebellion and questioning of parental (and other adult) authority. Middle adolescence The teen becomes more self-assured during middle adolescence, and independent decision-making skills are tested. The young and the tasteless Activities outside the home take on even greater importance, and the teenager commonly defines himself by whatever the peer group has defined. He wears what other teens in his group wear, he speaks using the common language the peer group has decided on, and his taste in music and other preferences go along with the crowd. When girls no longer have cooties It's at this time that relationships with the opposite sex are established. Late adolescence During the late teen years, adolescent rebellion has diminished. The young adult has a fairly strong sense of who he is but may not yet have committed to a particular occupation or role in life. Cognitive development During adolescence, the teen moves from the con- crete thinking of childhood into Piaget's stage of formal operational thought . The teen can now reason logically about abstract concepts and derive conclusions from hypothetical premises.

Can I have the car keys and $20 for gas so I can be an adult and go vote? You guys go ahead\u2014I have to do my homework. (Did I say that? It must be that postconventional level of moral development stuff.)I can see clearly now . . . He can imagine events in the future instead of focusing on the present (as in childhood). Because the future becomes a possibility, the teen may be more receptive to education that focuses on health promotion and can concentrate on future benefits as a result of current behaviors. One step forward, two steps back Although abstract thinking becomes more refined, the teen may revert back into concrete thinking during times of stress. Moral and spiritual development Kohlberg's conventional level of moral development continues into early adolescence. At this level, the child does what's right because it's the socially ac- ceptable action. At this level, the child continues to advance in moral reasoning as his cognition develops. In with the in-crowd The teen becomes increasingly dependent on his peer group for ap proval and associates good behavior with \"fitting in\" with the crowd. Morality may be dependent on the situation and relationship. Commonly, peer pressure will override the teen's own moral reasoning. At long last\u2014my own person As adolescence ends, the teen enters Kohlberg's postconven- tional , or principled , level of moral development . He starts to question and discard status quo, and chooses values for him- self, not necessarily what's dictated by his peers. Although he may appreciate the peer group's opinions, he's now capa-ble of forming a moral decision independent of the group. What's the meaning of life? The teen formulates questions about the larger world as he considers religion, philosophy, and the values held by parents, friends, and others. Adolescents are suspicious about parental religious views, and curi- osity about other religious beliefs is normal. They sort through and adopt those religious beliefs that are consistent with their moral character. Look, Mom, I'm legal! Their worldview becomes solidified during this time. The teen may be considered a young adult and societal laws reinforce this. By age 18, he's allowed to vote, and by age 21, he's considered a full adult with all of the rights and responsibilities that go along with Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 136 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 136 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Kluwer.

Even so, the adolescent remains somewhat dependent on his parents for finances and for help in meeting the adult re-sponsibilities given to him. Keys to health Health issues during adolescence include nutrition, sleep and rest, exercise, and dental hygiene. Nutrition Because physical changes are so drastic during adolescence, nutritional needs are greater than at any other time in a person's life. Run a little, eat a lot Activity plays a large role in a teen's caloric requirements for maintaining weight. An active teenager playing sports for several hours per day may need in excess of 3,000 kcal per day, whereas an inactive adolescent girl may have to take in fewer than 2,000 kcal to prevent weight gain. In addition, iron and protein needs increase as girls begin the menstruation cycle and boys begin to develop lean muscle mass. Got milk? Because bone growth is so critical during adolescence, teens need to ensure the proper intake of calcium and vitamin D. Starting in the preteen years through adolescence, daily calcium intakes should be between 1,200 and 1,500 mg/day. To achieve adequate levels, they need to consume at least three servings of calcium-fortified foods per day. Thus, it is important for providers to ask teens if they regularly consume dairy foods or other calcium- containing foods such as broccoli, spinach, tofu, or legumes. Teens continue to select their own meals and form food preferences, making it even more important for parents to offer nutritionally balanced snacks and meals that will become lifelong choices for teens. Sleep and rest Sleep requirements increase slightly from the school-age years because of physical growth spurts and high activity levels in adolescents. Use 'em or lose 'em Sleep needs vary from person to person, but teens require at least 8 hours of sleep each night, and those 8 hours can't be made up or stored. Therefore, \"catch-up\" sleep on the weekends isn't effective in replenishing a teen's sleep store. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 137 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Sometimes, it makes me feel socially isolated and depressed.Exercise Physical fitness and exercise are important for several health-related reasons. With adolescent obesity on the rise in the United States, regular aerobic exercise can help main- tain a healthy weight and prevent excessive gain. It also promotes a healthy cardiovascular system by reducing and preventing high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia. Running from depression Physical fitness may also help prevent periods of depression and help foster relationships between peers that have common sports activities. Dental hygiene Good dental hygiene should consist of brushing at least twice daily, flossing once daily, and professional clean-ings twice per year. Teens should avoid snacks with high sucrose levels and sticky candies that could cause dental caries. Coping with concerns Adolescents and their parents are typically faced with a range of concerns that may be intensified by the teen's need for peer approval and his desire to assert his independence. Acne During adolescence, acne is caused by blockage of follicles as a result of excessive sebum or bacteria. Acne has been associated with hormones due to the prevalence of flare- ups during a girl's premenstrual period. Acne is found primarily on the face but can also appear on the chest and back. It's usually seen by the naked eye and treated with topical agents or antibiotics for inflamma- tory lesions. No laughing matter Acne can be devastating during this time of life when appear- ance is of the utmost concern. Even mild to moderate acne can have lasting negative effects on self-esteem and a teen's ability and willingness to develop friendships and other relationships. In severe cases, embarrassment and isolation can lead to depression. For these reasons, acne should be considered a serious problem that warrants intervention rather than a \"phase\" that a teen should simply \"wait to grow out Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 138 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd Kluwer.

For health reasons, such as risk of hepatitis C, piercings and tattoos should be performed by an experienced, licensed person. It's important not to pass judgment on the teen who chooses to get a tattoo or piercing. Rather, consider his choice an opportunity to provide education on the subject which, in turn, helps the teen make an informed decision. Cigarette smoking Cigarette smoking among teens is reaching epidemic proportions; 1 out of 4 high school seniors have smoked cigarettes in the past month; 1 out of 10 adolescent males use smokeless tobacco. Ac- cording to the American Lung Association, nearly 5,000 teenagers will start smoking on any given day, with close to 2,000 of those teens becoming routine smokers. Dangling the bait Peer influence and family practices have a tremendous influence on teen smoking. Teens may start smoking to \"look cool\" or \"fit in\" with their peer groups, despite their knowledge of the deadly health consequences. Tobacco companies have been involved in court battles in an attempt to defend their advertising practices. Those opposing the large manufacturers claim that marketing programs unfairly target teens as potential smokers. A slippery slope Tobacco use can be associated with increasingly risky behaviors, such as alcohol use, drug use, and experimenting with sexual con-duct. The American Lung Association has instituted a voluntary program in the public school systems that uses peer counseling to educate teens on the dangers and health consequences of smoking. Injury prevention When a child reaches school age, he's no longer under his parents' constant supervision. Because of this unfamiliar freedom, school-age children and adolescents can sustain a range of serious, some- times life-threatening, injuries. Firearms Firearm safety is a major concern due to the teen's belief that \"it won't happen to me.\" Their curiosity about how a gun operates could have deadly consequences. Parents should educate teens on the safe use of a firearm but always practice safe gun storage. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 139 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 139 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.140MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Driving plus drugs or alcohol equals disaster. Sometimes, those words mean more when they come from a nurse.A loaded gun should never be stored in the home, and the ammuni- tion and unloaded gun should be securely stored in separate areas. Parents should consider using trigger locks on their firearms. Motor vehicle accidents Motor vehicle accidents are one of the leading causes of death among teens. During the late teen years, the adolescent is, by law, \"ready\" to get a driver's license. However, with greater privilege comes increased responsibility. Nurses can prevent motor vehicle accidents through education. Teens may be reluctant to listen to their parents but may engage in a conversation with another trusted authority figure. Will parallel parking be on the final exam? State law requires teens to pass written and practical driving tests before being issued a temporary driver's license. Most states and some public high schools offer driver education classes as part of their curriculum. Some states have graduated drivers' licenses for new teen drivers. New drivers typically must pass through three stages in order to receive their full driver's license: obtaining a learner's permit, progression to a probationary license, and the proceeding to a full driver's license. Graduated drivers' licenses often limit nighttime, expressway, and unsupervised driving dur-ing early stages. The restrictions lift with time, concluding with the teen receiving a full driver's license. Texting while driving Distracted driving leads to accidents. Unfortunately, about 44% of teens 16 years old or older report texting while driving, and of these teens, they had a higher incidence of infrequent seat belt use, riding with a driver who has been drinking, and drinking and driving themselves than those teens who did not text while driving. Buckled up for safety A teen should be shown that wearing a seat belt, no matter what seat he's in, can drastically reduce the risk of life- threatening injuries in the event of an accident. He should also be encouraged to use a hel- met when operating such motor vehicles as a motorcycle and a moped. A deadly mix Perhaps the greatest emphasis should be placed on educating the adolescent about the risks of mixing driving with alcohol or drug use. Not only is the combination illegal, but it also impairs the driver's judgment and could have deadly consequences.

Sports injuries are less common in team sports.Risk-taking behaviors Teenagers are still maturing, both cognitively and emotionally. A lack of maturity may lead them to take unwise chances in an attempt to be accepted by their peers. Risky business Teens have an \"it can't happen to me\" attitude and feel they're invincible. They may take risks to seek attention from others because of failures in school, rejection by peers, neglect at home, or a combination of these factors. A teen tends to be less of a risk taker if he has established autonomy and respects his parents and other authority figures. Sports injuries Although there's the potential for injury in any sport, most inju- ries occur during recreational sporting events rather than during organized competitions. Serious injuries are generally more com- mon during recreational and individual sports. In any case, although injuries are usually random events, the risk of injury can be de- creased by improving playing conditions, demanding compliance with rules and pro- tective equipment, and providing diligent coaching and supervision. Injury protection The nurse can help prevent sports injuries through education about safety equipment and potential risk. Teens need to be encouraged to use helmets when skateboarding or riding bicycles and snowmobiles. They should be encouraged to wear other protective equipment, such as pads and mouthguards, when playing contact sports. Slow down, you move too fast Because a teen's body is physically maturing, he needs to realize his own limitations to avoid straining or overextending himself until his body is more able to perform a physically challenging task. After experiencing an injury, a teen must be encouraged to follow rehabilitation instructions to prevent further injury or reinjury. Health problems Several serious health problems can affect school-age children and adolescents. Some of these problems may be life-threatening.

All Rights Reserved.142MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE A positive adult role model is the best antidote for negative peer influences.Alcohol and drug abuse Alcoholism is a chronic disorder most commonly described as the uncontrolled intake of alcoholic beverages. Psychoactive drug abuse and dependence is the use of illegal drugs or misuse of legal drugs, including narcotics, stimulants, depressants, antianxiety agents, and hallucinogens. Alcoholism and drug abuse impair physical and mental health, social and familial relationships, and the ability to uphold responsibilities related to school and jobs. It's old school Today, children aren't waiting until college, or even high school, to take a first drink of alcohol or \"experiment\" with drugs. Alcohol and drugs are readily available to school-age children, making substance abuse a problem of enormous proportions. What causes it Numerous biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors may cause alcoholism and drug abuse. Family background may play a significant role, as the child of one alcoholic parent is seven to eight times more likely to become an alcoholic than a peer without such a parent. P sychologically speaking Psychological factors that may cause alcohol or drug abuse may include:\u0081 inadequate coping skills, leading to the urge to reduce anxiety and tension through the use of substances \u0081 a desire to avoid responsibility\u0081 an inability to deal effectively with loneliness or boredom \u0081 a need to bolster self-esteem. Socioculturally speaking Sociocultural factors that may cause alcohol or drug abuse include: \u0081 the availability of alcohol and drugs\u0081 group or peer pressure \u0081 societal attitudes that condone alcohol or drug use. What to look for Substance abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of substance use (drug or alcohol) leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. This impairment or distress manifests as one or more of the following (occurring within a 12-month period): \u0081 recurrent substance use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 142 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 142 5/22/14 7:28 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.143HEALTH PROBLEMS \u0081 recurrent substance use in situations in which using the sub- stance is physically hazardous\u0081 recurrent substance-related legal problems \u0081 continued substance use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by or exacerbated by the effects of the substance. Ups and downs Chronic substance abusers may present with a variety of minor complaints, such as mood swings and depression, malaise, and an increased incidence of infection. Something smells fishy The effects on personal appearance include poor personal hygiene, unexplained injuries (such as cigarette burns), and nutri-tional deficiencies. I've got a secret The teen or child may be secretive about his disorder and may engage in suspicious behaviors, such as lying and stealing money, to support his habit. The school may report multiple, unexplained absences; poor classroom performance; and behavior pattern changes. When confronted about his behavior, he may deny the problem or become angry and violent toward others. Acute intoxication With acute alcohol or drug intoxication, look for one or any num- ber of the following:\u0081 decreased inhibitions \u0081 euphoria followed by depression or hostility \u0081 impaired judgment\u0081 incoordination\u0081 respiratory depression \u0081 slurred speech \u0081 unconsciousness\u0081 vomiting. What tests tell you Urine, blood, and saliva tests can confirm drug use and blood alcohol level, determine the amount and type of substance taken, and reveal complications. Complications Most body tissues can be adversely affected by the heavy intake of alcohol, and death can occur from abrupt alcohol withdrawal. (See Complications of alcohol abuse , page 144.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 143 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 143 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.144MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Chronic drug abuse, especially intravenous (I.V.) use, can lead to life-threatening complications, including: \u0081 cardiac and respiratory arrest, subacute hepatitis \u0081 tetanus, septicemia, and malaria\u0081 malnutrition\u0081 trauma\u0081 depression, psychosis, and increased risk of suicide. How it's treated Treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse must be long-term and requires the support of the child's parents and other significant people in his life. Alcohol abuse Total abstinence from alcohol is the only effective treatment for alcoholism. Participation in supportive programs, including Alcoholics Anonymous and Ala-Teen, may produce favorable Complications of alcohol abuse Alcohol can damage body tissues by its direct irritating effects, changes that take place in the body during its metabolism, aggravation of existing disease, accidents occurring during intoxication, and interactions between the alcohol and drugs. Such tissue damage can lead to a range of complications, including those listed below. Cardiopulmonary complications\u0081 Cardiac arrhythmias\u0081 Cardiomyopathy\u0081 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u0081 Essential hypertension\u0081 multiple substances\u0081 Suicide Other complications \u0081 Beriberi\u0081 Hypoglycemia\u0081 Leg and foot ulcers\u0081 Prostatitis\u0081 Fetal alcohol syndrome (from alcoholism while pregnant) Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 144 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 144 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

The recovering individual must also be able to fill the niche once occupied by alcohol with something constructive. Symptom support Acute intoxication is treated symptomatically by:\u0081 supporting respiration\u0081 preventing aspiration of vomitus \u0081 replacing fluids \u0081 initiating emergency treatment for trauma, infection, and GI bleeding. Drug abuse Treatment of drug dependence commonly involves a triad of care: detoxification, short- and long-term rehabilitation, and aftercare (meaning a lifetime of abstinence). Aftercare is usually aided by participation in Narcotics Anonymous or a similar self-help group. Slowly but surely The teen with acute drug intoxication should receive symptomatic treatment based on the drug ingested. Detoxification with the same drug or a pharmacologically similar drug may be necessary. Depending on the dosage and the time elapsed since ingestion, additional treatment may include gastric lavage, induced emesis, activated charcoal, or forced diuresis. What to do \u0081 Be alert for potential alcohol and drug abuse problems. Ask the teen about his own use of substances and about his friends' usage. Ensure confidentiality, and ask questions and provide information in a straightforward manner to promote an open discussion. \u0081 Be aware of signs and symptoms of intoxification with alcohol and commonly used drugs so you'll be prepared to identify them if seen in a patient. During an acute intoxication: \u0081 Continuously monitor the patient's vital signs.\u0081 Observe for complications of overdose and withdrawal, such as cardiopulmonary arrest, seizures, and aspiration. When the party's over After an acute intoxication: \u0081 Refer the patient for detoxification and rehabilitation as appropriate, and provide a list of available community resources, including meeting times and places for Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.\u0081 Refer parents of a child in crisis to an organization such as Parents Anonymous.

There's always a fat person in my mirror. Bulimia Bulimia is defined as regular episodes of binge eating, followed by self-induced vomiting, strict dieting or fasting, vigorous exercise, or taking laxatives or diuretics. The condition usually begins in adolescence or early childhood and may coexist with anorexia nervosa. The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Signs and symptoms \u0081 Alternating episodes of binge eating and purging\u0081 Thin or slightly overweight build\u0081 Use of diuretics or laxatives\u0081 Vomiting\u0081 Reports of abdominal and epigastric pain, amenorrhea, and painless swelling of the salivary glands\u0081 Hoarse and irritated voice\u0081 Calluses on the knuckles from vomiting (Russell's sign)\u0081 Anxiety and avoidance of conflict\u0081 Extreme need for approval\u0081 Guilt and self-disgust\u0081 Constant preoccupation with food\u0081 Preoccupation with exer-cise (and excessive exercise) Key test findings The Beck Depression Inven- tory may reveal depression; an Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) may suggest an eating disor-der. Metabolic acidosis may occur from diarrhea caused by enemas and excessive laxative use. Metabolic alkalosis (the most common metabolic complication) may occur from frequent vomiting. Laboratory tests reveal elevated bicarbonate, decreased potassium, and decreased sodium levels. Bulimia complications \u0081 Dental caries\u0081 Erosion of tooth enamel and gum infections\u0081 Increased risk of esopha- geal tears, gastric rupture, and mucosal damage to the intestines\u0081 Life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or sudden death Treating bulimia \u0081 Inpatient or outpatient therapy \u0081 Self-help inhibitors, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine\u0081 Monitor the patient for signs of depression or impend- ing suicide.\u0081 Encourage family members to seek professional help whether or not the patient does so. Anorexia nervosa Anorexia nervosa is a disorder that involves voluntary refusal to eat, accompanied by a severe loss of body weight without an organic cause. It results from a distorted, unrealistic per- ception of body size, weight, and food intake. It may coexist with bulimia. (See Bulimia .) The skinny on being skinny These perceptions override feelings of hunger, family members' threats or pleas to eat, and an intellec-tual (but not emotional) acknowledgement of the problem. Girl power? Although more than 90% of those with anorexia nervosa are adolescent girls and young women, the condition is Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 146 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 146 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.147HEALTH PROBLEMS increasingly appearing in males and has been diagnosed in chil- dren as young as age 7. By conservative estimates, 0.5% to 1% of females in late adoles- cence and early adulthood meet the diagnostic criteria. Over their entire lifetime, an estimated 0.5% to 3.75% of females will suffer from anorexia. What causes it The exact cause of anorexia nervosa is unknown; however, a num- ber of external and internal influences are thought to contribute to the disorder. These influences include: \u0081 societal attitudes that equate slimness with beauty \u0081 excessive pressure to achieve\u0081 dependence and independence issues\u0081 control issues \u0081 stress due to multiple responsibilities. Related risks Anorexia nervosa is a subconscious effort to exert personal control over life or to protect oneself from dealing with issues surrounding sexuality. Several risk factors have been identified, including: \u0081 low self-esteem \u0081 compulsive personality\u0081 history of sexual abuse\u0081 high, sometimes unrealistic, achievement goals (set by the per- son at risk or by parents or other authority figures). How it happens Decreased caloric intake depletes body fat and protein stores. In adolescent girls and women, estrogen deficiency occurs be-cause the stress on the body diminishes the production of LH and FSH, resulting in amenorrhea. In adolescent boys and in men, testosterone levels fluctuate, resulting in reduced erectile function and a reduction in sperm count. Ketoacidosis occurs from increased use of body fat as energy. What to look for When anorexia nervosa is suspected, look for: \u0081 emaciated or skeleton-like appearance, not regarded by the teen as being abnormal or undesirable \u0081 evidence of secret dieting \u0081 lack of satisfaction with weight loss (constantly setting new, lower weight goals)\u0081 body image distortion (weight, size, shape) Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 147 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 147 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.148MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE A child or teen with anorexia nervosa may exercise to excess.Cold, constipated, weak, and absent \u0081 possible reported symptoms, including cold intolerance, low blood pressure, low pulse rate, and abdominal pain\u0081 GI symptoms such as constipation or laxative dependence \u0081 muscle weakness, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias \u0081 emaciated appearance with dry skin and lanugo hair over back and extremities\u0081 amenorrhea (absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles when otherwise expected to occur), fatigue, loss of libido, and infertility\u0081 cognitive distortions, such as overgeneralization, or dichotomous thinking (black or white, good or bad, all or nothing)\u0081 compulsive behavior such as excessive exercising \u0081 dependency on others for self-worth Guilty, impaired, and needing to please \u0081 guilt associated with eating \u0081 impaired decision-making\u0081 need to achieve and please others \u0081 overly compliant attitude \u0081 perfectionist attitude\u0081 obsessive rituals concerning food and a preoccupation with food preparation \u0081 refusal to eat and to maintain or achieve normal weight for age and height\u0081 intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight. What tests tell you All criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition, Text Revision must be met for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. (See Diagnosing anorexia nervosa .) In addition, findings from an EAT performed on a patient with anorexia nervosa suggest an eating disorder, and an electrocar-diogram (ECG) reveals nonspecific ST interval, prolonged PR interval, and T wave changes. Other findings include: \u0081 low estrogen levels in female patients\u0081 low testosterone levels in male patients\u0081 low hemoglobin levels and low platelet and white blood cell counts\u0081 elevated blood urea nitrogen\u0081 2015 Wolters Kluwer. Complications \u0081 electrolyte imbalances\u0081 chronic malnutrition \u0081 acute dehydration \u0081 esophageal erosion, ulcers, tears, and bleeding\u0081 tooth and gum erosion and dental caries\u0081 decreased left ventricular muscle mass and chamber size \u0081 decreased cardiac output and hypotension \u0081 ECG changes\u0081 increased susceptibility to infection\u0081 anemia. How it's treated Medical management includes behavior modification and group, family, or individual psychotherapy with a clinician who specializes in disordered eating. Teens should be placed on a well- balanced diet with a normal eating pattern and vitamin supplements. However, a rapid weight gain should be avoided due to the potential for severe metabolic abnormalities. Bring out the troops Drug therapy may include antianxiety agents, such as lorazepam and alprazolam; antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and such as parox- etine and fluoxetine.Diagnosing anorexia nervosa According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition criteria, to be diag- nosed as having anorexia nervosa, a person must display:\u0081 persistent restriction of energy intake leading to signifi- cantly low body weight (in context of what is minimally expected for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health)\u0081 either an intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (even though significantly low weight)\u0081 disturbance in the way one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body shape and weight on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Subtypes of anorexia nervosa There are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa: restricting, in which a patient hasn't regularly engaged in binge-eating or purging (self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas) during the current episode of the disorder binge-eating or purging, in which the patient has regularly engaged in binge-eating or purging during the current episode.

All Rights Reserved.150MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Hospitalization may be as brief as 2 weeks or more than 2 years. Many clinical centers now have inpatient and outpatient programs designed specifically to manage eating disorders. What to do Early recognition is key. Young people need to be aware of the seriousness of this type of self-imposed disease. Positive, early interventions include: \u0081 teaching coaches, teachers, and parents to recognize early signs \u0081 supporting the teen's efforts to achieve her target weight and helping to negotiate adequate food intake in a relaxed, nonpuni-tive treatment atmosphere. Express for success Long-term success involves helping the teen identify coping mechanisms for dealing with anxiety and encouraging the teen to express her feelings without fear of reprisal or judgment. In addition, the nurse should: \u0081 Provide a specific goal-oriented plan that can be followed consistently.\u0081 Encourage early family therapy, which is most effective when it's started soon after the diagnosis is made. \u0081 Foster an open, honest therapeutic relationship with the ado-lescent, yet be firm to counteract manipulative behavior; behavior modification therapy may be helpful to decrease the adolescent's manipulative behavior. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavior problem characterized by difficulty in focusing attention; difficulty engaging in quiet, passive activities; or both. It's possible to have attention deficit without hyperactivity. One in every classroom . . . ADHD affects roughly 3% to 5% of school-age children in the United States. This amounts to as many as 2 million children\u2014an average of one in every classroom. It affects at least twice as many boys as girls. . . . and in the office, too Until recently, experts thought that children outgrew ADHD by ado- lescence. We now know that many symptoms continue into adult-hood. In fact, the disorder affects approximately 2% to 4% of adults. To be diagnosed with ADHD, a child's behaviors must: \u0081 be present in two or more settings \u0081 begin before age 12\u0081 result in significant impairment in social or academic functioning.

There's limited evidence of a genetic component, and some studies suggest that it may result from altered neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Other theories point to a deficit within the right hemisphere of the brain or an alteration of the reticular activating system of the midbrain that causes the child to react to all stimulation, not just selected stimuli. How it happens Alleles of dopamine genes may alter dopamine transmission in the neural networks. During fetal development, bouts of hypoxia and hypotension could selectively damage neurons located in some of the critical regions of the anatomic networks. What to look for A child or adolescent with ADHD may exhibit several behaviors and difficulties, including:\u0081 climbing, running, or talking excessively \u0081 decreased attention span \u0081 difficulty organizing tasks and activities\u0081 difficulty waiting for turns or playing quietly\u0081 being easily distracted; failing to give close attention to school- work or to finish an activity \u0081 failing to listen when spoken to directly So many things to do . . . \u0081 fidgeting or squirming in his seat (being disruptive in the classroom)\u0081 frequent periods of forgetfulness (frequently losing things needed for tasks) \u0081 impulsive behavior\u0081 losing his temper easily\u0081 inability to follow directions. What tests tell you Complete psychological, medical, and neurologic evaluations must rule out other problems before an ADHD diagnosis can be made. To make the diagnosis, the findings are combined with data from several sources, including parents, teachers, and the child. (See Diagnosing ADHD , page 152.) Complications Complications of ADHD include emotional and social difficulties (which may be extreme) and poor nutrition. Children with ADHD may also be at increased risk of abuse because parents may become exasperated with the child's behavior and may become abusive out of frustration and exhaustion.

People with ADHD show a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with func- tioning or development: Inattention: Six or more symptoms of inattention for children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents age 17 and older and adults; symptoms of inattention have been present for at least 6 months, and they are inappro-priate for developmental level: \u0081 often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or with other activities\u0081 often has trouble holding attention on tasks or play activities\u0081 often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly\u0081 often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., loses focus, sidetracked) \u0081 often has trouble organizing tasks and activities\u0081 often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to do tasks that require mental effort over a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework)\u0081 often loses things necessary for tasks and activities (for example, school materials, pencils, books, tools, wal-lets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones)\u0081 is often easily distracted\u0081 is often forgetful in daily activities. Hyperactivity and impulsivity: Six or more symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity for children up to age 16, or five or more for adolescents age 17 and older and adults; symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for the person's developmental level : \u0081 often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat\u0081 often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected\u0081 often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may be limited to feel-ing restless)\u0081 often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly\u0081 is often \"on the go\" acting as if \"driven by a motor\"\u0081 often talks excessively\u0081 often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed\u0081 often has trouble waiting his or her turn\u0081 often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games). In addition, the following conditions must be met: \u0081 Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12 years. \u0081 Several symptoms are present in two or more setting (e.g., at home, school, or work; with friends or relatives; in other activities).\u0081 There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.\u0081 The symptoms do not happen only during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder, or a personality disorder). Based on the types of symptoms, three kinds (presen- tations) of ADHD can occur:Combined presentation : if enough symptoms of both criteria, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months Predominantly inattentive presentation : if enough symp- toms of inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation : if enough symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity but not inattention were present for the past 6 months.Because symptoms can change over time, the presen- tation may change over time as well.

All Rights Reserved.153HEALTH PROBLEMS Looking for the label In addition, the child may experience long-term difficulties at school because of being \"labeled\" with an ADHD diagnosis. Chil-dren with ADHD may also have adverse reactions to medications used to treat the disorder. How it's treated Medical management starts with behavior modification and psy- chological therapy. Interdisciplinary interventions include vision screening, hearing tests, and an assessment of specific learning needs. Pharmacologic therapy may include amphetamines, such as methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine, to help the child concentrate. What to do The child with ADHD and his parents need information and ongo- ing support:\u0081 Monitor the child's growth, especially if he's receiving methyl- phenidate (as growth may be slowed). \u0081 Give one simple instruction at a time so the child can success-fully complete the task (which promotes self-esteem). Meals matter \u0081 Because some ADHD medications may decrease children's ap- petite, educate parents to give medications before breakfast in the morning to ensure that children are receiving adequate calories. \u0081 Encourage adequate nutrition as medications and hyperactivity may increase nutrient needs.\u0081 Suggest that parents reduce environmental stimuli to decrease distraction, and formulate a schedule for the child to provide con- sistency and routine. Report and support \u0081 Suggest that teachers and coaches provide a daily report on the child's progress to ensure that rules given at the home are being reinforced in other environments. \u0081 Provide parents with information about support groups, such as local organizations and online groups. Obesity Obesity is an excess of body fat that's generally 20% or more above ideal body weight for a person's age and height. Obese adolescents increased from 5% in 1980 to 18% in Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 153 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.154MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Equality of the sexes In addition, boys and girls seem equally at risk for obesity in both age-groups (school-age boys, 16%; school-age girls, 14.5%; adoles-cent girls and boys, 15.5%). (See Obesity and minorities .) What causes it Obesity results when a person takes in or consumes more calories than he expends. Simply put, the child eats more calories than his body burns. Obesity in childhood and adolescence can be related to these factors: \u0081 sedentary lifestyle (couch-potato children due to increased television viewing and decreased physical activity) \u0081 overeating \u0081 poor eating habits\u0081 stressful changes or life events, such as divorce, death, moving, or abuse\u0081 low self-esteem\u0081 depression\u0081 family problems or problems with peers.Cultured pearls Obesity and minorities Although obesity seems to affect school-age and adolescent girls and boys equally, one recent study found rates of obesity in minorities to be significantly greater than in nonminority populations. School-age children In school-age children, the study found that Hispanic children (24%) were twice as likely as White children (12%) to be overweight. Black children had a slightly lower rate of obesity than Hispanic children (20%). Adolescents In adolescents, the rates remain higher for Blacks and Hispanics. About 24% in both groups were more likely to be overweight than White adolescents (13%). It starts early The study also found that preschool-age Black, Hispanic, and White children were more equal in their tendency to be overweight (8%, 11%, and 10%, respectively), which suggests that early teaching about healthy eating and exercise habits could be beneficial.

All Rights Reserved.155HEALTH PROBLEMS How it happens The etiology of obesity is complex and usually multifactorial. Theories to explain this condition include:\u0081 genetic predisposition \u0081 biological factors \u0081 psychological factors. Genetic predisposition Obesity in parents increases the probability of obesity in children. In fact, a child of parents with obesity has an 80% chance of hav-ing obesity as a child. A child who's obese between the ages of 10 and 13 has an 80% chance of becoming obese as an adult. Some contributors to the genetic disposition toward obesity include: \u0081 a body type that's predisposed to the accumulation of subcuta- neous fat (such as those with a rounded, soft body shape) \u0081 an inherited defect that interferes with the metabolic breakdown of fat\u0081 familial and cultural eating patterns and behaviors. Biological factors Certain diseases and endocrine and metabolic problems can con- tribute to childhood obesity. Underlying disease is attributed to only 5% of cases of childhood obesity. Such conditions as hypo- thyroidism, muscular dystrophy, Down syndrome, and spina bifida can cause accumulation of fat due to decreased metabolism or limited mobility. Endocrine and metabolic factors are complex. The relationships between feelings of hunger and satiety, the central nervous system, and the body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates, protein, and fat are still under investigation. Psychological factors Many children, as well as adults, eat in response to how they're feeling. Eating gives older children and adolescents a sense of well-being, satiety, and security\u2014feelings that were developed when they ate during infancy. However, for a child who's bored, tired, depressed, sad, or lonely, eating is his way of obtaining those warm, nurturing feel- ings; it becomes a comfort for him. In addition, parents may use food as a reward, or withhold it as punishment, furthering the child's misuse of food. What to look for Observation and comparison of height and weight to a standard table indicate obesity. A waist to hip ratio may be measured. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 155 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 155 5/22/14 7:28 PM Reserved.156MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Weight-loss diets and children aren't a good mix. Instead, the emphasis needs to be on maintaining current weight because they'll \"grow into it.\" Measurement of the thickness of subcutaneous fat folds with calipers provides an approximation of total body fat. What tests tell you Body mass index can be calculated by dividing a person's weight by the square of his height. This number can be compared to normal values on standardized graphs to diagnose progressive levels of obesity. Complications Obesity may lead to serious complications, such as respiratory difficulties, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes melli-tus, and renal disease as well as psychosocial difficulties, includ- ing emotional taunts from peers. How it's treated Weight-loss diets may not be the answer for children and adolescents because of their nutritional needs during a time of rapid growth. Instead, it's recommended that the child be helped to maintain his current weight while allowing for his stature to continue growing. The child, in effect, outgrows his obesity (this isn't necessarily the case with adolescents). Although restrictive diets aren't the normal treatment, dietary changes can have significant results. Suggestions include:\u0081 avoiding fast-food establishments\u0081 providing low-fat alternatives for after-school snacks\u0081 switching from whole milk to skim milk\u0081 exchanging fresh vegetables for fried snack foods \u0081 offering a variety of fresh and dried fruits. What to do When providing care to a child or adolescent with obesity: \u0081 Obtain an accurate dietary history to identify the child's eating patterns and determine the importance of food to his lifestyle. \u0081 Encourage the child and parents to adhere to the prescribed dietary meal plan to help ensure a successful outcome.\u0081 Suggest low-calorie, low-fat snacks such as fresh fruits and vegetables. \u0081 Encourage parents to avoid overfeeding their children and discourage the use of food as a reward for good behavior.

All Rights Reserved.157HEALTH PROBLEMS \u0081 Promote physical activities, such as involvement in organized sports teams and individual events, and a personalized exercise program. Vim and vigor Children with obesity or normal weight should be encouraged to participate in some type of daily, vigorous, aerobic activity to help reduce or prevent childhood obesity and to promote a habit of daily exercise that will last a lifetime. Sexually transmitted infections An important group of sex-related disorders results from infection that are transmitted through sexual contact include:\u0081 HIV or HIV/AIDS infections (STIs) are among the most prevalent infections around the world. Gonorrhea, chlamydial infections, and genital warts are approaching epidemic propor- tions in the United States. In the past 10 years, between one-fifth and one-third of all reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis affect adolescents and young adults up to age 24. What causes it The cause of an STI may be bacterial, viral, or parasitic. (See Common STIs , page 158.) How it happens STIs are passed from one person to another through anal, oral, or vaginal sexual contact. The rate of transmission and, there-fore, the incidence of these diseases, is rising because of societal attitudes toward sex (such as those that condone multiple sexual partners), a lack of health promotion (for condom use or abstinence), and increased reporting of new cases. When STIs are diagnosed in children who are school-age or younger, child abuse must be investigated. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 157 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 157 5/22/14 7:28 PM 2015 Kluwer.

All Rights Reserved.159HEALTH PROBLEMS Reassure the child that you're there to help and that nothing that has happened is his fault.What to look for Symptoms vary depending on the infectious organism, and symptoms of a particular STI may vary by gender. Some classic symptoms of STIs include: \u0081 pain during urination \u0081 vaginal or penile discharge\u0081 growths that appear on the genitalia and sores on the mouth or genitalia \u0081 evidence of sexual abuse, such as vaginal tears, vaginal bruising, blood in the child's underwear, and difficulties void-ing. (Never assume that a child of any age, including a teen, has acquired an STI by consensual sexual contact.) What tests tell you A sexual history provides the basis for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of an STI. The physical assessment, primarily a diagnostic tool, can also serve as an excellent opportunity for patient teaching. I.D. the STI To help identify the infectious organism, an appropriate urine test may be ordered (for gonorrhea and chlamydia) or the sus-pected lesion is cultured with the appropriate culture method: \u0081 A genital tract specimen from a male should contain urethral discharge or prostatic fluid.\u0081 From a female, the specimen should contain urethral or cervical specimens. \u0081 Two swabs should always be collected simultaneously. Privacy is paramount Keep in mind that examinations of this kind can be extremely difficult and embarrassing for school-age children and teens. Procedures should be explained thoroughly and as much privacy as possible should be provided. Complications Complications that are common to all STIs include emotional stress, male or female infertility, ectopic pregnancies, and even death. How it's treated STIs may be treated with oral or I.M. antibiotics and antiviral medications. They're also treated symptomatically with analgesics and antipyretics. Some infections, such as herpes and HIV/AIDS, have no known cure. Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd 159 Meadows-Oliver_Ch05.indd PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.160MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE What to do Protection against and prevention of STIs should be the focus of nursing education. This information should be kept in mind when educating about STIs: \u0081 Abstinence is the safest way to ensure that teens stay healthy. \u0081 Although sex education and handing out condoms in public schools remain controversial, the use of latex condoms for those who are sexually active could protect a teen from acquir- ing an STI. \u0081 Teens should be strongly encouraged to seek medical treat-ment immediately if they suspect that they have contracted an STI.\u0081 If approached by a teen about treatment, remain nonjudgmental and try to address all of his concerns.\u0081 Urge the teen to inform sexual contacts of his or her infection so he or she can receive medical treatment, and stress the impor- tance of remaining abstinent until the completion of treatment. Suicide and attempted suicide Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to 24-year- olds and is commonly committed with a firearm. The rate of attempted suicides is higher in females, but males are three times as successful as females in their attempts. The highest suicide rate is in Native American males and Black females. What causes it One-third of those attempting suicide wish to die, whereas others seek to gain attention, communicate love or anger, or escape a dif-ficult or painful situation. What to look for Risk factors include:\u0081 interpersonal conflict or loss\u0081 family discord \u0081 legal or disciplinary problems \u0081 chronic drug or alcohol abuse\u0081 history of physical or sexual abuse\u0081 recent failure or disappointment \u0081 preoccupation with death \u0081 previous suicide attempt.

All Rights Reserved.161HEALTH PROBLEMS Advice from the experts Suicide warning signs During the patient interview, be alert for these signs of suicidal behavior:\u0081 overwhelming anxiety (the most frequent precipitant of a suicide attempt)\u0081 withdrawal and social isolation \u0081 signs and symptoms of depression, including crying, fatigue, helpless-ness, poor concentration, reduced interest in previously enjoyable activities, sadness, constipation, and weight loss\u0081 good-byes expressed to friends and family members\u0081 giving away prized possessions\u0081 covert suicide messages and death wishes\u0081 obvious suicide messages such as \"I'd be better off dead.\" compounded as he may be stigmatized by his peers or even by adults. The parents of an adolescent or child who commits suicide must deal with a range of emotions, including intense grief and guilt. Parents are also likely to feel guilty when an attempt is un-successful. They may become excessively protective of the child who made the attempt and of their other children. How it's treated Treatment for a suicide attempt is based on the underlying psychi- atric, emotional, or physical difficulty that led the child or adoles-cent to feel suicide was the only option. Immediate hospitalization without the adolescent's consent is warranted if threat of self-harm still exists. Treatment might also involve therapy (both group and individual), medications (such as tricyclic antidepressants), remediation of social and problem- solving deficits, and family conflict resolution. What to do To help deter potential suicide in the child or adolescent with major depression, the nurse should keep certain guidelines in mind. (See Suicide prevention guidelines , page 162.)

All Rights Reserved.162MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE Advice from the experts Suicide prevention guidelines To help deter potential suicide in the patient with major depression, keep the following guidelines in mind. Assess for clues Watch for such clues as:\u0081 communicating suicidal thoughts, threats, and mes-sages and talking about death and feelings of futility\u0081 hoarding medication\u0081 giving away prized possessions\u0081 describing a suicide plan\u0081 changing behavior, especially as depression begins to lift. Provide a safe environment Check patient areas and correct dangerous conditions, such as:\u0081 exposed pipes\u0081 windows without safety glass\u0081 access to the roof or open balconies. Remove dangerous objects Remove potentially dangerous objects from the patient's environment, such as:\u0081 belts\u0081 razors\u0081 suspenders\u0081 light and window cords\u0081 glass\u0081 knives or guns\u0081 nail files and clippers.Consult with staff Include the health care team in aspects of care and be sure to:\u0081 recognize and document both verbal and nonverbal suicidal behaviors \u0081 keep the doctor informed and share data with all staff\u0081 clarify the patient's specific restrictions\u0081 assess the patient's risk and plan for observation\u0081 clarify day and night staff responsibilities and frequency of consultation. Observe the suicidal patient Take some steps for easy observation of a suicidal patient, including: \u0081 being alert when the patient is using a sharp object (shaving), taking medication, or using the bathroom (to prevent hanging or other injury)\u0081 assigning the patient to a room near the nurses' station and with another patient\u0081 continuously monitoring the acutely suicidal patient. Maintain personal contact Help the patient remain in contact with his environment by:\u0081 reassuring the suicidal patient that he's not alone or without resources or hope \u0081 encouraging continuity of care and consistency of primary nurses\u0081 helping the patient build emotional ties to others (the ultimate technique for preventing suicide).

Infection can cause numerous illnesses during childhood, most of which are common, but some of which are less common or even rare. The severity of illness caused by infection can range from subclinical to life-threatening. A thorough understanding of the etiology and symptoms of infectious diseases as well as the ap- propriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions will help the nurse provide optimal care. Chain of infection Chain of infection is a term used to describe the circle of links needed for the transmission of infectious diseases Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 165 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 165 5/22/14 7:33 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.166INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS I may look healthy during the incubation period, but I'm already giving my infection to my mom, my brother, and my bratty little sister.in humans. All links must be present and in order for an infection to occur. The chain begins with a pathogen that's capable of producing disease in humans, that is, bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasite. The reservoir of an infectious agent. This is where the infec- tious agent will grow. Humans are the most common reservoir. Other reservoirs include the environment, hospital settings, water supply, and rodents or animals. The third link in the chain is the portal of exit. The pathogen leaves the reservoir via mucus, blood, or feces. The organism is transmitted from one host to another. The fifth link in the chain is the portal of entry (the site where disease transmission occurs), through which a pathogen can enter the body by penetrating the skin or a mucous membrane barrier by direct contact or ingestion. The last link is the host; a susceptible host is necessary for an infectious disease to be transmitted. Immature immunity Infants and children are susceptible to infectious diseases because their immune systems are immature. As children mature and grow, their exposure to infectious agents increases and they develop an- tibodies naturally. Subsequent infections with the same pathogen may be less severe or avoided completely. Stages of infection Infections follow a predictable sequence of events during transmission that results in five distinct stages of disease. The incubation period is the phase during which the pathogenic organism begins active reproduction in the host; the child has no clinical symptoms but may be contagious to others during this time. The prodromal phase is the initial appearance of clinical symptoms in the host; common symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and rhinitis. During the acute stage , maximum symptoms are experi- enced by the host; toxins deposited by the pathogenic or- ganism can produce tissue damage. (Inflammatory changes and tissue damage can also occur as a result of the immune response of the host.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 166 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 166 5/22/14 7:33 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.167IMMUNE PROTECTION The convalescent stage is characterized by progressive elimi- nation of the infection (or elimination of the pathogen), healing of damaged tissue, and symptom resolution. The resolution stage is the host's recovery from the infection without residual signs or symptoms of disease. Cover your mouth, please The period of communicability is the time when the infectious organism may move from the infected host to another person. It varies with different disease states but usually begins during the incubation phase. Immune protection Children receive protection from infectious diseases naturally and artificially. Methods of obtaining immune protection There are five different methods in which immune protection can be obtained: natural immunity, naturally acquired active immunity, naturally acquired passive immunity, artificially acquired active immunity, and artificially acquired passive immunity. Natural (innate) immunity Innate immunity is a combination of natural and nonspecific immunity that can protect the human body from pathogens and foreign agents. For example, the phagocytic action of white blood cells (macrophages) may be triggered by the body's innate ability to recognize and distinguish normal cells from foreign cells. The body's ability to distinguish self from non-self is natural, or innate, immunity. Naturally acquired active immunity Naturally acquired active immunity is obtained when the body's immune system responds to a specific pathogen. Antibodies and memory cells prevent or reduce the severity of subsequent infection with that specific pathogen. Naturally acquired active immunity persists for many years. Naturally acquired passive immunity Naturally acquired passive immunity involves mother-to-fetus transmission of maternal antibodies. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 167 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 167 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.168INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS A gift keeps on giving . . . The mother's immunoglobulin G crosses the placenta and is transmitted to the fetus. After birth, the infant can receive passive immunity through maternal antibodies in breast milk. . . . for up to 2 months Naturally acquired passive immunity differs from active im-munity. Although active immunity lasts many years, or even a lifetime, passive immunity lasts only as long as the antibod- ies remain in the blood of the fetus or infant (usually from a few weeks to about 2 months). Even so, some antibodies transferred across the placenta have been isolated up to age 1 year, which is why measles immunization must be delayed until age 15 months. Artificially acquired active immunity Artificially acquired active immunity is achieved by deliberate administration of a vaccine or toxoid. The vaccine or toxoid stimulates the immune system's production of antibodies against a specific antigen, but symptoms of the disease aren't produced in the person receiving the vaccine. Artificially acquired passive immunity Artificially acquired passive immunity is conferred when antibod- ies developed in another person or animal donor are injected into an individual. In pediatric patients, this transfer usually involves intravenous (I.V.) administration of a specific immunoglobulin, or antisera . Examples include: \u0081 gamma globulin (a mixture of antibodies against prevalent com-munity diseases, pooled from 1,000 human plasma donors) \u0081 hyperimmune or convalescent serum globulin (such as tetanus antitoxin, hepatitis B immune globulin, and varicella-zoster immune globulin). Types of immunizations Various immunizations are given at specific times to protect pedi- atric patients from certain diseases. These vaccines fall into two general categories: \u0081 live, attenuated vaccines \u0081 inactivated vaccines. Live, attenuated Live, attenuated vaccines are created from a live organism that's grown under suboptimal conditions to produce a live vaccine with reduced virulence. Hey, Mom\u2014 got milk? If you do, I'll have at least a few more weeks of passive immunity once I get out of here. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 168 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 168 5/22/14 7:33 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.169IMMUNE PROTECTION Weak but stimulating Thus, an attenuated immunization contains weakened micro- organisms and stimulates immune response and production of antibodies in the host. The vaccine confers 90% to 95% protection for more than 20 years with a single dose. Measles, mumps, and rubella\u2014itch, ouch Examples of live, An inactivated, or killed , vaccine confers a weaker response than a live vaccine, necessitating frequent boosters.\u0081 An inactivated vaccine doesn't promote replication and provides 40% to 70% protection. Toxoids Some bacteria, such as diphtheria, produce toxins, which cause disease. The vaccine to prevent a disease caused by a toxin is called a toxoid . A toxoid: \u0081 is another form of an inactivated vaccine \u0081 is a toxin that has been specially treated with formalin or heat to weaken its toxic effect but retain its antigenicity\u0081 provides 90% to 100% protection by stimulating the production of antibodies. Inactive but popular Examples of inactivated vaccines include: (IPV) \u0081 pertussis vaccine \u0081 hepatitis B vaccine. Immunization schedule Childhood immunizations include the hepatitis A and B vaccines, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, influenza vaccine, IPV vaccine, meningococcal vaccine, 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV). These immunizations are usually given according to a pre- determined schedule. (See Recommended immunization schedule for children , page 170.)

Before immunization \u0081 Obtain a history of allergic responses, especially life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to antibiotics or past vaccinations (certain vaccinations may be contraindicated in these children).\u0081 Assess the child for moderate or severe illness. Vac-cinations may be delayed in these children until they recover. However, a child with a minor illness, such as a cold, may receive immunizations. \u0081 Keep in mind that children receiving corticosteroids for longer than 2 weeks, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; those with human immunodeficiency virus infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or another disease that affects the immune system; and those with cancer will need special consideration for vaccination. (They may not be able to receive live virus vaccines, such as MMR, rotavirus, or varicella vaccines.) After immunization \u0081 Tell the parents to watch for and report reactions other than local swelling and pain and mild tempera-ture elevation.\u0081 Give parents the child's immunization record. 2013 general vaccine recommendations At right are the 2013 general vaccine recommenda-tions approved by the Advisory Committee on Immuni-zation Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.Age Immunization Birth Hepatitis B #1 1 to 4 months Hepatitis B 18 months Hepatitis B #3, IPV #312 PCV months DTaP #4, Hepatitis A #2 (6 months after (2 months HPV #3 (6 months after first dose)MCV #2 if first dose between 13 and 15 yearsInfluenza annual starting at 6 months of ageTd every 10 years starting after last Tdap Key: DTaP: and tetanus 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Hepatitis A vaccine Hepatitis A is recommended for all children starting at 12 months of age. It is also recommended for people at risk for acquiring hepatitis A. These people include: \u0081 people who live in endemic areas \u0081 military personnel or others traveling to high-risk areas of the world\u0081 persons at high risk (Native Americans, Alaskan natives, those with chronic liver disease, homosexual or bisexual adolescent males, or users of injectable and illicit drugs). Dosing This vaccine is a series of two doses given starting at age 12 months; the two doses should be administered at least 6 months apart. Children 12 months to 18 years of age receive two doses of 0.5 ml (given at least 6 months apart). Those 19 years and older receive 1 ml given intramuscularly (I.M.) (at least 6 months apart). (See Tips for pediatric injections , page 172.) Adverse reactions Adverse reactions to the hepatitis A vaccine are rare. Administra- tion is contraindicated for those with febrile illness or bleeding disorders. Hepatitis B vaccine Acquired during childhood or adolescence, hepatitis B can cause acute illness, with anorexia, jaundice, diarrhea, vomiting, and fa-tigue. It can also have fatal long-term consequences from cirrhosis or liver cancer. The virus that causes hepatitis B can be spread by: \u0081 passing of the virus from an infected mother to her infant during birth\u0081 having unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person \u0081 I.V. drug abuse or accidental needle-stick injuries \u0081 exposure to infected blood or body fluids. Hepatitis B vaccine is indicated for infants, children, and ado- lescents to prevent hepatitis B. Dosing Various vaccine formulations are available in different strengths.

Minimizing trauma To most toddlers and preschoolers, and to many older children, the prospect of getting an injection is the most frightening part of a doctor's visit or even a hospitalization. Many strategies, including those outlined in the follow- ing texts, can be used to reduce the trauma of receiving an injection, while establishing trust between the child and the health care team and making future injections easier for the child (and for the nurse who's giving the injection). Medicine to keep you healthy \u0081 Give the child a simple, age-appropriate explanation for why the injection is being given. When a child is being vaccinated, that explanation might be, \"This shot will give you medicine to keep you from getting sick.\" (Young chil-dren may think an injection is being given as a punishment and may not even realize that medication is being given.)\u0081 Allow the child to give a \"shot\" to a doll or stuffed animal; this gives him a sense of control, lets him see that the injection has a beginning and an end, and gives him a concrete understanding of what will happen. The best policy \u0081 Be honest; tell the child that it will hurt for a moment but that it will be over quickly. (Honesty promotes trust; if a nurse is honest about the potential for pain, the child will believe her when she tells him something won't hurt.) Coping and comfort \u0081 Give the child a coping strategy, such as squeezing his mother's hand, counting to five, singing a song, and look-ing away.\u0081 Have a parent hold and comfort the child while the injection is being given. A parent's presence reassures the child that nothing truly bad will happen. (The child may actually cry more when a parent is present, but this is because he feels safe enough to do so.) Praise and cover \u0081 When the injection has been given, tell the child that \"the hurting part\" is over, and praise him for what a good job he did (regardless of how he reacted). Never tell a child to \"be brave,\" to \"be a big boy,\" or not to cry, as these requests will set the child up for failure.\u0081 Give the child a bandage. (A young child may not believe the \"hurting part\" is over until a bandage has been applied.)\u0081 Always give injections in a designated treatment area. Avoid performing painful procedures in a playroom or, if possible, in the child's hospital room, because he needs to know there are places where he can feel completely safe. Giving the injection \u0081 Apply firm pressure at the site for 10 to 15 seconds immediately before giving the injection to decrease dis-comfort (a numbing patch may be used).\u0081 When two or more injections are needed, give them simultaneously in different extremities; have two or more nurses to assist (and provide manual restraint, if needed) during the procedures. (The child has only one painful experience when multiple injections are given simultane-ously; this is believed to be less traumatic than receiving painful injections one after the other.)\u0081 Apply bandages to each site, and immediately comfort and console the child following the injections.\u0081 Always keep resuscitation equipment and epinephrine readily available in case of an anaphylactic response to an immunization.

For older children and adolescents, the initial I.M. dose should be given as early as possible, with the second dose given 1 month later and the third dose given 6 months after the first dose. P ositive mom, extra ouch Before immunizing a neonate, check the results of the mother's hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test. If the mother is HBsAg-positive or her HBsAg status is unknown, the vaccine must be given within 12 hours of birth, along with hepatitis B immune globulin (also within 12 hours of birth) administered in two different sites. Adverse reactions Common reactions are pain and redness at the site of injection and elevated liver enzymes. Mild to moderate fever may occur (more common in children and adolescents than in adults). Ana- phylaxis is rare. DTaP vaccine The DTaP vaccine is given to protect infants and young children from acquiring diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The bacte-rium that causes diphtheria can create a toxin that damages tissue and attacks the heart and nerves. Such an attack can be fatal. Tetanus can cause muscle spasms that can interfere with breathing, which can lead to death. Pertussis is particu-larly dangerous for young children, especially infants youn- ger than age 1 year, who are most at risk for complications and death. Dosing The dosage for the DTaP vaccine is 0.5 ml given I.M. at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, for a total of five doses. The tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is given as a booster between ages 11 and 12 years and a tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster is then given at 10-year intervals. Adverse reactions Fever, fussiness, and anorexia are common adverse reactions as well as redness, pain, and swelling at the injection site. Redness, pain, and swelling at the injection site occur more commonly after the fourth or fifth dose in the DTaP series. Anaphylaxis, fever above 102\u00b0 F (38.9\u00b0 C), persistent crying for 3 hours or longer, and seizures are rare but severe reactions that require emergency treatment.

This infection can lead to severe invasive illnesses, including meningitis, epiglottitis, and pneumonia. Until recently, H. influenzae type B was the most common cause of meningitis in children older than age 1 month, but vaccination with the Hib vaccine has drastically reduced the incidence. Dosing The Hib vaccine dosage is 0.5 ml given I.M. for three or four doses. Schedules for different product preparations vary. (Refer to the manufacturer's guidelines and package inserts.) Three for P edvaxHIB . . . For the PedvaxHIB preparation, three total doses are recom-mended, with the first given at age 2 months, the second at age 4 months, and the third at ages 12 to 15 months. . . . Omni, Act get one dose more For other preparations, such as OmniHIB and ActHIB, four total doses are recommended, with the first given at age 2 months, the second at age 4 months, the third at age 6 months, and the fourth at ages 12 to 15 months. Adverse reactions Hib is one of the safest vaccines available because it causes only mild reactions, if any. Common adverse reactions are low-grade fever, localized pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. Anaphylaxis is rare. Human papillomavirus vaccine The HPV vaccine is available for boys and girls age 9 and older to protect against HPV, which is associated with increased risk for developing certain cancers. Dosing HPV vaccine is 0.5 ml administered in three doses I.M. The vac-cine series is usually offered around 11 to 12 years of age on a 0, 2-month, and 6-month schedule. Adverse reactions Side effects associated with the HPV vaccine include fainting and injuries associated with falling, dizziness, pain at site, fever, and nausea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend that patients sit or lie down for 15 minutes after the injection.

The live oral trivalent polio vaccine (OPV) is no longer used in the United States. Dosing The IPV dose is 0.5 ml administered subcutaneously (S.C.) at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, for a total of four doses. Adverse reactions Localized pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site are common adverse reactions, although IPV is safe and usually well tolerated. Anaphylaxis is rare. MMR vaccine The MMR vaccine stimulates immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella. Because the vaccine contains live virus, it's contra-indicated during pregnancy. Females shouldn't become pregnant within 1 month of immunization. Intact immunity required Live virus shouldn't be administered to anyone receiving immunosuppressive therapy or to those with immunodefi-ciency diseases. Dosing The MMR vaccine dose is 0.5 ml administered S.C. at ages 12 to 15 months and again at ages 4 to 6 years, for a total of two doses. Adverse reactions Common adverse reactions to the MMR vaccine are low-grade fever for 1 week after immunization; localized pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site; rash; and joint pain. Severe reactions are rare but include viral encepha- lopathy and anaphylaxis. Meningococcal vaccine The meningococcal vaccine prevents most types of meningococcal infections and is recommended for all adolescents age 11 to 18. Dosing The dose of meningococcal vaccine is given I.M. at ages 11 to 12 years and a booster should be given at 16 years of age. Patients receiving their first dose between the ages of 13 and 15 need a booster between 16 and 18 years of age. Adolescents receiving their first dose after age 16 do not require a booster dose.

It has been recommended that patients sit or lie down 15 minutes after the vaccine. Pneumococcal 13-valent for preventing and decreasing the severity of pneumo-coccal infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . These invasive infections can result in otitis media, pneumonia, meningi- tis, and sepsis, with the most serious illness occurring in children younger than age 2 years. Dosing The 0.5-ml dose of PCV13 is administered I.M. A total of four doses are recommended, with one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months. Adverse reactions Common adverse reactions from PCV are drowsiness, irritability, restless sleep, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and injec-tion site reactions (including swelling, redness, induration, inflam- mation, skin discoloration, and tenderness). Rotavirus vaccine The rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children younger than the age of 5 causing severe vomiting and watery diarrhea. Currently, there are two vaccines licensed in the United States to protect against rotavirus. Dosing The two vaccines RotaTeq and Rotarix are administered by mouth. RotaTeq is given in three doses at age 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Rotarix is administered at 2 and 4 months of age. The maximum age for the first dose is 14 weeks and 6 days, with the maximum age for the last dose in 8 months 0 days. Adverse reactions Common side effects from the rotavirus include irritability, mild diarrhea, or vomiting. A small but increased risk for developing intussusception has been noted after receiving the first dose of rotavirus vaccine. Varicella virus vaccine Varicella virus vaccine is used to stimulate immunity to vari- cella (chickenpox). The vaccine contains a live virus and Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 176 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 176 5/22/14 7:33 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It's also contraindicated in individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy and in those with immunodeficiency diseases. Dosing Two 0.5-ml doses of varicella virus vaccine (Varivax) are given S.C. between ages 12 and 18 months and between 4 and 6 years of age. Two for teens and teens for two . . . If patients did not receive varicella vaccine as a child, adolescents age 13 and older receive two doses; each dose is separated by a 4- to 8-week interval. Adverse reactions Common adverse reactions to the varicella virus vaccine are pain, redness, localized swelling, and varicella-like rash at the injection site. Low-grade fever and irritability for 1 week after vaccine administration are also common. Anaphylaxis is rare. Influenza vaccine Also known as the flu shot , the influenza vaccine is either an inactivated or killed vaccine or live, attenuated vaccine. Be- cause the influenza virus changes each year, the vaccine gets updated every year in an attempt to prevent the most common strains that are circulating at that time. Therefore, the influenza vaccine needs to be given yearly. Protection from the influenza virus should begin 2 weeks after the vaccination and may last for up to 1 year. Who gets it? The influenza vaccine is recommended for all children 6 months of age or older. Household contacts and caretakers of children younger than age 6 months or with a chronic health condition are encouraged to get the vaccine. Dosing The inactivated vaccine is administered I.M. once per year and is most effective when given early in the flu season, typically in October or November. For children younger than age 9 who are receiving the influenza vaccine for the first time, two doses are necessary and should be given 1 month apart. Children 6 to 35 months receive a dose of 0.25 ml and those 36 months and older receive a dose of 0.5 ml. There is an intranasal form of the influenza vaccine, which is a live, attenuated vaccine acceptable for healthy children ages 2 years and older.

All Rights Reserved.178INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Adverse reactions The influenza vaccine typically produces only mild adverse reactions, such as soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site; fever; or body aches. Such severe adverse effects as a life- threatening allergic reaction rarely occur. Contraindications to vaccine administration Mild illnesses and low-grade fevers that are common in children aren't contraindications to vaccine administration. However, there are several reasons to withhold or delay vaccine administration: \u0081 Vaccination is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe illness or a history of allergic response or anaphylaxis to the vaccine or certain antibiotics.\u0081 Vaccination with preparations containing live or attenuated viruses shouldn't be performed in patients who are pregnant, have an immunodeficiency disease, or are receiving immunosuppres-sive therapy.\u0081 The DTaP vaccine shouldn't be given to a child who has a progressive and active central nervous system (CNS) problem. However, a child with cerebral palsy can receive immunizations.\u0081 The measles vaccine shouldn't be given at the same time as a tuberculin purified protein derivative test. The measles vaccine can make a person who's positive for tuberculosis (TB) appear to be TB negative. Bacterial infections Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that break down dead tissue. They have no true nucleus and reproduce by cell division. Pathogenic bacteria contain cell-damaging proteins that cause infection. These proteins come in two forms: \u0081 exotoxins\u2014released during cell growth\u0081 endotoxins\u2014released when the bacterial cell wall decomposes. These endotoxins cause fever and aren't affected by antibiotics. (See How bacteria damage tissue .) A class by any other class Bacteria are classified several other ways, such as by their shape, growth requirements, motility, and whether they're aerobic (re-quiring oxygen) or anaerobic (not requiring oxygen). The young and the susceptible Bacterial infections are common in infants and young children who haven't achieved active immunity because their immune systems haven't been challenged by many pathogens. Such infections in Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 178 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 178 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Diphtheria Diphtheria is an acute, highly contagious, toxin-mediated infection that's preventable by vaccine. Diphtheria is rare in the United States but remains a serious problem in some other parts of the world. What causes it Diphtheria is caused by an infection of Corynebacterium diphthe- riae, a gram-positive rod that usually infects the respiratory tract (primarily the tonsils, nasopharynx, and larynx). It's more seri- ous when it occurs in infants because they have smaller airways, which are more susceptible to obstruction because of their size.How bacteria damage tissue The human body is constantly infected by bacteria and other infectious organisms. Some are beneficial, such as the intestinal bacteria that produce vitamins, and others are harmful, causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to life-threatening septic shock. Invading forces To infect a host, bacteria must first enter it. They do this by adhering to the mu-cosal surface and directly invading the host cell or attaching to epithelial cells and producing toxins, which invade host cells. I will survive To survive and multiply within a host, bacteria or their toxins adversely affect biochemical reactions in cells. The result is a disruption of normal cell func- tion, or cell death (shown below left). For example, the diphtheria toxin dam-ages heart muscle by inhibiting protein synthesis. In addition, as some organ-isms multiply, they extend into deeper tissue and eventually gain access to the bloodstream. Clot and deprive Some toxins cause blood to clot in small blood vessels. The tissues supplied by these vessels may be deprived of blood and may be damaged (shown below center). Bring down the walls Other toxins can damage the cell walls of small blood vessels, caus-ing leakage. This fluid loss results in decreased blood pressure, which, in turn, impairs the heart's ability to pump enough blood to vital organs (shown below right). Bacteria Toxins Body cells Damaged or dying cells Clot in blood vessel Toxins from bacteria Blood vessel Gaps in cell wall Toxins Fluid leaking into tissue Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 179 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 179 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.180INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS How it happens The infection is transmitted by: \u0081 contact with an infected patient's or carrier's nasal, pharyngeal, eye, or skin lesion discharge \u0081 contact with articles contaminated with the bacteria \u0081 ingestion of unpasteurized milk. Incubation and communicability The diphtheria incubation period is 2 to 7 days. The period of communicability is 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, or until 4 days after the initiation of antibiotic therapy. What to look for Symptoms of diphtheria include:\u0081 fever\u0081 malaise The infection, localized to the tonsils and posterior pharynx, is characterized by a thick, patchy, grayish green, membranous lesion that can lead to airway obstruction. Some children also exhibit infectious, ulcerated skin lesions as a manifestation of the disease. What tests tell you \u0081 Culture specimens from the nose, throat, and skin lesions reveal the presence of coryneform organisms.\u0081 Sensitivity tests determine the optimal antibiotic therapy. \u0081 Serologic testing will identify the presence of diphtheria toxin. Complications Infection with the toxin can result in myocarditis, thrombocy- topenia, peripheral neuropathy, or an ascending paralysis with symptoms similar to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Renal, cardiac, and peripheral CNS damage may also occur. It's a cover-up The membranous lesion that covers the tonsils can spread to cover the posterior pharynx, which can result in airway obstruction. Re-moval of the membrane may be indicated, but attempting to do so can cause bleeding. Left untreated, however, it can result in death.

No time to waste I.V. administration of diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotic therapy must begin within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. The patient should be tested for allergy to horse serum before administering the antitoxin. The antibiotic of choice is usually penicillin G or erythromycin for those allergic to penicillin. Too close for comfort Close contacts of the infected child should be identified, moni- tored for signs of illness, and treated with prophylactic antibiotic therapy (oral erythromycin for 7 to 10 days). Cultures of the nose, the throat, and skin lesions should be obtained. What to do Diphtheria is a preventable disease. The immunization series is designed to begin at age 2 months. The vac-cine confers immunity for 10 years, after which boost- ers should be given every 10 years throughout the life span. Passive immunity conferred from the presence of maternal antibodies lasts as long as 6 months after birth. Diagnose, then act When the disease is diagnosed, follow these steps: \u0081 Report the infection to public health officials.\u0081 Place the infected child in droplet isolation to pre- vent respiratory transmission. (Show the child isolation gowns, masks, and gloves that will be worn, and provide a simple explanation such as, \"Your parents and nurses and doctors are going to wear these so everyone stays healthy.\") \u0081 Institute contact isolation precautions if skin lesions are present.\u0081 Maintain infection precautions until after two consecu-tive negative nasopharyngeal cultures to prevent spread of the disease.\u0081 Closely monitor the patient for signs of airway obstruc- tion. Provide humidified oxygen, if oxygen is ordered, to reduce airway inflammation.\u0081 Administer antitoxin and antibiotics as ordered. Monitor for allergic or anaphylactic reaction.\u0081 Maintain the child on complete bed rest to prevent myocardi-tis. Provide age-appropriate activities to prevent boredom.

Otitis media can be secondary to H. influenzae .Haemophilus influenzae type B H. influenzae is a bacterium with several serotypes, but type B is the particularly virulent one. Bacterial infection can result in invasive and devastating illnesses in the pediatric population. What causes it Infection is caused by the coccobacillus H. influenzae , which is a gram-negative, pleomorphic, aerobic bacillus. How it happens Hib can be isolated as part of normal upper respiratory flora in healthy children and adults. However, in some instances, it breaks through the body's natural defense system and causes infection. Infectious symptoms typically begin with a viral upper respiratory infection. The invasion begins The pathogenic organisms can invade mucosal tissues and reach the bloodstream, resulting in bacteremia. All systems aren't and conjunctivitis are examples of localized, noninvasive diseases secondary to H. influenzae infection. Incubation and communicability The incubation period of H. influenzae infection isn't known. The period of communicability begins 3 days after transmission and lasts until the development of symptoms. What to look for H. influenzae infections are a common cause of epiglottitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, pneumonia, Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.183BACTERIAL INFECTIONS You'd be irritable too Symptoms vary according to the disease state and whether it's localized (noninvasive) or invasive. For example, a child with H. influenzae meningitis might complain of headache, fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia. Infants may be irritable and demon- strate signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as a bulging fontanel and a high-pitched cry. Tender to the touch When cellulitis develops as a complication of H. influenzae , there's usually no history of trauma. A localized area of soft tissue edema and erythema with indistinct margins is present. The area is tender to touch, and the patient usually has a fever. What tests tell you \u0081 Culture and sensitivity tests positively identify H. influenzae . \u0081 Peripheral blood smear may reveal leukocytosis as the body responds to the bacterial infection. Complications Potential complications of Hib include:\u0081 permanent neurologic sequelae from meningitis\u0081 \u0081 pericarditis\u0081 pleural effusion\u0081 respiratory failure from pneumonia. Not the time to procrastinate Complications are rare with noninvasive disease. In invasive dis- ease, complications are less likely when the disease is diagnosed promptly and appropriate antibiotic therapy is begun early. How complications develop also depends on the disease caused by the infecting organism; for example, hearing impairment can result from meningitis. When appropriate treatment is delayed, the po-tential for serious and life-threatening complications is greater. How it's treated I.V. administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (in particular, antibiotics that are effective against penicillin-resistant strains) is indicated for invasive disease. Cephalosporins, such as sinusitis and otitis media, can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 183 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 183 5/22/14 7:33 PM Kluwer.

Rifampin is effective in eliminating colonization of the organism. What to do \u0081 Use droplet isolation precautions with the infected patient until 24 hours after antibiotic therapy has been initiated.\u0081 Maintain adequate respiratory function through cool humidifica- tion, oxygen as needed, and a croup or face tent. \u0081 In patients with meningitis, continually monitor level of consciousness.\u0081 Advocate active immunization at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months to prevent both noninvasive disease and severe invasive diseases. Lyme disease In the United States, Lyme disease is the most common vector- borne disorder. Although Lyme disease occurs year-round, most infections occur during warm seasons (late spring and summer). Infection with Lyme disease doesn't produce active immunity so a patient may be reinfected upon reexposure. What causes it Lyme disease is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi , which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected deer tick. How it happens The spirochete enters the bloodstream via the tick's saliva as its bite penetrates the skin barrier. Tick tock The tick must feed for 36 to 72 hours or longer to transmit the infection. Most people who realize they have been bitten will re-move the tick before the infection can be transmitted. What to look for Once infected, the skin's inflammatory response causes a local-ized, red, \"bull's-eye\" rash ( erythema migrans ) at the site of the tick bite. The rash may itch and be painful.

Fever, headache, malaise, and lymphadenopathy are systemic symptoms of the disease. More reasons to treat If the infection is left untreated, arthritic pain and swelling of the joints (Lyme arthritis), facial palsy, meningitis, and carditis may result. What tests tell you Diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on signs and symptoms and history of exposure. The CDC recommends a two-step process confirmed by the presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the blood. The first step is enzyme immunoassay (EIA). If the EIA is negative, no further testing is needed. If the EIA is positive, a Western blot test is performed. If both the EIA and Western blot are positive, the patient has Lyme disease. Complications Symptoms of arthritis, including painful joint swelling and stiff- ness, are the most common complications of untreated disease. Meningitis, focal neurologic problems, and carditis are rare. How it's treated Amoxicillin (Amoxil) and cefuroxime (Ceftin) may be used in chil-dren younger than age 8 years. Amoxicillin and doxycycline are used for children older than age 8, but doxycycline shouldn't be used in younger children because it can cause permanent discol- oration of the teeth. A full course of antibiotic therapy is adminis-tered and is continued for 14 to 21 days. What to do \u0081 Teach parents that tick-infested areas should be avoided to help prevent Lyme disease. If children must be in such areas, protective clothing should be worn, and ticks that do attach must be removed immediately. (See Preventing tick-borne illnesses , page 186.) \u0081 Teach parents how to recognize the characteristic bull's-eye rash of Lyme disease to promote early diagnosis and treatment.

It typically produces an irritating cough that becomes paroxysmal and commonly ends in a high-pitched inspiratory whoop. Approximately 5,000 to 7,000 cases occur in the United States every year. Children who are too young to have been fully immunized and those who haven't completed the im- munization series are at highest risk for serious illness. What causes it The pertussis infection is usually caused by the nonmotile, gram- negative coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis . How it happens The disease is transmitted through inhalation of contami-nated respiratory droplets or by direct contact with con-taminated articles such as soiled bed linens.It's all relative Preventing tick-borne illnesses The following are measures to prevent tick- borne illnesses. Keep 'em off It's always preferable to stay out of tick- infested areas. Follow these tips to avoid such areas or, if unavoidable, protect yourself and others from acquiring a tick bite:\u0081 Treat household pets that may harbor ticks (such as cats and dogs) to eliminate the ticks.\u0081 Avoid grassy and wooded areas where ticks are abundant. \u0081 If children must be in such areas, dress them in appropriate protective clothing (such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants).\u0081 Consider using insect repellents. However, repellents containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) shouldn't be used in children younger than age 1 year. DEET is absorbed through the skin and may cause toxicity in this population.\u0081 Check the child for ticks frequently. Take 'em off If a tick attaches to the skin:\u0081 Remove it immediately using tweezers or forceps, making sure to remove the entire tick, including the mouth parts.\u0081 Don't crush or squeeze the tick to avoid causing more organisms from the tick to enter the bite.\u0081 Clean the site. \u0081 Wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the site.\u0081 Seek prompt medical attention for initiation of antibiotic therapy if symptoms develop, such as fever, erythema, or a rash in the area of the bite.

The period of communicability begins about 1 week after exposure and lasts for 5 to 7 days after antibiotic therapy has begun. What to look for Symptoms of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion begin insidi-ously, followed by a nonproductive cough. These symptoms are commonly accompanied by a low-grade fever, sneezing, and watery eyes. The cough of the giant crane The coughing becomes increasingly more severe. Spasms of par- oxysmal coughing followed by stridor on inspiration produce the characteristic \"whooping\" sound. Flushing and draining Flushing; cyanosis; and watery drainage from the nose, eyes, and mouth may accompany the coughing. Infants can have symptoms of choking and gasping for air, and vomiting may occur if the patient chokes on mucus. What tests tell you Isolation of B. pertussis in laboratory culture of respiratory secre- tions remains the gold standard for confirming pertussis infection. A peripheral blood smear may demonstrate leukocytosis caused by the body's response to the bacterial infection. Complications Complications from pertussis infection are most severe, and death rates are highest in infants younger than age 6 months. Complica-tions include: \u0081 secondary infection, such as pneumonia and otitis media \u0081 increased venous pressure\u0081 anterior treated Erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin given orally for 14 days is standard treatment for pertussis infection.

All Rights Reserved.188INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS What to do To prevent pertussis, nurses should advocate active immunization beginning at age 2 months and continuing at ages 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, for a total of five doses. When providing care to a child with pertussis, follow these steps: \u0081 Use droplet isolation for those with suspected or documented infection, until 5 to 7 days after antibiotic therapy has been initiated. \u0081 Closely monitor cardiorespiratory function and oxygen satura- tion. Maintain a patent airway; keep suctioning equipment readily available.\u0081 Create a quiet environment to decrease coughing stimulation.\u0081 Offer the child a small amount of fluids frequently to prevent dehydration.\u0081 Report diagnosed disease to public health officials. \u0081 Treat close contacts of the infected child prophylactically with oral erythromycin. Tetanus Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by an acute exotoxin-mediated infection that's usually systemic but may also be localized. Tetanus causes painful muscle rigidity and spasms all over the body, tightening the muscles of the jaw ( lockjaw ), which makes opening the mouth for breathing or swallowing impossible. It leads to death in 1 of 10 cases. What causes it Tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani , a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. Because C. tetani spores exist every- where, tetanus is a global health problem. However, the disease occurs primarily in those who are unvaccinated or inadequately immunized. How it happens The tetanus bacterium is transmitted through penetrating wounds; burns; open wounds in the skin; or contact with contaminated soil, dust, animal excreta, or surgical instruments. No room at the inn C. tetani can infect neonates who are born in a contaminated environment or when a contaminated instrument is used to cut the umbilical cord.

Axon reaction The infection reaches the axons of the nerves, causing involun- tary muscle contraction, muscle rigidity, and painful paroxysmal seizures. Incubation and communicability The incubation period averages 2 to 14 days. The disease isn't communicable, except through contact with infected skin wounds. What to look for History will reveal birth in unclean conditions (for neonatal tetanus) or an injury or wound in an unimmunized child. Clinical manifestations of the disease include: \u0081 stiffness of the neck and jaw \u0081 dysphagia\u0081 painful facial muscle spasms that progress to involve the respi-ratory muscles as well as the muscles of the abdomen, hips, and thighs \u0081 irregular heartbeat and tachycardia\u0081 hyperactive deep tendon reflexes\u0081 high sensitivity to external stimuli\u0081 profuse sweating\u0081 low-grade fever. The child remains alert throughout the disease pro- cess because mentation is unaffected. What tests tell you Diagnosis is based on the history and symptoms of muscle rigidity in a neurologically intact patient. There's also no history of previous tetanus immunization. Serum laboratory studies are usually normal. An increase in leukocytes on the peripheral blood smear may be noted from a wound infection or from the stress of tetanic muscle contractions. Complications Tetanic seizures and severe, sustained tetanic contractions as well as rigid muscle paralysis produce many complica-tions. Laryngospasm, respiratory muscle spasms, and respi- ratory distress can lead to asphyxia and death. Autonomic instability, unstable blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmias may also occur.

All Rights Reserved.190INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Make sure you create a quiet environment for the child with tetanus.How it's treated Treatment of tetanus is multifaceted and includes: \u0081 tetanus immune globulin (used to neutralize tetanus toxin) administered simultaneously with tetanus toxoid (Td) injected at a different site \u0081 penicillin G, the antibiotic of choice, administered I.V. (or metronidazole, erythromycin, or tetracycline for patients with penicillin allergy) \u0081 surgical wound excision or debridement, if needed \u0081 muscle relaxants and sedatives, if necessary, to treat muscle spasms\u0081 intensive care and careful monitoring of cardiorespiratory sta-tus, if needed. What to do Active immunization begins at age 2 months with DTaP . The series continues with immunizations at ages 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years, for a total of five doses. Ten-year reunion After the completion of the series, the Tdap vaccine should be administered between the age of 11 and 12 and then Td at 10-year intervals and should continue throughout adulthood. It is recommended that adolescents and adults (e.g., parents, siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health care per- sonnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant aged younger than 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis if they have not previously received Tdap. Ideally, these adolescents and adults should receive Tdap at least 2 weeks before beginning close contact with the infant. This process is known as \"cocooning.\" Close encounter with a rusty nail Td vaccine is given to any person with any potentially contami- nated wound if his tetanus immunization status isn't known or if it has been more than 5 years since the last immunization. Child care essentials For the child with tetanus, follow these steps:\u0081 Maintain a patent airway and adequate ventilation; keep emer-gency airway equipment readily available. Closely monitor vital signs. \u0081 Maintain a quiet environment, reducing external stimuli from light, sound, and touch. Schedule care to reduce handling of the child and allow for extended periods of rest. \u0081 Remember that the child's mentation is unaffected and that he may be fearful of the muscle spasms and rigidity.

All Rights Reserved.191VIRAL INFECTIONS relaxants are used, the resulting paralysis can make it impossible for the child to communicate clearly. Thoroughly explain proce-dures to the child, and observe closely for changes in vital signs, which can indicate pain or anxiety, particularly if the child can't communicate. Stay with the child as much as possible, and use a calm and reassuring tone to reduce the child's fear and anxiety. Viral infections Viruses are the smallest known organisms; they're visible only with an electron microscope. Independent of host cells, viruses can't replicate; instead, they invade a host cell and stimulate it to participate in forming additional virus particles. Supportive therapy is the treatment for viral infections. Antiviral medications are sometimes used. Antibiotic therapy isn't indicated for illnesses caused by viral infection but may be appropriate if a secondary bacterial infection has complicated the clinical course of the viral illness.

All Rights Reserved.192INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Fifth disease Fifth disease is a contagious viral disease characterized by rose-colored eruptions diffused over the skin, usually starting on the cheeks. The fifth dimension Fifth disease got its unusual name when it was counted as the fifth of the classic, rash-producing infections of children. The other rash-producing infections referred to in this chronology were measles, scarlet fever, rubella, and another rash that's unknown to doctors today but was referred to as \"the fourth disease.\" What causes it Fifth disease is caused by human parvovirus B19. How it happens The virus is transmitted through infected respiratory droplet secretions and through infected blood. Incubation and communicability The incubation period for fifth disease is 6 to 14 days. The period of communicability lasts from several days before the appearance of a rash until the appearance of the rash. What to look for Clinical manifestations in the prodromal phase are mild, includ-ing low-grade fever, headache, and symptoms of upper respira-tory infection. A slap in the face The typical rash in the initial stage is described as a red facial flushing, or a \"slapped-cheek\" appearance. The macular rash spreads rapidly to the truck and proximal extremities. The cen- ters of the macules fade, which gives the rash a lacy appearance. Spare the hands, spoil the feet The rash isn't present on the palms or soles. It resolves sponta- neously in 1 to 3 weeks. (See Fifth disease rash .) What tests tell you Diagnosis of fifth disease is usually based on reviewing the clin-ical presentation of the child, observing the rash, and excluding other differential diagnoses. Methods to detect the virus in lab- oratory studies are available, though not routinely ordered.Fifth disease rash The rash that appears on the face of a child with fifth disease makes it look as if the child has been slapped. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 192 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 192 5/22/14 7:33 PM Mark your calendars! The incubation period for mumps is 12 to 25 days.Complications Complications of fifth disease are rare. Children with chronic he- matologic conditions may experience transient anemias. Arthritis and joint symptoms may occur in adults but are rare in children. Pregnant? Watch out! Infection of a pregnant woman is associated with fetal disease and may result in fetal death. Even so, risk of infection is minimal in pregnant women who come into contact with affected children. How it's treated No specific treatment or cure for fifth disease exists. Nursing care is supportive. No vaccine is available to prevent the illness. What to do Treatment is supportive and directed toward relief of symptoms:\u0081 Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, are given to relieve fever.\u0081 Soothing baths or antipruritics can be used to alleviate itching. Don't fence me in Fifth disease is benign and self-limiting. Because the child isn't infectious to others when the rash appears, there's no reason to isolate the child. Mumps Mumps, also called parotitis , is an acute inflammation of one or both parotid glands and sometimes the sublingual or submaxillary glands. Painful swelling of the salivary glands is a common presenting symptom. What causes it Mumps is caused by paramyxovirus found in the saliva of an infected person. How it happens Mumps is spread by contaminated airborne respira-tory droplets or by direct contact with the saliva of an infected person. Incubation and communicability The incubation period is 12 to 25 days. The period of com-municability is from 7 days before the parotid gland enlarge-ment until 9 days after the glandular swelling has resolved.

All Rights Reserved.194INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS What to look for During the prodromal phase of the illness, symptoms include: \u0081 headache\u0081 neck pain \u0081 fever \u0081 malaise\u0081 painful chewing\u0081 anorexia. These symptoms are followed by acute and painful swelling of the parotid glands. What tests tell you \u0081 Peripheral blood smear may reveal leukocytosis and lymphocy- tosis.\u0081 Serum amylase may be elevated when the parotid boys and rare in prepu- bescent boys). How it's treated Mumps is treated symptomatically. The child should be on bed rest during the acute phase of the illness, and his diet should be adjusted according to his ability to chew. Orchitis should be treated with scrotal support and bed rest. Corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be given for arthritis symptoms. What to do Most children with mumps are uncomfortable but not seriously ill and are usually cared for at home.\u0081 If a child with mumps is hospitalized, droplet precautions should be maintained until the period of communicability has passed.

Just about any food a child craves can go in a blender\u2014and makes mumps a little easier to stomach.\u0081 as ibuprofen sodium (Aleve), may be administered to con-trol pain and fever. \u0081 A soft or pur\u00e9ed diet may be needed. \u0081 Warm, moist, or cool compresses may be offered to place on the swollen areas.\u0081 The child should be monitored for such signs of compli- cations as meningeal signs (positive Kernig's and Brudzin- ski's signs) and testicular swelling in males.\u0081 Confirmed cases should be reported to local and state health officials. Poliomyelitis Poliomyelitis, or polio , is a viral illness. Eradication is an impor- tant priority of the CDC and other organizations. Only three coun- tries continue to have an endemic of polio: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In the United States, the last case of \"wild\" polio (polio occurring directly from infection with the poliovirus) was reported in 1979. Since then, the only cases in the United States have been those resulting from the oral polio vaccine (vaccine-associated paralytic polio [VAPP]), at a rate of 8 to 10 cases per year. Oral is ousted For that reason, oral polio vaccine is no longer used in the United States; it was replaced with IPV in 2000. With this change, no cases of VAPP have occurred in the United States since 1999. Poliomyelitis may range in severity from minor symptoms to fatal paralytic illness. What causes it Polio is caused by polioviruses type 1, type 2, and type 3. What's in a name? The three types of poliovirus were named for the first people known to have the disease: Type 1 is also called Brunhilde . Type 2 is also called Lansing . Type 3 is also called Leon . Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 195 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 195 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.196INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS How it happens Transmission of the virus occurs by direct contact with infected oropharyngeal secretions or stool, infecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. When a susceptible person is infected with the poliovi- rus, the responses may range from a brief, febrile, minor illness to a major illness with CNS involvement and paralysis. Incubation and communicability The incubation period is usually 7 to 10 days. The period of com- municability isn't completely understood. The infected child can infect others for weeks before the development of symptoms. The virus is shed in respiratory secretions for a few days and in stool for several weeks. What to look for Children with poliomyelitis have a wide range of symptoms. In subclinical cases, the child may report or show no symptoms at all. Clinical manifestations of a mild infection include fever, head- ache, nausea, vomiting, and pharyngitis. Major infections may be nonparalytic or pains in the neck, back, arms, and legs; abdominal muscle ten- derness and weakness; and spasms in the extensors of the neck and back. Paralytic Clinical manifestations of paralytic poliomyelitis are similar to those of nonparalytic poliomyelitis. In addition, patients may have:\u0081 asymmetric weakness of various muscles \u0081 loss of superficial and deep reflexes \u0081 paresthesia\u0081 hypersensitivity to touch\u0081 urine retention \u0081 constipation \u0081 abdominal distention. What tests tell you Diagnosis is usually based on the patient's clinical history and presentation. The virus can be detected in specimens from the Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 196 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd Reserved.197VIRAL INFECTIONS pharynx and stool. Rising antibody titers in the blood can also indicate recent infection. Complications Complications include hypertension, urinary tract infection, uro-lithiasis, atelectasis, pneumonia, myocarditis, skeletal and soft-tissue deformities, paralytic ileus, permanent paralysis, respiratory arrest, and death. How it's treated No cure for polio exists. Treatment is supportive and is directed at symptom relief. Lifesaving measures may be necessary in cases of respiratory distress or failure. In general, the more extensive the paralysis, the greater the resulting disability. What to do Passive antibodies transferred across the placenta from mother to fetus persist for about 6 months. Vaccination is the only effective method of disease prevention. Children should be vaccinated with the IPV according to the recommended schedule (at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years). The vaccine provides lifelong im-munity to polio. When providing care to a child who's hospitalized with polio, follow these steps: \u0081 Consider the child infectious and institute droplet precautions.\u0081 Allow direct patient contact with only his family members and facility personnel who have been vaccinated against poliomyelitis.\u0081 Ensure good body positioning and range of motion to prevent contractures. Apply high-top sneakers or use a footboard to pre- vent footdrop. \u0081 Provide continuous, vigilant monitoring of respiratory function.\u0081 Monitor for all complications of immobility, including skin breakdown, bone demineralization, and pneumonia.\u0081 Report confirmed cases to local and state public health officials. Roseola infantum Roseola is a common, acute, benign, presumably viral illness char- acterized by fever with subsequent rash. Children with roseola usually present with a high fever of an unknown origin. What causes it Roseola is caused by the human herpes virus 6. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 197 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 197 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.198INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS At the onset of roseola, appearances can be deceiving. Aside from a sudden, high fever, the child can appear perfectly well.How it happens Transmission of roseola isn't completely understood. The virus is detected in human saliva and is believed to be passed by oral viral shedding. Incubation and communicability The incubation period for roseola is 5 to 15 days. The period of communicability is unknown. What to look for The onset of symptoms occurs with a sudden, high fever. Children can have fevers of 103\u00b0 to 106\u00b0 F (39.4\u00b0 to 41.1\u00b0 C). Other than the unexplained fever, the child appears well, behaving normally. Most cases occur in infants and children younger than age 2 years, with peak incidence in children ages 6 to 12 months. The fever resolves on the third or fourth day of the illness. Don't be rash The febrile phase is typically followed by the development of a body rash that begins on the trunk and spreads to the neck, face, arms, and legs. The rash fades within 3 days. Some children, however, don't develop a rash. What tests tell you Diagnostic laboratory tests aren't usually performed. It's pos- sible to perform antibody titers to detect the virus. Complications Complications of roseola are rare but include extreme hyper-thermia, persistent seizures, encephalitis, and hepatitis. How it's treated Treatment is supportive and directed at relief of symptoms. Non-aspirin antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, are given to re-lieve fever. Treating fever is important to prevent febrile seizures. What to do Roseola is benign and self-limiting. In addition to treatment for fever, care of a child with roseola should include:\u0081 observation for the development of complications \u0081 replacement of fluids and electrolytes as needed \u0081 investigation of other common causes of high fever in young children such as otitis media.

Of course, 1-day measles would have been even better.Rubella also known as German measles or 3-day measles , causes a distinctive maculopapular rash (resembling that of rubeola or scarlet fever) and lymphadenopathy. What causes it Rubella is caused by a viral infection with rubella virus (a togavirus). How it happens Rubella is a mild viral illness transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets, direct contact with an infected person, or direct contact with contaminated articles. The virus then enters the bloodstream. Incubation and communicability The incubation period of rubella is 14 to 21 days. The period of communicability is from 1 week before the onset of the rash until about 4 days after the appearance of the rash. What to look for Prodromal symptoms include:\u0081 Not so pretty in pink Prodromal symptoms occur for about 1 to 5 days before the onset of a pink rash. The exanthematous, maculopapular, mildly pruritic rash appears first on the face and then spreads to the neck, trunk, and legs. Small, red, petechial macules on the soft palate (Forch- heimer spots) usually precede or accompany the rash. What tests tell you \u0081 Clinical presentation usually confirms diagnosis of rubella. The presence of lymphadenopathy helps to distinguish rubella from other illnesses involving rashes. \u0081 Cell cultures of the throat, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as convalescent serum that shows a fourfold rise in anti-body titers, also confirms the diagnosis. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 199 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd PM Kluwer. Rights Reserved.200INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Complications Complications of rubella are rare but can occur. Neuritis, arthritis, encephalitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura can complicate the disease. In fetal infection (rare after 20 weeks' gestation), intra- uterine death, spontaneous abortion, and congenital malforma- tions of major organ systems can occur. How it's treated Rubella is a mild, self-limiting illness. Treatment is supportive and directed at relief of symptoms. Antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen, are used to control fever, and fluid intake is encouraged to promote and maintain adequate hydration. What to do Children with rubella are rarely hospitalized; they're usually treated at home because rubella is generally a mild, self-limiting viral illness: \u0081 During the period of communicability, the child shouldn't attend school or day care and should be isolated from pregnant women.\u0081 If the child is hospitalized, droplet precautions should be instituted until 5 days after the rash disappears. Pregnant women, beware Rubella in early pregnancy may cause severe congenital anomalies of the fetus. All females of childbearing age should be immunized to prevent rubella and the potential for congenital rubella syndrome in their offspring. When caring for a patient with rubella:\u0081 Make sure that the patient receives care only from non-pregnant hospital workers who aren't at risk for contracting rubella. \u0081 Make sure that all health care providers have documented immu-nity to rubella through a positive rubella titer.\u0081 Report confirmed rubella cases to local public health officials. Rubeola Rubeola, also known as measles , is a highly contagious viral dis- ease that causes a characteristic maculopapular rash. care only from non- at risk for contracting Better sa fe tha n sorry. Pre gnant health care worker s at risk for rubell a should leave t he car e of children with t he virus to someon e else. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 200 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 200 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.201VIRAL INFECTIONS What causes it Rubeola infection is caused by the rubeola virus. Outbreaks of illness occur mostly in unimmunized children or in those with compromised immune systems. How it happens Rubeola is transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets or by direct contact with contaminated articles. Incubation and communicability The incubation period for rubeola is 8 to 12 days. The period of communicability begins several days before the appearance of the red rash and continues until 5 days after the rash has resolved. What to look for Symptoms of the prodromal phase Koplik's spots, which are tiny gray-white specks surrounded by red halos that may be noted on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars about 2 days before the appearance of the body rash. (See Spotting Koplik's spots .) You look acute During the acute phase of the illness, a red, blotchy, flat rash begins on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities. The rash and other symptoms (severe cough, rhinorrhea, and lymphadenopathy) gradually subside in 5 to 7 days. What tests tell you Diagnosis of rubeola is usually based on clinical presentation. Laboratory tests are rarely needed. Complications Potential complications include:\u0081 viruses. The spots appear on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars and then extend to the entire buccal surface. The raised base of the spots may join together so that the blue-white centers stand out (looking like grains of salt) on the erythematous membrane. Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 201 Meadows-Oliver_Ch06.indd 201 seizures\u0081 secondary bacterial infections \u0081 autoimmune reactions. The infection can be severe or fatal in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity; mortality is highest in children youn- ger than age 2 years and in adults, who can contract pneumonia secondary to the disease. How it's treated Maternal immunity to rubeola is active in the infant for about 1 year after birth. Immunization with MMR vaccine induces active immunity. The first vaccine is given at age 12 to 15 months, and the second is given between ages 4 and 6 years. After the disease is diagnosed, treatment is supportive and is directed at the relief of symptoms:\u0081 Antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen, are used to control fever. \u0081 Antipruritic medications may be administered for itching.\u0081 A cool mist vaporizer may be soothing to inflamed mucous membranes.\u0081 Gentle suctioning with a bulb syringe may be needed to remove accumulated nasal secretions. What to do In addition to providing supportive treatment: \u0081 Monitor breath sounds to detect adventitious sounds.\u0081 Encourage fluid intake to promote hydration and decrease the viscosity of secretions. \u0081 In the hospitalized child, maintain droplet precautions during the period of communicability.\u0081 Report measles cases to local public health officials. Varicella Varicella, also called chickenpox , is an acute, highly contagious viral infection that can occur at any age. What causes it Infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox. The virus remains latent in dorsal root ganglia. Reactivation of the virus can cause herpes zoster infection (shingles) later in life.

All Rights Reserved.203VIRAL INFECTIONS How it happens Airborne spread of respiratory secretions or, less commonly, direct contact with lesions of an infected person can cause infec-tion in a susceptible child. Incubation and communicability The incubation period for chickenpox is 10 to 21 days. The period of communicability begins up to 5 days before the appearance of the body rash and continues until all lesions on the skin are crusted over. What to look for The onset of symptoms usually occurs 14 to 16 days after expo- sure. Prodromal symptoms of fever, malaise, and anorexia occur 24 to 48 hours before the development of the rash. The clinical picture is one of a child with lesions in all stages of evolution present on the skin. The rash is pruritic. In addition: \u0081 The rash begins as itchy red macules on the face, scalp, or trunk that progress to papules. \u0081 Papules develop into clear vesicles on an erythematous base (called \"dewdrops on rose petals\").\u0081 Vesicles become cloudy and break easily; then scabs form.\u0081 As initial lesions are crusting over, new lesions form on the trunk and extremities. What tests tell you VZV antibody tests and titers may be useful in establishing a diag- nosis. Most commonly, diagnosis is based on the clinical history and presentation of a child with the characteristic vesicular rash. Vaccination To prevent varicella, a vaccine is given at 12 to 15 months, with a booster between 4 and 6 years of age. Complications Complications of varicella are rare. The disease can have sig-nificant, life-threatening complications in children who are immunocompromised. Complications of varicella include secondary bacterial infec- tions, such as cellulitis, lymphadenitis, abscesses, and sepsis. Other potential complications include encephalitis and meningo-encephalitis, hepatitis, acute thrombocytopenia, and Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.204INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Quick quiz 1.

Seems like I'm the brains in this operation.Anatomy and physiology The neurologic system consists of the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, and the autonomic (invol-untary) nervous system (ANS). Through complex and coordinated interactions, these three parts integrate all physical, intellectual, and emotional activities. Understanding how each part works is essential to conducting an accurate neurologic assessment. Central nervous system The CNS is composed of the brain and all its component parts and the spinal cord. Structurally, the CNS is contained within the skull and the vertebral column. Central command Integration among all parts of the nervous system en-ables normal functioning of body parts, both voluntary and involuntary. A person's perception of himself and his environment, his reactions and interactions with the envi- ronment, and his adjustment to development and environmen-tal changes are greatly influenced by the proper integration and functioning of the nervous system.

When the body needs a stimulus interpreted or a motor activity initiated, I'm the only guy for the job.Brain The brain, the center of the CNS, collects, integrates, and interprets stimuli and initiates and monitors volun-tary and involuntary motor activity. The incredible expanding brain Head circumference, which is measured in children up to age 3 years, averages 13 /H11033 to 14 /H11033 (33 to 35.5 cm) and should be \u00bd /H11033 to 1 /H11033 (2 to 3 cm) larger than chest circumference at birth. Fifty percent of brain growth is achieved in the first year of life, 75% by age 3, and 90% by age 6. The brain comprises 12% of body weight at birth, doubles in weight in the first year, and triples by age 5 or 6. Separated at birth Since the skull protects the brain, the anterior and posterior fontanels are separated at birth to allow for brain expansion. The posterior fontanel closes between ages 4 and 8 weeks, and the anterior fontanel closes between ages 12 and 18 months. A mass of nerves in a house of bones Physiologically, the brain is the large, soft mass of nervous tissue housed in the cranium and protected and supported by the menin-ges and the skull bones. It consists of the: \u0081 cerebrum \u0081 cerebellum\u0081 brain stem. Other noteworthy figures Other structures and elements of the brain include the: cerebrum, the largest portion of the brain, is the nerve center that controls sensory and motor activities and intelligence. The outer layer of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex , consists of neuron cell bodies (gray matter); the inner layers consist of axons (white matter) and basal ganglia, which control motor coordination and steadiness. Bridging the hemispheres A longitudinal fissure divides the cerebrum into two hemispheres connected by a wide band of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum . These hemispheres share information through the Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 207 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 207 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Kluwer.

Because motor impulses descending from the brain cross in the medulla, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body and the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body. Not the piercing kind Several fissures divide the cerebrum into lobes, each of which is associated with specific functions. (See A look at the lobes .) P assing the baton The thalamus, a relay center below the corpus callosum, further organizes cerebral function by transmitting impulses to and from appropriate areas of the cerebrum. The body's thermostat The hypothalamus, which lies beneath the thalamus, is an auto-nomic center that regulates temperature control, appetite, blood pressure, breathing, sleep patterns, and peripheral nerve dis- charges that occur with behavioral and emotional expression. Cerebellum Beneath the cerebrum, at the base of the brain, is the cerebellum. It's responsible for smooth-muscle movements, coordinating sen- sory impulses with muscle activity, and maintaining muscle tone and equilibrium. Brain stem The brain stem relays nerve impulses between the spinal cord and other parts of the brain. It houses cell bodies from most of the cranial nerves (CNs) and includes the: \u0081 midbrain , which is the reflex center for the third and fourth CNs and mediates pupillary reflexes and eye movements\u0081 pons , which helps regulate respirations and mediate chewing, taste, saliva secretion, hearing, and equilibrium\u0081 medulla oblongata , which affects cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotor functions. Neurons The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neu- ron, a highly specialized conductor cell that receives and transmits electrochemical nerve impulses. Neurons develop at between 15 and 30 weeks' gestation. Delicate and impulsive Its structure contains delicate, threadlike nerve fibers that extend from the central cell body and transmit signals, or Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 208 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 208 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

The great dividers The fissure of Sylvius (lateral sulcus) separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes. The fissure of Rolando (central sulcus) separates the frontal lobes from the parietal lobe. The parieto-occipital fissure separates two parietal Lovely lobes controls specific body functions: \u0081 The frontal lobe controls voluntary muscle movements and contains motor areas ( including the motor area for speech, or Broca's area ). It's the center for personality, behavioral, and intellectual functions, such as judgment, memory, and problem solving; for autonomic functions; and for cardiac and emotional responses.\u0081 The temporal lobe is the center for taste, hearing, and smell. Also, in the brain's dominant hemisphere, it interprets spoken language.\u0081 The parietal lobe coordinates and interprets sensory information from the opposite side of the body.\u0081 The occipital lobe interprets visual stimuli.

Not bad for the ole' noggin either!axons , which carry impulses away from the cell body, and den- drites , which carry impulses to the cell body. Meninges The brain is covered with three thin membranes called meninges : The outer membrane is the dura mater , or \"hard mother\"; it has various folds that separate the brain into compartments. The second structure is the arachnoid ; it has two layers of fibrous and elastic tissue and, between the layers, a spongy, cobweblike structure containing subarachnoid fluid. The third structure is the pia mater , or \"tender mother,\" a very fine membrane that's rich in minute blood plexuses and follows the brain in all its folds. (See Meningeal layers of the brain .) CSF The ventricles of the brain and the entire subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord contain CSF. Clear liquid with a protein chaser CSF is a clear liquid containing water and traces of organic ma-terials (especially protein), glucose, and minerals. CSF is formed from blood in capillary networks called choroid plexuses , which are located primarily in the brain's lateral ventricles. The fluid is eventually reabsorbed into the venous blood through the arachnoid villi, located in dural sinuses on the brain's surface. Better than a bubble bath The brain floats in, and is bathed by, CSF. It acts as a shock absorber and helps reduce forces that jar or shake the brain. CSF is in contact with the entire brain and spinal cord surface as well as the surfaces of the ventricles. Ventricles The four ventricles are large, CSF-filled cavities within the brain. There are two lateral ventricles, one in each cerebral hemisphere. A third ventricle (located directly above the midbrain of the brainstem) communicates with both the lateral ventricles and the fourth ventricle (located in the posterior 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It functions as a conductive pathway to and from the brain. It's also the reflex center for activities that don't require Meningeal layers of the brain Three primary membranes, or meninges, help protect the CNS: the dura mater, the arachnoid membrane, and the pia mater. Dura mater The dura mater is a fibrous mem- brane that lines the skull and forms folds (reflections) that descend into the brain's fissures and provide stability. The dural folds include the:\u0081 falx cerebri, which lies in the longitudinal fissure and separates the hemispheres of the cerebrum\u0081 tentorium cerebelli, which separates the cerebrum from separates the lobes. The arachnoid villi (projections of the dura mater into the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses) serve as the exit points for CSF drainage into venous circulation. Arachnoid membrane A fragile, fibrous layer with moderate vascularity, the arachnoid membrane lies between the dura mater and the pia mater. Injury to its blood vessels during head trauma, lumbar puncture, or cisternal puncture may cause hemorrhage. Pia mater An extremely thin and highly vascular membrane, the pia mater closely cov- ers the brain's surface and extends into its fissures. It contains minute arteries and veins that supply the brain. Additional layers Three layers of space further cushion the brain and spinal cord against injury:\u0081 The epidural space (a potential space) lies over the dura mater.\u0081 The subdural space lies between the dura mater and the arach-noid membrane and is commonly the site of hemorrhage after head trauma.\u0081 The subarachnoid space , which is filled with CSF, lies between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater.

Within the spinal cord, connections are made between incoming and outgoing nerve fibers. Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves are connected to the cord. The sensory, or ascending, tracts carry sensory impulses up the spinal cord to the brain; the motor, or descending, tracts carry motor impulses down the spinal cord and out to the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral nervous system The part of the nervous system outside of the skull and vertebral column is considered the peripheral nervous system. It's com- posed of 31 spinal nerves and 12 CNs and is divided into two functional systems: the somatic nervous system and the ANS. Spinal nerves Messages transmitted through the spinal cord reach outlying areas through 31 pairs of segmentally arranged spinal nerves attached to the spinal cord. Spinal nerves are numbered according to their point of origin in the cord: \u0081 eight cervical nerves\u2014C1 \u0081 one coccygeal nerve. It's rude to interrupt After leaving the vertebral column, each spinal nerve separates into rami (branches), distributed peripherally, with extensive but organized overlapping. This overlapping reduces the risk of lost sensory or motor function from interruption of a single spinal nerve. Cranial nerves The 12 pairs of CNs transmit motor or sensory messages (or both) primarily between the brain or brain stem and the head and neck. All CNs except the olfactory and optic nerves exit from the midbrain, pons, or medulla oblongata of the brain stem. (See Exit points of the cranial nerves .) Somatic nervous system The somatic (voluntary) nervous system is activated by will but can function independently.

Autonomic nervous system The ANS regulates unconscious processes to control involuntary body functions, such as digestion, respiration, and cardiovascular function. It's usually divided into two antagonistic systems that balance each other's activities to support homeostasis under nor- mal conditions:\u0081 The sympathetic nervous system controls energy expenditure, especially in stressful situations, by releasing adrenergic catechol- amines. \u0081 The parasympathetic nervous system by releasing the cholinergic neurohormone acetylcholine. Neurologic assessment A complete assessment of the neurologic system includes evaluation of:\u0081 mental and emotional status \u0081 CN function \u0081 sensory function\u0081 motor function\u0081 reflexes. Knowledge of the pediatric patient's physical, psycho- motor, and cognitive developmental milestones is an es-sential assessment tool for detecting significant deviations. For toddlers and preschoolers, make a game of the assessment process when possible. Have older children assist with the assessment. Mini-assessment Because there isn't always enough time to completely assess neurologic function, a bedside assessment might focus on level of consciousness (LOC), pupillary response, motor func- tion, reflexes, sensory functions, and vital signs. Glasgow Coma Scale The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which assesses eye open- ing as well as verbal and motor responses, provides a quick, standardized account of neurologic status. A pediatric version of the scale considers the preverbal child. (See Pediatric coma scale .) Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 214 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.215NEUROLOGIC ASSESSMENT In this exam, each response receives a numerical value; the final score is the sum total of the values. \u0081 A total score of 15 for all three parts is normal. \u0081 A score of 7 or lower indicates coma. \u0081 A score of 3, the lowest possible score, usually (but not always) indicates brain death. Motor function Motor function is also a good indicator of LOC and can point to central or peripheral nervous system damage.Pediatric coma scale To quickly assess a patient's LOC and to uncover changes from baseline, use the pediatric coma scale. This assess-ment tool grades consciousness in relation to eye opening and motor response, and responses to auditory or visual stimuli. A decreased reaction score in one or more cate-gories warns of an impending neurologic crisis. A patient scoring 7 or lower is comatose and probably has severe neurologic damage.

Cephalocaudal de- velopment is the sequence in which the greatest growth always occurs at the head and gradually works its way toward the \"tail.\" Proximodistal development proceeds from the center toward the extremities. Reflex rules Infant activities are primarily driven by reflex but, with myelina- tion and development, a growing child progressively per-forms complex tasks requiring coordinated movements. How strong are you? To evaluate muscle strength, follow these steps:\u0081 Have the patient grip your hands and squeeze.\u0081 Ask him to push against your palm with his foot. \u0081 Compare muscle strength on each side to ensure the results are the same bilaterally. Pupillary response Brain damage is indicated by a lack of change in pupil size in response to light. Use a flashlight to assess pupillary response at the bedside. While shin- ing the outer edge of the light into the patient's eye, observe the initial size of the pupil and the speed of the pupil's response to the light. Compare both eyes to ensure an equal bilateral response. Diagnostic tests Several invasive and noninvasive tests are used to diagnose neu- rologic disorders. Minimizing emotional trauma Tests performed to diagnose neurologic disorders can be ex-tremely frightening to a child. Children may have misconceptions related to what will happen and why a test is being performed. Preparing a child helps allay fears and misconceptions and gives him the tools to cope effectively with a frightening experience. The timing of the preparation depends on the age/developmental Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 216 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 216 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.217DIAGNOSTIC TESTS level of the child. For the younger child, the preparation should be closer to the occurrence of the procedure, sometimes just prior to. The older child can be given information about a procedure more in advance. Before a test is performed, follow these steps: \u0081 Tell the child what to expect in simple, age-appropriate terms (what he'll see, hear, and feel) and explain why the test is being performed. \u0081 Be honest about pain or discomfort the child might experience and suggest coping strategies (for example, \"Count to 5 and the hurting part will be over\"). Big boys do cry \u0081 Tell the child that it's OK to be afraid, and reassure him that everyone involved is there to help him and keep him safe.\u0081 Whenever possible, allow the child to see the equipment (for example, the scanning machine) before the test. Pictures may be used, if necessary.\u0081 Encourage the child to ask questions and express his concerns.\u0081 Allow the parents to remain with the child during testing when- ever possible; when this isn't possible, tell the child where his parents will be waiting for him. A job well done \u0081 Give the child a \"job\" to do during the test (for example, \"Your job is to hold very still.\") to give him a sense of control.\u0081 After the test, praise the child for doing a good job, and encour- age him to talk about the test or draw a picture that depicts his experience (to help the child master the experience and put it in perspective). Specialist to the rescue Most hospitals have one or more child life specialists who will meet with the child and his parents before a test, explain the procedure, and accompany and support the child and his parents during the test. CT scan Computed tomography (CT) scan is indicated when CNS disease is suspected. The scan produces three-dimensional images that can identify congenital abnormalities, fractures, brain tumors, in- farction, bleeding, and hematomas as well as provide information about the ventricular system of the brain. CT scan may be done with or without contrast. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 217 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 217 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.218NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS Seeing is believing. Show the child a picture of the imaging machine (or the machine itself) to help allay his fear of the unknown.Nursing considerations A child who knows what to expect will be less fearful and more cooperative during a CT scan. To help the child know what to expect, consider these steps: \u0081 Explain the procedure to the child. Cooperation is necessary because the patient must lie still during the procedure.\u0081 Show the child a picture of the CT machine to help alle- viate fears. (It may be necessary to premedicate the patient.) \u0081 Tell the child that he may hear a clicking noise as the scan-ner moves around his head but that the machine won't touch him.\u0081 Explain that the child won't be able to eat or drink for 4 hours before the scan (depending on age); contrast dye may cause nausea. \u0081 Assess the patient for allergy to iodinated dye or shellfish. \u0081 Encourage the child to drink fluids after the scan ( because dye is excreted by the kidneys). EEG Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a graphic recording of the elec- trical activity of the brain. It's performed to identify and evaluate patients with seizures. Pathologic conditions involving the brain cortex (such as tumors and infarctions) can also be detected. EEG is also used to confirm brain death. Nursing considerations After explaining the procedure to the child and his parents: \u0081 Reassure the child that he won't feel anything during the test.\u0081 Make sure the child continues to eat and drink before the test because fasting may cause hypoglycemia, which could alter the test results.\u0081 Make sure the child doesn't drink anything with caffeine on the morning of the test because of caffeine's stimulating effect. \u0081 Tell the patient that he needs to remain still during the test; any movement will create interference and alter the EEG recording. Lumbar puncture By placing a needle in the subarachnoid space of the spinal col- umn, one can measure the pressure of that space and obtain CSF Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 218 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 218 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.219DIAGNOSTIC TESTS for examination and diagnosis. The needle is commonly placed between L3 and L4 (or L4 and L5). This examination may assist in the diagnosis of metastatic brain or spinal cord neoplasm, menin- gitis, cerebral hemorrhage, and encephalitis. Nursing considerations The procedure should be explained, and written informed consent should be obtained. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Apply eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) cream to puncture site 30 to 60 minutes before procedure to reduce pain if ordered.\u0081 Instruct the child to empty his bladder and bowels before the procedure. \u0081 Monitor the child's vital signs during and after the procedure because sedation is used to complete the procedure.\u0081 Explain the importance of remaining still throughout the proce-dure in the side-lying knee-chest position. (See Lumbar puncture positioning , page 220.) \u0081 Gently hold even a cooperative child during the procedure to prevent injury from unexpected or involuntary movement. Maintain, encourage, assess \u0081 Keep the child flat for 1 hour after procedure. \u0081 Keep the child in a reclining position for up to 12 hours after the procedure to avoid the discomfort of potential postprocedure spinal headache. \u0081 Encourage the child to drink increased amounts of fluid with a straw to replace the CSF removed during the puncture. (Drinking with a straw allows the patient to keep his head flat.) \u0081 Assess the child for numbness, tingling, and decreased move- ment of the extremities; pain at the injection site; drainage of blood or CSF at the injection site; and inability to void. MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive diagnostic procedure that provides valuable information about the body's anatomy in greater detail than a CT scan does. It doesn't require exposure to ionizing radiation. MRI is indicated for the evaluation of headache or neurologic signs of CNS lesions; it's also used to assess neck and back pain as well as lesions of the bones and joints.

All Rights Reserved.220NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS Nursing considerations Begin by explaining the procedure to the patient and his family and telling them that there's no exposure to radiation during MRI. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Tell the parents that, because no radiation is used, they may read or talk to their child in the imaging room during the procedure.\u0081 Inform the parents that young children may need to be sedated because of the need to remain motionless during the procedure. \u0081 Tell the child that he may eat or drink as usual before and after the procedure. (No food or fluid restrictions are necessary before MRI, unless sedation is given.)Advice from the experts Lumbar puncture positioning When positioning a child for a lumbar punc- ture, follow these steps: Have the child lie on his side at the edge of the bed, with his chin tucked to his chest and his knees drawn up to his abdomen. Make sure the child's spine is curved and his back is at the edge of the bed (as shown below); this position widens the spaces between the vertebrae, easing inser-tion of the needle. To help the child maintain this position, place one of your hands behind his neck; place the other hand behind his knees, and pull gently. Hold the child firmly in this position throughout the procedure to prevent ac- cidental needle displacement. (Typically, the doctor inserts the needle between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.) The sitting position may be used for infants. However, because the flexed position may interfere with the infant's breathing, monitor his color and respiratory status closely during the procedure.

All Rights Reserved.221DIAGNOSTIC TESTS It may not be cute and cuddly, but a PET scan is the best thing going for detecting cerebral dysfunction.PET scan In positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, radioactive chemicals are administered to the patient. These chemicals are used in the normal metabolic process of the particular organ being studied. Posi- trons emitted from the radioactive chemicals in the organ are sensed by a series of detectors positioned around the patient. PET scanning can help detect cerebral dysfunction caused by tumors, seizures, head trauma, and some mental illnesses. It's most commonly used for evalu-ation of the heart and brain and in many aspects of oncology. Nursing considerations Keep in mind that many people haven't heard of PET scanning; the child and his parents may be anxious about what they perceive to be a new procedure. To prepare the child and parents for the procedure, follow these steps:\u0081 Explain the procedure to the child and his family.\u0081 Explain to the child that an intravenous (I.V.) injection will be inserted and that this is the only \"hurting part\" of the procedure. \u0081 Explain that food or fluids may need to be restricted for 4 hours on the day of the test.\u0081 Don't sedate the child; he may need to perform certain mental activities during a brain PET scan.\u0081 After the scan, encourage the child to drink fluids and urinate frequently to aid removal of the radioisotope from the bladder. Ventricular tap A ventricular tap may be performed if an infant has unex- plained, excessive head growth or a bulging fontanel caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP), associated with an in- creased accumulation of CSF that has been confirmed by ultra- sound or CT scan. Going in When performing a ventricular tap: \u0081 The needle is inserted into the subdural space or the ventricle through the open anterior fontanel or the coronal suture. \u0081 The fluid is removed slowly to prevent intracranial hemorrhage caused by pressure shifts.

All Rights Reserved.222NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS Nursing considerations Parents are likely to feel anxious when their infant must undergo a procedure that involves pain, discomfort, or stress. The nurse should encourage the parents to ask questions and express concerns. \u0081 Explain the procedure to the parents. \u0081 Hold the infant's head securely in the correct position to prevent meningeal laceration.\u0081 Number and label the tubes of fluid in the order in which they're collected. \u0081 Maintain the infant in a semi-erect position (an infant seat may be used) to reduce the possibility of further leakage of fluid from the site of the puncture.\u0081 Assess the pressure dressing for leakage of fluid and bleeding.\u0081 Keep the infant as quiet and comfortable as possible; crying increases ICP . Procedures and treatments The care of a child with suspected or diagnosed neurologic problems may involve invasive procedures to monitor or treat the child's condition. ICP monitoring ICP monitoring allows assessment of the pressure exerted by the blood, brain, CSF, and any other space-occupying fluid or mass; increased ICP is defined as pressure sustained at 20 mm Hg or higher. Look closely . . . Assessment of the child with increased ICP requires close observation because the common signs and symptoms may not appear until ICP is significantly elevated, placing the child in grave danger. The subarachnoid bolt and the intraventricular catheter (gold standard of ICP monitoring) are the two major instruments used for monitoring ICP in a child:\u0081 The end of the bolt is placed in the subarachnoid space. The top of the bolt is attached to a transducer to conduct a waveform to the monitor.\u0081 The catheter is placed in the lateral ventricle or subarachnoid space. (The catheter provides a method for measuring pressure as well as a conduit to drain off extra fluid into a drainage bag.) The drainage bag and the manometer are part of a sterile closed system. (The manometer is used to measure the ICP within the closed system.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 222 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 222 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.223PROCEDURES AND TREATMENTS Less invasive In an infant, ICP monitoring can be performed without penetrating the scalp. In this external method, a photoelectric transducer with a pressure-sensitive membrane is taped to the infant's anterior fontanel. The transducer responds to pressure at the site and transmits readings to a bedside monitor and recording system. Sorry, not for everyone The external method is restricted to infants because pressure readings can be obtained only at the fontanels (the incompletely ossified areas of the skull). ICP monitoring from the fontanels can be inaccurate if the equipment is poorly placed or inconsistently calibrated. Nursing considerations Before ICP monitoring is performed, thoroughly explain the pro- cedure to the child and his parents. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Be thoroughly familiar with the monitoring system being used, and prepare the child and his family for what they can expect after placement of the selected monitoring device.\u0081 Explain that the procedure doesn't hurt the child and that he may have sand bags placed on either side of his head to prevent head movement. \u0081 Head of bed is usually elevated 15 to 30 degrees. \u0081 Assess whether the child has an allergy to iodine preparations. \u0081 Maintain the sterility of the system. \u0081 Monitor the child closely for signs of infection. \u0081 Monitor the amount of fluid in the drainage bag.\u0081 Constantly monitor the child for signs of increased ICP . \u0081 Minimize activities that may elevate ICP , such as those that may cause stress, pain, or crying; bright lights, noise, and other environmental stimuli, and vigorous range-of-motion (ROM) exercises. Remember that suctioning and percussion are contraindicated because they acutely elevate ICP . Suction-ing may be performed if absolutely necessary by hyperoxy-genating the patient with 100% oxygen before the procedure. Vibration may be used instead of percussion because it doesn't increase ICP . VP shunt insertion A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is implanted in the child with hydrocephalus to prevent excess accumulation of CSF in the ventricles. The tubing diverts the CSF from the ventricles into the peritoneal cavity, where it's reabsorbed. The procedure is per- formed under general Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

When explaining this procedure (and all procedures involving general anesthesia), make sure the child understands that he will be given \"a special medicine\" to make sure he doesn't feel anything during the procedure. A special sleep Rather than telling a child he'll be asleep (which may make him afraid to go to sleep at night or nap time or cause him to worry that he'll wake up during the proce- dure), tell him, \"The medicine gives you a special kind of sleep that isn't like sleeping at night or nap time.\" Monitor and measure In addition to preparing the child for the proce- dure, follow these care measures: Preoperatively Frequent neurologic assessments:\u0081 Monitor the patient for signs of increased ICP .\u0081 Measure head circumference daily at the occipital frontal cir- cumference; place the tape measure just above the top of the ears, around the midforehead, and around the most prominent part of the occiput.\u0081 Gently palpate fontanels and suture lines for signs of bulging, tenseness, and separation, which may indicate increased ICP or increasing ventricular size. Postoperatively Continue frequent neurologic assessments: \u0081 Monitor the patient for pain, and administer pain medications as ordered. \u0081 Check orders regarding allowable activities. \u0081 Observe the child for signs of increased ICP , which may indicate an obstructed shunt.\u0081 Monitor the child for abdominal distention, which may indicate distal catheter displacement. \u0081 Be alert for signs of shunt infection (fever, lethargy, irritability, redness along shunt device, abdominal discomfort or apnea), which is the greatest postoperative risk.\u0081 Monitor for fluid leak from the incision.\u0081 Administer antibiotics as ordered.\u0081 Teach parents to be aware of bowel patterns and recommend use of laxatives and diet to prevent constipation, which has been associated with shunt malfunction.

Neurologic disorders A diagnosis of a neurologic disorder, whether acute, chronic, or progressive, can be terrifying to a child and his parents. They'll look to their nurses to help allay fears and concerns, answer ques- tions, and provide ongoing support. Bacterial meningitis Meningitis, an inflammation of the meninges, is the most common infectious process of the CNS. It can be bacterial or viral and can occur as a primary disease or as a result of complications of neu- rosurgery, trauma, systemic infection, or sinus or ear infections. What causes it Prior to the addition of the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine (HiB vaccine), H. influenzae type B was the most common cause of meningitis in children older than age 1 month, but vaccination has drastically reduced its incidence. Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal meningitis) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal meningitis) took lead as the most common bacterial causes of meningitis beyond infancy. In 2001, a pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-7 [later PCV-13]) was added to the vaccine schedule, and since then, the incidence of menin-gitis caused by S. pneumoniae has decreased. By the end of the decade, meningococcal vaccines (MCV4) were widely available and added to the recommended vaccines for adolescents. The incidence of bacterial meningitis dropped by 31% between 1998 and 2007. Still strong The incidence of Escherichia coli and beta-hemolytic streptococ- cus meningitis is higher during the first 2 years of life, especially during the first month of life. How it happens \u0081 Bacteria reach the meninges via the bloodstream from nearby infections (for example, sinusitis, mastoiditis, otitis media) or by communication of CSF with the exterior (for example, myelome- ningocele, penetrating injuries, or neurosurgical 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.226NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS A high- pitched cry is one symptom of bacterial meningitis in infants.\u0081 The organism becomes implanted in CSF and throughout the arachnoid space. Because CSF has relatively low levels of anti-bodies, complement, and white blood cells (WBCs), the infection flourishes. \u0081 As the process continues, increased ICP develops, along with empyema.\u0081 If the infection spreads to the ventricles, edema and tissue scarring around the ventricle cause obstruction of the CSF and subsequent hydrocephalus. Because CSF contains such nutrients as protein and glucose, it's an excellent medium for bacterial growth. Thus, the process of infection, edema, obstruction, and hydrocephalus can occur rapidly. What to look for Symptoms of bacterial meningitis are variable and depend on the child's age, pathogen, and duration of the illness before diagnosis. Findings in young infants and toddlers (between ages 3 months and 2 years) may include: \u0081 fever\u0081 change in feeding pattern\u0081 vomiting or diarrhea \u0081 bulging anterior fontanel \u0081 irritability (becoming more so with rocking and cuddling)\u0081 high-pitched cry\u0081 seizures. Bigger kids In irritability rigidity (resistance to neck flexion)\u0081 opisthotonos (hyperextension of the head and neck to relieve discomfort)\u0081 seizures\u0081 coma \u0081 positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign, or both. (See Two telltale signs of meningitis Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 226 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.227NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Children with a hemorrhagic rash, first appearing as petechiae and changing to purpura or large necrotic patches, may have me- ningococcal meningitis. What tests tell you Lumbar puncture is performed to evaluate the CSF for protein and glucose levels and the number of WBCs. The fluid may appear cloudy or milky white. CSF protein levels tend to be high; glucose levels may be low. Polymerase chain reaction techniques are useful when the cultures are negative because of partially treated meningitis. A CT scan or MRI can rule out cerebral hematoma, hemor- rhage, or tumor and identify an abscess. Other tests performed to aid in diagnosis include:\u0081 blood cultures\u0081 complete blood count (CBC)Two telltale signs of meningitis A positive response to these tests helps to establish a diagnosis of meningitis. Brudzinski's sign To test for Brudzinski's sign, place the patient in a dorsal recumbent position and put your hands behind his neck and bend it forward. Pain and resistance may indicate meningeal inflammation, neck injury, or arthritis. However, if the patient also flexes his hips and knees in response to the manipulation, chances are he has meningitis.Kernig's sign To test for Kernig's sign, place the patient in a supine position. Flex his leg at the hip and knee and then straighten the knee. Pain or resistance points to meningitis. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 227 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 227 \u0081 clotting factors\u0081 nose and throat cultures. Complications The most common neurologic complications of meningitis are hearing loss, neurologic deficit, seizures, visual impairment, and behavioral problems. Other complications include CN dysfunc- tion, brain abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Death occurs in 10% to 15% of cases (espe-cially neonatal meningitis). How it's treated Treatment should begin before the causative organism is identi- fied because it may take up to 2 days to obtain culture results and delays could be fatal. Treatment includes the following: \u0081 Two broad spectrum antibiotics should be started as an initial treatment regimen.\u0081 Antibiotics may be changed when culture and sensitivity results are known. \u0081 Adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone (Decadron) may be provided to reduce the risk of sequelae such as hearing loss and neurologic complications.\u0081 Isolation of the child is necessary for the first 24 hours of therapy to prevent spreading the infection.\u0081 Medications to control fever and pain/discomfort should be administered as needed. No antibiotics needed if culture results come back negative Treatment for viral (aseptic) meningitis is supportive; medications such as analgesics may be used to keep the child comfortable. (See Aseptic meningitis .) The initial symptoms of viral and bacterial meningitis are similar, so children with signs of meningitis should be treated as if it is bacterial until the culture proves otherwise. What to do Nursing interventions include a thorough history and careful assessment:\u0081 Review the medical history with the patient and his family for recent illnesses, such as upper respiratory infection, head injury, otitis media, and sinusitis (or a previous lumbar puncture).\u0081 Assess the patient for the presence or absence of headaches, hearing loss, seizure activity, change in food and fluid intake, changes in LOC, pupil reaction and size, and nuchal rigidity. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 228 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 228 Rights Reserved.229NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 Assess peaks and troughs of antibiotic levels to ensure adequate treatment and prevent ototoxicity.\u0081 Ongoing assessment of LOC is the priority nursing assessment. \u0081 Teach the parents about the possible complications of meningi- tis and about the prescribed medications.\u0081 Question the parents about the child's close contacts because they will need prophylactic treatment. (Close contacts shouldn't wait for signs of meningitis to develop but should seek medical at- tention promptly because they could be incubating the infection.) Brain tumors CNS tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and cause more deaths in children than any other form of malignancy. Most brain tumors in children are supratentorial (above the roof- line of the cerebellum); the remaining tumors are infratentorial (below the roofline of the cerebellum). What causes it The cause of brain tumors is unknown, but heredity and environ-ment have been associated with their development.Aseptic meningitis Aseptic meningitis is a benign syndrome characterized by headache, fever, vomiting, and meningeal symptoms. It results from some form of viral infection, including entero-viruses (most common), arboviruses, herpes simplex virus, mumps choriomeningitis virus. Signs and symptoms Aseptic meningitis begins suddenly with a fever up to 104\u00b0 F (40\u00b0 C), alterations in con-sciousness (drowsiness, confusion, stupor), and neck or spine stiffness, which is slight at first. (The patient experiences such stiffness when bending forward.) Other signs and symptoms include headaches, nausea, vomit-ing, abdominal pain, poorly defined chest pain, and sore throat.Diagnostic tests Patient history of recent illness and knowledge of seasonal epidemics are essential in differen-tiating among the many forms of aseptic men-ingitis. Negative bacteriologic cultures and CSF analysis showing pleocytosis and increased protein levels suggest the diagnosis. Isolation of the virus from CSF confirms it. Treatment Treatment is supportive and includes:\u0081 bed rest\u0081 maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance\u0081 analgesics for pain \u0081 exercises to combat residual weakness\u0081 careful handling of excretions and good hand-washing technique to prevent spreading the disease (isolation isn't necessary).

Common in kids The most common brain tumors children are: Locations of brain tumors in children .) Locations of brain tumors in children Below are the most common types of brain tumor in children, along with their usual location.

All Rights Reserved.231NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS What to look for Signs and symptoms are directly related to the anatomic location and size of the tumor and, to some extent, the age of the child:\u0081 The hallmark symptoms of a brain tumor are morning headache and early morning vomiting related to the child getting out of bed. \u0081 The child may experience vision changes, such as diplopia, stra-bismus, and nystagmus, which may manifest as difficulties with schoolwork. \u0081 Papilledema (edema of the optic disc) may be a late sign; this may be hard to evaluate in children because ophthalmic examina- tions require the child's cooperation.\u0081 Enlargement of the head or bulging fontanels may be present in children before the closure of cranial sutures (at ages 12 to 18 months).\u0081 Personality changes may be most critical and easily observable (such as crying, irritability, and not wanting to play). \u0081 Ataxia , or uncoordinated gait, may be mistaken for clumsiness and is the most common sign of cerebellar involvement. What tests tell you History and physical and neurologic examinations provide the most important information. Diagnostic studies include:\u0081 MRI (most common), CT scan, and PET scan showing the loca- tion and extent of the tumor \u0081 lumbar puncture and serology of CSF to assess for the presence of tumor cells. Complications Some children with brain tumors experience some permanent se- quelae, especially if they receive radiation therapy. They may have slowed development, incoordination, learning disabilities, or other effects. In some instances, brain tumors result in death. How it's treated Treatment includes: \u0081 removing a resectable tumor\u0081 reducing cerebral edema, ICP , and other symptoms \u0081 preventing further neurologic damage. The mode of therapy depends on the tumor's histologic type, radiosensitivity, and location; it may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or decompression of increased ICP with diuretics, corticosteroids or, possibly, 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.232NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS It may take the whole team\u2014a social worker, a psychologist, and other health care workers\u2014to help the family cope.Treatment of choice Surgical excision is usually performed when possible. However, combination therapy (surgery and radiation with or without che-motherapy) has been proven to improve outcomes. What to do During your first contact with the child, perform a comprehensive assessment (including a complete neurologic evaluation) to pro-vide baseline data and help develop your care plan. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Continually assess for signs of increased ICP , including decreas-ing pulse and respirations, increasing systolic blood pressure, and a widening pulse pressure. \u0081 Monitor for changes in the child's LOC. (A change in behavior is most significant in young children. A change in sleeping and wak-ing patterns may also be significant.)\u0081 Report changes in ocular signs, such as pupil response, shape, and size.\u0081 Measure head circumference daily in children younger than age 2 years. Better safe than sorry \u0081 Observe seizure precautions; seizures are always a pos- sibility in a child with brain tumor.\u0081 Always keep the bed's side rails up and assist with am- bulation because CN dysfunction may lead to ataxia and weakness.\u0081 Provide emotional support for the child, his parents, and other family members; referral to a social worker, psycholo- gist, or other health care professional may be needed to help the child and his family cope with the diagnosis. Postoperative care Children who undergo surgery for a brain tumor require specialized care. Positioning is impor-tant and varies with the type of surgery per- formed, and diligent monitoring of vital signs, neurologic status, and pain is essential. In addi-tion, follow these steps:\u0081 The child may be kept flat at first; position- ing may be limited to a 10- to 20-degree elevation for the first 24 to 48 hours. (The doctor will prescribe the patient's position.)\u0081 Never place the child in Trendelenburg's position because it increases ICP and the risk of bleeding.

Suggest using hats, scarves, and wigs, and reassure the child that her hair will grow back.\u0081 Assess vital signs, mental status, and neurologic status frequently because the child is at risk for increased ICP related to cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, or hemorrhage. High temp, cool blanket \u0081 The child's temperature may be labile (usually elevated) because of edema of the brain stem; a hypothermia blan-ket may be used if the child becomes hyperthermic. \u0081 Be careful not to place tension on the suture line when turning the child.\u0081 Assess the child frequently for pain. (Analgesics should be provided according to the doctor's orders.) Hair today, gone tomorrow \u0081 Body image issues (shaven head, edema, or fear of disfig- urement) may be a problem for older children; help them to work through these feelings. \u0081 Provide emotional support to the parents; help them to work through their feelings regarding diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis (refer them to appropriate agencies and support groups for further assistance). Cerebral palsy Cerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive, neuromuscular disorder of varying degrees resulting from damage or developmental de-fects in the part of the brain that controls motor function. Children with CP can't control movements in certain parts of their bodies and may be partially paralyzed. They may have completely normal intelligence and may feel as if they're trapped in a body they can't control. What causes it Conditions that result in cerebral anoxia, hemorrhage, or other damage are probably responsible for CP . In the womb Prenatal conditions that may increase the risk of CP include maternal infection (especially rubella), maternal drug ingestion, radiation, anoxia, toxemia, maternal diabetes, abnormal placental attachment, malnutrition, and isoimmunization. A shaky start Perinatal and birth difficulties that increase the risk of CP include forceps placentae, metabolic or electrolyte disturbances, abnormal mater- nal vital signs from general or spinal anesthetic, prolapsed cord with delay in delivery of the head, premature birth, prolonged or unusually rapid labor, and multiple birth (especially infants born last in a multiple birth). A traumatic legacy Infection or trauma during infancy that increases the risk of CP includes poisoning, severe kernicterus resulting from erythro-blastosis fetalis, brain infection, head trauma, prolonged anoxia, brain tumor, cerebral circulatory anomalies causing blood vessel rupture, and systemic disease resulting in cerebral thrombosis or embolus. How it happens A perinatal anoxic episode plays the largest role in the pathologic state of brain damage. Structural or functional defects occur, impairing motor or cognitive function. Defects may not be distin- guishable until several months after birth or when the child fails to meet developmental milestones. What to look for There are three distinct types of CP: spastic athetoid ataxic. Spastic Spastic CP type, affecting about 70% of CP patients. The affected area of the brain is the cortex. Typically, the child with spastic CP walks on his toes with a scissor gait, crossing one foot in front of the other. Spastic CP muscle contraction and relaxation\u0081 underdevelopment of affected limbs. Athetoid In athetoid patients, involun- tary, uncoordinated motion occurs with degrees 234 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 234 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.235NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS MRI shows the part of the brain that's impaired.tension. The area of injury is the basal ganglia. The child exhibits slow, writhing, uncontrolled movements involving all extremities whenever voluntary movement is attempted. Facial grimacing, poor swallowing, and drooling make speech difficult. Ataxic Ataxic CP accounts for about 10% of CP patients. The affected area of the brain is the cerebellum. Its characteristics include poor balance and muscle coordination caused by disturbances in movement and balance. An unsteady, wide-based gait appears as the child begins to learn to walk; overall, the child appears clumsy. Mixed together Some children with CP display a combination of these clinical features:\u0081 In most, delayed gross motor development makes eating, especially swallowing, difficult. \u0081 Abnormal motor performance and coordination can manifest early in life as poor sucking and feeding difficulty.\u0081 Spasticity of hip muscles and lower extremities makes diapering difficult. \u0081 Posture abnormalities occur at rest or when changing position.\u0081 Cognitive impairment occurs in varying degrees in 18% to 50% of patients (most children with CP have an IQ that's normal or higher, but they can't demonstrate it on standardized tests).\u0081 Seizures occur in 25% of CP patients.\u0081 Many children have sensory deficits related to vision (stra- bismus), hearing, and speech. What tests tell you \u0081 Developmental screening reveals delay in achieving mile- stones.\u0081 EEG may identify the source of seizure activity. \u0081 Neuroimaging studies (CT scan, MRI) determine the site of brain impairment.\u0081 Cytogenic studies (genetic evaluation of the child and other family members) and metabolic studies are performed to rule out other potential causes. Complications Children with CP may also have associated disorders, such as impaired intellectual development, seizures, failure to grow and thrive, and problems with vision and sense of touch. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 235 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 235 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Rights Reserved.236NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS How it's treated CP can't be cured, but proper treatment can help affected children reach their full potential within the limitations set by this disorder. Treatment includes the following: \u0081 A baclofen (Lioresal) pump may be inserted to treat spasticity by delivering the skeletal muscle relaxant directly to the intrathe-cal space around the spinal cord (the pump lasts for 3 to 5 years, after which a new pump must be implanted). \u0081 Botulinum toxin A (Botox) may be used, especially for spas- ticity in lower extremities.\u0081 Oral muscle relaxants may be used or neurosurgery may be re-quired to decrease spasticity.\u0081 Braces or splints and special appliances, such as adapted eating utensils and a low toilet seat with arms, can help the child per-form activities independently. \u0081 ROM exercises minimize contractures. \u0081 An artificial urinary sphincter may be indicated for the inconti-nent child who's able to use hand controls. Correct those contractures \u0081 Orthopedic surgery may be indicated to correct contractures. \u0081 Antiepileptics may be used to control seizures. What to do Care of the child with CP involves attention to diet and physical activity:\u0081 Institute a high-calorie diet for the child with increased motor function to help him keep up with increased metabolic demands. \u0081 Assist with locomotion, communication, and educational opportunities to enable the child to attain an optimal developmen-tal level. \u0081 Perform ROM exercises to minimize contractures. \u0081 Plan activities that involve gross and fine motor skills (such as holding toys or eating utensils and positioning items to encourage reaching and rolling over).\u0081 Provide a safe environment; have the child use protective head-gear or bed pads to prevent injury. Skilled labor of love The nurse should also teach the family the skills needed to man- age the child's care (such as medication administration, physi-cal rehabilitation, and seizure management). Siblings should be involved in the child's care to prevent feelings of being left out. Family members need help in setting realistic goals and man- aging stress. They should be referred to community agencies that will enhance the child's quality of life (early childhood Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.237NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS programs, recreational programs for children with disabilities) and provide caregiver support. Down syndrome Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21 , is the most common genetic disorder, causing moderate to severe retardation. What causes it Down syndrome is the result of abnormal cell division involving chromosome 21. There is an increased incidence in advanced parental age (when the mother is age 35 or older at delivery or the father is age 42 or older). How it happens A spontaneous extra chromosome causes Down syndrome; the child has 47, rather than 46, chromosomes. The most common chromo-some affected is chromosome 21. The child has three copies of chro- mosome 21 rather than the usual two\u2014hence, the name \"trisomy.\" What to look for The physical signs of Down syndrome may be apparent at birth, especially hypotonia as well as some dysmorphic facial features and heart defects. The degree of mental retardation may not be- come apparent until the infant grows older. Facial features Facial features common in children with Down syndrome include: \u0081 flat, broad forehead\u0081 flat nasal bridge \u0081 protruding tongue (due to the small oral cavity) \u0081 small head (with slow brain growth)\u0081 upward slanting eyes\u0081 small, short ears (which may be low-set). Body features Body features associated with Down syndrome include: \u0081 hypotonia\u0081 short stature \u0081 simian crease (a along the palm with an in-curved little finger)\u0081 short, broad hands and neck\u0081 genital 237 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 237 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.238NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS Children with Down syndrome can be extremely engaging, affectionate, and loving.Level of functioning Intellectual dysfunction associated with Down syndrome includes mild to severe retardation, with intellectual abilities declining with age, and the onset of Alzheimer's-type dementia with increas- ing age. Level of functioning varies markedly among children (and adults) with Down syndrome. Some children remain entirely dependent on their parents or caregivers throughout their lives. Other, higher functioning children communicate well, develop relationships outside the home, attend school, and even live inde-pendently at some point (although this process takes longer than it does in children without Down syndrome). A special gift Many parents describe their child with Down syndrome as extraordinarily loving, gentle, affectionate, and extremely demonstrative. What tests tell you Physical findings at birth, especially hypotonia, may sug-gest Down syndrome, but no physical feature is diagnostic by itself. A karyotype showing the specific chromosomal abnormality provides a definitive diagnosis. Amnio alert Amniocentesis allows prenatal diagnosis and is recom- mended for pregnant women older than age 34, even if the family history is negative. Amniocentesis is also rec- ommended for a pregnant woman of any age when either she or the father carries a translocated chromosome. Complications In approximately 60% of patients, early death usually results from complications precipitated by associated congenital heart defects; up to 44% die before age 1 year. An increased incidence of upper respiratory infections, aspiration, leukemia, and hypothyroidism is common. How it's treated Because there's no cure for the disorder, management of Down syndrome is manifestation-specific and includes surgery to cor-rect cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), and other congenital problems. Skeletal, immunologic, metabolic, biochemical, and oncologic problems are treated according to the specific problem.

All Rights Reserved.239NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Parents of a child with Down syndrome may need counseling to help them grieve the loss of the healthy child they had hoped for.Atlantoaxial instability (a spinal deformity resulting in insta- bility of the upper cervical spine) should be assessed frequently. Growth and development should be monitored using specific growth charts. What to do \u0081 Offer assistance and support to the parents; give clear explanations to promote understanding and compliance. Just the way you are \u0081 Assist in identifying positive features and behaviors in the child to alleviate anxiety and promote parental acceptance of the child's disabilities. \u0081 Plan activities based on the child's cognitive and motor abilities, rather than chronological age, to promote a healthy emotional and physical environment.\u0081 Provide activities and toys appropriate for the child to support optimal development. \u0081 Refer the parents for nutritional counseling as needed. Sherlock Mom \u0081 Teach parents to recognize symptoms of problems, such as upper respiratory infections and constipation, and to administer thyroid medication if needed. \u0081 Keep the environment as routine as possible; a change in routine commonly results in frustration and decreased coping abilities.\u0081 Refer the parents for genetic counseling to explore the cause of the disorder and to discuss the risk of recurrence in a future pregnancy. The thrill of success \u0081 Encourage participation in success-oriented activities such as Special Olympics.\u0081 Refer the parents to a social worker or grief counselor, if needed; many parents grieve for the \"normal\" child they had expected. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy Muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited, progressively degen- erative diseases that cause muscle fiber degeneration and muscle weakness and atrophy. The most common type of muscular dystrophy is 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.240NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS What causes it DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder and affects mostly males; it occurs in 1 in 3,000 male children. Females are usually carriers and pass the defect on to their male offspring. How it happens In DMD, there's an absence of the muscle protein dystrophin, which helps support the structure of muscle fibers. This results in degeneration of skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. Fat and connective tissue replace the degenerated muscle fibers. What to look for Muscular dystrophy affects the upper arms, legs, and trunk muscles first. Pelvic muscles begin to weaken between ages 3 and 5 years. Signs include the following: \u0081 Calves appear large and strong but are weak because of infiltra- tion of the muscles with fat and connective tissue.\u0081 Children have difficulty climbing stairs, running, and riding a bicycle. \u0081 The child has a wide stance and a waddling gait. \u0081 Gowers' sign may be displayed when rising from a sitting or supine position. (See Observing Gowers' sign .) Rapid changes The disease progresses rapidly; by age 12, the child usually can't walk. Signs include the following:\u0081 Posture changes occur as abdominal and paravertebral muscles weaken. \u0081 Weakened thoracic muscles may cause scapular \"winging\" or flaring when the child raises his arms.\u0081 Bone outlines become prominent as surrounding muscles atrophy. \u0081 In later stages, contractures and pulmonary signs, such as tachycardia and shortness of breath, become noticeable. What tests tell you \u0081 Muscle biopsy reveals replacement of normal muscle with con- nective and fatty tissue. It also shows degeneration and necrosis of muscle fibers and a deficiency of the muscle protein dystrophin. \u0081 Electromyography (EMG) shows decreased and weakened elec- trical impulses in the child with DMD.\u0081 Nerve conduction velocity, in which electrical impulses are sent down the nerves of the arms and legs, reveals abnormal nerve function. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 240 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 240 5/22/14 7:35 PM Rights Reserved.241NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Observing Gowers' sign Because DMD weakens pelvic and lower extremity muscles, the child must use his upper body to maneu-ver from a prone to an upright position. This maneuver is called Gowers' sign . Lying on his stomach with his arms stretched in front of him, the child raises his head, backs into a crawling position, and then into a half-kneel. Then stopping, he braces his legs with his hands at the ankles and walks his hands (one after the other) up his legs until he pushes himself upright. DMD can cause respiratory failure and ultimately death. \u0081 Creatine kinase levels increase before muscle weakness becomes severe, providing an early indicator of muscular dystrophy. Complications Respiratory infections become common as the muscles of the diaphragm weaken. Cardiomyopathy occurs as the heart dete-riorates and weakens. Death occurs in the 20s from respira- tory failure, heart failure, or pneumonia. How it's treated Because there's no cure, treatment is supportive and aimed at maintaining ambulation and independence for as long as possible.

The goal of occupa- tional therapy is to help the child compensate for physical limita-tions and to achieve a level of success in performing activities of daily living. Heels, hips, and knees Surgery may be done to release the heel cord as contractures de- velop in this area. Surgery is also performed on the hips and knees as they become contracted, so that the child will be able to sit in a chair with some degree of comfort. What to do Care of a child with DMD is multidisciplinary: \u0081 Monitor respiratory and cardiac status regularly.\u0081 When respiratory involvement occurs, encourage coughing, deep-breathing exercises, and diaphragmatic breathing. \u0081 Ensure proper nutrition, and emphasize the importance of pre-venting obesity.\u0081 Assess the family's ability to cope with the diagnosis and poor prognosis. \u0081 Protect the child from others with respiratory and contagious diseases.\u0081 Encourage and assist with active and passive ROM exercises to preserve joint mobility and prevent muscular atrophy. Bring in the troops \u0081 Coordinate other health services that would be beneficial to the child\u2014for example, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nutritional services. \u0081 As movement becomes more difficult, assist the child with posi- tion changes every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers.\u0081 Encourage genetic screening and counseling, which are indi-cated for parents and siblings of children with DMD. \u0081 Refer the parents to agencies that can assist them with the child's home needs and provide emotional support. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acute, rapidly progressing, poten- tially fatal form of polyneuritis. It leads to deteriorating motor function and paralysis that progress in an ascending pattern. The condition affects the peripheral nervous system, resulting Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 242 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 242 5/22/14 7:35 PM Kluwer.

What's myelin is your-e-lin Myelin is the phospholipid protein of the cell membranes that forms the myelin sheath of neurons. It acts as an electrical insula-tor and increases the velocity of impulse transmission. What causes it Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is caused by an autoimmune response to an infectious organism, usually from a GI or respiratory illness 1 to 3 weeks before onset. It has also been linked to viral immuniza- tions (such as the swine flu vaccine) and cytomegalovirus. How it happens The syndrome is commonly preceded by immune system stimula- tion from a viral illness, trauma, surgery, immunizations, or human immunodeficiency virus. These stimuli are thought to alter the immune system, resulting in sensitization of lymphocytes to the patient's myelin, and subsequent myelin damage. Demyelination occurs, and the transmission of motor and sensory nerve impulses is stopped or slowed down. What to look for Symptoms usually develop 1 to 3 weeks after an upper respira- tory or GI infection. Infants have an onset of rapidly progressive and severe hypotonia, possible respiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. Weak from the legs up Older children have rapidly progressive symmetric weakness and muscle pain with varying degrees of distal paresthesia and numb-ness of the legs. The weakness spreads to the upper extremities, trunk, chest, neck, face, and head, and there's an ascending loss of deep tendon reflexes with flaccid paralysis. Unexplained autonomic instability may result in hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, and sinus tachycardia. From dysfunction to failure Other clinical features include urinary and bowel incontinence, CN dysfunction resulting in Bell's palsy, difficulty swallowing, and respiratory failure.

Age- appropriate tools can help the child communicate.What tests tell you Diagnosis is based primarily on a patient history revealing a recent febrile illness and typical clinical features. Other tests include the following: \u0081 Lumbar puncture reveals increased protein levels in the CSF. \u0081 EMG and nerve conduction studies are markedly abnormal; an abnormal wave pattern indicates Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Complications The most serious complication of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is respiratory failure, which occurs as paralysis progresses to the nerves that innervate the thoracic area. Most deaths are attributed to respiratory failure. Immobility from the paralysis can cause such problems as paralytic ileus, deep vein thrombosis, throm-bophlebitis, pulmonary emboli, muscle atrophy, and orthostatic hypotension. How it's treated Treatment is primarily supportive with special attention to the re- spiratory, neurologic, and cardiovascular systems and with early recognition of deteriorating status. In addition: \u0081 Plasmapheresis, a process that temporarily reduces the number of antibodies in the blood's circulation, is useful during the initial phase but offers no benefit if begun 2 weeks or more after onset. \u0081 High-dose immunoglobulin can be given if plasma- pheresis fails unavailable.\u0081 The child's nutritional status\u2014including body weight, serum albumin levels, and calorie counts\u2014should be continuously evaluated.\u0081 The child may require mechanical ventilation for respira-tory difficulties, and continuous electrocardiogram monitor- ing for possible cardiac arrhythmias. What to do Because of the progressive nature of this disorder, it's extremely important to establish a communication system in anticipation of the time when the child can't communicate verbally: \u0081 Perform frequent neurologic, cardiovascular, and respi-ratory assessments, and report changes to the doctor.\u0081 Watch for ascending sensory loss, which precedes motor loss. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 244 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 244 5/22/14 7:35 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.245NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 Frequently assess respiratory status by monitoring pulse oxim- eter readings, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas values, and auscultating breath sounds. \u0081 Perform chest physiotherapy to help prevent complications of immobility.\u0081 To prevent aspiration, test the gag reflex and elevate the head of the bed before giving the child anything to eat. Survey the signs \u0081 Watch for signs of urine retention and constipation. \u0081 Assess the need for nasogastric tube or gastrostomy feedings, which may become necessary. \u0081 Perform passive ROM exercises to help maintain function and prevent contractures. (See Care of the immobilized child .) Squash the stress \u0081 Help relieve anxiety in the child and his parents, and facilitate the child's development with age-appropriate activities.\u0081 Refer the parents to social workers, who can help with financial arrangements and school considerations, and to other health care professionals to help the family cope with the diagnosis. Advice from the experts Care of the immobilized child An immobilized child requires meticulous care to prevent complications. Without constant care, a bedridden patient is more suscep-tible to skin breakdown caused by increased pressure on tissues over bony prominences. To care for an immobilized child, follow these steps:\u0081 Change the child's position from side to side every 2 hours.\u0081 Place the child on a sheepskin pad, a con-voluted foam mattress, or an alternating-air current mattress.\u0081 Keep the child's body in proper alignment with rolls made of towels or blankets, or with splints.\u0081 Perform passive range-of-motion exercises at least three or four times per day, or as or- dered by the doctor, to prevent contractures.\u0081 Emphasize the importance of coughing and deep breathing. Teach the older child to use an incentive spirometer. Younger children can achieve the same effect by blowing bubbles or blowing up a medical glove like a balloon.\u0081 Change soiled or wet diapers frequently to prevent excoriation of the perianal area.

CSF overload As excess CSF accumulates in the ventricular system, the ven-tricles become dilated and the brain is compressed against the skull. This results in enlargement of the skull if the sutures are open or in signs and symptoms of increased ICP if the sutures are fused. What causes it Hydrocephalus that results from an obstruction in CSF flow is called noncommunicating hydrocephalus . Causes include faulty fetal development, infection, a tumor, a cerebral aneurysm, or a blood clot after intracranial hemorrhage. Communicating hydrocephalus results from faulty absorp- tion of CSF. Causes of communicating hydrocephalus include a surgical complication, adhesions, or meningeal hemorrhage. (See Hydrocephalus and CSF circulation .) How it happens In healthy children, CSF circulation is unimpeded: \u0081 CSF is produced from blood in a capillary network (choroid plexus) in the brain's lateral ventricles. \u0081 the ular foramen (foramen of Monro) to the third ventricle.\u0081 From there, it flows through the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle, through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie, to the cisterna of the subarachnoid space. \u0081 The fluid then passes under the base of the brain, upward over the brain's upper surfaces, and down around the spinal cord.\u0081 Eventually, CSF reaches the arachnoid villi, where it's reab-sorbed into venous blood at the venous sinuses. What to look for The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with the age of the child. In infants, the unmistakable sign of hydrocephalus is rapidly increasing head circumference that's clearly dispro- portionate to the infant's growth. Other characteristic changes include:\u0081 widening and bulging of the fontanels\u0081 distended scalp 246 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd \u0081 thin, shiny, fragile-looking scalp skin \u0081 underdeveloped neck muscles. (See Signs of hydro- cephalus .) The setting sun In severe hydrocephalus, the roof of the orbit is depressed, the eyes are displaced downward, and the sclerae are prominent. When the sclera is seen above the iris, it's called the setting- sun sign . Other common signs and symptoms include: \u0081 high-pitched, shrill cry \u0081 abnormal irritability \u0081 anorexia \u0081 projectile vomiting.Hydrocephalus and CSF circulation In noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the obstruction of CSF circulation occurs most commonly between the third and fourth ven-tricles, at the aqueduct of Sylvius. However, it can also occur at the outlets of the fourth ventricle (foramina of Luschka and Ma-gendie) or, rarely, at the foramen of Monro.Absorption distortion In communicating hydrocephalus, faulty absorption of CSF may result from surgery, adhesions between meninges at the base of the brain, or meningeal hemorrhage. Rarely, a tumor in the choroid plexus causes overpro-duction of CSF, resulting in space teristic changes in hydrocephalus include:\u0081 marked enlarge- ment distended scalp shiny, fragile-looking scalp skin\u0081 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 247 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.248NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS In older children, indicators of hydrocephalus include de- creased LOC, ataxia, incontinence, hydro- cephalus, especially when a myelomeningocele is present. In this condition, an elongated or tonguelike downward projection of the cerebellum and medulla extends through the foramen magnum into the cervical portion of the spinal canal, impairing CSF drain-age from the fourth ventricle. Rigid, noisy, and irritable Infants with this malformation also demonstrate nuchal rigidity, noisy respirations, irritability, vomiting, weak sucking reflex, and a preference for hyperextension of the neck. What tests tell you Diagnostic tests for hydrocephalus include: \u0081 daily measurement of head circumference, because rapid head enlargement is the first indication of the problem \u0081 skull X-rays, which show thinning of the skull with separation of sutures and widening of the fontanels\u0081 a CT scan and an MRI, which are used to confirm the diagnosis, assess ventricular dilatation or enlargement, and demonstrate the Arnold-Chiari malformation. Complications Potential complications of hydrocephalus include: \u0081 mental retardation\u0081 impaired motor function \u0081 vision loss. The most serious complication associated with shunt place- ment is infection. Shunt malfunction is the other major compli- cation and is caused by such mechanical problems as kinking, plugging, migrating, and tubing separation. How it's treated Treatment involves removal of the obstruction (such as surgical removal of a tumor) or creation of a new CSF pathway to divert excess CSF. The goal of treatment is to bypass the obstruction and drain the fluid from the ventricles to an area where it can be reabsorbed. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 248 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 248 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.249NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS It's tubular This bypass is accomplished with insertion of a VP shunt or tube, which leads from the ventricles, out of the skull, and passes under the skin to the peritoneal cavity. (See VP shunt .) Straight to the heart An alternative to the VP shunt is the less commonly used ventro-atrial shunt, which drains the fluid from the ventricles to the right atrium of the heart. What to do Several preoperative and postoperative nursing interventions are indicated for the child with hydrocephalus. VP shunt A VP shunt drains excess CSF from the brain's lateral ventricle into the peritoneal cavity. Catheter in enlarged ventricl e Subcutaneous catheter Loop of catheter in peritoneum Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd Preoperative care Preoperative care involves careful monitoring: \u0081 Head circumference should be measured daily, watching for signs of increased ICP . \u0081 Assess respiratory status every 4 hours or more often if necessary.\u0081 Measure intake and output of all fluids.\u0081 Monitor nutritional status and provide small feedings because the child is prone to vomiting. (During feedings, the child's head must be supported carefully and he must be burped frequently.) Postoperative care Postoperatively, the child is placed in a flat position on the non- operative side to prevent rapid CSF drainage and pressure on the valves. If CSF is drained too rapidly, the child is at risk for subdural hematoma caused by tears in the vessels secondary to the cerebral cortex pulling away from the dura. Nursing care continues to focus on careful observation of the child's status as well as educating the parents about how to care for the child with the shunt in place: \u0081 Observe for decreased LOC and vomiting.\u0081 Observe the child for signs of shunt infection, such as fever, increased heart and respiratory rates, poor feeding or vomiting, altered mental status, seizures, and redness along the shunt tract.\u0081 Observe for abdominal distention or discomfort because shunt placement may cause a paralytic ileus or peritonitis. \u0081 Measure head circumference daily; any increase of more than 0.5 cm is significant and should be reported to the doctor. Shunt care 101 \u0081 Explain all procedures to the parents. \u0081 Teach the parents signs and symptoms of shunt infection and malfunction and what to do if they suspect either. \u0081 Teach the parents to foster normal growth and development in their child; the child shouldn't be overprotected but should avoid contact sports. Neural tube defects Neural tube defects (NTDs) are serious birth defects that involve the spine or the brain. They result from failure of the neural tube to close at approximately 28 days after conception. The most com- mon forms of NTD are: \u0081 spina bifida 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.251NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Spina bifida Spina bifida occulta is a visible defect with an external saclike protrusion. It's characterized by incomplete closure of one or more vertebrae without protrusion of the spinal cord or meninges. What's in the sac? Spina bifida cystica is a visible defect with an external saclike protrusion. It has two classifications:\u0081 myelomeningocele , in which the external sac contains menin- ges, CSF, and a portion of the spinal cord or nerve roots distal to the conus medullaris\u0081 meningocele , in which the sac contains only meninges and CSF and may produce no neurologic symptoms. (See Forms of spina bifida , page 252.) Anencephaly Anencephaly occurs when both cerebral hemispheres are absent. The closure defect occurs at the cranial end of the neuroaxis and, as a result, part of the entire top of the skull is missing and the brain is severely damaged. It's the most severe NTD and is incom- patible with life. Gone too soon Many infants with anencephaly are stillborn. If the infant does survive, there's no specific treatment. Because the infant has an intact brain stem, he can maintain vital functions, such as temper- ature regulation and respiratory and cardiac function. Most live for a few weeks and then die of respiratory failure. Encephalocele In encephalocele, a saclike portion of the meninges and brain protrudes through a defective opening in the skull. What causes it NTDs may be isolated birth defects, may result from exposure to a teratogen (factor that increases risk of congenital disorder in an embryo), or may be part of a multiple malformation syndrome. It's believed that isolated NTDs (those not due to a specific teratogen or associated with other malformations) are caused by a combi-nation of genetic and environmental factors. Although most of the specific environmental triggers are unknown, research has identified a lack of folic acid in the mother's diet as one of the risk factors.

All Rights Reserved.252NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS How it happens During the fourth week of gestation, ventral induction of the neu- ral tube fails to occur. The degree of impairment depends on the size and level of the defect and whether it involves the spinal cord and nerves. Associated malformations include hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation. What to look for The signs and symptoms of NTDs vary widely according to the type of the defect. Search the sacrum In spina bifida occulta, a depression or dimple, a small tuft of hair, a hemangioma, or a port-wine nevi in the lower lumbar or sacral area usually accompanies the defect. Because there's no Forms of spina bifida The most common forms of spina bifida are listed below, along with their major characteristics. Spina bifida occulta Spina bifida occulta is the least severe of the spinal cord defects. It's characterized by incom- plete closure of one or more vertebrae without protrusion of the spinal cord or meninges. Spina bifida cystica Spina bifida cystica is a visible defect with an external saclike protrusion. It has two classifi-cations: meningocele and myelomeningocele.Meningocele In meningocele, the sac contains only menin-ges and CSF. Myelomeningocele In myelomeningocele, the external sac contains meninges, CSF, and a portion of the spinal cord or nerve roots distal to the conus medullaris. Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.253NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS Latex-free is the way to be when caring for a child with spina bifida.herniation of the spinal cord or meninges, spina bifida occulta usually doesn't cause neurologic dysfunction, but it's occasionally associated with foot weakness or bowel and bladder disturbances. Sac on the back In myelomeningocele and meningocele, a saclike structure protrudes over the spine. Meningocele seldom causes neurologic symptoms. Myelomeningocele is associated with permanent neu- rologic symptoms, such as flaccid or spastic paralysis; bowel and bladder incontinence; possibly, mental retardation; Arnold-Chiari malformation; and curvature of the spine. P oor prognosis Clinical effects of encephalocele include paralysis, hydrocephalus, and severe mental retardation. Anencephaly is invariably fatal. What tests tell you Diagnostic tests include the following:\u0081 Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening to measure AFP levels in the blood at 16 to 18 weeks' gestation. AFP is a fetal-specific gamma-1 globulin in the amniotic fluid that indicates the presence of myelo- meningocele. If the AFP screen is abnormal, amniocentesis and fetal ultrasound are performed.\u0081 Amniocentesis may reveal the presence of AFP in the amniotic fluid. \u0081 Ultrasound may be used to detect open NTDs or ventral wall defects.\u0081 Transillumination of a protruding spinal sac can some-times distinguish between myelomeningocele (in which the sac transilluminates) and meningocele (in which the sac doesn't transilluminate). \u0081 Skull X-rays and CT scans identify the defects. Complications Complications of NTDs include decreased motor activity below the defect, paralysis, multiple musculoskeletal deficits, neuro-genic bladder and bowel, CNS infections, hydrocephalus, and death. Latex liability Children with spina bifida are at high risk for developing latex allergies, possibly because of frequent exposure to latex during catheterizations and multiple surgical procedures. Allergic reactions can range from mild signs and symptoms to ana- phylactic shock. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 253 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.254NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS How it's treated Immediate surgical closure (within 48 hours) is the most common choice of treatment, although spina bifida occulta usually requires no surgery. The rationale for early surgical closure is to decrease the risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality and to prevent fur- ther spinal cord and spinal nerve damage. Surgery doesn't reverse neurologic deficits. Scheduled for surgery A shunt may also be needed to relieve related hydrocephalus. Treatment of encephalocele includes surgery during infancy to place protruding tissues back in the skull, excise the sac, and cor- rect associated craniofacial abnormalities. What to do Nursing interventions begin prenatally and, after the child is born, continue with preoperative and postoperative care. Prenatal care Prenatally, care focuses on educating and supporting the parents:\u0081 Refer the prospective parents to a genetic counselor who can provide information and support the couple's decision on how to manage the pregnancy.\u0081 Inform women of childbearing age to take a folic acid supple-ment until menopause or the end of childbearing potential. Re- search has indicated that the risk of an open NTD may be reduced 50% to 100% in pregnant women who take folic acid.\u0081 Provide psychological support to help the parents accept the diagnosis and prognosis. Preoperative care Before surgery, many nursing interventions focus on preventing complications associated with the sac:\u0081 Prevent the sac from drying by covering it with warmed saline- soaked sterile dressings. \u0081 Check for leakage from the sac, monitor for redness and infec-tion around the sac, and assess for signs and symptoms of CNS infection. \u0081 Assess for sensory and motor activity below the sac, including bowel and bladder function. No pressure, please \u0081 Prevent trauma by keeping pressure off the sac; keep the child on his abdomen with hips flexed and legs abducted.

All Rights Reserved.255NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 Institute measures to keep the sac free from infection; avoid contamination from urine and stool. (A \"mud flap\" can be made using a strip of plastic with adhesive backing on the top portion; this is placed directly below the defect and will prevent contami- nation from stool.)\u0081 Measure head circumference to establish baseline data.\u0081 Be aware of the increased incidence of latex allergies in these children, and take appropriate precautions. Teach and support \u0081 Provide emotional support to the parents. Be aware that surgery is usually performed 24 to 48 hours after birth.\u0081 Teach parents and other family members about measures to prevent contractures, pressure ulcers, urinary tract infections, and other complications. Postoperative care After surgery, provide routine postoperative care, including mon- itoring vital signs, positioning, and observation of the operative site. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Provide thorough skin care if paralysis is present (to prevent complications such as pressure ulcers).\u0081 Infant may be positioned on side (with order) or abdomen.\u0081 Assess motor activity and bowel and bladder function to com- pare with the preoperative condition. \u0081 Measure head circumference daily, and perform ROM exercises.\u0081 Teach clean intermittent catheterization to parents.\u0081 Maintain splints, braces, and casts; use wheelchairs, walkers, and other assistive devices as needed. Reye's syndrome Reye's syndrome is an acute childhood illness that causes fatty in- filtration of the liver with concurrent hyperammonemia, encepha-lopathy, and increased ICP . Fatty infiltration of the kidneys, brain, and myocardium may occur. Equal opportunity syndrome Reye's syndrome affects children from infancy to adolescence and occurs equally in boys and girls. What causes it Reye's syndrome typically begins within 1 to 3 days of an acute viral infection, such as an upper respiratory tract infection, type B influenza, or varicella. Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 255 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 255 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.256NEUROLOGIC PROBLEMS To prevent Reye's syndrome, never give aspirin to a child younger than age 15. Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs instead.Nada to ASA Use of aspirin in children younger than age 15 is not rec- ommended because of its link to Reye's syndrome. Fortu-nately, Reye's syndrome has become rare because most parents now give their children acetaminophen instead of aspirin for flulike symptoms or fever. How it happens In Reye's syndrome, damaged hepatic mitochondria disrupt the urea cycle, which normally changes ammonia to urea for its excretion from the body. This disruption results in hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and an increase in serum short-chain fatty acids, leading to encepha-lopathy. Fatty infiltration occurs simultaneously in renal tubular cells, neuronal tissue, and muscle tissue (including the heart). What to look for The severity of the child's signs and symptoms varies with the degree of encephalopathy and cerebral edema. In all cases, Reye's syndrome develops in five stages: The first stage is the initial viral infection. A brief recovery period follows, when the child doesn't seem seriously ill. A few days later, he develops intractable vomiting, lethargy, rapidly changing mental status (mild to severe agitation, confu-sion, irritability, and delirium), rising blood pressure and respira- tory and pulse rates, and hyperactive reflexes. The syndrome commonly progresses to coma. As coma deepens, seizures develop, followed by decreased tendon reflexes and, usually, respiratory failure. What tests tell you Diagnosis of Reye's syndrome is based on the abrupt change in the child's LOC and on findings from diagnostic tests. At the time of diagnosis, the child usually has already progressed to stage III\u2014coma and decorticate posturing: \u0081 Blood (aspartate aminotrans-ferase or alanine aminotransferase) elevated to twice their normal levels as well as elevated ammonia levels, below normal blood glucose levels, and prolonged prothrombin time.

Complications Developmental and neurologic deficits may occur and are more severe in children younger than age 2 years. Cerebral edema is the major factor contributing to morbidity and mortality. Other complications may include respiratory failure and death. How it's treated The goal of medical management is to provide supportive treat- ment to prevent the secondary effects of cerebral edema and metabolic injury; it includes assisted ventilation for the coma- tose child, monitoring for signs of increased ICP (caused by cerebral edema), and I.V. glucose for hypoglycemia. Close mon-itoring of electrolytes, blood chemistry, and blood pH is also done. What to do In stage I, follow these steps: \u0081 Assess hydration status.\u0081 Monitor skin turgor, mucous membranes, intake and output, and urine specific gravity. \u0081 Maintain a patent I.V. line for hydration. Respiratory inventory In stages II through V, follow these steps: \u0081 Assess respiratory status, noting changes in rate and pattern, presence of circumoral cyanosis, restlessness, or agitation. \u0081 Assess circulatory status by taking vital signs frequently. \u0081 Note skin color, temperature, and the presence of abnormal heart sounds or neck vein distention. Know your neuro In all stages, follow these steps: \u0081 Assess neurologic status.\u0081 Immediately report to the doctor signs of coma that require invasive, supportive therapy such as intubation. \u0081 Monitor LOC, pupil response, motor coordination, extremity movement, orientation, posturing, and seizure activity.\u0081 Support the child and his family. Explain treatments and proce- dures, incorporating family members in treatments as appropriate. Organize regular family and patient care conferences, and use sup-port services as needed.\u0081 Provide additional parental and community education to ensure early recognition and treatment.

Seizures can accompany a variety of disorders, or they may occur spontaneously without apparent cause. Epilepsy is a condition in which a person has spontaneously recurring seizures. What causes it The most common causes of seizure during the first 6 months of life are:\u0081 severe birth injury \u0081 congenital defects involving the CNS \u0081 infections\u0081 inborn errors of metabolism. Other causes include birth trauma (inadequate oxygen supply to the brain, blood incompatibility, or hemorrhage), infectious diseases (meningitis, encephalopathy, or brain abscess), ingestion disorders (hypoglycemia, hypo-calcemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, or hyperbilirubinemia), and high fever. How it happens In recurring seizures (epilepsy), a group of abnormal neurons seem to undergo spontaneous firing. Consciously electric Electrical discharges come from central areas in the brain that affect consciousness. The discharges may be localized in one area of the brain and cause responses specific to the anatomic focus controlled by that area. They may be initiated in a localized area of the brain and then spread to other areas, resulting in a general-ized response. Cellular excitement Hyperexcitable cells, called the epileptogenic focus , spontane- ously release the discharges. These discharges can be triggered by either environmental or physiologic stimuli, such as emotional stress, anxiety, fatigue, infection, or metabolic disturbances. What to look for Seizures can take various forms, depending on their origin and whether they're localized to one area of the brain (as in partial Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 258 Meadows-Oliver_Ch07.indd 258 5/22/14 7:35 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.259NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS seizures) or occur in both hemispheres (as in generalized seizures). If a partial seizure generalizes, it's still classified as a partial seizure. (See Classifying seizures, page 260.) What tests tell you A complete history, physical, and neurologic examination\u2014 including birth and development history, significant illnesses and injuries, family history, history of febrile seizures, and a comprehensive neurologic assessment\u2014should be performed. Laboratory and other tests include:\u0081 CBC and blood chemistry to detect electrolyte imbalances\u0081 blood glucose levels to detect hypoglycemic episodes \u0081 lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis as a cause of the seizures\u0081 EEG to help differentiate epileptic from nonepileptic seizures (each seizure has a characteristic EEG tracing). CT, MRI\u2014both can help identify If the child is taking anticonvulsants, blood levels should be moni- tored. Lead levels, toxicology screening, and radiologic tests, such as CT scanning or MRI, may be performed to identify structural lesions. Complications Complications from seizures include physical injury during the seizure, brain damage, and respiratory insufficiency or arrest. How it's treated Most children are treated with anticonvulsants, preferably a single medication to minimize adverse effects. Children who continue to have seizures with the single medication are treated with multiple anticonvulsants. Medication dosage adjustments are usually needed as the child grows. Serum drug levels are moni-tored to achieve therapeutic levels or when toxicity is possible. Surgery may be necessary to remove a tumor, lesion, or portion of the brain that has been identified as causing the seizure. Older children and adolescents may be candidates for a vagal nerve stimulator. Kudos for ketogenic A ketogenic diet may occasionally be used for children younger than age 8 years with myoclonic or absence seizures. A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, low-protein diet that causes ketosis as the body uses fat for metabolism. Ketosis is believed to slow the electrical impulses that cause seizures.

Instead, stay with the child and take appropriate measures to keep him safe.Keep it cool Children with febrile seizures may be treated with an anticonvul- sant throughout the presenting febrile illness; long-term anticon-vulsants aren't generally used. Parents are taught to lower fever by administering antipyretics and to keep the child cool. Rectal diazepam may be given during the seizure episode. What to do The nurse caring for a child who has seizures should focus on maintaining airway patency, ensuring safety, administering medications, observing and treating the seizure, educating the child and his parents, and providing psychosocial intervention. In addition, she should:\u0081 stay with the child during a seizure\u0081 move the child to a flat surface, out of danger; if he's standing, gently assist him to the floor \u0081 provide a patent airway and place the child on his side to allow saliva to drain out\u0081 avoid trying to interrupt the seizure (Instead, she should gently support the child's head and keep his hands from inflicting self-harm but not restrain him.)\u0081 pad the crib or bed rails to prevent physical injury. Out with the noise, in with the calm \u0081 reduce external stimuli and environmental noise \u0081 administer anticonvulsants as ordered by a doctor\u0081 record seizure activity, and assess neurologic status and vital signs after the seizure subsides \u0081 monitor serum levels of anticonvulsants to ensure therapeutic levels and prevent toxicity. A helping hand Having a seizure can be extremely frightening to a child; it can also be embarrassing, especially when a seizure occurs in the presence of peers. To the child's parents, and others who witness a seizure, the experience can be terrifying. The child and his parents need a great deal of education and emotional support:\u0081 Instruct the parents (and the child, if old enough) in all as- pects of seizure control measures such as how to control fever if the child has febrile seizures.\u0081 Stress to the parents the need to treat the child as normally as possible.\u0081 Encourage the parents and the child to express their fears and anxieties; answer their questions honestly.

Quick quiz 1. A child who had bacterial meningitis is scheduled to have his hearing tested before discharge. The mother asks the nurse why the test is necessary. The most appropriate nursing re-sponse is: A. \"It's necessary to make sure your child is developing appropriately.\" B. \"The test will identify attention deficit problems related to your child's illness.\" C. \"It's necessary to make sure the steroid therapy your child had in the hospital didn't affect his ability to hear.\" D. \"Despite treatment, some children with bacterial men- ingitis suffer neurologic damage, especially to the nerve responsible for hearing.\" Answer: D. The most common neurologic complications of meningitis are hearing loss, mental retardation, seizures, visual impairment, and behavioral problems. 2. A nurse is caring for a 2-year-old child with a VP shunt. Assessment indicates the child is afebrile but irritable and less responsive than he was previously. The most appropriate nursing action is to: A. lower the head of the bed and position the child on his stomach. B. increase the oxygen to 100%. C. increase the fluids the child is receiving.D. notify the doctor. Answer: D. The nurse should notify the doctor of indications of increased ICP, including irritability and lethargy.

Upon assessment, his vital signs are temperature of 104\u00b0 F (40\u00b0 C), respirations at 26 breaths/minute, pulse at 120 beats/minute, and blood pressure of 90/69 mm Hg. The nurse should: A. give a tepid sponge bath. B. administer phenytoin (Dilantin).C. do an Accu-Check.D. aggressively hydrate the child with I.V. fluids. Answer: A. An elevated temperature could lead to a febrile sei- zure. The nurse should intervene to lower the core body tempera-ture by offering oral fluids, giving the child a tepid sponge bath, and administering doctor-ordered antipyretics. 4. A 9-year-old is admitted with weakness in his legs and a history of the flu. He's diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The nurse must notify the doctor immediately if what symptom is observed? A. Tingling in the hands B. Increasing hoarsenessC. Weak muscle tone in the armsD. Weak muscle tone in the feet Answer: B. The most serious complication of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syn- drome is respiratory failure, which occurs as paralysis progresses to the nerves that innervate the thoracic area. Increasing hoarse-ness may be a sign of impending respiratory distress. Scoring If you answered all four items correctly, fantastic! There's no deficit in your understanding of neurologic problems.

After all, it's my impressive physique that allows me to pump blood throughout the entire body.Anatomy and physiology Understanding cardiovascular problems in children requires a sound, working knowledge of normal cardiac structure and function. Structures of the heart The heart is a muscular organ located behind the sternum in the chest and covered by a sac called the pericardium . Its main purpose is to pump blood throughout the body by continuous rhythmic contractions. The heart is composed of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) and four valves. Heart chambers The four chambers of the heart are the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles. Atria The atria serve as reservoirs during ventricular contraction (sys-tole) and as pumps during ventricular relaxation Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.265ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY A look inside the heart Within the heart lie four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) and four valves (two atrioventricular and two semilunar valves). A system of blood vessels carries blood to and from the heart. Superior vena cava Branches of right pulmonary artery Right atrium Right pulmonary veins Tricuspid valve Chordae tendineae arch Pulmonic semilunar valve Branches of left pulmonary artery Left atrium Left pulmonary veins Mitral valve Aortic semilunar valve Left ventricle Interventricular septum Myocardium Descending aorta right atrium and are separated by an atrial septum . Ventricles The left ventricle propels blood through the aorta to the rest of the body. The right ventricle sends blood through the pul-monary artery to the lungs. The ventricles are separated by an interventricular septum . Equal at birth At birth, the ventricles are relatively equal in size because of low- resistance placental circulation. When the left ventricle begins functioning against systemic resistance that increases after birth, however, it becomes thicker than the right ventricle. (See A look inside the heart .)

All Rights Reserved.266CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Heart valves The heart has four valves: tricuspid valve mitral valve aortic valve mitral valves The tricuspid and mitral valves are known as the atrioventricular (AV) valves . They prevent blood backflow from the ventricles to the atria during ventricular contraction. Location, leaflets, and muscles The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and ven- tricle. It has three leaflets, or cusps, and three papillary muscles. The mitral valve is situated between the left atrium and ventricle. It has two leaflets and two papillary muscles. Lovely leaflets The leaflets of both the tricuspid and the mitral valve are attached to the papillary muscles of the ventricles by thin, fibrous bands pulmonic valves aortic valves are known as the semilunar valves . These valves prevent backflow of blood from the aorta and pulmonary artery into the ventricles during ventricular relaxa- tion. The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta. The pulmonic valve is located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Circulation Blood is returned to the heart via the veins. Veins are small, thin-walled blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood from the capillaries to the heart. A long day's journey Blood enters the right atrium from the inferior and superior vena cavae and then goes into the right ventricle. From there, it's pumped into the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it gains oxygen and loses carbon dioxide.

Who could ask for anything more?Return to sender The pulmonary veins bring the oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium. The oxygenated blood then passes into the left ventricle, is pumped into the aorta, and is delivered to the rest of the body via the arteries. Arteries are large, thick-walled blood vessels that distribute oxygenated blood to the capillaries. Pulmonary role reversal The pulmonary artery is the only artery in the body that carries deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins are the only veins in the body that carry oxygenated blood. Conduction system The heart's conduction system is an electrical system that initiates myocardial contractions to move blood through the heart and maintain its rhythmic pumping action. This system is composed of several specialized cells: \u0081 The sinoatrial node (also called the pacemaker of the heart ) is located within the right atrial wall near the opening of the superior vena cava. It initiates electrical impulses and sends them throughout the atria. \u0081 The AV node is located within the right atrium near the lower end of the septum. It transmits impulses from the atria to the ventricle. Bundles and branches \u0081 The AV bundle (bundle of His) extends from the AV node to each side of the interventricular septum and divides into right and left bundle branches. It facilitates rapid conduction of the impulses through the ventricles. \u0081 The Purkinje fibers extend from the AV bundle into the walls of the ventricles and rapidly conduct impulses through the heart muscle. Cardiac physiology The heart's primary purpose is to pump the blood that delivers oxygen and nutrients to tissues throughout the body and to re-move waste products such as carbon dioxide. To do this, the heart must maintain an adequate cardiac output. Cardiac output is the amount of blood ejected by the heart in 1 minute. Cardiac output can be determined by multiplying the heart rate in 1 minute by the stroke volume. Stroke volume Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 267 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 267 5/22/14 7:45 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.268CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Right now I get all the oxygen I need from the placenta. But as soon as I get out of here, my lungs will take over.is the amount of blood ejected by the heart at each heartbeat (or contraction). Stroke volume is affected by three factors: Preload , or the stretch of the myocardial fibers, is simply the circulating blood volume. Afterload is the resistance against which the ventricle must pump during its contraction, which can be affected by blood pressure. (Hypertension will increase afterload, as the heart must pump harder to force blood into circulation.) Contractility is the force of left ventricular ejection. Chillin' with homeostasis To maintain homeostasis, the body will make many adjustments to the factors that contribute to cardiac output. Cardiac adaptations at birth During fetal circulation, blood is oxygenated and waste products are removed in the placenta. Blood is shunted away from those organs that aren't yet fully functional, such as the lungs and the liver. P erfusion only\u2014no exchange In the fetus, the lungs are filled with fluid and aren't yet the site of gas exchange. The amount of blood that passes through the lungs is just enough to perfuse lung tissue. Farewell placenta, hello lungs! At birth, however, the neonate must transition from a reli-ance on the placenta to a reliance on his lungs for oxygen-ation. This transition is normally accomplished within the first few breaths after birth. Many keys, one lock Key structures that maintain fetal circulation include: \u0081 umbilical vein , which carries oxygenated blood from the pla- centa to the fetus \u0081 umbilical arteries , which carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta \u0081 foramen ovale , which serves as the septal atria of the fetal heart \u0081 ductus arteriosus , which connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the fetal lungs Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 268 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 268 5/22/14 7:45 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.269ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY After only a few breaths, I'm breathing oxygen, dilating my pulmonary vessels, and sending more blood to my lungs. How about me!\u0081 ductus venosus , which carries oxygenated blood from vein to the inferior vena cava (IVC), bypassing the liver. Out with fluid, in with air Cardiac adaptations at birth occur gradually, resulting from structural and pressure changes in the lungs, heart, and major vessels. With the first few breaths after birth, the fluid in the neonate's lungs is absorbed and replaced with air. Inspired oxygen dilates the pulmonary vessels, resulting in decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and increased pulmonary blood flow as the lungs fill with air and expand. More blood will now travel to and from the lungs. The drama unfolds The pressure in the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmo- nary artery decreases. Simultaneously, a gradual increase in systemic vascular resistance occurs when the umbilical cord is clamped and the low-resistance placental circula- tion is removed. At that point, left atrial pressure increases more than right atrial pressure. The foramen ovale, which was a one-way door, closes as a result of this unequal pres- sure. The ductus arteriosus begins to close because of increased pulmonary blood flow and the dramatic reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance. Later, the ductus arteriosus (and ductus venosus) will become ligaments and will be closed structurally. Out of a job Function of the foramen ovale ceases immediately or soon after birth. Ductus arteriosus functioning ceases after the infant is about 4 days old. Anatomic closure, however, takes considerably longer. If the foramen ovale or ductus arteriosus fails to close, persistent shunting of fetal blood away from lungs will result. (See From fetal to neonatal circulation , page 270.) Murmurs Murmurs are produced by vibrations within the chambers of the heart or major arteries from the back-and-forth flowing of blood through these structures. In children, murmurs may be called: \u0081 innocent , which means there's no anatomic or physiologic cause \u0081 functional when there's a physiologic cause, such as anemia, but no anatomic abnormality \u0081 organic when there's some anatomic defect in the heart, with or without the existence a All Rights Reserved.270CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Sit, stand, recline When auscultating for murmurs, position the child in the sitting and reclining positions. Also, auscultate the heart with the child standing, sitting and leaning forward, and in a left side-lying posi- tion. (See Grading murmurs .) Diagnostic tests Diagnostic tests of the cardiovascular system in children include: \u0081 echocardiography\u0081 electrocardiography (ECG) \u0081 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Echocardiography Echocardiography is used to evaluate cardiac structures and func- tions using echoes from pulsed, high-frequency sound waves. An ultrasound transducer is placed on the chest, and the sound waves From fetal to neonatal circulation These illustrations show the changes in circulation that occur at birth, allowing all neonatal blood to pass through the lungs. Fetal circulation 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.271DIAGNOSTIC TESTS produce an image of the heart. The test is noninvasive and painless and is one of the most commonly used tests to detect cardiac problems in children. Ultrasound-endoscopy combo Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) combines ultra-sound with endoscopy. It's an alternative method for detect-ing cardiovascular problems in children and is used when the transthoracic approach isn't possible or would be difficult. Dur- ing the procedure, the transducer is passed into the esophagus to an area behind the atria. The procedure is more complicated than the transthoracic approach and may require sedation and intubation to preserve the airway in young children. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the child and his parents; tell the child what he'll see, hear, and feel and be honest about any pain or discomfort he might experience. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Stress the importance of holding still during the test and assist as necessary. (Tell the child that holding still is his \"very important job.\") \u0081 Administer mild sedation if needed. Use distractions such as a videotape to help calm the child.\u0081 For TEE, administer sedation as ordered and assist with en-dotracheal intubation as necessary. Explain that the child must have nothing to eat or drink before the procedure. Electrocardiography ECG provides a graphic representation of the heart's electri- cal activity. It's used to detect the presence of ischemia, injury, necrosis, bundle-branch block, fascicular blocks, conduction delay, chamber enlargement, and arrhythmias. Nursing considerations Explain the test to the child and his parents, stressing that there's no pain involved. In addition:\u0081 Describe the equipment that will be used for the test; show the child a picture or, if possible, the actual equipment. \u0081 Explain that the child may have to lie on his left side, inhale and exhale slowly, or hold his breath at intervals during the test. \u0081 Encourage the child to be still during the test; he may sit on his parent's lap if necessary.Grading murmurs Use the system outlined here to de-scribe the intensity of a murmur. When recording your find- ings, use Roman numerals as part of a fraction, always with \"VI\" as the denominator. For example, a grade III murmur would be recorded as \"grade III/VI.\" Grade I is a barely audible murmur. Grade II is audible but quiet and soft. Grade III is moderately loud, without a thrust or thrill. Grade IV is loud, with a thrill. Grade V is very loud, with a thrust or a thrill. Grade VI is loud enough to be heard before the stethoscope comes into contact with the chest. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 271 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 271 5/22/14 7:45 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.272CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Magnetic resonance imaging MRI uses magnetic fields and radio frequencies to show a cross- sectional view of the heart and its structures. It's useful in identify-ing some congenital heart defects. MRI is generally a noninvasive test; however, contrast media may be used. Nursing considerations When explaining the test to the child, show him a picture of the scanner or, whenever possible, let the child see the actual scanner. Tell the child that no pain is involved; prepare him if contrast media must be used. In addition: \u0081 Tell the child that his parents may stay in the room with him during the scan.\u0081 Prepare the child for the movements and the loud, clicking noises made by the scanner; reassure him that the machine won't touch him. \u0081 Because no metal can go in the scanner, assist the child in re-moving hair clips, jewelry, and other metal items as necessary.\u0081 If necessary, provide sedation to ensure that the child remains still during the test.\u0081 Assess for a history of iodine or seafood allergies before the procedure if a contrast medium is to be used. Exercise testing Exercise testing may be done for some children, depending on their age and general condition. With it, the child's doctor can evaluate the extent of disease from any heart or lung disease that may be present. In addition, it can help to determine what kinds of activity ease or aggravate the child's condition, as well as his or her conditioning, both aerobic and musculoskeletal. Either a treadmill or a stationary bike may be used while the child's heart and respiratory rate are monitored. The blood pressure and pulse oximetry are also monitored during the exercise test. Nursing considerations Most children know what a bicycle looks like, but they may not be familiar with the concept of a stationary bike. They may not recog-nize a treadmill at all. So, good instructions and explanations may be necessary. Pictures or other visual aids may be helpful. Let the child know that there will be monitoring equipment, which may contain several wires that may be attached to him or her. Assure the child that there is no pain involved. In addition: \u0081 The child's parents may remain in the room with the child, unless the child prefers to test alone (a possibility for an older school-age child or an adolescent). Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 272 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 272 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.273TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \u0081 Be sure the child knows that the doctor needs to be notified right away if there is any discomfort, or if there is any difficulty keeping up with the exercise. Treatments and procedures Treatments and procedures used for cardiac problems in child-hood include:\u0081 valve replacement \u0081 cardiac catheterization \u0081 cardiac surgery\u0081 cardiac transplantation. Teach expectations Many of the treatments and procedures done for children with cardiac problems involve surgery. When a child knows what to expect before a surgical procedure, he'll be less frightened, more cooperative, and more trusting of the nurses who provide his care. (See Preparing children for surgery, page 274.) Valve replacement Valve replacement with a prosthetic valve is indicated for heart valve narrowing (stenosis) and heart valve leaking (insufficiency). Valvular problems are commonly caused by rheumatic fever and congenital heart defects. They may also be caused by heart failure and infective endocarditis. Nursing considerations Nursing interventions focus on monitoring and educating the patient and his parents.\u0081 After surgery, monitor for hypotension, arrhythmias, and throm- bus formation. \u0081 Monitor vital signs, arterial blood gas (ABG) values, intake, out-put, daily weight, blood chemistries, chest X-rays, and pulmonary artery catheter readings. Heed the signs \u0081 Because lifelong anticoagulant therapy will be necessary, teach the parents (and the child, if old enough) to recognize the signs and symptoms of bleeding, including black, tarry stools (from GI bleeding); oral bleeding (a small, soft bristle toothbrush should be used to prevent this); and excessive bleeding from minor cuts and scrapes.

All Rights Reserved.274CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Preparing children for surgery Many of the interventions performed for cardiac problems involve major surgery. What a child imagines about surgery is likely much more frightening than the reality. A child who knows what to expect ahead of time will be less fearful and more cooperative and will learn to trust his caregivers. A child who's well prepared for medical procedures is much less likely to experience emotional trauma, which can have long-lasting effects. Developmental concerns Many of the concerns that children may have about hospitalization and surgery relate to their particular stage of development. Infants, toddlers, and preschoolers \u0081 Infants and toddlers are most concerned about separation from their parents. Stranger anxiety may make a necessary separation (during surgery) especially difficult.\u0081 Because toddlers think concretely, showing is a necessary adjunct to telling when preparing a toddler for surgery.\u0081 Preschoolers may view medical procedures, including surgeries, as punishments for some type of perceived bad behavior.\u0081 Preschoolers are also likely to have many misconceptions about what will happen during surgery. School-age children \u0081 School-age children have concerns about fitting in with peers and may view surgery as something that sets them apart from their friends.\u0081 A desire to appear \"grown up\" may make the school-age child reluctant to express his fears.\u0081 Because this age is a time when children are especially curious and interested in learning, school-age children are very receptive to preopera-tive teaching and will likely ask many important questions (although they may need to be given the \"permission\" to do so). Adolescents \u0081 Adolescents struggle with the conflict between wanting to assert their inde-pendence and needing their parents (and other adults) to take care of them during illness and treatment.\u0081 Adolescents may want to discuss their illness and treatment without a parent present.\u0081 In addition, adolescents may have a hard time admitting that they're afraid or experiencing pain or discomfort. Before surgery Whenever the situation permits, ar-range for the child to visit the hospital before he's admitted for surgery. Ideally, the formal preparation for surgery is done during the preadmis-sion visit. Explanations should be honest and age-appropriate and should involve the parents (unless the adolescent would rather be prepared alone). The explana-tion should focus on what the child will see, hear, and feel; where his parents will be waiting for him; and when they'll be reunited. If a child will initially be cared for in an intensive care setting, allow him to visit the area ahead of time and to meet some of the nurses who will be caring for him. Prepare him for the equipment and the other patients he'll see.Principles of preparation Here are some principles to keep in mind when preparing a child for surgery:\u0081 Begin by asking the child to tell you what he thinks is going to happen dur-ing his surgery.\u0081 Ask the child about worries or fears. He may be worried about something that isn't going to happen at all.\u0081 Provide a developmentally appropriate explanation of why the surgery is being performed; encourage the child to ask questions. Pictures or illustrations can be very helpful in assisting the child to understand the explanations.\u0081 Reassure the child that he won't wake up during the surgery but that the doctor knows how and when to wake him up afterward.\u0081 Show the child an induction mask (if it will be used) and allow him to \"prac-tice\" by placing it on his face (or yours).\u0081 Prepare the child for equipment (moni-tors, drains, and intravenous [I.V.] injec-tions, for example) he'll wake up with.\u0081 Tell the child about the sights and sounds of the operating room.\u0081 Tell the child that his doctor and nurse will be in the operating room with him. Reassure him that they'll talk to him and tell him what's happening.\u0081 If possible, show the child where he'll be waking up in the recovery room and where his parents will be waiting for him.\u0081 Tell the child it's perfectly fine to be afraid and to cry.\u0081 After the surgery, encourage the child to talk about the experience; he may also express his feelings through art or play. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 274 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 274 5/22/14 7:45 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.275TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \"Performing\" a procedure on a \"friend\" gives the child a sense of control and helps him learn what to expect\u2014in a non- threatening way.\u0081 Stress to the child and parents the importance of antibiotic ther- apy before dental work and other invasive procedures to prevent infective endocarditis. Children who undergo valve replacement will always need this type of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. \u0081 Teach the child and parents the importance of good oral hygiene to reduce the risk of oral infection, which may lead to bacteremia.\u0081 Inform the child and parents that clicking of the mechanical heart valve may be heard outside of the chest. Reinforce that this sound is normal. Cardiac catheterization Cardiac catheterization is performed with a radiopaque catheter that's passed through the femoral artery directly into the heart and lungs. It may also be performed in conjunction with angiography, in which a radiopaque contrast medium is injected through the catheter into the circulation, allowing visualization of blood circu-lation through the heart chambers. Measure for measure Cardiac catheterization is used to evaluate ventricular function and measure heart chamber pressures and oxygen saturation in the blood. It also serves as a method for obtaining cardiac muscle biopsy specimens and for performing electrophysiologic studies. Complications Complications of cardiac catheterization include acute hemor- rhage, transient arrhythmias, temporary diminished cir-culation to the catheterized extremity because of clot or hematoma formation, allergic reaction to the contrast me- dium, nausea and vomiting, and the possibility of infection. Nursing considerations Nursing interventions for cardiac catheterization begin when the procedure is scheduled and continue throughout the recovery period. Before the procedure Before catheterization, nursing interventions focus on preparing the child for the procedure, both physically and emotionally.\u0081 Describe to the child and parents the procedure room as well as the equipment that will be used during the proce- dure. Show the child where on his body the catheter will be inserted, using doll play to prepare him, as necessary. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 275 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 275 5/22/14 7:45 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.276CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS \u0081 Tell the child that the lights in the room will be dimmed after the catheter is placed. Reassure him that you'll be right there with him and will talk to him throughout the procedure. \u0081 Tell the child that he may feel warm after the contrast medium is injected.\u0081 Weigh the child and take his vital signs.\u0081 Assess the child's color, temperature of his extremities, and pulses. Mark the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses with indelible ink before the procedure, allowing for easy assess-ment after the procedure. After the procedure After catheterization, nursing care focuses on preventing com- plications, monitoring the catheterized extremity, and ensuring adequate fluid intake. \u0081 Keep the affected extremity immobile to prevent hemorrhage, usually for 4 to 6 hours after the procedure.\u0081 Keep the catheter site clean and dry; monitor for bleeding and hematoma formation. \u0081 Compare postcatheterization assessment data to precatheteriza- tion baseline data, paying special attention to pulses and neuro-vascular status in the catheterized extremity.\u0081 Ensure adequate fluid intake (I.V. and oral) to compensate for blood loss during the procedure and the diuretic action of some contrast media used. Doing so will also aid in flushing the contrast medium from the circulation. \u0081 Because cardiac catheterization is commonly done on an out- patient basis, provide thorough postprocedure teaching for the parents. (See Instructions after cardiac catheterization .) Cardiac surgery Treatment of almost all congenital heart defects is achieved through cardiac surgery. The specific procedure performed will depend on the defect. Even so, certain methods are used no mat- ter which procedure is performed. Heart-lung vacation Cardiopulmonary bypass machines are typically used to oxygen- ate body tissues because surgery may necessitate stopping the heart. During the procedure, the patient is placed in a hypother- mic state to minimize blood loss (which enhances patient recov- ery) and to reduce the body's need for oxygen. An incision into the chest (thoracotomy) is commonly performed, and chest tubes are placed. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 276 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 276 5/22/14 7:45 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Nursing considerations Prepare the child (and his parents) for what he'll see, hear, and feel after surgery. When a child and his parents know ahead of time that certain events are \"normal,\" those events will be less stressful and frightening when they occur. \u0081 Monitor the patient's heart rate closely. (It will normally in-crease after surgery.) Changes in regularity and rhythm should be reported to the doctor immediately. \u0081 Auscultate the lungs every hour, assessing for diminished or absent breath sounds, which may require further medical evalua-tion and intervention. Keep the heat \u0081 Keep the child warm to prevent heat loss. (Infants may be placed under radiant heat warmers.)\u0081 Monitor body temperature closely. It may rise to about 100\u00b0 F (37.8\u00b0 C) in the first 48 hours after surgery due to the inflamma- tory process initiated by tissue trauma. (Further temperature elevation may indicate an infection, requiring immediate action to determine the cause.)It's all relative Instructions after cardiac catheterization Cardiac catheterizations are commonly performed on an outpatient basis. Provide parents with these clear instructions about caring for their child at home:\u0081 Remove the pressure dressing the day after the procedure.\u0081 Keep the site covered with an adhesive bandage for several days after the procedure.\u0081 Keep the insertion site clean and dry; give only sponge baths until the site is healed. \u0081 Observe the site for redness, swelling, drainage, and bleeding.\u0081 Monitor the child's temperature, and report fever promptly.\u0081 Have the child avoid strenuous exercise.\u0081 Provide a regular diet for the child.\u0081 Administer acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for discomfort or Keep 277 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.278CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Advice from the experts Chest tube removal Follow these guidelines to prepare the child for chest tube removal and to reduce compli-cations:\u0081 Tell the child he'll experience momentary sharp pain as the chest tube is removed. \u0081 Administer anesthetics or analgesics as or-dered.\u0081 Instruct the child to take a deep breath. (The tube should be removed at the end of inspiration.)\u0081 Cover the wound with sterile petroleum gauze, topped with a clear, occlusive film dressing, such as Tegaderm, making sure all sides are securely attached to the skin for an airtight seal. \u0081 Monitor the site for drainage, bleeding, and infection. Change the dressing according to your facility's policy. \u0081 Maintain mechanical ventilation of the child in the immediate postoperative period. Extubation may occur in the operating room or in the early postoperative period. \u0081 After extubation, an oxygen mask, hood, or tent or nasal can- nula is used to deliver humidified oxygen. If the patient is in an oxygen tent, change his linens and clothes frequently to keep them dry, preventing excessive chilling that would increase metabolic needs and, consequently, increase cardiac and oxygen demand. Turn and breathe \u0081 Implement turning and deep breathing hourly, using adjunct analgesics and splinting of the incision to minimize discom-fort and pain. Firm stuffed animals can be used effectively for incisional support during deep-breathing and spirometry exercises.\u0081 Prepare the child for chest tube removal (typically between the first and third postoperative day), which can be a painful and frightening procedure for a child. Topical anesthetics or analge- sics are commonly administered before removal. (See Chest tube removal .) Rx: TLC \u0081 Provide emotional support and comfort because surgery can be frightening as well as painful to the child. (Encourage parental involvement in the child's care to foster feelings of comfort and security.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 278 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 278 5/22/14 7:45 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.279TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \u0081 Provide detailed discharge teaching. (See Teaching about cardiac surgery .) Cardiac transplantation For infants and children with worsening heart failure and limited life expectancy, heart transplantation has become an option. Indications for transplantation in children include cardiomyopathy and end-stage congenital heart disease. One of two There are two surgical options for cardiac transplantation: \u0081 orthotopic procedure , in which the diseased heart is removed in its entirety and a new, healthy heart from a donor (who has been declared brain dead) is implanted \u0081 heterotopic procedure (rarely performed in children), in which the patient's own heart is kept in place and a \"piggyback\" heart is implanted to serve as an additional pumping organ to assist the diseased heart. Who knows UNOS? The process begins by placing the child on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) list to match a donor with the recipient. Due to limited donor supply, 30% of infants on the UNOS list die before a new heart can be found for them. Approximately 300 to 400 transplants are performed per year on pediatric patients. Crucial 6 months Complications are most common during the first 6 months to 1 year after transplantation. During this period, the family must adjust to a totally new lifestyle that will require lifelong man- agement. The leading cause of demise after heart transplanta- tion is organ rejection. Because lifelong immunosuppressive therapy is required, infection is always a risk. Nursing considerations The child and his parents must be prepared thoroughly for this major procedure. Preparation should include a brief visit to the coronary intensive care unit (CICU) and, if possible, the child should be introduced to the nurses who will be providing his care. Parents should be made aware of the visiting policies in the CICU and should be assisted in making arrangements (in the hospital and at home) to spend as much time with their child as possible.It's all relative Teaching about cardiac surgery Be sure to include these points in your teaching plan for the parents of a child who has undergone cardiac surgery:\u0081 dietary restric-tions, if any\u0081 fluid requirements and restrictions\u0081 activity and exer-cise restrictions\u0081 operative site care and inspection\u0081 medication regi-men\u0081 follow-up tests and doctor visits\u0081 home care needs\u0081 importance of en-couraging the child to talk and express his feelings about the surgery and hospitalization.

Teach patients to go slowly, and intersperse gradual activity increases with lots of rest.The hard part is over Postoperative care involves: \u0081 monitoring the patient closely for signs of rejection, infection, and adverse reactions from immunosuppres- sive therapy \u0081 restricting fluids as ordered to prevent hypervolemia and heart strain\u0081 providing adequate rest periods with gradual activity increases to further decrease the workload of the heart \u0081 encouraging compliance with the complex drug regimen required, especially in adolescents\u0081 providing emotional support to the child and family and offering resources for additional support\u0081 helping the parents (and the child, if age appropriate) come to terms with the reality that someone had to die for a heart to become available. (This concept is too confusing and upsetting for most young children; par-ents should be encouraged to provide age-appropriate explanations when the child begins to ask where his new heart came from.) Congenital heart defects that increase pulmonary blood flow Congenital heart defects that increase pulmonary blood flow include atrial septal defect (ASD), (VSD). Atrial septal defect In a child with ASD, an opening between the left and right atria allows blood to flow from the left side of the heart to the right side, resulting in ineffective pumping of the heart, thus increasing the risk of heart failure. (See Looking at ASD .) ASDs come in threes The three types of ASDs are: ostium secundum defect , the most common type, which occurs in the region of the fossa ovalis at the center of the atrial septum and, occasionally, extends inferiorly, close to the vena cava sinus venosus defect , which occurs in the superior-posterior portion of the atrial septum, sometimes extends 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.281CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS THAT INCREASE PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW and is almost always associated with abnormal drainage of pulmonary veins into the right atrium ostium primum defect , which occurs in the inferior portion of the septum primum and is usually associated with AV valve abnormalities (cleft mitral valve) and conduction defects. Benign when small ASD accounts for about 10% of congenital heart defects and is almost twice as common in females as in males, with a strong familial tendency. Although an ASD is usually a benign defect during infancy and childhood, delayed development of symp- toms and complications makes it one of the most common congenital heart defects diagnosed in adults. The prognosis is excellent for asymptomatic patients and for those with uncomplicated surgical repair. The prognosis is poor, however, in patients with cyanosis caused by large, untreated defects. What causes it The cause of ASD is unknown. Ostium primum defects commonly occur in patients with Down syndrome. How it happens In ASD, blood shunts from the left atrium to the right atrium because the left atrial pressure is normally slightly higher than the right atrial pressure. The difference in pressure forces large amounts of blood through the defect. This shunt results in right heart volume overload, affecting the right atrium, right ven-tricle, and pulmonary arteries. Enlarge and dilate Eventually, the right atrium enlarges, and the right ventricle dilates to accommodate the increased blood volume. If pul-monary artery hypertension develops, increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular hypertrophy follow. What to look for Signs and symptoms of ASD include: \u0081 fatigue after exertion\u0081 early to midsystolic murmur at the second or third left inter- costal space \u0081 low-pitched diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border (more pronounced on inspiration)Looking at ASD An ASD is an open- ing between the left and right atria that allows blood to flow from the left side of the heart to the right side, as shown here. Atrial septal defect Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 281 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.282CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS \u0081 fixed, widely split S 2 due to delayed closure of the pulmonic valve \u0081 systolic click or late systolic murmur and cyanosis right-to-left shunt develops. (See Cyanosis and crying .) What tests tell you A history of increasing fatigue and characteristic physical features suggest ASD. These tests confirm the diagnosis:\u0081 Chest X-ray shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, a prominent pulmonary artery, and increased pulmonary vascular markings.\u0081 ECG results may be normal but commonly show right-axis deviation, prolonged PR interval, varying degrees of right bundle- branch block, right ventricular hypertrophy, measures right ventricular enlargement, may locate the defect, and shows volume overload in the right side of the heart. (It may also reveal right ventricular and pulmonary artery dilation.)\u0081 Two-dimensional echocardiography with color and contrast echocardiography have supplanted cardiac catheter- ization as the confirming tests for ASD. (Cardiac catheterization is used if inconsistencies exist in the clinical data or if significant pulmonary hypertension is suspected.) Complications Complications of ASD may include physical underdevelopment, respiratory infections, heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, and mitral valve prolapse. How it's treated Operative repair is advised for uncomplicated ASD with evidence of significant left-to-right shunting. Ideally, this is performed when the patient is between ages 2 and 4. An operative repair shouldn't be performed on a patient with a small defect and trivial left-to- right shunt. Procrastination preferred Because ASD seldom produces complications in an infant or tod- dler, surgery can be delayed until preschool or early school age. A large defect may need immediate surgical closure with sutures or a patch graft. Alternatively, placement of an atrial occluder during cardiac catheterization is becoming a more common intervention than open-heart surgery.Cyanosis and crying An infant may be cyanotic because he has a cardiac or pulmonary disorder. Cyanosis that worsens with crying is most likely as-sociated with cardiac causes because crying increases pul- monary resis-tance to blood flow, resulting in an increased right-to-left shunt. Cyanosis that improves with crying is most likely due to pulmonary causes because deep breathing improves tidal volume.

For the child with ASD, we're the first line of defense against the evil endocarditis! What to do Before cardiac catheterization, explain pretest and posttest procedures to the child and his parents. Whenever possible, use drawings or other visual aids to enhance the explanation. \u0081 As needed, teach the parents (and child) about anti biotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis.\u0081 If surgery is scheduled, prepare the child and his parents for what they'll experience in the intensive care unit and introduce them to the staff. Show the parents where they can wait during the operation, and explain postoperative proce-dures, tubes, dressings, and monitoring equipment.\u0081 After surgery, closely monitor the patient's vital signs, central venous and intra-arterial pressures, and intake and output. (Watch for atrial arrhythmias, which may remain uncorrected.) Patent ductus arteriosus The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that connects the pul- monary artery to the descending aorta, just distal to the left subcla-vian artery. Normally, the ductus closes within days after birth. In PDA, the lumen of the ductus remains open after birth. This defect creates a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to the pulmo-nary artery and results in recirculation of blood through the lungs. P ostdated PDA Initially, PDA may not produce clinical effects. Over time, how- ever, it can precipitate pulmonary vascular disease, causing symptoms to appear by age 40. PDA affects twice as many females as males. (See Looking at PDA, page 284.) Smaller is better In PDA, prognosis is good if the shunt is small or surgical repair is effective. Otherwise, PDA may advance to intractable heart failure, which may be fatal. What causes it PDA is associated with:\u0081 premature birth, probably as a result of abnormalities in oxy-genation or the relaxant action of prostaglandin E, which prevents ductal spasm and contracture necessary 2015 Wolters Kluwer. Rights Reserved.284CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS How it happens The ductus arteriosus normally closes as prostaglandin levels from the placenta fall and oxygen levels rise. This process should begin as soon as the neonate takes his first breath but may take as long as 3 months in some children. Back to the aorta In PDA, relative resistance in pulmonary and systemic vascula- ture and the size of the ductus determine the quantity of blood that's shunted from left to right. Because of increased aortic pressure, oxygenated blood is shunted from the aorta through the ductus arteriosus to the pulmonary artery and the lungs. The blood returns to the left side of the heart and is pumped out to the aorta once more. The left atrium and left ventricle must accommodate the in- creased pulmonary venous return by increasing filling pressure and workload on the left side of the heart. This compensation causes left-sided hypertrophy and, possibly, heart failure. Reverse to cyanosis In the final stages of untreated PDA, the left-to-right shunt leads to chronic pulmonary artery hypertension that becomes fixed and unreactive. This condition causes the shunt to re- verse so that unoxygenated blood enters systemic circulation, causing cyanosis. What to look for Signs and symptoms of PDA may include: \u0081 respiratory distress with signs of heart failure in infants, especially those who are premature \u0081 classic machinery murmur (Gibson murmur), a continuous murmur heard throughout systole and diastole\u0081 thrill palpated at the left sternal left impulse \u0081 bounding peripheral pulses widened pulse pressure\u0081 slow motor development\u0081 failure to thrive\u0081 fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, which may develop in adults with undetected PDA. What tests tell you These tests help diagnose PDA: \u0081 Chest X-rays may show increased pulmonary vascular mark-ings, prominent pulmonary arteries, and enlargement of the left ventricle and aorta.Looking at PDA In PDA, the lumen of the ductus arteriosus stays open after birth, causing a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, resulting in recir-culation of arterial blood through the lungs. This shunt reversal (from fetal circulation) occurs because of the lower pres-sure in the lungs and pulmonary artery after birth.

All Rights Reserved.285CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS THAT INCREASE PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW Plug up the ductus! In a child with a PDA, shunting can sometimes be stopped by inserting an \"umbrella,\" or plug.\u0081 ECG may be normal or may indicate left atrial or ventricular hypertrophy and, in pulmonary vascular disease, biventricular hypertrophy. \u0081 Echocardiography detects and estimates the size of a PDA. It also reveals an enlarged left atrium and left ventricle or right ven-tricular hypertrophy from pulmonary vascular disease. Complications Possible complications of PDA may include infective endocarditis, heart failure, and recurrent pneumonia. How it's treated Correction of PDA may involve:\u0081 indomethacin (Indocin), a prostaglandin inhibitor, to induce ductus spasm and closure in premature infants \u0081 As an alternative to indomethacin (Indocin), some facilities are using ibuprofen, with findings of equally good closure of the PDA but fewer renal side effects and complications. \u0081 left thoracotomy to ligate the ductus if medical manage-ment can't control heart failure (asymptomatic infants with PDA don't require immediate treatment; if symptoms are mild, surgical ligation of the PDA is usually delayed until the child is 1 year old)\u0081 visual assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to ligate the ductus as an alternative to surgery with a thoracotomy (VATS may be done at the bedside or in a procedure room and in- volves three small incisions in the left chest through which a clip is placed on the ductus) \u0081 Alternatively, procedures can be done through a cardiac catheterization to block the flow of blood through the duc-tus by inserting umbrella or coil-type devices into the ends of the ductus, thus blocking the shunt. \u0081 prophylactic antibiotics to protect against infective endocarditis\u0081 treatment of heart failure with fluid restriction, diuretics, and digoxin What to do PDA necessitates careful monitoring, patient and family teaching, and emotional support.\u0081 Watch carefully for signs of PDA in all premature neonates. \u0081 Be alert for respiratory distress symptoms resulting from heart failure, which may develop rapidly in a premature neonate. Fre-quently assess vital signs, ECG, electrolyte levels, and intake and output and document the child's response to diuretics and other therapy. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 285 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd Kluwer. Rights Reserved.286CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS \u0081 If the infant receives indomethacin for ductus closure, watch for possible adverse effects, such as diarrhea, jaundice, bleed-ing, and renal dysfunction. Obtain blood tests before each dose of indomethacin as ordered. Explain, prepare, meet, and greet \u0081 Before surgery, carefully explain all treatments and tests to the parents and child, if age-appropriate.\u0081 Arrange for the family to meet the intensive care unit staff. Discuss the expected I.V. lines, monitoring equipment, and postoperative procedures.\u0081 Immediately after surgery, the child may have a central venous pressure catheter and an arterial line in place. Carefully assess vital signs, intake and output, and arterial and venous pressures. Provide pain relief as needed. Tell one, tell all \u0081 Stress the need for regular medical follow-up examinations and advise the parents to inform any doctor who treats their child about his history of surgery for PDA\u2014even if the child is being treated for an unrelated medical problem. \u0081 Before discharge, review instructions with the parents about activity restrictions based on the child's tolerance and energy levels. (Advise the parents to avoid becoming overprotective as their child's tolerance for physical activity increases.) Ventricular septal defect In the child with VSD, an opening in the septum between the ventricles allows blood to shunt between the left and right ven-tricles. This opening results in ineffective pumping of the heart and increases the risk of heart failure. (See Looking at VSD .) VSDs account for up to 30% of all congenital heart defects. The prognosis is good for defects that close spontaneously or are correctable surgically. Prognosis is poor, however, for untreated defects, which are sometimes fatal in children by age 1 year, usually from secondary complications. What causes it VSD may be associated with: \u0081 fetal alcohol syndrome\u0081 Down and prematurity.Looking at a VSD, an opening in the interventricular septum allows blood to shunt be- tween the left and right ventricles. Ventricular 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.287CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS THAT INCREASE PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW Because it isn't readily apparent at birth, VSD can sometimes go undiagnosed until an infant is 8 weeks old.How it happens In infants with VSD, the ventricular septum fails to close completely by gestation week 8. VSDs are located in the mem-branous or muscular portion of the ventricular septum and vary in size. Some defects close spontaneously; in other defects, the septum is entirely absent, creating a single ventricle. Small VSDs are likely to close spontaneously. Large VSDs should be surgically repaired before pulmonary vascular disease occurs or while it's still reversible. Undercover VSD VSD isn't readily apparent at birth because right and left pressures are approximately equal and pulmonary artery resistance is elevated. Alveoli aren't yet completely opened, so blood doesn't shunt through the defect. As the pulmonary vasculature gradually relaxes between 4 and 8 weeks after birth, right ventricular pressure decreases, allowing blood to shunt from the left to the right ventricle. Leading with the left Initially, large VSD shunts cause left atrial and left ventricu- an uncorrected VSD right ventricular hypertrophy due to increasing pulmonary resis- tance. Eventually, right- and left-sided heart failure and cya- nosis (from reversal of the shunt direction) occur. Fixed pulmonary hypertension may occur much later in life with right-to-left shunting, causing cyanosis and clubbing of the nail beds. What to look for Signs and symptoms of VSD may include: \u0081 thin, small infant who gains weight slowly (when a large VSD is present) \u0081 loud, harsh, widely transmitted systolic murmur heard best along the left sternal border at the third or fourth intercostal space\u0081 palpable thrill \u0081 loud, widely split pulmonic component of S 2 \u0081 point of maximal impulse displacement to the left \u0081 prominent anterior chest\u0081 liver, heart, and spleen enlargement \u0081 difficulties \u0081 diaphoresis, tachycardia, cyanosis and clubbing right-to-left shunting 287 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.288CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Small VSDs might not be detected by chest X-rays or ECG.What tests tell you These tests help diagnose VSD: \u0081 Chest X-rays appear normal in children with small defects. In children with large defects, X-rays may show cardiomegaly, left atrial and left ventricular enlargement, and prominent vascular markings.\u0081 ECG may be normal with small VSDs, whereas in large VSDs, it may show left and right ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. \u0081 Echocardiography can detect a VSD in the septum, estimate the size of the left-to-right shunt, suggest pulmo-nary hypertension, and identify associated lesions and complications.\u0081 Cardiac catheterization determines the size and exact location of the VSD and the extent of pulmonary hyperten- sion, detects associated defects, and calculates the degree of shunting by comparing the blood oxygen saturation in each ventricle. (The oxygen saturation of the right ventricle is greater than normal because oxygenated blood is shunted from the left to the right ventricle.) Complications Complications of VSD may include pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis, pneumonia, and heart failure. How it's treated Many VSDs (20% to 60%) may close spontaneously during the first year of life, especially small VSDs. Correction of VSD may involve: \u0081 early surgical correction for a large VSD, usually performed using a patch graft, before heart failure and irreversible pulmo-nary vascular disease develop\u0081 placement of a permanent pacemaker, which may be necessary after VSD repair if complete heart block develops from interfer- ence with the bundle of His during surgery\u0081 surgical closure of small defects using sutures (such defects may not be surgically repaired if the patient has normal pulmo-nary artery pressure and a small shunt)\u0081 pulmonary artery banding to normalize pressures and flow distal to the band and to prevent pulmonary vascular disease if the child has other defects and will benefit from delaying surgery\u0081 digoxin, sodium restriction, and diuretics before surgery to prevent heart failure\u0081 prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery to prevent 288 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.289CONGENITAL OBSTRUCTIVE DEFECTS What to do Although the parents of an infant with VSD commonly suspect something is wrong with their child before diagnosis, they may need psychological support to help them accept the reality of a serious cardiac disorder. Also, because surgery may take place months after diagnosis, parent teaching is vital to prevent com-plications until the child is scheduled for surgery or the defect closes. Thorough explanations of all tests are also essential. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Instruct the parents to watch for signs of heart failure, such as poor feeding, sweating, and heavy breathing.\u0081 If the child is receiving digoxin or other medications, tell the parents how to give it and how to recognize adverse effects. (Caution them to keep medications out of the reach of all children.) \u0081 Teach the parents how to recognize and report early signs of infection and to avoid exposing the child to people with obvi-ous infections.\u0081 Encourage the parents to let the child engage in normal activities.\u0081 Stress the importance of prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgical procedures. Congenital obstructive defects Defects that obstruct the flow of blood out of the heart include coarctation of the aorta, is a narrowing of the aorta, usually just below the left subclavian artery, near the site where the ligamentum arteriosum (the remnant of the ductus arteriosus) joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Coarctation may occur with aortic valve stenosis (usually of a bicuspid aortic valve) and with severe cases of hypoplasia of the aortic arch, PDA, and VSD. The obstruction to blood flow results in ineffective pumping of the heart and increases the risk of heart failure. (See Looking at coarctation of the aorta .) What causes it Although the cause of this defect is unknown, it may be as- sociated with Turner's syndrome. Turner's syndrome is a chromosome abnormality affecting only females, caused by the complete or partial deletion of the X chromosome.Looking at coarctation of the aorta In coarctation of the aorta, a nar-rowing of the aorta occurs, usually near the site of Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.290CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Walking can be difficult and painful for a child with coarctation of the aorta.How it happens Coarctation of the aorta may develop as a result of spasm and constriction of the smooth muscle in the ductus arteriosus as it closes. This contractile tissue may extend into the aortic wall, causing narrowing. The obstructive process causes hypertension in the aortic branches above the constriction (arteries that supply the arms, neck, and head) and diminished pressure in the ves-sel below the constriction (that supplies the trunk and lower extremities). Under pressure Restricted blood flow through the narrowed aorta increases the pressure load on the left ventricle and causes dilation of the proximal aorta and ventricular hypertrophy. A leggy problem As oxygenated blood leaves the left ventricle, a portion travels through the arteries that branch off the aorta proxi-mal to the coarctation. If PDA is present, the rest of the blood travels through the coarctation, mixes with deoxy- genated blood from the PDA, and travels to the legs. If the PDA is closed, the legs and lower portion of the body must rely solely on the blood that gets through the coarctation. Untreated, this condition may lead to left-sided heart failure. If coarctation remains asymptomatic in infancy, it usually remains so throughout adolescence as collateral circulation develops to bypass the narrowed segment. What to look for Signs and symptoms of coarctation of the aorta may include: \u0081 cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly during an infant's first year of life \u0081 claudication (cramping pain in arms and/or legs)\u0081 hypertension in the upper body\u0081 headache, vertigo, and epistaxis \u0081 pink upper extremities and cyanotic lower extremities \u0081 bounding pulses in the arms and absent or diminished femoral pulses\u0081 in most cases, normal heart sounds unless a coexisting cardiac defect is present\u0081 more developed chest and arms than legs\u0081 upper extremity blood pressure greater than lower extremity blood Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 290 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 290 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.291CONGENITAL OBSTRUCTIVE DEFECTS What tests tell you Physical examination reveals the cardinal signs of coarctation of the aorta, including resting systolic hypertension in the upper body, absent or diminished femoral pulses, and a wide pulse pres- sure. In addition, these tests may indicate the condition: \u0081 Chest X-rays may demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, a wide ascending and descending aorta, and notch-ing of the undersurfaces of the ribs due to erosion by collateral circulation. \u0081 ECG may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy.\u0081 Echocardiography may show increased left ventricular muscle thickness, coexisting aortic valve abnormalities, and the coarcta-tion site. Complications Possible complications may include heart failure, severe hyperten- sion, cerebral aneurysms and and infective endocarditis. How it's of the aorta may involve:\u0081 digoxin, diuretics, oxygen, and sedatives in infants with heart failure \u0081 prostaglandin infusion to keep the ductus open \u0081 antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis before and after surgery\u0081 antihypertensive therapy for children with previous undetected coarctation until surgery is performed. Resect, patch, ligate Surgery may be performed early for infants with heart failure or hypertension, or it may be delayed until the preschool years. Options include: \u0081 end-to-end anastomosis, in which the area distal and proximal aorta are end-to-end\u0081 patch aortoplasty, in which the area of coarctation is incised and an elliptical Dacron patch is sutured in place to widen the diameter\u0081 subclavian flap aortoplasty, in which the distal subclavian artery is divided and the flap of the proximal portion of this vessel is used to expand the coarcted area. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 291 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 291 Reserved.292CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS The ductus arteriosus is always ligated with each of these surgical techniques. Balloon angioplasty may be performed if recoarctation occurs. What to do When providing care to an infant:\u0081 If coarctation requires rapid digitalization, monitor vital signs closely and watch for digoxin toxicity (poor feeding and vomiting). \u0081 Monitor intake and output carefully, especially if the infant is receiving diuretics with fluid restriction.\u0081 Weigh the child daily. Bigger and bigger For an older child: \u0081 Assess blood pressure in his extremities regularly, explain exercise restrictions, stress the need to take medications prop- erly and to watch for adverse effects, and teach him about tests and other procedures. P ostop checklist After corrective surgery, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor blood pressure closely using an intra-arterial line. Take blood pressure in all extremities. \u0081 Monitor intake and output. \u0081 If the patient develops hypertension and requires antihy-pertensives, administer the medication as ordered. Watch for severe hypotension and regulate the dosage carefully. \u0081 Provide pain relief as needed and encourage a gradual in- crease in activity.\u0081 Stress the importance of continued endocarditis prophylaxis if prescribed. Stenosis, aortic In aortic stenosis, narrowing or fusion of the aortic valve interferes with left ventricular outflow to the aorta. This defect, which is most common in males, causes left ventricular hyper- trophy, causing pulmonary venous and arterial hypertension.

All Rights Reserved.293CONGENITAL OBSTRUCTIVE DEFECTS How it happens Increased left ventricular pressure attempts to overcome the resistance of the narrowed valvular opening. The added work-load increases the demand for oxygen, and diminished cardiac output causes poor coronary artery perfusion, ischemia of the left ventricle, and left-sided heart failure. If left-sided heart fail-ure develops, increased pressure in the left atrium with resulting increased pressure in the pulmonary veins can cause pulmonary edema. What to look for Signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis may include: \u0081 rough, systolic murmur chest pain on activity and exercise intolerance. What tests tell you Tests used to diagnose aortic stenosis and determine its severity include:\u0081 chest X-ray, which shows left ventricular hypertrophy and prominent pulmonary vasculature \u0081 ECG, which ventricular hypertrophy\u0081 echocardiography, which a thickened aortic valve and left ventricular wall \u0081 cardiac catheterization, which demonstrates the degree of stenosis. Complications Complications of aortic stenosis may include infective endocar- ditis, pulmonary edema, heart failure, and sudden death due to myocardial ischemia.

Mixed congenital heart defects In defects that cause mixed blood flow, oxygenated and deoxygen- ated blood mix in the heart or great vessels. Such defects include hypoplastic left heart syndrome and transposition of the great arteries. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome refers to underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. The defects of this syndrome include:\u0081 aortic valve Reserved.296CARDIOVASCULAR \u0081 severe hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. (See Looking at hypoplastic left heart syndrome .) What causes it The cause of hypoplastic left heart syndrome is unknown. How it happens Blood from the left atrium travels through a patent foramen ovale to the right ventricle and pulmonary artery, entering the systemic circulation via the ductus arteriosus. Patency of the ductus ar- teriosus, which allows blood flow to the systemic circulation, is necessary to sustain life. What to look for Signs and symptoms may include: \u0081 cyanosis\u0081 weak or absent pulses \u0081 signs of heart failure, such as tachycardia, sweating, cardiomeg- aly, tachypnea, cyanosis, and peripheral edema.Looking at hypoplastic left heart syndrome Hypoplastic left heart syndrome consists of these defects: \u0081 atresia or stenosis\u0081 diminutive or absent left ventricle\u0081 severe hypoplasia the aorta All Rights Reserved.297MIXED CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS Close call If the ductus arteriosus closes, the infant will progressively dete- riorate with worsening cyanosis, decreased cardiac output, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. What tests tell you Echocardiography provides visualization of the defect. Complications Complications of hypoplastic left heart syndrome can include heart failure and death. How it's treated Prostaglandin E is used to maintain patency of the ductus arte-riosus. Digoxin and diuretics are administered to control heart failure. Certain surgery Without surgery, death will occur in early infancy. Surgical procedures include heart transplantation in the neonatal period (although not common because of the shortage of neonate organs, risk of rejection, and need for chronic immunosuppression) or the more commonly performed staged reconstruction , which is a series of surgeries to restructure the heart to be as efficient as possible without an adequately functioning left ventricle. Typi- cally, three procedures are performed in stages: \u0081 Norwood procedure (performed soon after birth)\u2014Blood flow from the right ventricle is rerouted to provide systemic circulation (a task normally performed by the left ventricle). Because the right ventricle is now providing circulation to the rest of the body instead of to the lungs, an alternative source of pulmonary circula-tion must be provided. An aortopulmonary shunt is created to connect the aorta to the main pulmonary artery to provide pulmo- nary blood flow.\u0081 bidirectional Glenn procedure (also called a hemi-Fontan) (performed at ages 4 to 6 months)\u2014The pulmonary arteries are disconnected from their existing blood supply (e.g., a shunt cre-ated during a Norwood procedure). The superior vena cava (SVC), which carries blood returning from the upper body, is discon-nected from the heart and instead redirected into the pulmonary arteries. The IVC, which carries blood returning from the lower body, continues to connect to the heart.\u0081 modified Fontan procedure (the final stage performed at ages 2 to 3 years)\u2014The blood from the IVC is redirected to the lungs. At this point, the oxygen-poor blood from upper and lower body flows through the lungs without being pumped (driven only by the pressure that builds up in the veins). This corrects the All Rights Reserved.298CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS associated with hypoplastic left heart and leaves the single ven- tricle responsible only for supplying blood to the body. The ultimate goal of these surgeries is to make it possible for the right ventricle (fully functioning) to work as two normal ventricles would and to allow the separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood as the blood passes through the pulmo-nary and systemic circulations. What to do Explain the heart defect to the parents, prepare the child for surgery, and answer any questions. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, and intake and output to assess renal function and detect changes.\u0081 Assess cardiovascular and respiratory status to detect early signs of decompensation. \u0081 Take the patient's apical pulse for 1 minute before giving di- goxin and withhold the drug to prevent toxicity if the heart rate is below 90 to 110 beats/minute in infants and young children (below 70 beats/minute in older children).\u0081 Monitor fluid status, enforcing fluid restrictions as appropri-ate to prevent fluid overload. Weigh the child daily.\u0081 Organize nursing care activities around long periods of unin- terrupted rest to decrease the child's oxygen demands. Transposition of the great arteries In transposition of the great arteries, the aorta rises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery rises from the left ven-tricle. This defect produces two noncommunicating circulatory systems. (See Looking at transposition of the great arteries .) What causes it The cause of transposition of the great arteries is unknown. How it happens The transposed pulmonary artery carries oxygenated blood back to the lungs rather than to the left side of the heart. The transposed aorta returns unoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation rather than to the lungs. Communication between the pulmonary and systemic circu- lation is necessary for survival; the presence of other congenital defects, such as PDA, ASD, and VSD, allows for such communi- cation. These defects cause holes in the heart that allow blood to flow from one side of the heart to the other so that oxygen-ated and deoxygenated blood can mix and flow to the lungs and the rest of the body, which is necessary to sustain life.Looking at transposition of the great arteries In transposition of the great arteries, the aorta rises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery from the left ven-tricle, producing two noncommuni-cating circulatory systems.

Up, up and away Atrial balloon septostomy may be done during cardiac cathe-terization to enlarge the patent foramen ovale, which improves oxygenation by allowing greater mixing of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Go with the flow Corrective surgery may be performed to redirect blood flow by switching the positions of the major blood vessels. This procedure is typically performed in the first few weeks of life.

All Rights Reserved.300CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS What to do Nursing care begins with patient education. Teach the parents about the defect and answer any questions they may have. The child should be prepared for surgery and other invasive procedures. \u0081 Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, and intake and output to assess renal function and detect changes.\u0081 Assess cardiovascular and respiratory status to detect early signs of decompensation. \u0081 Monitor fluid status, enforcing fluid restrictions as appropriate to prevent fluid overload. Weigh the child daily.\u0081 Offer the child high-calorie foods that are easy to ingest and digest.\u0081 Encourage parents to help their child assume new activity levels and independence. Congenital heart defects that decrease pulmonary blood flow Defects that decrease pulmonary blood flow include tetralogy of Fallot and tricuspid atresia. Tetralogy of Fallot the VSD). Blood shunts from right to left through the VSD, allowing unoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood, which results in cyanosis. This heart defect accounts for about 10% of all con- genital defects and occurs equally in males and females. (See Looking at tetralogy of Fallot .) What causes it The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown, but it is thought to be due to environmental or genetic factors or a combination of both. It is associated with chromosome 22 deletions and DiGeorge syndrome. How it happens In tetralogy of Fallot, unoxygenated venous blood returning to the right side of the heart may pass through the VSD to the left ven-tricle, bypassing the lungs, or it may enter the pulmonary artery, depending on the extent of the pulmonic stenosis. Rather than orig- inating 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.301CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS THAT DECREASE PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW Looking at tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination VSD lies in the outflow tract of the right ventricle. Severe obstruction of right ventricular outflow produces a right- to-left shunt, causing decreased systemic arterial oxygen satura- tion, cyanosis, reduced pulmonary blood flow, and hypoplasia of the entire pulmonary vasculature. Right ventricular hypertrophy develops in response to the extra force needed to push blood into the stenotic pulmonary artery. What to look for Cyanosis is the hallmark of tetralogy of Fallot. Children may have cyanotic or \"blue\" spells by dyspnea; deep, sighing respirations; bradycardia; fainting; seizures; and loss of consciousness after exercise, crying, straining, infection, or fever. Not all children are cyanotic, and these children may be referred to as \"pink tets.\" Other signs and symptoms include: \u0081 clubbing, diminished exercise tolerance, increasing dyspnea on exertion, growth retardation, and eating difficulties in older children\u0081 squatting during episodes of shortness of breath Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 301 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 301 Tetralogy of Fallot gives the heart \"the boot.\" Actually, the cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped on X-ray.\u0081 loud systolic murmur best heard along the left sternal border, which may diminish or obscure the pulmonic component of S 2 \u0081 continuous murmur of the ductus in a patient with a large PDA\u0081 thrill at the left sternal border\u0081 obvious right ventricular impulse and prominent inferior ster- num associated with right ventricular hypertrophy. What tests tell you Findings from chest X-rays, ECG, and echocardiography demonstrate the defects:\u0081 Chest X-ray demonstrates a boot-shaped cardiac silhouette and decreased pulmonary vascular markings. \u0081 ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy, right axis devia-tion and, possibly, right atrial hypertrophy.\u0081 Echocardiography and cardiac catheterization provide visual- ization of the defects. Complications Complications of tetralogy of Fallot may include hypercya- notic tet spells, right ventricular dysfunction, infective endo-carditis, polycythemia, and death. How it's treated Tetralogy of Fallot may be managed by:\u0081 knee-chest position and administration of oxygen and mor-phine to improve oxygenation \u0081 beta-blockers, such as propranolol, to prevent tet spells and prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis\u0081 palliative surgery to reduce hypoxia during tet spells (involving the Blalock-Taussig procedure, which joins the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery) \u0081 complete surgical closure to relieve pulmonic stenosis and close the VSD, directing left ventricular outflow to the aorta (Brock procedure). What to do Educating the parents (and the child, if old enough) is a major part of nursing care:\u0081 Explain tetralogy of Fallot to the parents; explain that their child will set his own exercise limits and will know when to rest. \u0081 Teach the parents how to recognize tet spells, which can cause dramatically increased cyanosis; deep, sighing respirations; and syncope (tell them to place the child in the knee-chest position and to report such spells immediately; emergency treatment may be necessary). Older children may often squat during a tet spell.\u0081 During hospitalization, alert the staff to the child's condition.

All Rights Reserved.303CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS THAT DECREASE PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW \u0081 Because of the right-to-left shunt through the VSD, treat I.V. lines like arterial lines, and remember that a clot dislodged from a catheter tip in a vein can cross the VSD and cause cerebral embolism (which can also happen if air enters the venous lines). \u0081 If the child requires medical attention for an unrelated prob-lem, advise the parents to inform the doctor immediately of the child's history of tetralogy of Fallot; any treatment must take this serious heart defect into consideration. Tricuspid atresia Tricuspid atresia is failure of the tricuspid valve to develop. This defect prevents blood from entering the right ventricle from the right atrium. (See Looking at tricuspid atresia .) What causes it The cause of tricuspid atresia is unknown, but it may be as-sociated with pulmonic stenosis or transposition of the great arteries. How it happens Deoxygenated blood shunts from the right atrium through an ASD or a patent foramen ovale to the left atrium, where it mixes with oxygenated blood. This mixed blood then passes to the left ventricle and through a VSD to the right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and lungs, or mixed blood from the aorta refluxes back through the PDA to the lungs. What to look for Signs and symptoms may include cyanosis, tachycardia, dys- pnea, and a heart murmur. What tests tell you In a patient with tricuspid atresia:\u0081 Chest X-ray shows an enlarged right atrium and decreased pulmonary blood flow. \u0081 ECG indicates left-axis deviation and absent right ventricular forces.\u0081 Echocardiography provides visualization of the defect and shunting.

Surgical repair may involve a subclavian-to-pulmonary artery shunt to improve blood flow to the lungs, or the modified Fontan procedure, which connects the right atrium directly to the pulmonary artery. What to do Explain the heart defect to the child and his parents, prepare the child for surgery, and answer any questions. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor vital signs, pulse oximetry, and intake and output to assess renal function and detect changes.\u0081 Assess cardiovascular and respiratory status to detect early signs of decompensation. \u0081 Monitor fluid status, enforcing fluid restrictions as appropriate to prevent fluid overload. Weigh the child daily.\u0081 Organize nursing care around periods of uninterrupted rest to reduce the child's oxygen demands. Other cardiovascular disorders Other cardiovascular disorders that are common among children and adolescents include endocarditis, heart failure, Kawasaki disease, and rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. Endocarditis Endocarditis (also known as infective or bacterial endocarditis ) is an infection of the endocardium, heart valves, or cardiac pros-thesis resulting from bacterial or fungal invasion. Untreated endocarditis is usually fatal but, with proper treat- ment, 70% of patients recover. The prognosis is worst when endo- carditis causes severe valvular damage, leading to insufficiency and heart failure, or when it involves a prosthetic valve. What causes it Most cases of endocarditis in children occur in patients with: \u0081 abnormal heart valves\u0081 prosthetic heart valves \u0081 (especially Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.305OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Bacteremia from something as simple as a dental extraction may be enough to cause endocarditis.Other predisposing conditions include Marfan syndrome, degenerative heart disease, I.V. drug use and, rarely, a syphilitic aortic valve. The root of the problem Some patients with endocarditis have no underlying heart disease. Infecting organisms differ among these groups. In patients with native valve endocarditis who aren't I.V. drug abusers, causative organisms usually streptococci (especially Streptococcus viridans ), staphylococci, and enterococci. Although other bacteria occasionally cause the disorder, fungal causes are rare in this group. The mitral valve is involved most commonly, fol- lowed by the aortic valve. In patients who are I.V. drug abusers, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism. Less commonly, streptococci, enterococci, gram-negative bacilli, or fungi cause the disorder. The tricuspid valve is involved most commonly, followed by the aortic valve, and then the mitral valve. P ostprosthesis predicament In patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis, early cases (those that develop within 60 days of valve insertion) are usu-ally due to staphylococcal infection. However, gram-negative aerobic organisms, fungi, streptococci, enterococci, or diphthe- roids may also cause the disorder. The course is usually fulminant and is associated with a high mortality rate. In late cases (occurring after 60 days), pa- tients show signs and symptoms similar to those of native valve endocarditis. How it happens In endocarditis, bacteremia\u2014even transient bacteremia follow- ing dental or urogenital procedures\u2014introduces the pathogen into the bloodstream. This infection causes fibrin and platelets to aggregate on the valve tissue and engulf circulating bacte- ria or fungi that flourish and form friable wartlike vegetative growths on the heart valves, the endocardial lining of a heart chamber, or the epithelium of a blood vessel. (See Degenera- tive changes in endocarditis .) It's a cover up Such growths may cover the valve surfaces, causing ulceration and necrosis, or extend to the chordae tendineae, leading to rupture and subsequent valvular insufficiency. Ultimately, they may embolize to the spleen, kidneys, central nervous system, and lungs.Degenerative changes in endocarditis This illustration shows typical growths on the endocardium pro-duced by fibrin and platelet deposits on Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.306CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS What to look for Early clinical features of endocarditis are usually nonspecific and include malaise, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, arthralgia, night sweats, chills, valvular insufficiency and, in 90% of patients, an intermittent fever that may recur for weeks. A more acute onset is associated with organisms of high pathogenicity such as S. aureus . Murmur by megaphone Endocarditis commonly causes a loud, regurgitant murmur typical of the underlying heart lesion. A sudden change in the murmur or the discovery of a new murmur in the presence of fever is a clas- sic physical sign of endocarditis. In about 30% of patients, embolization from growing lesions or diseased valvular tissue may produce: \u0081 splenic infarction\u2014pain in the left upper quadrant, radiating to the left shoulder, and abdominal rigidity \u0081 renal infarction\u2014hematuria, pyuria, flank pain, and decreased urine output\u0081 infarction\u2014cough, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub, dyspnea, and hemoptysis (most common in right-sided endocarditis, which commonly occurs among I.V. drug abusers and after cardiac surgery) \u0081 neurologic deficits\u0081 peripheral vascular occlusion\u2014numbness and tingling in an arm, leg, finger, or toe or signs of impending peripheral gangrene. Pinpoint spots Other signs of endocarditis may include splenomegaly; petechiae of the skin (especially common on the upper anterior trunk) or buccal, pharyngeal, or conjunctival mucosa; and splinter hemor- Osler, Roth, and Janeway Rarely, endocarditis produces Osler's nodes (tender, raised, subcu- taneous lesions on the fingers or toes), Roth's spots (hemorrhagic areas with white centers on the retina), and Janeway lesions (purplish macules on the palms or soles). What tests tell you Three or more blood cultures in a 24- to 48-hour period (each from a separate venipuncture) identify the causative organism in up to 90% of patients. Blood cultures should be drawn from three differ- ent sites, with 1 hour between All Rights Reserved.307OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Watch the clock! Giving antibiotics at their prescribed times will keep blood levels consistent in a child with endocarditis.The remaining 10% of patients may have negative blood cul- tures, possibly suggesting fungal infection or infections that are difficult to diagnose such as Haemophilus parainfluenzae . Other abnormal but nonspecific laboratory test results may include: \u0081 normal or elevated white blood hematuria (in about 50% of patients)\u0081 positive serum rheumatoid factor (in about 50% of all patients after endocarditis is present for 3 to 6 weeks)\u0081 valvular damage, identified by echocardiography\u0081 atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias that accompany valvular disease, identified by ECG. Complications Complications of endocarditis may include heart failure, aortic root abscesses, myocardial abscesses, pericarditis, cardiac arrhythmia, meningitis, brain abscesses, septic pulmonary in- farcts, arthritis, glomerulonephritis, acute renal failure, and death. How it's treated The goal of treatment is to eradicate the infecting organism. First- line therapy is usually a combination of penicillin and an ami-noglycoside, usually gentamicin (Garamycin). I.V. antimicrobial therapy should start promptly and continue over 4 to 6 weeks. The right fit Selection of an antibiotic is based on identification of the infecting organism and on sensitivity studies. While await-ing results, or if blood cultures are negative, empiric anti- microbial therapy is based on the likely infecting organism. Supportive treatment includes bed rest, acetaminophen for fever and aches, and sufficient fluid intake. Severe val- vular damage, especially aortic or mitral insufficiency, may require corrective surgery if refractory heart failure devel- ops or in cases requiring that an infected prosthetic valve be replaced. What to do Provide reassurance by teaching the patient and his family about this disease and the need for prolonged treatment. In addi-tion, follow these steps: \u0081 Before giving antibiotics, obtain the patient's history of allergies. Administer antibiotics on time to maintain consistent antibiotic blood levels.

Heart failure Heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's metabolic needs. It results in intravascular and interstitial volume overload and poor tissue perfusion. What causes it Heart failure most commonly occurs in children secondary to structural defects (such as congenital heart defects), resulting in Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 308 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 308 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.309OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS Increased ventricular muscle mass improves my output, but it also increases my oxygen needs.increased blood volume and pressure within the heart itself. Other causes include:\u0081 ventricular impairment imbalances \u0081 sepsis or severe anemia, which can place excessive demands on the normal heart muscle. How it happens Right-sided heart failure results from ineffective right ventricular contractile function; blood isn't pumped effectively through the right ventricle to the lungs, causing it to back up into the right atrium and the peripheral circulation. The patient gains weight and develops peripheral edema and engorgement of the liver, kidneys, and other organs. Left-sided heart failure occurs as a result of ineffective left ventricular contractile function. As the pumping ability of the left ventricle fails, cardiac output falls. Blood is no longer effectively pumped out into the body; it backs up into the left atrium and then into the lungs, causing pulmonary con-gestion, dyspnea, and activity intolerance. If the condition persists, pulmonary edema and right-sided heart failure may result. Reverse, reverse! The body will attempt to compensate for heart failure by increasing cardiac output through such mechanisms as increased sympathetic activity, ventricular dilation, and ventricular hypertrophy. Increased sympathetic activity Increased sympathetic activity\u2014a response to decreased cardiac output and blood pressure\u2014enhances peripheral vascular resistance, contractility, heart rate, and venous return. Signs such as cool extremities and clamminess may indicate im- pending heart failure. Ventricular in end-diastolic ventricular vol- ume (preload) causes increased stroke work and stroke volume during contraction, stretching cardiac muscle fibers so that the ventricle can accept the increased intravascular volume. Eventu- ally, the muscle becomes stretched beyond optimum limits and contractility declines. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 309 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 309 hypertrophy In ventricular hypertrophy, an increase in ventricular muscle mass allows the heart to pump against increased resistance to the outflow of blood, improving cardiac output. This increased muscle mass, however, also increases myocardial oxygen requirements. An increase in the ventricular diastolic pressure necessary to fill the enlarged ventricle may compromise diastolic coronary blood flow, limiting the oxygen supply to the ventricle, and causing isch- emia and impaired muscle contractility. What to look for In children, total adequate heart functioning depends on both the right and left sides of the heart because they work together to pump blood. Because a failure of one chamber causes reciprocal change in the opposite chamber, children don't show separate right- or left-sided signs and symptoms, as observed in adults. Typically, a combination of symptoms is seen because right- and left-sided heart failure occur simultaneously in children. Gallops, wheezes, and weight Signs and symptoms of heart failure in children may include: \u0081 tachycardia (one of the earliest signs)\u0081 gallop heart rhythm \u0081 diaphoresis wheezes\u0081 hepatomegaly\u0081 ascites\u0081 weight gain. What tests tell you A chest X-ray may reveal cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular markings resulting from increased pulmonary blood flow. ECG may identify ventricular hypertrophy, and echocardiography may reveal the cause of heart failure such as a congenital heart defect. Complications Acute complications of heart failure include pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, and arrhythmias. Chronic complications include activity intolerance, renal impairment, metabolic impair- ment, and 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

To reduce the workload on the heart, minimize metabolic de- mands by:\u0081 maintaining a normothermic state in a neutral thermal environment \u0081 providing treatment for infection, if present\u0081 decreasing respiratory effort (providing oxygen and keeping the patient in a semi-Fowler's position) \u0081 providing sedation or analgesics as needed for pain or discomfort\u0081 decreasing stimuli to promote a quiet, restful environment. What to do Children with heart failure tend to require close monitoring. Be- cause congenital heart defects are the main cause of heart failure in children, be alert for signs and symptoms of heart failure when caring for a child with a congenital heart defect. \u0081 Prepare the child for the intensive care environment and vari-ous equipment that may be in use. Also, make sure parents are aware of visiting policies. Oxygen as ordered \u0081 Place the child in semi-Fowler's position and provide supple- mental oxygen as ordered to help him breathe more easily.\u0081 Weigh the patient daily, and check for peripheral edema. \u0081 Carefully monitor vital signs and I.V. intake and output. Aus- cultate the heart for murmur or gallop rhythm and the lungs for crackles or rhonchi. Report changes at once. Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 311 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Feed the heart well \u0081 Increase caloric intake to meet the body's increased metabolic needs as the heart is working harder.\u0081 Monitor the patient's apical pulse for 1 full minute before administering a digoxin dose. Although the drug may be given to adults with apical rates above 60 beats/minute, digoxin should be withheld in infants and young children if the apical rate is below 90 to 110 beats/minute (below 70 beats/minute in older children).\u0081 Stress the importance of taking digoxin exactly as prescribed, and tell parents to watch for and immedi-ately report signs of toxicity, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia. Kawasaki disease Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome , is an acute systemic vasculitis. It has become a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in the United States. The majority of cases occur in children younger than age 5, with 1\u00bd times the incidence in boys than in girls. Although KD is a self-limiting disorder, cardiac sequelae may develop in about 20% of children who aren't treated. These sequelae may include damage to the coronary arteries and myocardium. What causes it The cause of KD is unknown. It has geographic or seasonal outbreaks in late winter or early spring, suggesting an infectious process. However, it isn't spread person to person. How it happens In KD, inflammation of the small to medium blood vessels occurs throughout the body. However, the coronary arteries and, subse-quently, the myocardium are most vulnerable to damage. Later pro- gression of the vasculitis may damage the walls of 312 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.313OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS vessels, possibly leading to coronary artery aneurysms. Systemic vasculitis usually begins to subside in 6 to 8 weeks. What to look for The three phases of KD are acute, subacute, and convalescent. Acute phase The acute phase of KD involves abrupt onset of high fever that doesn't respond to antipyretics and antibiotic therapy. Signs and symptoms during this phase include: \u0081 fever \u0081 irritability (possibly and dry eyes \u0081 erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and tongue, leading to the char- acteristic \"strawberry tongue\"\u0081 desquamation of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet\u0081 myocarditis\u0081 intermittent signs of heart failure\u0081 transient arthritis of the small joints. (See Clinical criteria for KD .) Subacute phase The subacute phase begins as fever subsides and continues until all clinical signs have resolved. Because the damaged coronary arteries will stretch to their maximum diameter during this phase, the child is at risk for coronary thrombosis and aneurysms. Signs and symptoms that may occur during this phase include:\u0081 irritability\u0081 periungual desquamation (peeling that occurs around the nails of the fingers and toes) \u0081 arthritis of larger, weight-bearing joints. Convalescent phase By the convalescent phase, all of the clinical signs of KD have resolved. Laboratory results may, however, still be abnormal, and this phase will end when those results are normal. This phase usually occurs 6 to 8 weeks after the onset of fever, and the child usually seems to be \"back to normal\" by the end of the convales-cent phase. What tests tell you Along with the clinical findings, diagnostic tests may show: \u0081 elevated ESR\u0081 tissue biopsy showing initial proliferation of the adventitia and intima of vessels and thickening of vessel wallsClinical criteria for KD To be diagnosed with KD, a child must have a fever that lasts for more than 5 days and show four of the following five signs and symptoms: bilateral conjunctivi- tis without discharge strawberry tongue and mucous mem-brane dryness with possible fissures erythema of the palms or soles with peeling (usually at week 2 or 3) and peripheral edema polymor- phous rash cervical lymph node swelling (one node greater than 1.5 cm).

Complications Cardiac complications of KD include myocarditis, mitral regurgi-tation, dysrhythmias, and vasculitis\u2014usually the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. Inflammation of the coronary arter- ies can lead to an aneurysm. Aneurysms increase the risk of blood clots forming and blocking the artery, which could lead to a heart attack or cause life-threatening internal bleeding. How it's treated High-dose I.V. immune globulin (IVIG) may reduce the duration of fever as well as coronary artery involvement (if given in the first 10 days of the disease course). Aspirin therapy is used to reduce fever and inflammation. Kawasaki treatment is a rare exception to the rule against aspirin use in children. For the occurrence of giant aneurysms, anticoagulation therapy may be instituted. Most children recover completely following treatment, but cardiovascular involvement may lead to serious morbidity, usually due to coronary thrombosis. What to do Monitor cardiovascular status and intake and output carefully, in- cluding daily weights. Observe the child for fluid volume overload due to myocarditis, and assess him frequently for signs of heart failure. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Administer IVIG as you would a blood product, obtaining vital signs during and immediately following the infusion and being alert for signs of allergic reaction (the single infusion is usually given over 10 to 12 hours). Soft and soothing \u0081 Decrease skin inflammation with cool compresses, unscented lotions, and the use of soft clothing.\u0081 Provide gentle mouth care during the acute phase of the illness along with a diet of clear, nonirritating liquids and soft foods.\u0081 Maintain a quiet environment to promote rest and reduce irritability. Teach parents that irritability is a hallmark symp- tom of KD (because parents are, at times, surprised by their child's uncharacteristic behavior). Hush little baby, don't you cry \u0081 Support the parents' efforts to console their crying child, and reassure them that irritability usually subsides during the All Rights Reserved.315OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS \u0081 Because antibody development may be suppressed, don't admin- ister live immunizations, such as the measles-mumps-rubella or vari-cella vaccines, until at least 11 months after IVIG administration. Come on in\u2014the water's fine \u0081 Because arthritis symptoms may persist for several weeks in weight-bearing joints, provide warm baths and passive range-of-motion exercises to maintain joint function and reduce stiffness. \u0081 Teach the parents signs and symptoms of MI in children, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, restlessness, inconsolable crying, and pallor (possibly chest pain in older children). Instruct the parents in cardiopulmonary resuscitation of the child. Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease A systemic inflammatory disease of childhood, acute rheumatic fever develops after infection of the upper respiratory tract with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. It primarily involves the heart, joints, central nervous system, skin, and subcutaneous tis- sues, and it commonly recurs. Rheumatic heart disease refers to the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever. It includes pancarditis (myocarditis, pericardi- tis, and endocarditis) during the early acute phase and, later in the course of the disease, chronic valvular disease. Cardiac involve-ment develops in up to 50% of patients with rheumatic fever. Millions \"served\" Worldwide, 15 to 20 million new cases of rheumatic fever are re- ported each year. The disease typically strikes during cool, damp weather in the winter and early spring. In the United States, it's most common in the north. A family affair Rheumatic fever tends to run in families, lending support to the existence of genetic predisposition. Environmental factors also seem to be significant in the development of the disorder. For example, in lower socioeconomic groups, the incidence is high- est in children between ages 5 and 15 years, probably because of crowded living conditions. Prognosis Patients without carditis or with mild carditis have a good long- term prognosis. Severe pancarditis occasionally produces fatal heart failure during the acute phase. Of patients who survive this complication, about 20% die within 10 years. Antibiotic therapy has greatly reduced the incidence of mortal- ity from rheumatic heart disease.

All Rights Reserved.316CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS Most children with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease have joint pain\u2014as if they don't have enough problems!What causes it Rheumatic fever is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococ- cal pharyngitis. How it happens Rheumatic fever appears to be a hypersensitivity reaction to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection. Because very few people (3%) with streptococcal infections go on to contract rheumatic fever, altered host resistance must be involved in its development or recurrence. The antigens of group A streptococci bind to receptors in the heart, in muscle, and in the brain and synovial joints, causing an autoimmune response. Because of a similarity between the anti- gens of the streptococcus bacteria and the antigens of the body's own cells, antibodies may mistakenly attack healthy body cells. When carditis gets complicated \u0081 Carditis may affect the endocardium, myocardium, or pericar- dium during the early acute phase. Later, the heart valves may be damaged, causing chronic valvular disease. \u0081 Pericarditis produces a serofibrinous characteristic lesions called Aschoff bodies (fibrin deposits surrounded by necrosis) in the interstitial tissue of the heart as well as cellular swelling and fragmentation of interstitial collagen. (These lesions lead to progressively fibrotic nodule and interstitial scar formation.)\u0081 Endocarditis causes along lines of leaflet closure; and blood, platelet, and fibrin deposits, which form beadlike growths. Eventually, the valve leaflets become scarred, lose their elasticity, and begin to adhere to one another. (Endocarditis strikes the mitral valve most commonly in females and the aortic valve in males. In both genders, it occasionally affects the tricuspid valve and, rarely, the pulmonic valve.) What to look for The classic symptoms of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease include:\u0081 polyarthritis or migratory joint pain, caused by inflam- most patients) \u0081 erythema marginatum, a nonpruritic, macular, transient rash on the trunk or inner aspects of the upper arms or thighs, that gives rise to red lesions with blanched centers Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 316 Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 316 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

But wait, there's more Other signs and symptoms of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease include:\u0081 streptococcal infection a few days to 6 weeks earlier (in 95% of those with rheumatic fever) \u0081 temperature of at least 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) due to infection and inflammation. Aye, that's the rub \u0081 pericardial friction rub caused by inflamed pericardial mem- one mitral or aortic heart murmur or a murmur in a person with a preexisting murmur \u0081 chest pain, typically pleuritic, due to inflammation and irri-tation of the pericardial membranes (Pain may increase with deep inspiration and decrease when the patient sits up and leans forward, pulling the heart away from the diaphragmatic pleurae of the lungs.)\u0081 dyspnea, tachypnea, nonproductive cough, bibasilar edema due to heart failure in severe rheumatic carditis. What tests tell you Several tests are used to help diagnose rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease: \u0081 Jones criteria (revealing two major criteria, or one major and two minor criteria, plus evidence of a previous group A streptococcal infection) are necessary for diagnosis. (See Jones criteria for rheumatic fever .)Jones criteria for rheumatic fever The Jones criteria are used to stan-dardize the diag-nosis of rheumatic fever. Diagnosis requires that the patient have either two major crite-ria, or one major criterion and two minor criteria, plus evidence of a previ-ous streptococcal infection. Major criteria \u0081 Carditis\u0081 Migratory poly-arthritis\u0081 Subcutaneous nodules\u0081 Erythema margin-atum (the presence of pink rings on the trunk and inner surfaces of the arms and legs) Minor criteria \u0081 Fever\u0081 Arthralgia\u0081 Elevated acute phase reactants\u0081 Prolonged Meadows-Oliver_Ch08.indd 317 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Regular or extra-large \u0081 Chest X-rays may show normal heart size or cardiomegaly, peri- cardial effusion, or damage and pericardial effusion, measure chamber size, and provide information on ven- tricular function.\u0081 Cardiac catheterization provides information on valvular dam-age and left ventricular function. Complications Possible complications of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease include destruction of the mitral and aortic valves, pancar-ditis, and heart failure. How it's treated The goals of treatment for rheumatic heart disease are to destroy any remaining group A streptococcal bacteria, relieve symptoms, and control inflammation. Treatment typically involves: \u0081 prompt treatment of all group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin (or erythromycin for patients with peni-cillin hypersensitivity)\u0081 anti-inflammatory treatment (with aspirin or naproxen) to re- lieve fever and pain and minimize joint swelling \u0081 corticosteroids if the patient has carditis or if the anti- inflammatory agents fail to relieve pain and inflammation.

It makes my life easier when I'm dealing with the demands of rheumatic heart disease.Lullaby and good night Strict bed rest is advised for about 5 weeks for the patient with active carditis to reduce cardiac demands. Bed rest, sodium restriction, ACE inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics are used to treat heart failure. Surgery for severity Corrective surgery is reserved for severe mitral or aor- tic valvular dysfunction that causes persistent heart failure. Procedures may include: \u0081 commissurotomy\u2014separation of adherent, thickened valve leaflets of the mitral valve\u0081 valvuloplasty\u2014inflation of a balloon within a valve\u0081 valve replacement\u2014replacement of the diseased valve. On second thought Secondary prevention of rheumatic fever begins after the acute phase subsides. The child will be prescribed long-term prophylac-tic antibiotics. Treatment usually continues for at least 5 years or until age 21, whichever duration is longer. P op a pill before the drill Prophylactic antibiotics for dental work and other invasive or surgical procedures will be necessary to prevent infective endocarditis. What to do Because rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease require prolonged treatment, the care plan should include comprehensive patient (and parent) teaching to promote compliance with the prescribed therapy: \u0081 Before giving penicillin, ask the parent if the child has ever had a hypersensitivity reaction to it, and warn that such a reaction is possible even if it hasn't occurred previously. (Instruct parents to stop giving the drug and call the doctor immediately if the child develops a rash, fever, chills, or other signs of allergy at any time during penicillin therapy.) Be on alert \u0081 Instruct the patient and his family to watch for and report early signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea and a hacking, nonproduc-tive cough.

All Rights Reserved.320CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS \u0081 Stress the need for bed rest during the acute phase and suggest appropriate, physically undemanding diversions. Prescription for quality time \u0081 After the acute phase, encourage family members and friends to spend as much time as possible with the patient to minimize bore-dom. Advise parents to secure tutorial services to help the child keep up with schoolwork during the long convalescence. \u0081 Help parents overcome guilty feelings they may have about their child's illness. Tell them that failure to seek treatment for strepto-coccal infection is common because this illness typically seems no worse than a cold, and encourage them (and the child) to vent their frustrations during the long, tedious recovery.\u0081 If the child has severe carditis, help the parents and child pre-pare for permanent changes in the child's lifestyle.\u0081 Teach the patient and his family about the disease and its treatment, and stress the need to watch for and immediately re-port signs of recurrent streptococcal infection, including sudden sore throat; diffuse throat redness and oropharyngeal exudate; swollen, tender cervical lymph glands; pain on to 40\u00b0 C); headache; and nausea. (Urge the parents to keep the child away from people with respi-ratory tract infections.) Brush and floss at any cost \u0081 Promote good dental hygiene to prevent infection. Stress the need to comply with prolonged antibiotic therapy and follow-up care and the need for additional antibiotics before dental surgery or other invasive procedures. Arrange for a home health nurse to oversee care, if necessary.\u0081 Teach the patient (and his parents) to follow current recommen-dations of the American Heart Association for prevention of infec- tive endocarditis; antibiotic regimens used to prevent recurrence of acute rheumatic fever are adequate for preventing infective 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

A child's respiratory tract is constantly growing and changing for the first 12 years of life. It differs anatomically from an adult's respiratory system in ways that predispose the child to respiratory difficulties, making respiratory problems common during childhood. (See Structures of the respiratory system , page 324.) Chest and lungs The lungs are the main component of the respiratory system. They inspire air, extract oxygen, and exhale the waste product carbon dioxide. Totally lobular The right lung has three lobes; the left has two. The mediastinum is the space between the two lungs. The lungs are surrounded by a framework of ribs, vertebrae (posteriorly), and the sternum (anteriorly), creating the 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It will gradually develop into a flattened shape across the front and back as the child grows. However, certain respiratory diseases can alter the shape of the chest. For example, obstructive diseases like asthma and cystic fibrosis can produce a barrel-shaped chest when they become severe.Structures of the respiratory system This illustration shows the structures of the respiratory system.

I don't know that I'm supposed to open my mouth if my nose is blocked!Upper respiratory tract The upper respiratory tract consists of the: \u0081 nose nasal passages The nose and nasal passages serve as a conduit for air to and from the lungs. They're lined with ciliated mucous membranes that filter, warm, and moisten the air. Nasal for 4 weeks Infants and young children have smaller nares and narrow nasal passages, making them prone to airway occlusion. Because neonates prefer to breathe through their noses, nasal patency is essential for such life- sustaining activities as breathing and feeding. The neuro- logic pathways that will coordinate mouth breathing won't develop until age 4 weeks. Mouth and oropharynx After about age 4 weeks, air may also enter the respira- tory system via the mouth and oropharynx. The child's small oral cavity and large tongue leave the child prone to airway occlusion. Pharynx The pharynx, or throat, serves as a conduit for the respiratory and digestive tracts. It's composed of smooth muscle and mucous membranes. The tonsils and adenoids, located in the pharynx, grow rapidly in early childhood and can leave the child prone to occlusion if they become inflamed. The tonsils and adenoids may decrease in size after age 12. (See Locating the tonsils and adenoids , page 326.) Larynx The larynx, or the upper end of the trachea, consists of a rigid framework of cartilage. It contains the epiglottis, a flaplike struc-ture that overhangs the entrance to the trachea, and the glottis, the opening to the Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.326RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS No solids or fluids beyond this point The epiglottis and glottis prevent solids and fluids from entering the air passages during swallowing. The glottis contains the vocal cords, which produce vocal sounds when they vibrate. The child's long, floppy epiglottis is vulnerable to swelling that may lead to obstruction. Lower respiratory tract The lower respiratory tract is composed of the: \u0081 trachea\u0081 bronchi \u0081 alveoli. Trachea The trachea acts as a passageway for air into the lungs. It's made up of C-shaped rings of cartilage and is supported by smooth Locating the tonsils and adenoids These illustrations show the locations of the tonsils and adenoids.

In infants, the cartilage is soft, making the airway more easily collapsible when the neck is flexed. A child's trachea is higher than an adult's and gives rise to two major bronchi: the right and the left. The right bronchus is shorter, wider, and situated more vertically than the left. Because of this, aspirated foreign bodies are more likely to become lodged in the right bronchus. (See Estimating tracheal diameter .) Bronchi The bronchi, the larger air passages of the lungs, are com- posed of the same cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle as the trachea. The bronchi divide into progressively smaller passages called bronchioles . As a child grows taller in stature, there's increased branching of the bronchioles, leading to greater lung surface area. The cartilaginous rings disappear as the bronchioles get smaller, leaving the smallest divisions with a lining of a single layer of cells. The bronchioles terminate in alveoli. Alveoli Alveoli are the small, saclike structures in which the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide takes place. Each alveolus is surrounded by many capillaries. Throughout the first 12 years of life, the alveoli change in size and shape and increase in number, resulting in an increased area available for gas exchange as the child grows. A neonate's lung tissue contains about 25 million alveoli; this number increases to about 300 million by age 8. No confusion\u2014it's diffusion The alveoli promote gas exchange by diffusion (the passage of gas molecules through the respiratory membranes). By dif-fusion, oxygen from the alveoli passes to the blood, and carbon dioxide, a by-product of cellular metabolism, passes out of the blood into the alveoli, where it's channeled away during exhalation. Airway resistance Airway resistance (the effort or force required to move air into the lungs) is greater in children than in adults because chil-dren's airways are narrower than those of adults. In infants, air- way resistance is about 15 times that of an adult. When there's edema or swelling in the airway due to an irritant or infectious Advice from the experts Estimating tracheal diameter One way to esti- mate the size of a child's trachea is to remember the \"rule of the finger.\" The diameter of a child's trachea is roughly equal to the diameter of his little (or pinky) finger. This rule may come in handy when selecting the appropriate size of endotracheal tube if intubation be-comes 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

My airway is narrower than my mom's, so I have to work harder to breathe than she does.process, the airway is further narrowed, increasing the air- way resistance even more. Child labor Increased airway resistance makes the child work harder to breathe. This is indicated by:\u0081 increased respiratory rate \u0081 retractions \u0081 nasal flaring\u0081 use of accessory muscles. Pulmonary circulation In pulmonary circulation, blood passes through the lungs to obtain oxygen to distribute to the cells and tissues of the body in a four-step process: Oxygen-depleted blood enters the lungs from the pul- monary artery that arises from the heart's right ventricle. Blood then flows through the main pulmonary arteries into the smaller vessels of the main bronchi, through the arterioles and, eventually, into the capillary networks that surround the alveoli. There, oxygen diffuses into the capillaries from the alveoli, and the oxygenated blood flows through progressively larger vessels, enters the main pulmonary vein, and flows into the left atrium. From there, the oxygenated blood passes into the left ventricle and exits the heart through the aorta for distribution throughout the body. Inspiration and expiration An infant's ribs are primarily cartilage and are very flexible, making them inefficient in ventilating. Infants primarily engage in diaphragm breathing, also known as abdominal breathing . As the diaphragm moves downward during inspiration, a nega- tive pressure is created, allowing the lungs to expand to draw air in. Muscles to stabilize, muscles to breathe The intercostal muscles of the chest are used for stabilization. However, after age 6, a child will begin to use the intercostal muscles for breathing. Then, contraction and relaxation of Normal pediatric respiratory rates This chart shows the normal respi-ratory rates from birth to age 18.

All Rights Reserved.329ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY these respiratory muscles moves air into and out of the lungs. Normally, expiration is passive. (See Normal pediatric respira- tory rates .) Retractions reveal distress When an infant or child is having difficulty breathing, retractions of the respiratory muscles will occur. The depth and location of the retractions will indicate the severity of the respiratory distress: \u0081 In mild distress, there are isolated intercostal retractions.\u0081 In moderate distress, there are subcostal, suprasternal, and supraclavicular retractions. \u0081 In severe distress, there are all of the retractions mentioned above along with accessory muscle use. (See Looking for retractions .) Adventitious breath sounds Adventitious breath sounds are sounds not normally heard on aus- cultation of the lungs. Due to the thinness of the chest wall, breath sounds seem louder and harsher in infants and young children, and adventitious breath sounds may transmit over larger areas. Looking for retractions This illustration shows you where to look for retractions. The types of retractions you see in a child can indicate the severity of his respiratory distress.

Sounds like adventitious breath sounds to me.Ventriloquist lungs Sounds may seem to originate in the lungs when they're actually referred from the upper airway, such as when there's mucus in the nose or throat. Auscultating in the axillae of infants and small children is a good way to hear adventitious breath sounds if they're present. (See Types of adventitious breath sounds .) Blown away When assessing breath sounds: \u0081 Encourage small children to breathe deeply by asking them to pretend they're blowing out candles or have them blow away a tissue. \u0081 Listen with the bell of the stethoscope for low-pitched sounds.\u0081 Listen with the diaphragm for higher pitched sounds. Diagnostic tests and monitoring techniques Children with suspected or diagnosed respiratory problems may need to undergo invasive or noninvasive diagnostic tests as well as monitoring procedures.Types of adventitious breath sounds This chart describes the types of adventitious breath sounds you might hear in a pediatric patient. Breath sound Characteristics Causes Wheezing \u0081 Continuous, musical, high-pitched sounds heard in mid- to late expiration (may be audible without a stethoscope)\u0081 Indicative of edema and obstruc- tion in small airways Crackles \u0081 Intermittent, medium- to high-pitched popping sounds heard during inspiration (may clear with coughing)\u0081 Caused by fluid in the alveoli, bronchioles, or bronchi \u0081 Continuous, snoring, out respiration (may clear with coughing)\u0081 Due to edema and obstruction in large bronchi and the trachea Stridor \u0081 High-pitched crowing sound heard on inspiration \u0081 Caused by upper airway obstruc- tion at or above the vocal cords Pleural friction rub \u0081 Grating, rubbing, loud, high-pitched sound heard during inspiration and expiration\u0081 Due to inflamed 2015 Kluwer.

It also assesses the ventilatory control system, determines the blood's acid-base balance, and monitors respiratory therapy. The respiratory and metabolic systems work together to keep the body's acid-base balance within normal limits. (See Understand- ing acid-base disorders .) ABG analysis is done on a blood sample taken from a periph- eral arterial puncture or an arterial catheter, such as an umbilical arterial catheter, arterial line, or central catheter. The normal pediatric values are similar to those for adults. Understanding acid-base disorders Acid-base disorders may have several causes and signs and symptoms, as outlined in the chart below along with arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis findings for each disorder.

All Rights Reserved.332RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Nursing considerations If the sample will be drawn from an arterial catheter, reassure the child that he won't feel any pain. If the sample will be taken via arterial puncture, keep in mind that this is typically more painful than a venous puncture. Help minimize the trauma from a periph- eral arterial puncture:\u0081 Be honest about the painful part of the procedure. (For ex-ample, say, \"This is going to hurt for a few seconds. It's OK to be scared, but you're going to do a great job and it's going to be over very quickly.\") Blood borrowing \u0081 Explain that only a small amount of blood will be taken, and that the child's body will quickly make new blood to replace it. (Young children think they have a finite amount of blood and may have many misconceptions about what happens to them when some of that blood is removed.)\u0081 Allow the parent to comfort the child during the blood draw-ing. A parent's presence reassures the child that nothing terrible will happen to him. Count and squeeze \u0081 Give the child coping mechanisms. (For example, say, \"Count to 5 and the hurting part will be over,\" or, \"Squeeze your mother's hand if it hurts.\") \u0081 Praise the child for doing a good job regardless of how he reacts.\u0081 Comfort the child and apply a bandage as soon as the sample has been drawn; covering the site reas- sures the child that the hurting part is truly over. Obtaining the sample If a peripheral arterial puncture is performed, check arterial cir- culation to the area (for example, with the Allen test) before the puncture is made. After the puncture, apply firm pressure to the arterial site to stop the bleeding; then frequently assess the site for bleeding or hematoma formation. To obtain the sample, follow these steps: \u0081 Draw the blood sample into a heparinized syringe because un- clotted blood is required. \u0081 Remove air bubbles from the sample to avoid altering the gas concentration.\u0081 Keep the blood sample on ice and transport it immediately to the laboratory.

On a chest X-ray, soft tissues, such as organs and muscles, appear as gray forms. Dem bones, dem bones Dense tissue such as bone appears white and clearly defined. The chest X-ray is used to rule out foreign body aspiration, determine infectious process, and gain information on cardiac size and contour, vessel and cardiac chamber size, and status of pulmonary blood flow. Inspiration, expiration, front and back Inspiratory and forced expiratory films are best to rule out foreign body aspiration. Anterior-posterior and lateral films are best to view internal structures for diagnosis of disease processes in the chest. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the child, assuring him that there are no \"hurting parts\" to the test. If possible, show the child an actual X-ray film to illustrate what the X-ray can and can't show. (Young children may think an X-ray machine will be able to tell what he's thinking and feeling.)\u0081 Protect the child from radiation exposure by covering his gonads and thyroid gland with lead shields during the test. \u0081 Make sure the child holds still during the test and tell him that doing so is his special job. (You may need to assist the child to do so.) Pulmonary function tests Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are a series of measurements used to evaluate ventilatory function. They aid in the assessment of lung function in children with acute or chronic respiratory disorders. (See Understanding PFT results , page 334.) Serial testing Normal values can change dramatically with growth. For this reason, serial determination of pulmonary function is more infor-mative than a single PFT, especially when evaluating a disorder for severity or progression, or when evaluating the effects of treatment. You'd be surprised what a child can aspirate! On a chest X-ray, an aspirated foreign body will appear white. Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 333 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 333 7:51 PM 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.334RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Breathing on cue PFTs require the child to cooperate and understand instructions. Most children aren't able to perform the testing until about age 5, because it requires manipulating equipment, holding their breath, and exhaling on cue with directions.Understanding PFT results You may need to interpret pulmonary function test (PFT) results in your assessment of a patient's respiratory status. Use this chart as a guide to common PFTs. Restrictive and obstructive The chart mentions restrictive and obstructive defects. \u0081 A restrictive defect is one in which a person can't inhale a normal amount of air; it may occur with chest wall deformities, neuromuscular diseases, or acute respiratory tract infections.\u0081 An obstructive defect is one in which something obstructs the flow of air into or out of the lungs; it may occur with such disorders as asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Test Implications Tidal volume (V T): amount of air inhaled or ex- haled during normal breathingDecreased V T may indicate restrictive defect and indicates the need for further tests such as full chest X-rays. Minute volume (MV): amount of air breathed per minuteNormal MV can occur in emphysema. Decreased MV may indicate other diseases such as pulmonary edema. Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV): amount of air inhaled after normal inspirationAbnormal IRV alone doesn't indicate respiratory dysfunction. IRV decreases during normal exercise. Expiratory reserve volume (ERV): amount of air that can be exhaled after normal expirationERV varies, even in healthy people. Vital capacity (VC): amount of air that can be exhaled after maximum inspirationNormal or increased VC with decreased flow rates may indicate re- duction in functional pulmonary tissue. Decreased VC with normal or increased flow rates may indicate respiratory effort, decreased thoracic expansion, or limited movement of the diaphragm. Inspiratory capacity (IC): amount of air that can be inhaled after normal expirationDecreased IC indicates restrictive defect. Forced vital capacity (FVC): amount of air that can be exhaled after maximum inspirationDecreased FVC indicates flow resistance in the respiratory system from obstructive disorders, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Forced expiratory volume (FEV): volume of air exhaled in the first (FEV 1), second (FEV 2), or third (FEV 3) FVC maneuverDecreased FEV 1 and increased FEV 2 and FEV 3 may indicate obstruc- tive disease. Decreased or normal FEV 1 may indicate restrictive defect. Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 334 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 334 7:51 PM 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.335DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND MONITORING TECHNIQUES 95% and above is a pretty good saturation rate.Nursing considerations Explain the test to the child and his parents, stressing that there's no pain involved. Tell the child that his job will be to follow instructions related to handling equipment, holding his breath, and inhaling on cue. Have him practice doing these things before the actual test. In addition:\u0081 Note that results may not be accurate because the young child may have difficulty following the necessary directions. \u0081 Instruct the child and his parents that he should have only a light meal before the test.\u0081 Withhold bronchodilators and intermittent positive-pressure breathing therapy before the test. Pulse oximetry Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive monitoring technique used to estimate arterial oxygen saturation through a probe that mea-sures saturation by the absorption of red and infrared light as it passes through tissue. It measures the amount of oxygen carried by hemoglobin by reading the amount of light that passes through a vascular bed and converting the amount of light absorbed by the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin, which gives a saturation value. Sensing saturation The sensor can be located on an extremity, a digit, a palm, or an earlobe or wrapped around the foot (in an infant) and works best when there's adequate peripheral perfusion. A reading of 95% or greater is ideal for most children. Nursing considerations Explain this type of monitoring to the child and his par- ents, and put the probe on a parent or nurse so the child can see that it's painless. Reassure him that even though it's used to measure oxygen in the blood, no needles are needed. In addition:\u0081 Place the probe on a site with good perfusion, such as the finger, foot, or toe. \u0081 Periodically rotate sites for probe placement to pre- vent skin breakdown under the probe.\u0081 To ensure that the value is accurate, make sure the pulse reading on the pulse oximeter matches the child's heart rate.

All Rights Reserved.336RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Treatments and procedures Respiratory treatments and procedures commonly used for the pediatric patient include aerosol therapy, assisted ventilation, chest physiotherapy (CPT), endotracheal Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) are used to administer medications such as bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids to children. Spaced out Children need to use a spacer with a valve if they can't coordinate inspiration with medication release or if they're younger than age 5. The spacer is a tube that captures the aerosol released, allowing the child to breathe it in over a couple of minutes. Under-age aerosol Nebulizer therapy is sometimes used for infants. A nebulizer aero-solizes the medication, releasing it into a small mask that's placed over the child's face. The child can then breathe in the medication through his mouth by taking deep, slow breaths. Liquid to vapor Vaporizers are used to create vapor from a liquid. They're most commonly used to vaporize cool water to increase the humidity in a room for the benefit of children with swollen, reactive airways. They can relieve many symptoms of upper airway irritation and congestion in young children. Nursing considerations Before beginning treatment, show the child the MDI with spacer or nebulizer mask. Let the child place the MDI/spacer to his mouth or the mask to his face before the medication has been added. \u0081 To determine the effectiveness of aerosol therapy, assess the patient's breath sounds before and after treatment.\u0081 Monitor the patient's tolerance of the procedure. An infant or young child may fight the MDI with spacer mask or the mask over his face during nebulizer therapy. (Calming techniques such as swaddling may be necessary.)\u0081 After teaching the child and his parents how to use the device correctly (which is necessary for optimal effectiveness), observe Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 336 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 336 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.337TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES while they demonstrate their technique; provide support and correct technique as needed. (See Using an MDI .) Assisted ventilation Assisted ventilation can be administered to children via mechanical ventilation or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Mechanical ventilation Mechanical ventilation involves inflation of the lungs with compressed gas. It may be needed for children who are unable to maintain adequate gas exchange due to airway obstruction, neuromuscular disease, or other pulmonary pathology. Compress and pressurize The compressed gas is pushed into the lungs with pressure, and the exhalation is then passive. Oxygen may also be adminis-tered. Mechanical ventilation requires the child to be intubated or to have a tracheostomy, whereas positive-pressure ventila- tions may also be given by a bag and mask apparatus. Inflate and expand Inflation pressures are limited to what's necessary to provide sufficient lung expansion for adequate ventilation and preven-tion of atelectasis, while keeping a careful watch for damage to airways and lung parenchyma. \u0081 Pressure-cycle ventilators, most commonly used in infants, deliver an indefinite volume of gas at a fixed inflation pressure.\u0081 Volume-cycled ventilators, most commonly used in children and adolescents, deliver a fixed volume of gas at whatever inflation pressure is necessary, up to a preset maximum. With any ventilator, the nurse must assess the child care- fully and frequently for breath sounds, chest wall excursion, and ABG measurements and pulse oximetry. Continuous positive airway pressure CPAP is used to infuse oxygen or air under a preset pressure through nasal prongs or a small mask. The pressure increases the alveolar volume by preventing the alveoli from collapsing on expiration, which leads to an increased functional residual capacity and improves the diffusion time of oxygen.It's all relative Using an MDI To optimize treatment, make sure your patient (and his parents) know how to use a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) prop-erly by providing them with the fol-lowing instructions: Shake the canister while tak- ing a deep breath in and out. Use a spacer with each use of the MDI. Depress the button on the canister at the beginning of the next inhalation. Breathe the mist in deeply and hold your breath for the count of 10, then exhale. Repeat as needed to com-plete the dosage. (Dosages are usually set in numbers of puffs or inhalations.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 337 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 337 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.338RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS When there's no time to prepare a child before an emergency procedure, talk him through it\u2014 step-by-step\u2014while it's being done.Nasal fashion statement Some CPAP systems come with small, triangular-shaped masks that fit only over the nose. These masks help prevent skin break-down and irritation around and inside the nares that can occur with long-term use of nasal prongs and for preterm neonates whose nares are very small to begin with. Nursing considerations Before beginning assisted ventilation, explain the proce- dure to the parents and the child. If ventilation must be initiated in an emergent situation, tell the child (and his parents) what's happening as it's being done. \u0081 Place the patient on a cardiorespiratory monitor and pulse oximeter during any form of assisted ventilation.\u0081 Obtain blood gases to monitor gas exchange and oxy- genation status as ordered. (Prepare the child if an arterial puncture must be performed.) Suction secretions \u0081 For infants who have an ET tube or tracheostomy, suction the airway as needed to prevent occlusion with secretions.\u0081 Frequently assess breath sounds and watch for signs of ET tube or tracheostomy dislodgment. Make sure the ET or tracheostomy tube is appropriately secured to prevent dislodgment. Assess for distress \u0081 In patients who are mechanically ventilated, observe for signs of pneumothorax, such as respiratory distress, absent or decreased breath sounds on one side (the affected side), hypotension, and oxygen desaturation on pulse oximetry. \u0081 For patients receiving CPAP via nasal prongs, cut and place a cushioning dressing (such as Duoderm) over the edges of the nares and the tip of the nose to protect the skin. Chest physiotherapy CPT includes breathing exercises and postural drainage. These therapies help to strengthen respiratory musculature and develop more efficient patterns of breathing. Drain and clear Postural drainage is usually done in combination with other tech-niques to enhance the clearance of mucus from the airway. It can be done with manual percussion, vibration, and squeezing of the chest followed by a cough or forceful expiration.

All Rights Reserved.339TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES Soap bubbles and a bubble wand can do wonders for deep breathing\u2014and for morale. (It's fun for the kids, too!)P ercussion section The most common technique involves manual percussion of the chest wall with the patient placed in a postural drainage position with the head down, while the provider strikes the chest wall with a cupped hand or a special device for per- cussing small areas. CPT is contraindicated in children who pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, increased intracranial pressure, osteogenesis imperfecta, or minimal car- diac reserves. (See Percussion devices .) Nursing considerations Explain the purpose of physiotherapy to the child and his parents. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Administer bronchodilators, if ordered, before CPT to en- hance airway clearance. \u0081 Perform percussion over the ribs only; don't percuss over the spine or the sternum.\u0081 Encourage the child to cough (which may be easier while sitting up) and give him a soft pillow or stuffed toy to hug while coughing to provide support.\u0081 Encourage the child to perform deep breathing exercises; use techniques to make this fun, such as having the child blow soap bubbles, blow through a straw, or blow cotton balls or tis-sues across a table. Endotracheal intubation ET intubation is a short-term measure that may be needed in an emergency. It's used to stabilize the airway if a child is losing the ability to keep the airway open due to swelling or exhaustion that leads to a deteriorating level of con- sciousness. The ET tube can be inserted orally (orotra-cheal) or nasally (nasotracheal). The ET tube prevents vocal cord vibration; when the child is intubated, he's unable to cry or talk. If long-term intubation is re- quired, a tracheostomy may be necessary. Nursing considerations If there's time, explain the procedure before intubation. If the tube is inserted as an emergency measure, explain each step as it's taken. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Suction the ET tube as needed to maintain patency.Percussion devices Percussion is done to clear secretions from the airway. It can be performed by striking areas over the patient's lungs using either the hand (posi-tioned as in the top illustration) or a percussion device (such as the one in the bottom illustra-tion) that's used for infants. Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 339 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 339 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.340RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Always remember that oxygen needs to be administered as prescribed\u2014just like any other drug.\u0081 Securely retape the tube to the child's face as needed to prevent dislodgment.\u0081 Monitor skin integrity around the tube, such as around the nares if nasotracheally intubated or on the lips and gums if orotracheally intubated. Separate but equal \u0081 Frequently monitor breath sounds to assess lungs and for posi- tioning of the tube; breath sounds should be equal bilaterally.\u0081 Observe for signs of tube dislodgment, such as audible crying or talking, oxygen desaturations on pulse oximetry, and decreased breath sounds. Silent cry \u0081 Monitor the child's facial expressions. Although you may not hear him cry, his face will still make the grimaces of crying. Provide support, calming and comforting techniques, and pain medication as necessary. \u0081 Because the tube passes through the child's vocal cords, facili-tate communication with the child by providing alternatives, such as using sign language, allowing the child to write information, or using a communication board. Oxygen administration Some children require more than the 21% oxygen that's present in room air to maintain an adequate oxygenation status. Oxygen is usually required for children who have a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa O2) less than 60 mm Hg or an oxygen saturation range of 89% to 92% on pulse oximetry. When oxygen therapy is used, the goal is usually to keep oxygen saturation above 92%. Because oxygen is a drug, it should be administered only in the prescribed dosage. It's usu-ally administered in liters per minute (if via nasal cannula) or as a percentage (if via mechanical ventilation or an oxygen hood or tent). Oxygen can be drying, so it must be humidified before it's delivered to the patient. Oxygen can be administered through an ET or tra- cheostomy tube during mechanical ventilation or via an anesthesia bag and mask. For children breathing on their own, oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula, an oxygen hood or tent, or mask. Nursing considerations Explain to the parents (and the child, if he's old enough) why oxygen is being administered and how it will help the child's Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 340 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 340 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.341TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES No matter what kind of tent you're in, it's always a good idea to keep the flaps closed tightly!condition. If an ET tube must be used, prepare the child for its insertion, explaining what he'll feel and reassuring him that he'll get used to the tube quickly. In addition: \u0081 Monitor the effectiveness of oxygen therapy by assessing the child's color, pulse oximetry, and Pa O2 using ABG analysis. \u0081 Make sure that the patient is receiving the appropriate con- centration of oxygen; also make sure that the oxygen is being humidified before delivery to the patient. Indoor camping \u0081 For infants in an oxygen tent, keep the flaps of the tent closed snugly around the patient; openings in the tent will allow oxygen to rapidly escape, so the tent must be kept fully enclosed.\u0081 Try to cluster care and procedures to avoid frequently opening the tent. \u0081 Check the infant's clothes and bed linens frequently for moisture, and change as necessary to keep them dry. Tracheostomy Tracheostomy is a surgically created opening in the anterior neck at the cricoid cartilage leading directly to the trachea. This may be done in the emergency department, in the field where immediate intervention is necessary, or in the more controlled setting of the operating room. A tracheostomy tube is inserted to keep the opening patent; the tube must be secured in place to prevent accidental extubation. Tracheostomies are used for patients requiring long-term ventilation, or they can be created urgently for children with epiglottitis, croup, or foreign body aspiration. The tracheostomy is usually only needed short-term for these urgent indications. (See Tracheostomy , page 342.) Nursing considerations If time permits, prepare the child and his family before the proce- dure. Discuss how the tracheostomy will look and feel, and decide on a method of communication to be used after the procedure. \u0081 After the procedure, monitor the child for complications such as hemorrhage, infection, edema, decannulation (dislodgment of the tracheostomy tube), and tube obstruction.\u0081 Frequently assess the child's breath sounds and monitor respi- ratory status with blood gases. \u0081 Suction the tracheostomy Rights Reserved.342RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS \u0081 Provide stoma care per facility policy. The stoma can usually be gently cleaned with half-strength hydrogen peroxide to remove secretions. The skin around the stoma should be kept clean and dry. Monitor the skin for signs of breakdown. \u0081 Keep the tracheostomy tube ties clean and dry, and change as needed.\u0081 Keep the tracheostomy tube ties secured tightly, but with enough room to slip a fingertip between the ties and the neck to help prevent accidental decannulation. Respiratory disorders Disorders of the respiratory system that can occur during childhood include acute otitis media (AOM), asthma, bronchiolitis, Acute otitis media AOM is the most commonly diagnosed illness in childhood; it's an inflammation of the middle ear with a rapid onset of symptoms and clinical signs. AOM occurs most commonly in Tracheostomy This illustration shows a tracheostomy tube in place in the trachea. Note how the tied cloth tapes keep the tube securely in place. Tracheostomy tube Trachea Lung Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 342 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.343RESPIRATORY DISORDERS children between ages 6 months and 3 years and is uncommon after age 8. The incidence is higher during the winter months. Breast-fed infants have a lower incidence than formula-fed infants because breast milk provides an increased immunity that protects the eustachian tube and middle ear mucosa from pathogens. What causes it AOM is often caused by bacteria but can also be caused by viruses. The most common causative bacterial organisms are commonly cause AOM are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and adenoviruses. How it happens Infants and young children are more predisposed to AOM because they have:\u0081 short, horizontally positioned eustachian tubes \u0081 poorly developed cartilage lining, which makes eustachian tubes more likely to open prematurely\u0081 enlarged lymphoid tissue, which obstructs the eustachian tube opening \u0081 immature humoral defense mechanisms, which increase the risk of infection. (See Characteristics of a child's ear .) Characteristics of a child's ear You'll recognize three major differences between an infant's or a young child's ear and an adult's ear. These anatomic differences make the infant and young child more susceptible to ear infection:\u0081 A child's tympanic membrane slants horizontally, rather than \u0081 A child's eustachian tube slants horizontally; this causes fluid to stagnate and act as a medium for bacteria. Child's ear Tympanic membrane External canal Eustachian tube Adult's ear Tympanic membrane canal 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.344RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Hear ye, hear ye! Infants and young toddlers communicate ear pain by tugging at their ears.The great equalizer The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx and is normally closed and flat, thus preventing organisms in the pharyngeal cavity from entering the middle ear. The tube opens to allow drainage of secretions produced by the middle ear and equal- izes air pressure between the middle ear and the environment. No escape When swelling or other predisposing factors cause eustachian tube dysfunction, secretions are retained in the middle ear. Air is also unable to escape through the obstructed tubes and causes negative pressure within the middle ear. If the tube opens, the difference in pressure causes bacteria to be drawn into the middle ear chamber where they proliferate and invade the mucosa, caus-ing infection. Supine? Not this time Bottle-feeding an infant in the supine position increases the risk of infection because this position promotes pooling of milk in the pharyngeal cavity, creating an excellent medium for the spread of infection. What to look for Common acute symptoms of AOM include: \u0081 ear pain that may present as pulling at the ears in younger chil-dren or difficulty eating or lying down due to ear pressure and pain \u0081 fever \u0081 irritability\u0081 loss of appetite\u0081 purulent drainage in the external ear canal \u0081 nasal congestion and cough \u0081 vomiting and diarrhea. The trouble with tympany Otoscopy reveals: \u0081 tympanic membrane injection (sometimes bright red)\u0081 bulging tympanic membrane, which is dull, with no visible land- marks or light reflex \u0081 diminished mobility of the tympanic membrane with air insuffla-tion (pneumatic otoscopy). What tests tell you These tests are used for diagnosis and to guide treatment: \u0081 A culture and sensitivity of any drainage may indicate what the organism is and which antibiotic is indicated for treatment.

We'll have the patient feeling better in only 2 or 3 days.\u0081 Tympanometry is used to measure the change in air pressure in the external auditory canal (from movement of the eardrum).\u0081 Audiometric testing establishes a baseline or detects any hear- ing loss secondary to recurring infection. (Hearing evaluation is recommended for any child who has recurrent ear infections or chronic otitis media with effusion that lasts 3 months or longer.) Complications Complications of AOM include effusion (which may persist be- yond 3 months), hearing impairment, spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane, and mastoiditis. How it's treated In March 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians issued new guidelines for treating AOM to help inhibit the develop- ment of antibiotic-resistant organisms and contain the escalating costs of AOM, both direct (treatment) and in-direct (lost time from school and work). These guidelines are intended for otherwise healthy children without under- lying medical conditions that may complicate AOM (such as cleft palate, Down syndrome, and other genetic or immune system disorders) and include:\u0081 using analgesics, such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol), to relieve pain, especially in the first 24 hours of infection (Parents should be aware that analgesics\u2014not antibiotics\u2014will relieve the ear pain of AOM.)\u0081 on the basis of joint clinical management in children aged 6 to 23 months with nonsevere unilateral otitis media, giving parents the option of allowing their child's immune system to fight the infection for 48 to 72 hours, then only starting antibiotics if the child's condition doesn't improve after that time\u0081 encouraging the prevention of AOM by breast-feeding for the first 6 months of life, avoiding \"bottle-propping,\" and eliminating the child's exposure to tobacco smoke. But wait, there's more! The guidelines also recommend that antibiotics should be used without a waiting period for infants younger than 6 months of age, children ages 6 months to 2 years with a confirmed diagnosis of AOM (bulging tympanic membrane, ear pain, fever greater than 39\u00b0 C), and children ages 2 and older with severe symptoms.

Rights Reserved.346RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Most children should receive amoxicillin (Amoxil) as a first-line agent. With severe illness or if additional antibacterial coverage is necessary, amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) may be initiated. In cases of allergic reaction to amoxicillin or penicil- lin, alternative therapies may include cephalosporins, or co-trimoxazole (Bactrim). With antibiotic therapy, the child should experience symptom resolution within 48 to 72 hours. If drugs don't do it After antibiotic therapy is completed, the child should be reevalu- ated to make sure that treatment was effective and there are no complications.

Asthma Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory airway disorder that causes episodic airway obstruction and hyperresponsive-ness of the airway to multiple stimuli. It results from bronchospasms, increased mucus secretion, and \u0081 reduced expiratory flow\u0081 exercise intolerance\u0081 respiratory distress. What causes it Asthma exacerbations or attacks are caused by inflammation of the lungs, including the protective mechanisms of mucus formation, swelling, and airway muscle contraction.

All Rights Reserved.348RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Over-reacting The lungs react excessively in response to a stimulus (trigger), increasing anxiety and physical responses, in addition to releasing histamine and intracellular chemical mediators that result in bron- chospasm. The result is a vicious cycle of anxiety and physiologic response to anxiety. Gentleman, choose your triggers Common asthma triggers include: \u0081 exercise\u0081 viral or bacterial agents \u0081 allergens, such as mold, dust, and pollen \u0081 pollutants\u0081 changes in weather\u0081 food additives \u0081 animal dander. Many people with asthma, especially children, have intrinsic and extrinsic asthma. Outside and sensitive Extrinsic , or atopic , asthma begins in childhood. Patients are typi- cally sensitive to specific external (extrinsic) allergens and have a family history of asthma or other allergies. Extrinsic allergens that can trigger an asthma attack include such elements as pollen, animal dander, house dust or mold, kapok or feather pillows, food additives containing sulfites, and other sensitizing substances. Extrinsic asthma in childhood is commonly accompanied by other hereditary allergies, such as eczema and allergic rhinitis. A look within Patients with intrinsic , or nonatopic , asthma react to internal, nonallergenic factors. Intrinsic factors that can trigger an asthma attack include irritants, emotional stress, fatigue, endocrine changes, temperature variations, humidity variations, exposure to noxious fumes, anxiety, coughing or laughing, and genetic factors. Most episodes occur after a severe respiratory tract infection, especially in adults. Exercise-induced asthma is a narrowing of the airways that makes it difficult to move air out of the lungs. Symptoms include coughing; wheezing; chest tightness; and prolonged, unexpected shortness of breath after 5 to 20 minutes of exercise. These symp-toms are commonly worse in cold, dry air. Genetic messes Asthma is associated with two genetic influences: \u0081 ability to develop asthma because of an abnormal gene (atopy)\u0081 tendency to develop hyperresponsive airways (without Kluwer.

Sorry about that!A potent mix Environmental factors interact with inherited factors to cause asthmatic reactions with associated bronchospasms. How it happens Asthma attacks follow a predictable course of bronchospasm, inflammation, and airway narrowing. Here's how asthma develops: The tracheal and bronchial linings overreact to various stimuli, causing episodic smooth-muscle spasms that severely constrict the airways. Mucosal edema and thickened secretions also block the airways. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies, attached to histamine-containing mast cells and receptors on cell membranes, initiate intrinsic asthma attacks. When exposed to an antigen such as pollen, the IgE antibody combines with the antigen. On subsequent exposure to the antigen, mast cells de- granulate and release mediators. These mediators cause the bronchoconstriction and edema of an asthma attack. Ready, set, spasm! As a result, expiratory airflow decreases, trapping gas in the airways and causing alveolar hyperinflation. Atelectasis may develop in some lung regions. The increased airway resistance initiates labored breathing. Repeat and damage With repeated episodes of bronchospasm, swelling airways, and mucus plugging, cells that line the airways suffer damage, leaving a chronically irritated and scarred lining that results in air trap- ping or hyperinflation. What to look for An acute asthma attack may begin dramatically, with simultaneous onset of multiple, severe symptoms, or insidiously, with gradually increasing respiratory distress. Look for these signs and symptoms: \u0081 sudden onset of breathing difficulty \u0081 frequent coughing or frequent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis (which may be an indication that the child's airway is overly sensitive to stimuli) Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 349 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 349 5/22/14 7:51 PM Kluwer.

The four levels are mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. Level of severity Clinical findings Intermittent \u0081 Symptoms occur less than two times per week. \u0081 The patient is asymptomatic with normal peak expiratory flow (PEF) between exacerbations. \u0081 No interference with normal activity.\u0081 Nighttime symptoms occur less than two times per month.\u0081 Short-acting /H9252-agonist less than 2 days/week \u0081 Lung function studies show forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) or PEF greater than 80% of normal values; PEF may vary by less than 20%. Mild persistent \u0081 Symptoms occur more than two times per week, but less than once per day; exacerbations may affect activity.\u0081 Nighttime symptoms occur more one to four times per month.\u0081 Short-acting /H9252-agonist greater than 2 days/week but not daily. \u0081 Minor limitations in normal activity. \u0081 Lung function studies show FEV 1 or PEF greater than 80% of normal values; PEF may vary 20% to 30%. Moderate persistent\u0081 Symptoms occur daily.\u0081 Exacerbations occur more than two times per week and may last for days; exacerbations affect activity.\u0081 Bronchodilator therapy is used daily. \u0081 Nighttime symptoms occur three to four times per month or more than once weekly but not nightly.\u0081 Daily use of short-acting /H9252-agonist. \u0081 Some limitation in normal activity.\u0081 Lung function studies show FEV 1 or PEF 60% to 80% of normal values; PEF may vary by greater than 30%.

(See Four levels of asthma severity .) What tests tell you Several tests are used to diagnose asthma, assess its severity, and identify allergens:\u0081 Pa O2 and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Pa CO2) are usually decreased, except in severe asthma, when Pa CO2 may be normal or increased, indicating severe bronchial obstruction. Function or obstruction? \u0081 PFTs reveal signs of airway obstructive disease, low-normal or decreased vital capacity, and increased total lung and residual ca-pacities. (Pulmonary function may be normal between attacks.) \u0081 Serum IgE levels may increase from an allergic reaction. \u0081 Sputum analysis may indicate the presence of Curschmann's spirals (casts of airways), Charcot-Leyden crystals, and eosinophils. \u0081 Chest X-rays can be used to diagnose or monitor the progress of asthma and may show hyperinflation with areas of atelectasis.\u0081 ABG analysis detects hypoxemia (decreased Pa O2; decreased, normal, or increasing Pa CO2) and guides treatment. \u0081 Skin testing may identify specific allergens. Up to the challenge? \u0081 Bronchial challenge testing evaluates the clinical significance of allergens identified by skin testing.\u0081 Electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia during an attack; during a severe attack, this test may show signs of cor pulmonale (right axis deviation, peaked P wave) that resolve after the attack. Complications Status asthmaticus, in which there's unrelenting, severe respira- tory distress and bronchospasm, may occur despite pharmaco-logic and supportive interventions. Mechanical ventilation may be needed due to respiratory failure. Death may occur if a child in acute exacerbation isn't treated in a timely manner and proceeds to respiratory failure without intubation. How it's treated The best treatment for asthma is prevention of exacerbations. Management includes medications, environmental management of asthma triggers, and education and support of the child and parents. Choice of medications to promote optimal respiratory Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 351 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 351 Reserved.352RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Leukotriene modifiers can help control seasonal allergies.function is typically based on the asthma's level of control and severity. Anti-inflammatory agents Anti-inflammatory medications to reduce mucosal edema in airways inhaled corticosteroids, such as flutica-sone (Flovent) and budesonide (Pulmicort). These drugs are preventive medications, usually taken on a daily basis to stop the release of chemicals such as hista-mine during the inflammatory process. Anti-inflammatories must be taken con- sistently to be effective. These medications aren't effective after wheezing starts but may help gain control and speed the resolution of an asthma attack. Cortico-reactions Adverse reactions of corticosteroids include glu- cose metabolism abnormalities, increased appe-tite, fluid retention, weight gain, moon face, mood alteration, growth suppression, and hypertension, all of which may be severe if used daily for long-term therapy. Bronchodilators Bronchodilators are used to relax smooth muscle in the airway for moderate to severe symptoms resulting in rapid bronchodila-tion within 5 to 10 minutes. Short-acting /H9252-agonists (SABAs) are the first line of treatment for quick relief of acute symptoms and for prevention of exercise-induced the muscle bundles that constrict airways for airway dilation and relaxation and are used for acute or daily therapy, nocturnal symptoms, and exercise-induced broncho- spasm. When used for long-term control, they work best when a specific amount is maintained in the bloodstream, so serum level checks and dosage adjustments may be required. Adverse effects include tachycardia, nervousness, nausea and vomiting, and headaches. Leukotriene modifiers Leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast ( Singulair) may be used as a steroid-sparing adjunct for the prevention of broncho- spasm. They improve pulmonary function and enhance the effect of corticosteroids, allowing for lower dosages of corticosteroids.

Always think about your ABCs when evaluating a child's respiratory status.Adverse reactions include diarrhea, laryngitis, pharyngitis, or headache. Administering leukotri-ene modifiers daily, at bedtime, may promote compliance. Allergy shots and oxygen The use of allergy shots for hyposensitization\u2014to reduce sensi-tivity to environmental allergens that may be unavoidable, such as mold or pollen\u2014is controversial because their actual effect is questionable. Oxygen is administered by nasal cannula or face mask for the child exhibiting difficulty breathing. The oxygen must be humidified to decrease drying and thickening of mucus secretions. What to do Nursing interventions are focused on maintain- ing airway patency and fluid status, promoting rest, and decreasing stress for the child and his parents. \u0081 Upon arrival at the clinic or hospital setting, evaluate the child's current respiratory status, remembering the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation); move on to other activities only after establishing that the child doesn't need immediate interven-tion to promote oxygenation.\u0081 If the child isn't moving air or is unable to talk, take emergency action.\u0081 Continue to assess the quality of the child's breathing, obtain oxygen saturation via pulse oximeter, and peak expiratory flow rate in an older child (the frequency of assessment is based on the severity of symptoms). Top to bottom, looking for problems \u0081 Assess skin and intake and output, and perform a head-to- toe assessment to identify associated problems contributing to the asthma exacerbation. \u0081 Assess the child's psychosocial status, looking for indica- tions of anxiety or fear, and promote comfort for the child and his family. (Encouraging the parents' presence can be re-assuring for the child and can decrease his anxiety and fear.) \u0081 Place the child in a sitting (semi-Fowler's) position to facilitate respiratory effort.\u0081 Administer fluids, which are important for restoring and maintaining fluid balance as adequate hydration helps break up trapped mucus plugs in a narrowed airway.

(Include education on medication therapy and stress the need for follow-up care.) Smoke provokes \u0081 Teach parents about the dangers of smoking around a child with asthma. Encourage them to quit or, at the very least, never smoke indoors, even if the child isn't in the home at the time. Even if parents smoke outside, they should be encouraged to wear a smoking jacket so that the child does not inhale smoke residue from the parent's clothing. \u0081 Teach the older child signs of early respiratory distress so he can seek treatment before the signs get more serious. (A plan should be communicated to the child's school to ensure that medi-cations are given as needed and school officials can recognize respiratory distress.) Bronchiolitis Bronchiolitis is an illness that usually occurs after an upper respi- ratory infection causes inflammation and obstruction of the small airways (bronchioles)\u2014either early in life as a single episode or with multiple occurrences in the first year of life. It most commonly affects toddlers and preschoolers, but can become severe in infants younger than 6 months old, causing life-threatening respiratory distress that requires hospitalization. What causes it RSV is the leading cause of bronchiolitis. Other causes exist, however, including viruses, bacteria, and myco-plasmal organisms. Premature infants and those with Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 354 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 354 5/22/14 7:51 PM bronchopulmonary dysplasia, immunodeficiency, or congenital heart disease are at especially high risk. How it happens Bronchiolitis occurs when viruses or other infectious agents invade the mucosal cells lining the bronchi and bronchioles, causing the cells to die. Cell death results in cell debris that clogs and obstructs the bronchioles and irritates the airway. The airway lining responds by swelling and producing excessive mucus result-ing in partial airway obstruction and bronchospasm. The process continues as both lungs are invaded and the obstructed airways allow air in, but the swollen airways and mucus buildup don't allow for expulsion of the air, creating wheezing and crackles in the airways. Diminishing returns Air trapped below the obstructed airways interferes with gas exchange, leading to decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide levels. Airflow continues to decrease and breath sounds diminish. What to look for The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is based on clinical findings, the child's age, and the season. Clinical findings may include:\u0081 recent history of upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal stuffiness or serous nasal discharge accompanied by mild fever and a cough in older toddlers and preschoolers\u0081 wheezing, deep and frequent cough, and labored breathing\u0081 rapid, shallow respirations accompanied by nasal flaring and retractions \u0081 tachypnea, paroxysmal cough, and increasing irritability with increasing respiratory distress The child commonly appears ill, is less playful, and has little interest in eating or has a history of spitting up food with thick, clear mucus. What tests tell you Bronchiolitis is diagnosed primarily by history and physical examination. \u0081 Chest X-rays usually show nonspecific findings of inflammation, but may show areas of consolidation that are difficult to differenti- ate from bacterial pneumonia.\u0081 Viral cultures or antigen testing by nasal swab or a direct aspira-tion Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.356RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Palivizumab is given from November to April\u2014RSV season.\u0081 If the bronchiolitis is severe and advanced, there may be a rise in Pa CO2, leading to respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. Complications Some children with more severe cases require intubation and assisted ventilation if they become too fatigued to breathe effectively, and they progress to respiratory failure. Death may result due to severe RSV bronchiolitis in children with preexisting cardiopulmonary disease. Bronchiolitis in infancy may increase the chances of childhood wheezing and asthma. How it's treated Usually, supportive management with high humidity, adequate fluid intake, and rest is all that's needed when the bronchiolitis is mild to moderate in severity. The child with more severe bronchi- olitis will need: \u0081 monitoring with pulse trapped \u0081 humidified oxygen therapy via nasal cannula or an oxygen hood or tent to alleviate dyspnea and hypoxia\u0081 I.V. hydration if the child is tachypneic and unable to main- tain hydration status (due to decreased intake with respiratory distress or insensible fluid loss due to fever and increased respira-tory rate). Drugs to the rescue Pharmacologic therapy includes: \u0081 aerosol medications, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and beta-adrenergic agonists to act directly on inflamed and obstructed airways \u0081 antipyretics to reduce fever\u0081 antibiotics (only if a secondary bacterial infection such as otitis media is present) \u0081 ribavirin (Virazole), an antiviral drug delivered via hood, tent, or mask, to treat RSV. (Ribavirin's effectiveness is controversial, and is usually reserved for life-threatening cases.) 'Tis the season Preventative therapy may be indicated for RSV bronchiolitis in high-risk infants or children with congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic lung problems, cystic fibrosis, or prematurity.

The virus is one thing you definitely don't want to share.What to do Nursing care focuses on careful attention to respiratory function: \u0081 Assess airway and respiratory function carefully and frequently because it's important to intervene in a timely manner for worsening respiratory symptoms to prevent respiratory distress.\u0081 Maintain respiratory function by administering oxygen and pulmonary care therapies. Head's up \u0081 Elevate the head of the bed to ease the work of breath- ing and assist mucus to drain from upper airways.\u0081 Use oxygen saturation level as an indicator of the sever- ity of the disease and to spot early signs of deterioration. \u0081 Maintain isolation in a separate room or cohort room for RSV infection and use meticulous hand washing and contact precautions such as gowns and gloves to prevent spreading infection. (RSV is highly contagious and has the potential to spread during close contact.) Assess and de-stress \u0081 Perform psychosocial assessment by observing the child and his parents for signs of fear and anxiety, which can worsen respiratory distress. \u0081 Help to reduce anxiety by providing thorough explana- tions and updates and encouraging parents to participate in the child's care as able (to promote emotional security).\u0081 Cluster nursing activities to promote rest and decrease stress as rest is required to improve the child's breathing and healing. \u0081 Administer antipyretics to control temperature and promote comfort as needed.\u0081 Assist in hydrating the child by encouraging oral fluid intake if possible or maintaining I.V. infusion.\u0081 Assist in discharge planning and home care teaching when the child is able to go home; supportive therapies may be needed at home until resolution of all symptoms, which may take weeks. Croup Croup, also known as acute laryngotracheobronchitis , is a self-limiting upper airway obstructive disease that affects young children (usually younger than age 5). It involves severe inflam- mation and obstruction of the upper airway and is most common from the late fall to early spring, although it may occur throughout the year.

It also may be of bacterial origin (diphtheria or pertussis). It affects more boys than girls and is typically seen in children between ages 6 months and 3 years. How it happens Croup is usually preceded by an upper respiratory infection that proceeds to laryngitis and then descends into the trachea (and sometimes the bronchi), causing inflammation of the mucosal lining and subsequent narrowing of the airway. Profound airway edema may lead to obstruction and seriously compromised venti-lation. (See How croup affects the upper airway .) If it barks like a seal . . . The flexible larynx of a young child is particularly susceptible to spasm, which may cause complete airway obstruction. When the child's airway is significantly narrowed, he struggles to inhale air past the obstruction and into the lungs, producing the How croup affects the upper airway In croup, inflammatory swell- ing and spasms constrict the larynx, reducing airflow.

It's always darkest before the dawn Croup is characterized by gradual onset of a low-grade fever. Worsening of symptoms at night and a cough are common. The airway obstruction increases, leading to retractions, restlessness, anxiety, tachycardia, and tachy- pnea. Severe obstruction leads to respiratory exhaustion, hypoxemia, carbon dioxide accumulation, and respira-tory acidosis. What to look for History and physical examination typically reveal: \u0081 history of upper areas of diminished or absent breath sounds\u0081 retractions, wheezing, and cyanosis (in severe cases). What tests tell you The diagnosis of croup is based primarily on history and clinical findings. Croup is differentiated from epiglottitis by a lateral neck radiograph that shows a normal epiglottis. X-rays show symmetri- cal narrowing of the subglottic space (\"steeple sign\"). Complications If the child experiences obstruction that's severe enough to pre- vent adequate exhalation of carbon dioxide, respiratory acidosis results and the child eventually experiences respiratory failure. How it's treated The majority of children with croup don't require hospitalization. The mainstays of at-home treatment are vaporizers, oral fluids, and antipyretics. The major objectives of treatment are to main- tain an airway and provide for adequate respiratory exchange. High humidity with cool mist provides relief for most children and can be accomplished using a cool air vaporizer or a steamy bathroom at home.

Reading the signs Parents must learn the signs of respiratory distress so they can seek medial attention if symptoms progress. Indications for hospi-talization include: \u0081 or restlessness, or obtundation (mental dullness). Epi for edema treat croup: Nebulized racemic epinephrine (Isuprel) is used decrease subglottic inflammation and edema by causing mucosal vasoconstriction. This drug acts quickly\u2014within 10 to 15 minutes\u2014last about 2 hours, and can be administered as a nebulization every 20 to 30 minutes for severe croup and every 4 to 6 hours for moderate croup. \u0081 Corticosteroids reduce subglottic edema and inflammation. Dexamethasone (Decadron) given one time early in the course of croup results in a shorter hospital stay and reduces cough and dyspnea and, commonly, the need for intubation.\u0081 Acetaminophen reduces fever and oxygen consumption in the febrile child with croup. What to do The most important nursing intervention for the child with croup is continuous observation and accurate assessment of respiratory status, including careful monitoring of color, respiratory effort, evidence of fatigue, and vital signs to assess for worsening of symptoms that would require further management. Continually assess for possible respiratory failure, and have intubation equipment readily accessible at the bedside. \u0081 Assess for airway obstruction by evaluating respiratory status. \u0081 Administer prescribed medications as ordered, which may include racemic epinephrine via nebulizer, antibiotics if croup is bacterial in origin, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.

If aspiration risk exists, fluids may need to be adminis- tered I.V.\u0081 Help the child find the most comfortable position for the best oxygenation. Most infants and small children prefer sitting upright and many want to be held.

Encourage the parents to bring a favorite toy for the child. \u0081 Support the parents, who may be frightened by the rapid progression of croup and the alarming sound of the cough and stridor, by answering questions and explaining treatments and procedures. Encourage them to be present and participate in their child's care as appropriate.\u0081 Educate the parents about caring for the child at home. (See Croup class .) Cystic fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is a chronic, autosomal-recessive, inherited disorder of the exocrine glands that affects multiple organ systems. It's characterized by chronic airway infection that leads to bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal dysfunction, abnormal sweat gland function, and reproductive dysfunction. The disease is the most common fatal genetic disease in white children. Cystic fibrosis is accompanied by many complications. Life expectancy for the person with the disease is currently 37 years\u2014but, because of advances in treatment and technology, some people live much longer. What causes it The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis is located on chromo- some 7q. regulator (CFTR) . The exact function of CFTR remains unknown, but it appears to help regulate chloride and sodium transport across epithelial membranes. Causes of cystic fibrosis include abnormal coding found on as many as 350 CFTR alleles and autosomal-recessive inheritance.It's all relative Croup class Teach parents how to care for their child with croup at home by telling them: \u0081 medication dos-ages, administra-tion techniques, and possible adverse reactions\u0081 symptoms of croup to watch for and report\u0081 how to manage home vaporizer or mist treatments\u0081 how to alleviate symptoms (such as awakening with a barking cough) by putting the child in the bathroom and running hot water to produce steam (always with adult supervision).

This condition occurs most commonly in chil- dren with more advanced disease. Other complications include bronchiectasis, intestinal obstruction, rectal prolapse, cor pulmo-nale, diabetes mellitus, and nasal polyps. How it's treated Pulmonary treatment of cystic fibrosis is aimed at prevention and treatment of pulmonary infection by improving aeration, removing mucopurulent secretions, and administering antimicrobial agents. Twice per day keeps infection away Prevention of infection is maintained with good pulmonary hygiene with a daily routine of CPT, which is usually performed twice daily and more often if needed during pulmonary infec- tions. Some children can use a flutter mucus clearance device, a handheld device that facilitates removal of mucus by increasing sputum expectoration. The child blows into the plastic pipe that contains a stainless steel ball on the inside. Dilate and stimulate Bronchodilators delivered in an aerosol help open the bronchi for easier expectoration and are administered before CPT if the child has reactive airway disease or wheezing. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease, known generically as dornase alpha (Pulmozyme), is used to decrease the viscosity of mucus. Physical exercise is also an important adjunct to daily CPT as it stimulates Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 363 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Oxygen is administered to children with acute episodes, as needed, but is used cautiously as many of these children have chronic carbon dioxide retention. What to do Nursing care will vary depending on where a child is in the disease process and whether he's being treated for an acute exacerbation of pulmonary infection or is simply undergoing routine care. Oil change not included When PFTs are low or when children have difficulty breathing or experience a flare-up of infection, they may need to be hos-pitalized for a \"pulmonary tune-up.\" This type of treatment may include: \u0081 I.V. antibiotic therapy for Pseudomonas infection when feres with daily functioning\u0081 rigorous CPT \u0081 inhalation therapy. The deluxe treatment Nursing care also involves: \u0081 encouraging pulmonary hygiene (such as CPT, postural drainage, aerosol treatments with bronchodilators, and breathing exercises) to aid in sputum expectoration \u0081 monitoring respiratory status by evaluating breathing patterns and vital signs No dieting here \u0081 promoting adequate nutrition by providing a diet high in calories and protein, with fats as tolerated and increased salt intake during hot weather or febrile periods \u0081 maintaining calorie counts, monitoring intake and output, and recording daily weights\u0081 administering medications as ordered, including aminoglycosides to prevent or treat infection, bronchodilators, and pancreatic enzymes\u0081 administering vitamin supplements and iron and medium-chain triglycerides as dietary supplements Infection-free zone \u0081 monitoring for signs of infection and limiting exposure to per- sons with respiratory infections\u0081 promoting adequate rest by clustering nursing interventions and scheduling regular rest All Rights Reserved.365RESPIRATORY DISORDERS \u0081 providing and encouraging activities according to the child's developmental level and physical capabilities, and arranging for a school tutor or help with schoolwork if a school-age child is hospitalized \u0081 providing family support through education and referrals for counseling, support groups, and other resources, such as a dieti-tian, social worker, physical therapist, tutor, or pastor. Epiglottitis Epiglottitis is an acute inflammation of the epiglottis that occurs most commonly in children between ages 2 and 5. Epiglottitis obstructs the airway and needs immediate attention. What causes it Epiglottitis commonly results from infection with H. influenzae type B (Hib) but other possible causative organisms include S. pneumoniae and streptococci A, B, and C. How it happens Epiglottitis is commonly preceded by a minor upper respiratory infection and sore throat of several days duration that rapidly progresses to severe respiratory distress. The child usually goes to bed with no symptoms and then awakens later complaining of a sore throat and difficulty swallowing. If untreated, it may rapidly progress to increasing upper airway obstruction that results in hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis, closely followed by decreased muscle tone, altered level of consciousness and, if obstruction becomes complete, sudden death. What to look for Health history and physical assessment typically reveal one or more of these signs and symptoms:\u0081 sudden onset of symptoms, commonly preceded by upper respi- ratory infection \u0081 sore throat, pain on swallowing, and refusal to eat or drink due to dysphagia There's a frog in my throat \u0081 muffled, thick voice; wheezy inspiratory stridor; and snoring expiratory sound with a froglike croaking sound on inspiration (not hoarseness as with croup) \u0081 characteristic positioning of sitting upright, leaning forward, with chin thrust out, mouth open, and tongue protruding (tripod position)\u0081 drooling because of difficulty or pain with swallowing Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 365 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 365 5/22/14 7:51 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.366RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Give me a call if you suspect epiglottitis. Unless it's done by an expert, a throat inspection can make matters worse.Hot and toxic \u0081 high fever, toxic appearance \u0081 irritability; restlessness; and retractions include listlessness, cyanosis, bra- dycardia, and decreased respiratory rate with decreased aeration. On inspection, the child's throat appears red and inflamed with a large, cherry-red, edematous epiglottis. A job for the experts When symptoms of epiglottitis occur, throat inspection should be done only by an otolaryngologist or other proper ly trained personnel. In addition, equipment should be readily available for performing emergency ET intubation or tra- cheotomy because examination may precipitate complete airway obstruction. What tests tell you \u0081 A lateral neck film showing epiglottal enlargement con- firms the diagnosis of epiglottitis.\u0081 Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and increased bands and neutrophils on differential count may also indi- cate the diagnosis.\u0081 Identification of causative bacteria through blood cultures will assist with antibiotic selection. Complications Complications of epiglottitis include rapid progression of the illness to the point at which the airway is swollen shut. The child can't be intubated and suffers from respiratory distress. If respira- tory distress isn't reversed in a timely manner, the child can die or suffer from the long-term disabling results of brain anoxia. How it's treated The child is immediately transported to a facility that's set up to manage this type of emergency. When a diagnosis is confirmed, the child is usually intubated or a tracheotomy is performed to maintain an airway so the child can be ventilated if necessary.

All Rights Reserved.367RESPIRATORY DISORDERS Making sure a parent's questions are answered is the best prescription for stress reduction.The best treatment for epiglottitis is prevention, and it's recommended that all children receive the Hib conjugate vaccine beginning at age 2 months. First by vein, then by mouth Children with epiglottitis are treated with antibiotics, first I.V. and then orally, to complete a 7- to 10-day course. Sometimes, corticosteroids are used to reduce edema during initial treatment. Most intubated children will be treated with corticosteroids for 24 hours before extubation. The child continues to require intensive observation for the first 24 hours of antibiotic therapy, after which the epiglottal swelling usually decreases. By the third day the epiglottis is near normal and most children can be extubated at that time. What to do Nursing care focuses primarily on maintaining airway patency and observing for any signs of respiratory distress or infection:\u0081 Closely monitor respiratory status to ensure airway patency; if the child presents with symptoms of epiglottitis, ensure that a throat examination is performed only by a trained professional with emergency equipment on hand.\u0081 After the child is intubated, monitor closely and maintain a patent airway. Suction as needed, and provide oxygen therapy as ordered.\u0081 Observe closely for signs of respiratory distress after extubation.\u0081 Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.\u0081 Ensure adequate hydration by monitoring I.V. fluid ad-ministration and keeping strict intake and output records. \u0081 Help relieve anxiety by maintaining a calm, relaxing atmosphere; limiting intrusive procedures; encouraging the parents to bring in security objects from home; providing age-appropriate play activities; assisting the child to the most comfortable position for breathing before intubation; and administering sedative agents, as ordered, after the child is intubated.\u0081 Support the family by answering their questions and providing information about diagnosis and treatment. Allow the parents to be present to participate in their child's care, as appropriate.\u0081 Administer prescribed medications, which may in-clude antibiotics, sedation if the child is being intubated, and to 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It occurs in about 4% of children younger than age 4; the incidence de- creases with advancing age. What causes it Infection can result from viruses, bacteria, mycoplasma, or aspiration of foreign substances. Viral pneumonia is the most common type, with RSV the most common causative organism. Other viral causes include influenza and parainfluenza viruses, rhinovirus, and adenovirus. Major causative organisms in bacterial pneumonia include pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci. Children with bacterial pneumonia appear more ill than those with viral pneu- monia and have more localized physical findings. How it happens Bacterial and viral pneumonia begin as upper respiratory infections:\u0081 Bacterial pneumonia typically begins as a mild upper respira- tory infection in which bacteria circulate through the blood- stream to the lungs, leading to cell damage throughout one or more lobes of a single lung.\u0081 Viral, or mycoplasma, pneumonia begins as an upper respi- ratory tract infection. The virus infiltrates the alveoli near the bronchi of one or both lungs, where they replicate and burst out to kill cells and send out cell debris. Invasion of the cell snatchers Invasion of the virus, bacteria, or mycoplasma results in exu- date from cell death. This exudate fills the alveolar spaces, with pooling and clumping in dependent areas of the lung to create areas of consolidation. Bacterial pneumonia most commonly causes lobular involvement and sometimes consolidation. Viral pneumonia most commonly results in inflammation of intersti-tial tissue. (See Types of pneumonia .) What to look for Regardless of the causative agent, symptoms of pneumonia may include:\u0081 elevated temperature \u0081 cracklesTypes of pneumonia Pneumonia is clas- to location and extent of involvement:\u0081 Lobar pneumo- nia involves a large segment of one or more lung lobes; if it involves both lungs it's known as bilateral or double pneumonia . \u0081 Bronchopneu- monia begins in the terminal bronchioles and involves nearby lobules, which become clogged to form consolidated patches.\u0081 Interstitial pneu- monia is confined to and interlobu-lar tissues.\u0081 Aspiration pneu- monia is caused by aspiration of fluid or food substance in a child who has difficulty swallow-ing; who's unable to swallow due to paralysis, weakness, congenital anoma-lies; or who has an absent cough reflex. It can also occur if the child is fed while crying or breathing rapidly. Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 368 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 368 5/22/14 7:51 PM if consolidation exists. Fretful and feverish Infants may also demonstrate vomiting, seizures, poor feeding, fretfulness, fever, stiff neck, bulging anterior fontanel, circumoral cyanosis, respiratory distress, diminished breath sounds and crackles, and pleural friction rub. Headache and hacking Older children usually experience headache, abdominal or chest pain, high fever with chills, intermittent drowsiness and rest-lessness, tachycardia, tachypnea, hacking nonproductive cough, expiratory grunting, circumoral cyanosis, diminished breath sounds and disappearance of crackles (indicating consolidation), and moist crackles and cough that produce copious, blood-tinged mucus (as the disease resolves). What tests tell you Diagnosis of pneumonia is made by chest X-ray, which shows abnormal density of tissue such as lobar consolidation. Other tests include: \u0081 sputum specimen, Gram stain and culture, and sensitivity tests help differentiate the type of infection and the drugs that are effective against it\u0081 blood cultures reflect bacteremia and are used to determine the causative organism \u0081 WBC count reveals leukocytosis in bacterial pneumonia; the WBC count is normal or low in viral or mycoplasmal pneumonia\u0081 ABG levels vary, depending on the severity of pneumonia and the underlying lung state\u0081 bronchoscopy or transtracheal aspiration enables collection of material for culture \u0081 pulse oximetry may show a reduced oxygen saturation level. Complications Hospitalization is reserved for seriously ill children. Complica- tions of pneumonia include pleural effusion, empyema, and ten-sion pneumothorax. Some effusions require surgical drainage. How it's treated Treatment for all types of pneumonia consists mainly of symptom-atic therapy, such as pain and fever control, supportive care of the airway and hydration status, and rest All Rights Reserved.370RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS Thanks for elevating the head of the bed. It makes my work a lot easier when I'm dealing with pneumonia.\u0081 Bacterial pneumonias are treated with organism-sensitive antibiotics; mycoplasma pneumonias may also be treated with antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection. \u0081 Some children may also be treated with anti-inflammatory medications.\u0081 To help prevent pneumonia, immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) is recommended for all children in the United States beginning at 2 months of age. Additionally, pneumo- coccal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV or PPV-23) is recommended for children older than age 2 who are immunosuppressed or have chronic diseases, such as asthma and sickle cell disease. What to do The goal of nursing care is to restore optimal respira- tory function:\u0081 Ease respiratory effort by administering oxygen therapy as ordered. \u0081 Perform ongoing respiratory assessment, watching for respiratory distress by monitoring vital signs and respiratory status. \u0081 Use a humidifier or mist tent to create a high- humidity atmosphere.\u0081 Perform CPT, postural drainage, and suctioning as needed to remove mucus from airways.\u0081 Reposition the child frequently and elevate the head of the bed to prevent pooling of secretions and ease respirations. \u0081 Provide relief from pain when coughing and deep breathing with such medications as acetaminophen and ibuprofen; antitussives may sometimes be used before periods of rest and before eating.\u0081 Administer prescribed medications as ordered, including anti-biotics and antipyretics. What goes in must come out \u0081 Monitor intake and output, and weigh the child daily. \u0081 Encourage adequate oral intake or administer I.V. fluids to pre-vent dehydration. \u0081 Promote rest by clustering nursing care to minimize distur- bances, and maintain bed rest as necessary to conserve energy.\u0081 Provide a diet of high-calorie foods in small amounts in a re-laxed atmosphere. Keeping parents in the loop \u0081 Provide support to the child and his family by answering ques- tions, providing updates, and encouraging the parents to partici-pate in the child's care.

It's into the respiratory tract we go to spread, destroy, and erode.\u0081 Begin discharge planning early, providing teaching on medi- cations, especially antibiotics that must be taken at prescribed intervals for the full course. Tuberculosis TB, one of the major chronic diseases today, is increasing in incidence. This increase is due to the rise in homelessness, the increase in foreign-born immigrants in the United States, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Individuals at highest risk include the homeless, those with weakened immune systems (such as those with HIV infection or leukemia or those on corticosteroid therapy), young infants and children with immature immune systems, and those in correc- tional facilities. Cases of TB are most common in urban and low-income areas. Lying in wait TB is considered latent when the patient is asymptomatic and can't spread the disease to others, but has a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test result. In these individuals, the body has been able to prevent the infection from growing; however, the infection retains the ability to become active disease in the future, especially if the individual becomes immu-nocompromised. Active TB occurs when the body can't prevent the bacteria from multiplying and the individual becomes symptomatic. What causes it TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . The main source of infection in children is an infected adult or adolescent in the household. How it happens The lung is the usual portal of infection for human beings. Transmission occurs as the child inhales the microorganisms into the respiratory tract after an infected individ- ual coughs or sneezes. Epithelial cells proliferate around multiplying bacilli of M. tuberculosis in an attempt to wall off the invading organisms. This forms the typical tubercle. There's progressive tissue destruction as the primary lesion extends and spreads within the lung, which can produce pneumonia and erode blood vessels.

All Rights Reserved.372RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS What to look for Contact with an infected individual is the most important find- ing of the history. A child may be asymptomatic, but if signs and symptoms do occur, they may include: \u0081 chronic cough \u0081 anorexia\u0081 weight loss or failure to gain weight\u0081 fever. What tests tell you The tuberculin test is used to determine if the child has been ex- posed to the tubercle bacillus. The Mantoux test, which uses PPD injected intradermally, is the recommended procedure. A positive reaction (defined as 10 mm or more induration in 48 to 72 hours) indicates that the child has been exposed and his body has devel-oped sensitivity to the protein of the tubercle bacillus; it doesn't, however, confirm the presence of active disease. Once positive, always positive After a child has a positive reaction, he'll continue to have positive reactions. Some children born in other countries may have been vaccinated against TB using the Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine. Children vaccinated with BCG may have a positive PPD skin test. A previously negative reaction that converts to a positive indicates that the child has been exposed since the last skin test. Chest X-rays may be helpful in diagnosis as they may demon- strate hilar lymphadenopathy in active disease or calcification if the disease is in the healing phase. Complications Very young children (younger than age 2), adolescents, and chil- dren who are HIV-positive are more affected by the disease and have a higher incidence of disseminated disease. Death seldom occurs in treated children but may be an outcome in those who contract TB meningitis. How it's treated Treatment for TB lesions in children consists of drug therapy, general supportive care, and prevention of unnecessary exposure to other infections that may further compromise the body's de- fenses. Hospitalization isn't usually necessary except for needed diagnostic tests or, when indicated, surgery. Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 372 Meadows-Oliver_Ch09.indd 372 5/22/14 7:51 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.373QUICK QUIZ Two or more are better than one when it comes to treating TB\u2014and we're the team for the job!Teaming up to treat TB The use of two or more drugs simultaneously has been found to be optimal, with isoniazid and rifapentine given in a 3-month regimen. Isoniazid may also be used alone in a 9-month treatment regimen. Treatment must be modi- fied if the patient is a contact of an individual with drug-resistant TB. Consultation with a TB expert is advised if the known source of TB infection has drug-resistant TB. The guidelines for drug therapy are based on chest X-ray findings after a positive skin test has been verified. Removing the source Surgery may be required to remove the source of infec- tion in tissues that aren't affected by drug therapy or tissue that has been destroyed by the disease. Bronchoscopy for removal of a tuberculous granulomatous polyp or resection of a portion of a diseased lung may also be performed. What to do The majority of nursing care for children with TB is provided in the ambulatory care setting, in schools, and through public health agencies: \u0081 Assist with radiographic examinations, perform skin tests, and obtain specimens for laboratory examination.\u0081 Encourage the child to attend school and continue life activi-ties as usual. However, older children should be restricted from vigorous activities, such as competitive games and contact sports, during the active stage of TB.\u0081 Encourage compliance with the drug regimen to optimize treat-ment success. (Parents must be instructed to give the medication at the correct times and for the length of time it's ordered.) Quick quiz 1. In which anatomic structure does gas exchange take place? A.

It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.Anatomy and physiology The key structures of the urinary system are the kidneys and urinary tract. Kidneys The kidneys are bean-shaped organs located near the middle of the back. Their primary functions are to filter waste products from the blood and form urine and send it to the bladder through the ureters. Other functions of the kidneys include regulation of volume, electrolyte con-centration, acid-base balance of body fluids, and blood pressure and support of red blood cell (RBC) produc- tion (erythropoiesis). The kidney is divided into two distinct areas: renal cortex \u2014the outside, superficial area of the kidney renal medulla \u2014the internal portion of the kidney in which the nephrons are located. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 375 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 375 Reserved.376URINARY Nephrons are the kidney's functional units. These micro- scopic structures form urine. (See A closer look at a nephron .) A child acquires the adult number of nephrons shortly after birth, although these structures continue to mature throughout early childhood. The renal corpuscle within the nephron filters A closer look at a nephron The nephron is the kidney's basic functional unit and the site of urine formation: The renal artery, a large branch of the abdominal aorta, carries blood to each kidney. Blood flows through the interlobular artery (running between the lobes of the kidneys) to the afferent arteriole, which conveys blood to the glomerulus. Blood passes through the glomerulus into the effer- ent arteriole and into the peritubular capillaries, venules, and the interlobular vein. The peritubular capillary network of vessels then supplies blood to the Arcuate artery and vein Ascending loop of Henle Descending loop of HenleProximal convoluted tubule 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.377ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY blood plasma. The renal tubules within the nephron allow the filtered fluid to pass through on its way to the bladder. Multitasking kidneys To produce urine, the various parts of the kidney perform three basic functions: glomerular filtration (the process of filtering blood as it flows through the kidneys) tubular resorption tubular secretion. While waste products and excess fluids are filtered out of the blood for elimination, necessary fluids, electrolytes, proteins, and blood cells are retained (resorbed) into the bloodstream. Urinary tract The urinary tract consists of the bladder, urethra, and ureters. The bladder is a balloon-shaped pouch of a thin, flexible muscle, in which urine is temporarily stored before being eliminated from the body through the urethra. Urine is produced by the kidneys and passed into the bladder through two ureters, one from each kidney. A friendly nudge Peristaltic contractions within the ureters push urine from the kidneys toward the urinary bladder. A valve mechanism prevents urine from backing up into the kidneys as the bladder fills. When the bladder is full: \u0081 The micturition reflex is triggered, and nervous innervation causes relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle.\u0081 Relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle sends a message to the person's conscious mind to indicate the need to void. \u0081 The person then releases the external sphincter, and urine passes through the urethra and out of the body. Any volunteers? Voluntary control of these urethral sphincters usually occurs in a child between ages 18 and 24 months. However, the psychological readiness to initiate toilet training may develop much later. Urine Urine is a liquid waste product that's filtered out of the blood by the kidneys, stored in the bladder, and expelled from the body through the urethra during urination. About 96% of urine is water, and the other 4% is waste product. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 377 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 377 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Average urine output will vary according to age. (See Urine output in children .) Diagnostic tests Diagnostic tests commonly used to assess urinary system problems in the pediatric population include:\u0081 urinalysis and urine culture \u0081 blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels \u0081 X-ray of the and urine culture Urinalysis determines urine characteristics, such as specific gravity, pH, and physical properties (color, clarity, odor), and detects the presence of RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), casts, and bacteria. Culture on a plate In a urine culture, the urine specimen is placed on a medium and bacteria that may be present are allowed to grow and are then counted. As soon as bacteria are identified, sensitivity testing can determine which antibiotics would be most effective for treating the infection. Catch 'em while you can Specimens for urinalysis and urine culture are typi- cally obtained as clean-catch specimens but may also be obtained from an infant's diaper (urinalysis only), a urine collection bag for infants and young children, bladder catheterization, or a suprapubic bladder tap. Nursing considerations Nursing considerations differ according to the child's age and gender. For boys, the head of the penis and the urinary meatus must be cleaned. For girls, the urinary meatus must be cleaned, carefully washing between the labia.Urine output in children This chart shows the average volume of urine output per 24 hours for children according to age. Age-group Urine output Neonate 50 to 300 ml/day Infant 300 to 550 ml/day Preschool 500 to 800 ml/day School-age 600 to 1,400 ml/day Adolescent 1,000 to 378 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.379DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Lather up, rinse away For both boys and girls, soapy water, which is then rinsed away, is usually used for cleaning. If an antiseptic towelette is provided, it may be used without rinsing afterward. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Instruct the child or parents on how to clean the penis or meatus.\u0081 Instruct the child or parents on how to collect the urine specimen by starting to urinate into the toilet bowl to clear the urethra of con- taminates and then catching 3 to 6 oz of urine in a sterile container. \u0081 For neonates and infants, apply a urine bag to obtain a clean specimen; the bag fits over the perineum in females and the penis (and perhaps the scrotum) in males to catch urine as the infant voids (instruct the parents to inform you as soon as the child voids, so the container can be removed and fecal contamination can be avoided).\u0081 When obtaining a urine specimen from a catheterized child, don't take the specimen from the collection bag; aspirate a speci- men through the collection port in the catheter with a sterile needle and syringe. Keep it clean A clean-catch specimen may be needed to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI). In addition to the procedures used for routine uri-nalyses, it's useful to: \u0081 Instruct the child or parents to use an antiseptic solution to clean the urethral meatus (with a prepared towelette or a cotton ball soaked in the solution); the urethral meatus should be cleaned at least three times, using a new towelette or cotton ball each time. \u0081 Stress to the child and parents the importance of not touching the inside of the sterile container to maintain its sterility. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine Serum BUN and creatinine levels are obtained from blood samples drawn from venipuncture.\u0081 BUN levels can provide a great deal of information about kidney function; they measure the blood nitrogen that's part of the urea resulting from catabolism of amino acids (proteins). When the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduces suddenly and severely, the BUN level rises suddenly. \u0081 Plasma creatinine levels become elevated when there's catabo- lism of creatinine phosphate in skeletal muscles. An elevation in these levels indicates poor renal function.\u0081 The ratio between BUN and creatinine may also be examined. The ratio is usually between 10:1 and 20:1. Results vary with muscle damage, as in the case of a crushing injury or degenerative muscle disease. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 379 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 379 5/22/14 7:52 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It's a painless first step toward sorting out a problem in the urinary system.Nursing considerations Nursing considerations are aimed at making venipuncture less stressful for the child.\u0081 Use lidocaine and prilocaine (eutectic mixture of local anes- thetics [EMLA]) cream or some other form of topical anesthetic to make it easier and less traumatic to draw blood from a child; remember to apply it at least 1 hour before drawing blood.\u0081 Allow the parent to be present, and allow the child to hold a comfort object, such as a stuffed animal or blanket, during the venipuncture.\u0081 Follow dietary orders as necessary; sometimes, when BUN levels are elevated, protein intake may need to be limited. KUB radiography KUB assesses the size, shape, position, and possible areas of calcification of the kidneys, ureters, and blad-der. A KUB may be required as a first step if a problem with these structures is suspected. Nursing considerations The nurse should help the child remain quiet and lie still during the X-ray. Tell the child that this is his \"job\" and that there's no \"hurting part\" involved. Depending on facility policy, parents may be able to re- main in the radiology room with the child. Instruct them that they must be shielded from radiation by wearing a lead apron. Excretory urography Excretory urography is a form of X-ray of the lower urinary tract, during which a dye is injected intravenously (I.V.). A series of X-rays is taken as the dye passes through the bloodstream, is filtered through the kidneys, passed on through the ureters into the bladder, and then through the urethra to be eliminated from the body. Nursing considerations Begin by explaining the reason for the test to the child and parents and telling them what to expect.\u0081 Prepare the child for insertion of the I.V. line and reassure him that it's the only needle stick he'll experience. \u0081 Assess for a history of allergies to dyes, iodine, shellfish, or eggs because of the use of an iodine-based contrast medium. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 380 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 380 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.381DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Before a VCUG, reassure the child that the X-ray technician won't be watching him while he's voiding; he'll be looking at the X-ray instead.\u0081 Administer a bowel preparation as ordered; the colon must be emptied because a full bowel won't allow proper visualization of the urinary tract. \u0081 Insert an I.V. line to allow for the injection of the dye. \u0081 Explain to the child that he may feel warm or a bit woozy when the dye is injected; reassure him that this is normal and that the feeling will pass quickly. \u0081 On the day of the test, allow only clear liquids to be consumed until after the test is completed. Voiding cystourethrogram VCUG is an X-ray of the bladder and the lower urinary tract. A catheter is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, and a water-soluble contrast medium is injected through the catheter. The catheter is then withdrawn, and X-ray images are taken as the bladder is emptied. This test is performed to determine if there are abnormalities of the lower urinary tract, particularly vesicoureteral reflux, a condition that increases the risk of or prolongs a UTI. Sedation is rarely required, nor is it desirable, because the child must urinate during the test. Nursing considerations VCUG can be a difficult test for children. Insertion of a cathe ter can be uncomfortable and embarrassing. The child will be asked to void during the test, and to do so without going into the bathroom, which can be confusing to a child who has recently been toilet trained. What's more, the thought of voiding in the X-ray room in full view of the technician can be embarrassing. Reassure the child that the hospital staff realizes he knows how to use the bathroom and that he'll be urinating during the test only because he's being asked to do so (explain why this is necessary). In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Explain the reason for the test and prepare the child for inser-tion of the catheter.\u0081 Before the test, make sure the child is dressed in comfortable clothing and is wearing no metal objects. \u0081 Assess for a history of allergies to dyes, iodine, shellfish, or eggs because of the use of an iodine-based contrast medium.\u0081 Tell the parents of infants and young children that the child may be wrapped tightly in a blanket to help him lie still during the procedure.\u0081 Assure the parents that the amount of radiation received by the child is minimal.

All Rights Reserved.382URINARY PROBLEMS A little cold water can put out the \"fire\" during a postcatheter void.\u0081 Inform the parents that a VCUG can't be performed while the child has an active UTI. Behind closed doors \u0081 Insert a urinary catheter just before the test; provide as much privacy as possible by closing the door or drawing curtains, and allow a parent to remain in the room if the child desires (depending on the child's age, a nurse of the same sex may be the best person to insert the catheter).\u0081 After the procedure, remove the urinary catheter and encourage the child to drink fluids to reduce burning on urination and to flush out residual dye; pouring a glass of very cold water over the genital area during the first few voids after catheter re-moval helps to minimize burning. Renal biopsy Although renal biopsy isn't performed routinely in children, it may be used to evaluate decreased kidney function, persistent blood in the urine, or protein in the urine. It may also be performed to evaluate the functioning of a newly transplanted kidney. In renal biopsy, a needle is inserted through the child's flank under ultrasound guidance. A small specimen of kidney tissue is withdrawn and sent for microscopic study. Nursing considerations Prepare the child and parents for the procedure, which can be frightening. Use a doll to show the child how it will be done. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Reassure the parents that ultrasound will allow the doctor to see exactly where he'll be inserting the needle and will prevent damage to other organs.\u0081 Provide analgesics as ordered. \u0081 Assist with positioning and holding the child throughout the procedure. Treatments and procedures Common treatments and procedures used in the care of a child with a urinary disorder include bladder catheterization, hemo-dialysis, kidney transplantation, and peritoneal dialysis. Always prepare children for treatments and procedures with an age-appropriate explanation of what to expect. When treatments and procedures involve surgery, preparation should include an explanation of the anesthesia and what to expect postoperatively.

All Rights Reserved.383TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES A young child may need her parents' okay for a doctor or nurse to touch parts of her body that are otherwise off-limits to adults.Bladder catheterization Bladder catheterization may be performed for diagnostic or treatment purposes. In this procedure, the urethral meatus is thoroughly cleaned and an appropriate-sized catheter is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. Insert and drain In intermittent catheterization, a straight catheter is inserted and a urine specimen may be taken; the catheter is removed after the bladder is drained. Insert and inflate If the catheter is to remain in place, an indwelling catheter, also called a Foley catheter , may be used and attached to a drainage bag for urine collection. An indwelling catheter has an inflatable balloon near its tip to hold the catheter in place in the bladder. Nursing considerations Remember that catheterization can be uncomfortable and embar- rassing for a child. The older child may feel more comfortable when a same-sex nurse inserts the catheter. The younger child may be confused and fearful if he has been told it's wrong for anyone to touch his \"private parts.\" Have the parents explain to the child that this situation is different. To minimize trauma, follow these steps: \u0081 Educate the child and parents about the purpose of the catheterization; if it's being done to obtain a sterile specimen, explain why this is preferable to a clean-catch specimen.\u0081 Prepare the child to facilitate the procedure and ease the child's fears; use a doll to show him what will happen.\u0081 Be sure to choose the appropriate-sized catheter. (For a premature neonate, a size 5 French feeding tube may be used; for a larger infant or a small toddler, use a size 8 French feeding tube; for children ages 4 and older, use a size 8 French to 14 French catheter.)\u0081 Provide as much privacy as possible; close the door, draw the room divider curtain, and allow the child to keep on as much clothing as possible.\u0081 Allow the parent to be present if the child desires.\u0081 Give the child coping mechanisms to deal with discomfort (such as \"Squeeze your mother's hand if it hurts,\" or, \"Count to 10 and the hurting part will be over\").\u0081 Use distraction techniques to help keep the child's mind off of what is happening. This can be accomplished with toys with which the child likes to play or with bubbles. Just be sure to keep everything clear of the sterile field that has been set up.

All Rights Reserved.384URINARY PROBLEMS A set of headphones and a CD player can be a great antidote to boredom during hemodialysis.Generous and gentle When inserting the catheter: \u0081 Clean the urethral meatus three times with an antiseptic swab, using a different swab each time. \u0081 Generously lubricate the tip of the catheter and gently insert it through the urethra into the bladder until urine returns and is collected in the sterile specimen container.\u0081 If the catheter doesn't easily enter the meatus, use a smaller catheter; never force it into the urethral meatus. \u0081 If performing an intermittent catheterization, gently remove the catheter after the bladder is drained; clean off the antiseptic and lubricant with water.\u0081 If inserting an indwelling urinary catheter, insert the inflatable balloon with sterile water and gently pull on the catheter to make sure it inflated; next, connect the catheter to the closed drainage system. Hemodialysis Hemodialysis involves the use of a machine to clean waste prod- ucts from the bloodstream if the kidneys are severely damaged or have failed. The blood travels through tubes to an artificial kidney in the machine, and waste products and excess fluid are removed from the body. The purified blood then flows back to the body through another set of tubes. Ideally, this would be done in a pediatric dialysis center. To stick or not to stick The child on hemodialysis may have a double-lumen central catheter in place in his chest to serve as a site for blood removal. Children needing long-term dialysis may have a subcutaneous graft, anastomosing a vein and an artery. This graft reduces the risk of infection but means the child will need two venipunctures each time dialy-sis is performed. EMLA cream should be used to reduce discomfort. Nursing considerations Provide diversional activities to prevent boredom, such as games, music, drawing or coloring materials, and videos; encourage a family member to stay with the child. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Weigh the child before beginning hemodialysis.\u0081 If the patient has a subcutaneous graft, check the blood ac-cess site every 2 hours for patency and signs of clotting; don't When it comes to kids and catheters, one size doesn't fit All Rights Reserved.385TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES When I can't do my job, the professionals send in a replacement\u2014 a healthy kidney from a living person or a cadaver. It isn't worth the risk. Even the common cold can pose a major threat to an immunosuppressed child.use the arm with this site for taking blood pressure or drawing blood.\u0081 During dialysis, monitor vital signs, clotting times, blood flow, the function of the vascular access site, and arterial and venous pressures. Look out for losses \u0081 Watch for complications, such as septicemia, embolism, hepatitis, and rapid fluid and electrolyte loss.\u0081 After dialysis, monitor vital signs and the vascular access site; weigh the patient and watch for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.\u0081 Use standard precautions when handling blood and body fluids. Kidney transplantation Kidney transplantation involves replacing a patient's diseased kid- ney with a healthy kidney from another person. The donor kidney may come from a living donor or a cadaver donor. Although hemo- dialysis and peritoneal dialysis are life-preserving procedures and may even be carried out in the home, kidney transplantation is the preferred method of renal replacement therapy in the pediatric population because it offers the opportunity for a normal life. Nursing considerations By the time a child undergoes kidney transplantation, he most likely has a long history of procedures and hospitalizations. The child should be given as many choices as possible; a choice as simple as which arm to use for a blood draw can help to give the child a sense of control. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Provide emotional support and guidance to the child and parents; prepare them for the procedure, including what will occur pre operatively, during the procedure, and postoperatively.\u0081 Arrange for the child and his parents to tour the intensive care unit and meet the nursing staff before the transplantation.\u0081 Administer immunosuppressive medications as ordered; a child who will have or has had a kidney transplant will be taking immunosuppressive medications to decrease the risk of organ rejection. \u0081 Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection; while immu-nosuppressed, the child is at increased risk for infection. You sneeze, you leave \u0081 Make sure that no one with obvious infection takes care of the child. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 385 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 385 5/22/14 7:52 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.386URINARY PROBLEMS \u0081 Prepare the child (and parents) for the possibility of continuing to need hemodialysis temporarily after the transplant because the transplanted kidney might not work effectively right away. Peritoneal dialysis In peritoneal dialysis, the blood is cleaned of waste products and excess fluids using the lining of the abdomen as a filter. Peritoneal dialysis is especially useful for children who are poor risks for vascular access and for those who live far from a medical center. This procedure includes these steps:\u0081 A peritoneal dialysis catheter is inserted through a small abdominal incision or a puncture hole into the peritoneal cavity. The catheter is then connected to fluid bags and tubing. \u0081 A cleaning solution is drained from a bag into the abdomen.\u0081 Fluids and waste products flow through the lining and are \"caught\" by the dialysis fluid.\u0081 This fluid is then drained from the abdomen, taking the extra fluids and waste products with it. Nursing considerations Prepare the child and parents for the insertion of the catheter into the abdominal cavity. Make sure a valid informed consent form has been signed and included in the patient's chart. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor the child's reaction to the sedation, anesthesia, and pain management regimen.\u0081 Make sure strict sterile technique is used at all times during catheter placement and peritoneal dialysis. \u0081 Monitor the child's response to the therapy.\u0081 Make the child as comfortable as possible and provide sufficient rest periods.\u0081 Assess for bleeding from the catheter insertion site.\u0081 Maintain patency of the peritoneal dialysis catheter; keep it in place, without kinks or pulling, and with the fluid bags at the cor- rect level. \u0081 Monitor for signs of infection at the insertion site. Urinary disorders Urinary disorders that may affect nephrotic syndrome, renal failure (acute and chronic), and Wilms' tumor. Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 386 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 386 Reserved.387URINARY DISORDERS Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the tubules of the kidneys (glomeruli), which filter waste products from the blood. When this inflammation follows an infection with streptococcal bacteria (most commonly via strep throat), it's called acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis . It's most commonly seen in boys between ages 3 and 7 but can occur at any age. Up to 95% of children recover fully; the rest may progress to chronic renal failure. An interesting point: The relationship between acute glomeru- lonephritis and scarlet fever was first recognized as early as the 18th century. Its relationship with hemolytic streptococcus was identified later in the 1950s. What causes it Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis typically follows a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the respira-tory tract. Less commonly, it may follow a skin infection such as impetigo. How it happens The disease usually begins about 1 to 6 weeks after a streptococ- cal infection, although 2 weeks is the most common time of onset. Clumping with the enemy In this immunologic disorder, antigens from streptococci clump together with the antibodies that killed them and become trapped in the tubules of the kidneys. The tubules become inflamed, and edema of the capillary walls decreases the amount of glomerular perfusion. The kidneys then become incapable of filtering and eliminating body wastes. What to look for Edema may initially appear in the face, especially around the eyes. Later, edema may occur in the legs. Changes in urination may in-clude low urine output (oliguria), blood in the urine (hematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), and cola-colored (smoky) urine. Other signs and symptoms may include:\u0081 high blood pressure\u0081 mild anemia, pallor \u0081 joint pain Rights Reserved.388URINARY PROBLEMS A child with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis might have to wait a while for potato chips and pepperoni pizza.What tests tell you Urinalysis reveals the presence of protein, RBCs, and WBCs in the urine. Blood studies show elevated levels of urea and creatinine.\u0081 Antistreptolysin-O test confirms that the patient has had a streptococcal infection. \u0081 Throat culture, if performed during an acute infection, confirms the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.\u0081 Renal ultrasound shows slightly enlarged kidneys bilaterally. \u0081 Renal biopsy may be performed to assess the renal tissue or confirm the diagnosis. Complications No complications are typically associated with acute poststrep- tococcal glomerulonephritis. Generally, a full recovery can be expected within a matter of weeks to months. If complications occur, they may include: \u0081 hypertensive encephalopathy\u0081 chronic or progressive problems of kidney function\u0081 renal failure (in rare instances) \u0081 pulmonary edema and heart failure (occasionally). How it's treated Treatment may involve antibiotics for 7 to 10 days to treat infections contributing to the ongoing antigen-antibody response. Other medications may include: \u0081 antihypertensives to control high blood pressure \u0081 diuretics to reduce fluid retention and edema\u0081 corticosteroids to decrease antibody synthesis and sup-press the inflammatory response. Lay low The patient may be placed on bed rest to reduce his metabolic demands. In the acute phase, a low-sodium, low-protein diet may be ordered to prevent fluid reten- tion, and fluid restrictions may be ordered to decrease edema. In rare instances, dialysis may be necessary. What to do Nursing care of the patient with acute poststreptococcal glomeru- lonephritis focuses on monitoring and education.\u0081 Check vital signs and electrolyte values; monitor intake and output and measure the child's weight daily. \u0081 Assess renal function daily through serum creatinine, BUN, and urine creatinine clearance levels; watch for and immediately report signs of acute renal failure (oliguria, azotemia, and acidosis) and monitor 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.389URINARY DISORDERS After a child has had acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, a sore throat can take on gigantic significance!Battle the boredom \u0081 Provide quiet, age-appropriate activities that the child can enjoy while on bed rest; allow him to gradually resume normal activities as symptoms subside. \u0081 Monitor for signs of complications, such as sudden major changes in vital signs, a change in the amount or appearance of urine output, significant weight gain, changes in vision, changes in motor abilities, seizure activity, severe pain, or behavioral changes. Medication education \u0081 Teach the child and parents about medications the child will be taking; tell them that the child should continue taking the prescribed medications even if he's feeling better and to report adverse effects. \u0081 Teach the child and parents about necessary dietary restrictions. Most commonly, this would include limited water and sodium intake. Strep alert \u0081 Advise the child and parents to immediately report signs of a streptococcal throat infection, such as sore throat and fever. \u0081 Teach the parents to monitor the child's weight and blood pressure on a regular basis; instruct them to report changes in the child's condition, such as increased edema, changes in appetite, signs of infec- tion, abdominal pain, headaches, lethargy, or changes in urine output. Chronic glomerulonephritis Chronic glomerulonephritis results from slow, progressive de- struction of the glomeruli of the kidney with progressive loss of kidney function. It may eventually result in renal failure. What causes it Most cases of chronic glomerulonephritis are thought to be caused by an abnormality of the immune system. Other causes may include: \u0081 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) shunt\u0081 infection with streptococcus or staphylococcus bacteria\u0081 exposure to organic solvents, mercury, or certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents \u0081 human immunodeficiency virus infection\u0081 infection 389 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 389 7:52 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.390URINARY PROBLEMS How it happens Because chronic glomerulonephritis may go undetected for years until renal function declines markedly, it's more commonly diag-nosed during adolescence than in early childhood. Damage, changes, impairment Damage to the glomeruli of the kidneys is caused by abnormal im-mune responses\u2014possibly a direct attack on the kidney itself or accumulated immune complexes in the glomerular filter. Chronic changes to the structure of the glomeruli result. These changes impair renal function\u2014specifically, inefficient filtering of the blood. Blood and protein then spill into the urine. What to look for In chronic glomerulonephritis, symptoms of declining renal function may be present along with hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension that don't respond to routine treatment. Nephrotic syndrome may develop. What tests tell you \u0081 Urinalysis shows a high specific gravity and the presence of blood, casts, and protein.\u0081 Blood chemistry shows hyperkalemia, anemia, and show small kidneys.\u0081 Renal biopsy may show one of the forms of chronic glomerulo-nephritis or nonspecific scarring of the glomeruli. Complications Complications of chronic glomerulonephritis may include ne- phrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, end-stage renal disease, chronic hypertension, malignant hypertension, heart failure, pul- monary edema, chronic or recurrent UTI, and increased suscepti- bility to other infections. How it's treated Treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis is largely symptomatic and may include:\u0081 antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure \u0081 corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications to suppress inflammatory and immune responses\u0081 restricted dietary intake of sodium, potassium, fluids, and pro-teins to help in the control of hypertension \u0081 dialysis or kidney transplantation if renal failure develops.

Provide emotional support and reassurance to the child and his parents and be sure to include clear explanations of procedures. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Weigh the patient daily. Carefully measure and record intake and output. \u0081 Monitor vital signs and watch for and report signs of inadequate renal perfusion (hypotension) and acidosis. Strike a balance Maintain proper electrolyte balance by: \u0081 strictly monitoring potassium levels\u0081 watching for symptoms of hyperkalemia (malaise, anorexia, paresthesia, or muscle weakness) \u0081 monitoring for and immediately reporting electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (tall, peaked T waves; widening QRS segment; and disappearing P waves) \u0081 avoiding medications containing potassium. (See Managing the child with hyperkalemia .) Follow through on the follow-up In addition, the importance of long-term follow-up, including fre- quent visits to the child's health care provider should be stressed to the parents. They should also be informed that follow-up renal biopsies will be needed every 2 to 5 years. If renal failure occurs, Advice from the experts Managing the child with hyperkalemia Emergency treatment is needed for the child with acute hyperkalemia (a serum potassium level higher than 7 mEq/L or ECG changes). Hypertonic glucose, insulin, and calcium gluconate may be administered because they provide a rapid, although temporary, reduction in potassium. However, these infusions won't remove potassium from the body. They may be used until a slower acting agent, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), can be administered. Kayexalate can be administered orally or rectally to bind potassium and re-move it from the body.During emergency treatment to lower potassium levels, assess the patient frequently. \u0081 If the child receives hypertonic glucose and insulin infusions, monitor potassium and glucose levels.\u0081 If the child receives calcium gluconate, monitor calcium and potassium levels.\u0081 If Kayexalate is given rectally, make sure the child doesn't retain it and become Kluwer.

Congenital anomalies of the ureter, bladder, and urethra Congenital anomalies of the ureter, bladder, and urethra are among the most common birth defects, occurring in about 5% of births. Some of these abnormalities are obvious at birth; others are recognized only after they produce symptoms. What causes it Causes of these congenital anomalies are unknown. How it happens The most common malformations include duplicated ureter, and epispadias. Their pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments vary. (See Congeni- tal urologic anomalies .) What to look for Signs and symptoms will vary. (See Congenital urologic anomalies .) What tests tell you With the exception of bladder exstrophy, hypospadias, and epispa- dias (which can be diagnosed on clinical examination), diagnostic tests are used to visualize the defect. Complications Complications will vary according to the specific anomaly but may include UTI, vesicoureteral reflux, voiding dysfunction, and hydronephrosis. How it's treated Surgical repair is needed. The specific procedure will depend on the anomaly.

Document the amount and color of urine, voiding pattern, strength of stream, and indica- tions of infection, such as fever and urine odor. Neighborhood watch Tell parents to watch for these signs at home. In all children, watch for signs of obstruction, such as dribbling, oliguria or anuria, ab-dominal mass, hypertension, fever, bacteriuria, or pyuria. When caring for the hospitalized child, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor renal function daily; record intake and output accu- rately; weigh diapers if necessary.\u0081 Follow strict sterile technique in handling cystostomy tubes or indwelling urinary catheters. \u0081 Make sure that ureteral, suprapubic, or urethral catheters re-main in place and don't become contaminated; document type, color, and amount of drainage.\u0081 Apply sterile saline pads to protect the exposed mucosa of the neonate with bladder exstrophy; don't use heavy clamps on the umbilical cord and avoid dressing or diapering the infant. Moistening mist \u0081 Place the infant with exstrophy in an Isolette, and direct a stream of saline mist onto the bladder to keep it moist; use warm water and mild soap to keep the surrounding skin clean, rinse well, and keep the area as dry as possible to prevent excoriation. \u0081 Provide reassurance and emotional support to the parents and, when possible, allow them to participate in their child's care to promote normal bonding. \u0081 As appropriate, suggest or arrange for genetic counseling. Hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS is a complex of symptoms that includes acute renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. It's an acute renal disease that occurs mostly in infants and children from age 6 months to 3 years. It's one of the main causes of acute renal failure in the young child, with severity of symptoms ranging any-where from subclinical to life-threatening. What causes it In pediatrics, the most common cause of HUS is an infection with a specific strain of Escherichia coli , usually the strain known as O157:H7. Such E. coli may be found in contaminated meat or pro- duce and in swimming pools or lakes contaminated with feces.

One of us is usually the culprit in a case of hemolytic uremic syndrome.The usual suspects HUS usually follows an attack of infectious bacterial diar- rhea caused by E. coli such as varicella, echovirus, and coxsackie A and B, may also cause it. Occasionally, HUS can appear, with no associated diarrhea. HUS may follow an upper respiratory infection and may be associated with such long-term illnesses as acquired immu- nodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer. How it happens The bacterial infection causes endothelial cell injury in the lining of the small glomerular arterioles. The endothelial cell capillaries. This platelet aggregation results in thrombocytopenia, and the kidneys become swollen and pale. Although damage occurs mainly in the endothelial lining of the glomerular arterioles, other organs may be involved. Cardiac involvement may include heart failure and arrhythmias. Pan-creatitis or type 1 diabetes mellitus may occur from pancreatic involvement. Ocular involvement may include retinal or vitreous hemorrhage. What to look for The patient's history typically shows a recent episode of diarrhea. Less commonly, there may be a history of upper respiratory tract infection or viral infection. Signs and symptoms may include: \u0081 (oliguria or anuria)\u0081 hypertension\u0081 gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with blood in stool\u0081 seizures\u0081 heart failure.

Nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the kidneys lose a significant amount of protein in the urine, resulting in low blood levels of protein. The syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The prognosis is highly variable depending on the underlying cause. Preschool predominance Primary nephrotic syndrome occurs predominantly in preschool children; the incidence peaks between ages 2 and 3, and the syn-drome is rare after age 8. It's more common in boys than in girls. Some forms of nephrotic syndrome may eventually progress to end-stage renal disease. What causes it Causes of nephrotic syndrome include: \u0081 lipid \u0081 collagen-vascular disorders such as SLE\u0081 circulatory diseases, such as heart failure, sickle cell anemia, and renal vein thrombosis \u0081 nephrotoxins, such as mercury, gold, and 397 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.398URINARY PROBLEMS How it happens In nephrotic syndrome, the injured glomerular filtration mem- brane allows the loss of plasma proteins, especially albumin and immunoglobulin, resulting in decreased levels of serum albumin (hypoalbuminemia). Hypoalbuminemia results in decreased colloi- dal osmotic pressure and fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces. Edema subsequently results from sodium and water reten-tion. (See What happens in nephrotic syndrome .) What to look for Signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include: \u0081 oliguria with dark, concentrated urine\u0081 edema starting around the eyes (periorbital) and then becoming more generalized \u0081 weight gain\u0081 abdominal distention, which may be so severe that it causes re-spiratory difficulty, abdominal pain, anorexia, and diarrhea \u0081 irritability \u0081 lethargy, easy fatigability, and activity intolerance\u0081 pallor\u0081 hypertension (in later stages).What happens in nephrotic syndrome This flowchart illustrates the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome.

When performed, renal biopsy identifies the type of nephrotic syndrome the child has and can be used to monitor response to medical management. Highs and lows Blood studies show: \u0081 high levels of lipids, especially cholesterol (hypercholes-terolemia) \u0081 low levels of protein, especially albumin \u0081 normal to high hematocrit and hemoglobin level\u0081 high platelet levels. Complications integrity from severe edema\u0081 infection\u0081 loss of proteins required to fight infections, resulting in increased risk of infections \u0081 loss of proteins that prevent blood from clotting, resulting in clot formation within the blood vessels\u0081 adverse effects of steroid therapy. How it's treated Prednisone commonly produces a rapid improvement in symptoms (remission). I.V. administration of albumin may be used, followed by I.V. furosemide (Lasix), to induce diuresis. If marked hypertension exists, antihypertensive medications may be used. Other medications may include:\u0081 pain medication to lessen discomfort\u0081 prophylactic antibiotics to control and prevent infection \u0081 immunosuppressive medications for children who don't respond to steroids. Hold the salt Dietary changes may include some restriction of salt intake. Bed rest may be required during the acute phase, especially when the child is hypertensive.

All Rights Reserved.400URINARY PROBLEMS What to do The child with nephrotic syndrome is likely to require multiple hospitalizations. Because these hospitalizations interrupt the child's normal routine, it's important to provide him with activities that support his continued development, and simply allow him to have fun. A delicate balance Other interventions focus on monitoring and assessment: \u0081 Maintain fluid balance and monitor for signs of fluid volume excess, such as edema, ascites, weight gain, decreased and con- centrated urine, and pulmonary congestion. \u0081 Assess for signs of electrolyte imbalance\u2014cardiovascular, neurologic, GI, and skin changes\u2014and work with the health care providers to correct imbalances that may exist. \u0081 Assess general nutritional status and work to improve it by pro- viding a diet the child will eat (with sufficient protein and other nutrients and without excess sodium). Parents can help with this, too, by bringing in food from home that the child likes, as long as it fits within the child's dietary restrictions.\u0081 Assess for adverse effects of medications, and report them to the health care provider as soon as possible. Protection from infection \u0081 Assess for signs of infection and work to prevent it; if infection occurs, report it as soon as possible.\u0081 Monitor for pain and provide appropriate pain relief measures. \u0081 Provide emotional support and education to the child and parents. Renal failure, acute Renal failure is a general term used to describe what happens when the kidneys aren't functioning at an optimum level. In acute renal failure, the kidneys suddenly stop filtering waste products from the blood. What causes it Most commonly, acute renal failure in children is a temporary condition resulting from dehydration or other condition that causes poor renal perfusion (which can be resolved by increasing the child's fluid volume). The causes of acute renal failure may be classified as prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal. (See Causes of acute renal 400 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 400 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.401URINARY DISORDERS How it happens The pathophysiology of acute renal failure varies depending on whether the cause is prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal. Prerenal failure Prerenal failure ensues when a condition that diminishes blood flow to the kidneys leads to hypoperfusion. It's rude to interrupt When renal blood flow is interrupted, so is oxygen delivery. The ensuing hypoxemia and ischemia can rapidly and irreversibly damage the kidney. The renal tubules are most susceptible to hypoxemia's effects. Azotemia (excess nitrogenous waste products in the blood) develops in 40% to 80% of patients with acute renal failure and is also a consequence of renal hypoperfusion. The impaired blood flow results in a decreased GFR and increased tubular resorp- tion of sodium and water. Usually, restoring renal blood flow and glomerular filtration reverses azotemia. Intrarenal failure Intrarenal failure, also called intrinsic or parenchymal renal failure , results from damage to the filtering structures of the kidneys. Causes of intrarenal failure are classified as nephrotoxic , inflammatory , or ischemic .Causes of acute renal failure The causes of acute renal failure may be classified as prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal. Prerenal Prerenal causes, which are most common in children, may include: \u0081 arrhythmias that cause sickle cell anemia\u0081 SLE.Postrenal Postrenal causes of renal failure are uncommon in children older than age 1 year. They may include: \u0081 bladder obstruction 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.402URINARY PROBLEMS Damage in the basement When the damage is caused by nephrotoxicity or inflammation, the delicate layer under the epithelium (the basement membrane) becomes irreparably damaged, typically leading to chronic renal failure. Severe or prolonged lack of blood flow caused by ischemia may lead to renal damage (ischemic parenchymal injury) and excess nitrogen in the blood (intrinsic renal azotemia). Totally radical Acute tubular necrosis is the precursor of intrarenal failure; it can result from ischemic damage to renal parenchyma during un-recognized or poorly treated prerenal failure. The ischemic tissue generates toxic, oxygen-free radicals, which cause swelling, injury, and necrosis. Postrenal failure Bilateral obstruction of urine outflow leads to postrenal failure. The obstruction may be in the bladder, ureters, or urethra. What to look for Acute renal failure is a critical illness in children. Its early signs are oliguria, azotemia, and, rarely, anuria. System alert Electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis, and other severe effects follow as the patient becomes increasingly uremic and renal dysfunction disrupts other body systems: \u0081 ure- mic frost \u0081 cardiovascular \u2014hypotension (early in the course of the disease), hypertension (later in the course of the disease), arrhythmias, fluid overload, heart failure, systemic edema, anemia, altered clotting mechanisms\u0081 respiratory \u2014pulmonary edema, Kussmaul's respirations. What tests tell you \u0081 Blood studies show elevated BUN, serum creatinine, and potassium levels; decreased sodium, calcium, bicarbonate, and hemoglobin levels; decreased All Rights Reserved.403URINARY DISORDERS Fluid and electrolyte balance is essential for the child with renal failure.\u0081 Urine studies show casts, cellular debris, and decreased spe- cific gravity; in glomerular diseases, proteinuria and increased urine osmolality. \u0081 ECG shows changes associated with electrolyte imbalance and heart failure.\u0081 Ultrasound of the kidney shows the size of the kidneys and may reveal the presence of a tumor, cyst, or urinary tract obstruction. \u0081 Excretory urography demonstrates the appearance of the kid-ney structure and, possibly, the presence of obstruction. Complications Renal failure affects many body processes. Complications may include fluid volume overload, arrhythmias or seizures from electrolyte imbalance, heart failure, hypertension or hypotension, tachypnea, pulmonary edema, infection, skin breakdown, malnu- trition, or development of chronic renal failure. How it's treated The key to managing acute renal failure is prevention. For children with dehydration or any type of fluid loss, fluid volume should be restored as soon as possible to prevent disruption of perfusion to the kidneys. Caution should be exercised whenever nephrotoxic drugs are used in the pediatric population. Treatment of acute renal failure may include: \u0081 diet high in carbohydrates and fats and low in pro- tein, sodium, and potassium to meet metabolic needs\u0081 fluid restriction\u0081 careful monitoring of electrolytes and fluid sta-tus; I.V. therapy to maintain and correct fluid and electrolyte balance\u0081 diuretic therapy Kayexalate or enema to reverse hyperkalemia with mild symp-toms (malaise, loss of appetite, muscle weakness); hypertonic glucose, insulin, and sodium bicarbonate I.V. for more severe hyperkalemic symptoms (numbness and tingling and ECG changes)\u0081 antihypertensives to control elevated blood pressure\u0081 blood products as needed to control anemia or reverse effects of bleeding\u0081 hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (occasionally required).

All Rights Reserved.404URINARY PROBLEMS What to do Care of the child with acute renal failure includes careful moni- toring and dietary education. The child and parents will need emotional support and reassurance, with clear explanations of all procedures. No fluid shall go unmeasured Measure and record intake and output, including body fluids, such as wound drainage, nasogastric output, and diarrhea; weigh the child daily. Monitor vital signs; watch for and report signs of in- adequate renal perfusion (hypotension) and acidosis. Maintain proper electrolyte balance by: \u0081 strictly monitoring potassium levels \u0081 watching for symptoms of hyperkalemia (malaise, anorexia, paresthesia, or muscle weakness) \u0081 monitoring for and immediately reporting ECG changes (tall, peaked T waves; widening QRS segment; and disappearing P waves)\u0081 avoid administering medications containing potassium. Monitor and maintain Other interventions focus on monitoring and maintaining nutri- tional status and preventing infection:\u0081 Maintain nutritional status; provide a high-calorie, low-protein, low-sodium, and low-potassium diet with vitamin supplements. (Give the anorexic child small, frequent meals.)\u0081 Use sterile technique because the child with acute renal failure is highly susceptible to infection; don't allow personnel with upper respiratory tract infections to care for the child and limit visitors who have symptoms of infection.\u0081 Use guaiac tests to monitor stools for blood, a sign of GI bleeding. Renal failure, chronic Chronic renal failure is usually the end result of gradual tissue destruction and loss of renal function. It can also result from a rapidly progressing disease of sudden onset that destroys the nephrons and causes irreversible kidney damage. Few symptoms develop until less than 25% of glomerular filtra- tion remains. The normal parenchyma then deteriorates rapidly and symptoms worsen as renal function decreases. End-stage renal disease is the final stage of chronic renal failure. This disor- der is fatal without treatment, but maintenance on dialysis (either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or kidney transplantation can sustain life.

All Rights Reserved.405URINARY DISORDERS What causes it Chronic renal failure may be caused by: \u0081 chronic glomerular disease (glomerulonephritis)\u0081 chronic infection (such \u0081 nephrotoxic agents (long-term aminoglycoside therapy). How it happens Chronic renal failure commonly progresses through four stages: When renal reserve is reduced, GFR is 35% to 50% of normal function. With renal insufficiency, GFR is 20% to 35% of normal function. In renal failure, GFR is 20% to 25% of normal function. In end-stage renal disease, GFR is less than 20% of normal function. The point of no return Nephron damage is progressive; damaged nephrons can't function and don't recover. The kidneys maintain relatively normal func-tion until about 75% of the nephrons are nonfunctional. Surviving nephrons hypertrophy and increase their rate of filtration, reab- sorption, and secretion. Compensatory excretion continues as GFR diminishes. Toxin takeover Eventually, the healthy nephrons and glomeruli are so overbur- dened that they become sclerotic, stiff, and necrotic. Toxins accumulate and potentially fatal changes ensue in all major organ systems. (See Effects of chronic renal failure , page 406.) What to look for In the early stages, the child may be asymptomatic (until normal kidney function has declined to 20% or less). The first signs are usually lethargy and fatigue. Progressing signs and symptoms may include: \u0081 hypertension\u0081 growth retardation evidenced by the child falling behind on growth charts \u0081 edema Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 405 Meadows-Oliver_Ch10.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.406URINARY PROBLEMS Effects of chronic renal failure In addition to the retention of waste products, chronic renal failure may produce other physiologic changes; the presence and severity of these manifestations depend on the duration of renal failure and its response to treatment. Hyperkalemia and acidosis In early renal insufficiency, acid excretion and phosphate reabsorption increase to maintain normal pH. When the GFR decreases by 30% to 40%, progressive metabolic acidosis ensues (characteristic of chronic renal failure) and tubular secretion of potassium increases. Total-body potassium levels may increase to life-threatening levels, requiring dialysis. Bone demineralization Demineralization of the bone (renal osteodystrophy or renal rickets) manifested by bone pain and pathologic fractures is due to several factors:\u0081 Decreased renal activation of vitamin D decreases absorp-tion of dietary calcium.\u0081 Retention of phosphate increases loss of calcium in urine (which decreases serum calcium levels).\u0081 Decreased urinary excretion causes an increase in parathy-roid hormone circulation. Anemia Anemia and platelet disorders with prolonged bleeding time ensue as diminished erythropoietin secretion leads to reduced RBC production in the bone marrow. Uremic toxins associated with chronic renal failure shorten RBC survival time. The patient may experience lethargy and dizziness. Growth and hormonal alterations Growth retardation induced by renal failure is one of the most profound effects on children. Its cause isn't clearly understood. All hormone levels are impaired in excretion and activation, which may delay sexual maturation or prevent it from occur-ring. This impairment may also cause anovulation or amenor-rhea in females and impaired spermatogenesis in males. Skin changes The skin of a child with chronic renal failure acquires a grayish-yellow tint as urine pigments (urochromes) accumu-late. Inflammatory mediators released by retained toxins in the skin cause pruritus. Uric acid and other substances in the sweat crystallize and accumulate on the skin as uremic frost. High plasma calcium levels are also associated with pruritus. Infection Chronic renal failure increases the risk of death from infec-tion. Children with chronic renal failure are at high risk for infection related to suppression of cell-mediated immunity and a reduction in the number and function of lymphocytes and phagocytes. Decreased sensation in the hands may be a sign of chronic renal failure.\u0081 signs of fluid overload, evidenced by abnormal heart and breath sounds and shortness of breath \u0081 \"uremic\" odor on the breath \u0081 anorexia, nausea, and vomiting\u0081 general malaise\u0081 headache \u0081 generalized pruritus \u0081 increased or decreased urine output, nocturia, enuresis\u0081 easy bruising or bleeding\u0081 decreased level of alertness, poor school performance\u0081 muscle cramps and twitching\u0081 seizures \u0081 decreased sensation, especially in the hands or feet.

What's in urine Urine tests reveal: \u0081 RBCs or casts in the urine\u0081 alterations in urine electrolyte levels and specific gravity. The also-rans Other studies may include:\u0081 ECG, which shows electrolyte im-balances excretory urography, nephrotomography, renal scan, (all of which show reduced kidney size)\u0081 renal biopsy to identify underlying disease\u0081 electroencephalogram (EEG) to identify metabolic encepha- lopathy.

How it's treated Treatment of chronic renal failure involves: \u0081 sodium and potassium limitations\u0081 protein restricted only to the recommended daily allowance for children (because further protein restrictions may impede growth and neurodevelopment)\u0081 fluid restrictions and diuretics to maintain fluid balance\u0081 antihypertensives to control blood pressure 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

A little oatmeal in the bath water keeps skin moist and eases the itch.\u0081 calcium carbonate (Caltrate) or calcium acetate (PhosLo) to treat renal osteodystrophy by binding to phosphate and supple-menting calcium \u0081 antiemetics to relieve nausea and vomiting \u0081 iron and folate supplements and an iron- and folic acid-rich diet for anemia and, possibly, transfusion of RBCs if needed\u0081 synthetic erythropoietin (Epogen) to stimulate the bone marrow to produce RBCs \u0081 antipruritics such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to relieve itching\u0081 supplementary vitamins, particularly B and D, and essential amino acids\u0081 dialysis for hyperkalemia and fluid imbalances\u0081 oral or rectal administration of cation exchange resins, such as Kayexalate, and I.V. administration of calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, 50% dextrose, or regular insulin to reverse hyperkalemia\u0081 peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis to help control end-stage renal disease\u0081 kidney transplantation (usually the treatment of choice if a donor is available). What to do Provide emotional support to the child and family and help them deal with the diagnosis and prognosis. They should be encouraged to express their feelings and to ask questions. Because chronic renal failure has such widespread clinical effects, it requires meticulous and carefully coordinated supportive care. In with the moisture, out with the itch Good skin care is important. Bathe the child daily using superfatted soaps and oatmeal baths, and use skin lotion without alcohol to ease pruritus. Glycerin-containing soaps shouldn't be used be- cause they cause skin drying. Good oral hygiene is also important. Brush the child's teeth often with a soft brush or sponge tip to reduce breath odor. Sugarless hard candy and mouthwash minimize the metallic taste in the mouth and alleviate thirst. The child should be given small, palatable meals that are also nutri-tious; try to provide favorite foods within dietary restrictions.

(Record daily weight, presence or absence of thirst, dryness of tongue, hypertension, and peripheral edema.)\u0081 Monitor for bone or joint complications.\u0081 Maintain strict sterile technique and watch for signs of infection (high fever, leukocytosis).\u0081 Observe for signs of bleeding. Monitor hemoglobin levels and hematocrit and check stools, urine, and vomitus for blood. Wilms' tumor Wilms' tumor, also called nephroblastoma , is the most common form of kidney cancer in children as well as the most common intra-abdominal tumor in children. The average age at diagnosis is 2 to 4 years. The tumor favors the left kidney and is usually unilateral. It can remain encapsulated for a long time, and prognosis is excellent if metastasis hasn't occurred. What causes it Studies have shown an increased risk in children with specific chromosomal abnormalities. Wilms' tumor has also been associ-ated with several congenital anomalies including hypospadias and cryptorchidism. How it happens Wilms' tumor is an embryonal cancer of the kidney originating during fetal life. In the early stages, the tumor is well encapsu-lated, but it may later spread into the lymph nodes, renal vein, or vena cava; metastasis to the lungs or other sites may occur. Life is but a stage The tumor is staged to determine the best treatment: \u0081 Stage I \u2014The tumor is limited to one kidney. \u0081 Stage II \u2014The tumor extends beyond the kidney but can be completely excised. \u0081 Stage III \u2014The tumor has spread but is confined to the abdomen and lymph nodes.

After surgery for bilateral Wilms' tumor, my partner and I were spared!\u0081 Stage IV\u2014 The tumor has metastasized to the lung, liver, bone, and brain. \u0081 Stage V\u2014 The tumor involves both kidneys. What to look for The child usually has a nontender abdominal mass, commonly first identified by the parents during bathing or dressing or by a pediatrician during a routine physical examination. The mass can be palpated in the region of the lower abdomen and is usually confined to one side. Other signs and symptoms may include an enlarged abdomen, hypertension, vomiting, hematuria, anemia, and constipation. What tests tell you \u0081 Ultrasound will determine if the mass originated within the kid- ney and if the mass is a solid tumor.\u0081 CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging will determine the extent of the tumor and whether it has spread to other organs. \u0081 Excretory urography assesses function of the unaffected kidney.\u0081 Chest X-ray and CT scan of the chest will determine if the tumor has metastasized to the lungs. Complications Recurrence of Wilms' tumor may occur in several sites, such as the lungs, liver, and the surgical area. Other complications may include: \u0081 musculoskeletal defects from radiation therapy \u0081 possible development of other (metastatic) cancers in the bones, breast, and thyroid\u0081 decreased fertility, especially after radiation therapy \u0081 renal failure. How it's treated Most commonly, treatment involves surgical removal of the entire affected kidney (radical nephrectomy). Exploratory surgery of the lymph nodes and the liver may be performed at the same time to determine if the tumor has spread outside the kidney. Keep the kidney If the tumor is bilateral, neither kidney is removed during the initial surgery. Rather, a biopsy of the tumor is taken to help determine the tumor type. Chemotherapy will reduce the size of bilateral tumors. Later, with bilateral tumors, the child has further surgery, removing just the tumors and a portion of the kidneys, saving most of both kidneys to maintain kidney function.

Abdominal palpation can rupture the surrounding capsule of Wilms' tumor, causing distant metastasis.Chemotherapy is typically administered after nephrec- tomy. In addition, radiation therapy may be used, as it has been found to improve survival rates. What to do A great deal of emotional support is needed for the child and parents dealing with this diagnosis. The child should be thoroughly prepared for treatments and procedures, including surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation and their adverse effects. The nurse should serve as an advocate for the child and his parents, making certain that questions are answered and concerns are addressed in a timely fashion. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Keep in mind that a Wilms' tumor is very soft, and the capsule can easily rupture before or during surgery; if this happens, there can be rapid metastasis to other organs.\u0081 Make sure that after the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, there's absolutely no further palpation of the abdomen because this can cause rupture of the capsule. \u0081 Tell the parents and the child that he may need frequent imaging of the remaining kidney to detect recurrence of the tumor. Quick quiz 1. The main functioning unit of the kidney is the: A. renal cortex.B. renal medulla. C. nephron. D. ureter. Answer: C. The nephron, located within the renal medulla, is the main functional unit of the kidney; it filters out waste products and excess water, forming urine. 2. An X-ray done with I.V. contrast media to show the structure of the urinary system is called: A. KUB. contrast medium is in- jected, and then X-rays are taken to visualize the structures of the entire urinary elimination system.

Pink-tinged urine, facial edema, and a history of a sore throat are the typical signs and symptoms of acute poststrep-tococcal glomerulonephritis. 4. A child is admitted to the pediatric unit with a new diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Which set of symptoms would the nurse expect to see? A. edema Answer: B. The four classic signs and symptoms of early stages of nephrotic syndrome are hypercholesterolemia, hypoproteinemia, proteinuria, and periorbital edema. 5. A child on the pediatric unit has a Wilms' tumor. One of the most important nursing functions for this child is to: A. prepare the parents for the possible loss of the child. B. maintain the child's fluid volume.C. ensure the child's nutritional status.D. make sure that no abdominal palpation is performed. Answer: D. Remember that a Wilms' tumor is very soft and the capsule surrounding it can rupture easily, causing distant and potentially devastating metastasis to other organs.

(Actually, 206 bones, to be exact.)In this chapter, you'll learn: basic anatomy and physiology of the musculoskeletal system common diagnostic tests for musculoskeletal problems orthopedic treatments and procedures selected musculoskeletal disorders in the pediatric population. Anatomy and physiology The musculoskeletal system is one of the most complex sys- tems within the body. The muscles and bones allow the body to move and function. If a problem occurs in the musculo- skeletal system, mobility and general activities of daily living may be impaired. Bones The body's form and function are supported by the skeletal system. The mature human skeleton is made up of 206 bones that are shaped according to their function. Newborn infants have over 300 bones, a number of which fuse together by the time a child is around 9 years old. The skeletal system:\u0081 enables movement of the body by supporting soft tissues\u0081 provides support and allows a person to stand erect \u0081 protects underlying organs \u0081 serves as a reservoir for storing such minerals as calcium and phosphorus\u0081 serves as a site for red blood cell 413 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.414MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS The long and short of it Long bones are found in the upper and lower extremities. They're responsible for carrying the body's weight and helping make am-bulation possible. Short bones are found in the hands and feet and are shaped to provide strength in a compact area. Some bones, such as the ribs and sternum, are flat and thin; they provide struc-ture. Other bones are large and irregularly shaped (for example, the pelvic bone). Universal coverage The composition of bone differs depending on the type of bone, but all are covered by a double layer of connective tissue, called the periosteum , which helps provide nourishment to the bone. In children, the periosteum is thick and vascular, so a child's bone tends to heal faster than that of an adult with the same injury. Bone growth and formation The epiphysis is the growth end of the long bones. The epiphyseal plate, or growth plate , is located in the epiphysis. A plate of cartilage The epiphyseal plate is composed of cartilage cells that grow and develop, thereby causing the bone to lengthen. The growth plate is gradually replaced by bone until only the epiphyseal line remains. When the plate is completely replaced by bone, the bones can no longer lengthen; they can only increase in breadth. Injury to the growth plate may seriously impede bone growth. Children are particularly susceptible to growth plate injuries. Cartilage serves as a smooth surface for articulating bones. Because young children have a more cartilaginous skeleton, they may be less prone to severe fractures than adults. Salty framework Ossification is the process of developing new bones from tissue. Osteoblasts form bone cells that lay down a framework for the new bone. Calcium and phosphorus combine to form salts, which are then deposited into the framework. The thyroid and para- thyroid glands regulate this deposition. (See Bone growth and remodeling .) Bone bank deposit To maintain equilibrium, bone is deposited where it's needed within the skeletal system. If increased stress is placed on a cer-tain bone, more bone is deposited. If there's no stress on the bone, part of the bone mass is reabsorbed. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 414 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 414 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.415ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Bone growth and remodeling The ossification of cartilage into bone, or osteogenesis , begins at about week 9 of fetal development. The diaphyses (shaft) of long bones are formed by birth, and the epiphyses (growth end) begin to ossify around that time. The stages of growth and remodeling of the epiphyses of a long bone are shown in these illustrations. Creation of an ossification center At about the ninth month of fetal development, an ossification center develops in the epiphysis. Some carti-lage cells enlarge and stimulate ossification of surround-ing cells. The enlarged cells die, leaving small cavities. New cartilage continues to develop.Osteoblasts form bone Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) begin to form bone on the remaining cartilage, creating the scaffolding or trabeculae network of cancellous (spongy) bone. Cartilage continues to form on the outer surfaces of the epiphysis and along the upper surface of the epiphyseal plate. Resorption is the process by which old bone is dissolved. The bone cells known as osteocytes and osteoclasts are responsible for the resorption of bone in this framework. This process can release calcium into the circulation. Muscles Muscles are the major organs that enable movement. They're fibrous bundles covered with thin connective tissue. They also serve as repositories for some metabolites.

Muscles in opposition The movement enabled by muscles occurs through the contract- ing and lengthening of opposing muscle groups. As a muscle shortens on contraction, it pulls the bones to which it's attached, Bone growth and remodeling (continued) Bone growth Cartilage is replaced by compact bone near the outer surfaces of the epiphysis. Only cartilage cells on the upper surface of the diaphyseal plate continue to multiply rap-idly, pushing the epiphysis away from the diaphysis. This new cartilage ossifies, creating trabeculae on the inner or medullary side of the epiphyseal plate.Remodeling Osteoclasts (cells associated with bone resorption) pro-duce enzymes and acids that reduce trabeculae created by the epiphyseal plate, thus enlarging the medullary (bone marrow) cavity. In the epiphysis, osteoclasts reduce bone, making its calcium available for new osteoblasts that give the epiphysis its adult shape and proportion. In young adults, the epiphyseal plate completely ossifies (closes) and becomes the epiphyseal line; longitudinal growth of bone then ceases.

That's the body in motion.One of us is held stable . . .bringing the bones closer together. Most muscles are attached to two bones that articulate (join or work together as a single unit) at an intervening joint. Taking turns For the most part, movement happens when one bone moves while the other is held stable. The body of the muscle that produces move- ment of the extremity usually lies proximal ( closest) to the bone that's moved. Six hundred volunteers There are more than 600 voluntary muscles (muscles we control) in the body. These muscles are called striated or skeletal mus- cles. Other types of muscles include visceral muscles (also called smooth or involuntary muscles ) and the cardiac muscle. Joints Joints are formed when two surfaces of bones come together and articulate. Joints on the move There are three types of joints, classified by the degree of movement:\u0081 Synarthrodial (immovable) joints separate bone by a thin layer of cartilage\u2014for example, the skull and various bones of the cranium. \u0081 Amphidiarthrodial (semimovable) joints separate bone with cartilage or a fibrocartilaginous disk\u2014for example, the joints between the vertebral bodies. \u0081 Diarthrodial (freely movable) joints are commonly called sy- novial joints . Most joints in the body are synovial joints. They're lined with a membrane that secretes and lubricates the joint with synovial fluid\u2014for example, the knees, shoulders, and hips. They're encased by the joint capsule, which is strengthened by ligaments that surround the capsule. Flex or extend Muscles are categorized according to the type of joint movement produced when the muscle is contracted. They're designated as flexor or extensor muscles depending on whether the joint is flexed or extended. Range of motion (ROM) is determined by the degree of movement in a joint. (See Types of joint movement , page 418.) Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 417 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 417 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.418MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS Diagnostic tests Tests used to assess the musculoskeletal system and guide treatment include arthroscopy, bone scans, electromyography (EMG), muscle and bone marrow biopsy, and X-rays. Arthroscopy Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure used to visualize, diagnose, and treat problems inside a joint. It involves placing a fiber-optic instrument into the joint and then visualizing the area. Corrective surgery can be done at the same time, which helps eliminate the need for more extensive surgery. The knee is the most common joint evaluated and treated with arthroscopy. It's most commonly done under a general anesthetic with younger children but can also be performed with a local or spinal anesthetic depending on the joint and the suspected problem. Lean on me There may be some swelling and pain after arthroscopy. With knee arthroscopy, the child may need to use crutches for 2 to 4 weeks after a surgical repair. It's important for the crutches to be the right size for the child and for the child to be instructed in their use. This instruction is best given by someone from the physical therapy (PT) department. The child can usually return to school within a few days. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for the procedure by explaining the general anesthesia or the anesthetic, what the child will experience in the operating room (if he'll be awake), and how he'll feel after the procedure. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Note any allergies because of the anesthesia use.\u0081 Tell the child he may feel a thumping sensation as the can-nula is inserted into the joint capsule (if he'll be awake during the procedure). \u0081 Cover the site with a small dressing after the procedure. Bone scans Bone scans are used to diagnose osteomyelitis and metastatic bone disease. They can also be used to aid diagnosis of joint in-fections and certain fractures. Special radiographic techniques Types of joint movement There are seven types of joint movement:\u0081 Flexion is a bending forward of the joint; this de-creases the angle between the bones that are connected.\u0081 Extension is an increase of the joint angle that occurs with straightening of the limb. \u0081 Abduction is the movement of the limb away from the midline, or central axis, of the body \u0081 Adduction is the movement of the limb toward or beyond the midline, or central axis , of the body.\u0081 Internal rotation is the turning of the body part inward, toward the midline, or central axis , of the body.\u0081 External rotation is the turning of the body part away from the midline, or central axis , of the body.\u0081 Circumduction is the movement of the body part in a circular motion.

These techniques include computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI). Nursing considerations The tubelike structures that house the imaging equipment can be frightening to a child. Whenever possible, show the child a picture of the scanning equipment, or the equipment itself, before the procedure. Reassure the child that the parent will be allowed to remain in the room.\u0081 Explain the procedure to the parents and child. Tell the child that he'll be placed in a tube so that pictures may be taken. \u0081 Instruct the child to remain still during the procedure; sedation may be necessary. Distraction techniques may help calm the child.\u0081 Remove metallic objects. Electromyography EMG measures muscle response to nervous stimulation (the electrical activity within the muscle fibers). Needle electrodes are inserted into the muscle to be tested, and electrical activity is recorded when the muscle is at rest and during contraction. A sign of weakness EMG is used when there are symptoms of muscle weakness and decreased muscle strength. It can differentiate primary muscle conditions from weakness caused by neurologic disorders or a lack of use of the particular muscle. Conditions that may be di- agnosed by EMG include muscular dystrophy, nerve dysfunction, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Nursing considerations EMG can be frightening and uncomfortable for a child. When ex- plaining the procedure to the child and parents, prepare the child for insertion of the needle and the feeling in the muscle when the electrical impulses are sent through (like a hard hit to the \"funny bone\"). Let them know that residual bruising may occur. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Explain that the child may be asked to voluntarily contract the muscle; help him practice the different positions or movements. \u0081 Use deep breathing exercises and play preparation to help lessen the fear and anxiety the child may experience. Involving a child life specialist may be helpful.\u0081 Reassure the child that his parent may stay with him during the procedure.

Feeling safe is the best antidote to emotional trauma.Muscle and bone marrow biopsy Biopsy of the muscles and bones involves the removal of a small specimen of muscle or bone marrow for analysis. It's usually per-formed at the bedside and takes about 20 minutes. Local anes- thetics or systemic analgesics are used to help alleviate the pain. The puncture site may remain tender for a few weeks. For bone marrow biopsy, the proximal tibia is the most commonly used site in young children. In older chil- dren, the vertebral bodies T10 through L4 are preferred. Nursing considerations Biopsy can be an extremely frightening procedure for a child (and his parents). Thoroughly prepare the child and his parents. Allowing the child to \"perform\" the procedure on a doll (using correct positioning, a syringe, and a bandage) will enhance his understanding of the procedure and may help to ease his fears. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Clarify the meaning of biopsy in context; many parents (and older children) automatically think of cancer when they hear the word biopsy . \u0081 Provide analgesics as ordered.\u0081 Assist the child into the desired position depending on the site to be used. If necessary, assist in holding the child still during the procedure. (Allow a parent to be present in a com- forting capacity only, leaving the positioning and restraint of the child to the health care professionals.)\u0081 When the specimen is obtained, apply direct pressure to the site for 5 to 10 minutes.\u0081 Cover the site and make sure the child remains still for approxi-mately 30 minutes after the procedure. X-rays Radiography is the most widely used diagnostic test in the as- sessment of children with bone abnormalities or other conditions affecting the bones. X-rays can show pathology, such as a fracture, and can show bone density and irregularities. X-rays are used not only for initial evaluation but also for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. Invisible bone Normally, the calcium deposits in bones will make skeletal struc- tures appear radiopaque, or white, on X-rays. However, in Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 420 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 420 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.421TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES Where did they go? The skeletal structures of an infant or young child are radiolucent, meaning they may not be visible on X-ray.infant and young child (whose skeleton is composed mostly of growth cartilage), structures are radiolucent and may not appear on X-ray. Thus, X-rays are less reliable in this population. High-resolution ultrasound may provide a more accurate picture. Nursing considerations Always explain to the child the reason for obtaining an X-ray. Explain that an X-ray simply takes pictures (of what-ever part of the body is being X-rayed). Reassure the child that the X-ray itself doesn't hurt, but keep in mind that a child with an injury may experience discomfort during positioning for the X-ray. It's common to allow the parents to remain with the child during the procedure as long as appropriate precau-tions are taken. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Tell the child that it's his job to remain still during the procedure.\u0081 Obtain previous X-rays if possible, which may be use-ful for comparison.\u0081 If an adolescent female is sexually active, assess for possible pregnancy, a contraindication for radiography. \u0081 Remove metallic objects, such as jewelry or snaps on gowns, before the X-ray because metallic objects may be mistaken for pathology. Treatments and procedures Children may experience dysfunction in any part of the muscu- loskeletal system. Treatment depends on a thorough assessment and appropriate interventions based on findings. These interven- tions are typically designed to promote healing and lessen the impact of the condition on mobility. Principles of body mechanics are used to maintain the integrity of the musculoskeletal system. Prevent and restore Nursing care of orthopedic conditions involves the correction of alterations in the musculoskeletal system. These preventive and restorative measures include: \u0081 casting or splinting and traction, which are used to help correct, maintain, and support the body part in a functional position\u0081 surgical repairs such as tendon release\u0081 limb amputations, which may be Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.422MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS Casting or Splints Casts or splints may be required when a child has a fractured bone, weakness, paralysis, or spasticity. They're also used follow-ing corrective orthopedic surgery. The cast may be made of plaster or, more commonly, of syn- thetic material such as fiberglass or plastic. Polyester and cotton impregnated with water-activated polyurethane resin may also be used. (See Types of casts for children .) Depending on the type of material that's used, drying time for the cast may be as little as 7 minutes or as much as 48 hours. Weight bearing on the affected part of the body is typically avoided until the cast has dried. Types of casts for children These illustrations show the types of casts commonly used for children.

It's a great itch reliever!Splints Splints are \"half-casts\" and offer a bit more flexibility than a stan- dard cast. They also do not offer quite as much support as a cast. Splints may be custom-formed to the child or may be ready-to- wear. Most splints have Velcro straps to adjust to the child's body. Instruct the parent and the child to keep the splint on as much as possible and to avoid excess activities that would further compro-mise the injury. A wash and a blow-dry Some synthetic casts may be waterproof. Double check that the inner lining of the cast is waterproof as well before allowing the child to get the cast wet. If appropriate, instruct the patient and family to dry the cast after bathing or immersion by using a blow- dryer on a cool setting. Nursing considerations Explain each step of the procedure to the child before the proce- dure and again as the cast is being applied. If plaster will be used, explain that the child will experience a sensation of warmth when it's first applied. As it dries, the cast\u2014and the child\u2014will feel cold. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 If a closed reduction is necessary, explain to the child that there will be some pain. Allow the parents to remain close to the child and hold his hand to help lessen anxiety. \u0081 Assess the casted area every 30 minutes for the first few hours, then every hour for 24 hours, then every 4 hours for an additional 48 hours. Drainage from a wound under the cast should be noted.\u0081 If there are signs and symptoms of compromise in the affected area, notify the doctor immediately. Also notify the doctor if cracks are noted in the cast. \u0081 Assess for signs of skin breakdown, a common oc-currence. The area around the cast edges will typically become pink and warm and swelling may also occur. (Provide skin care to prevent further breakdown.) Cast scratch fever \u0081 Because cool air can relieve the itchiness that accompanies casting, instruct the parents to blow cool air down into the cast using a blow-dryer on a cool setting. Also advise against putting an object down the cast in an attempt to scratch. May I have your autograph? \u0081 Ask the child if he would like his nurses and doctors to sign his cast to help him cheer up, feel important to the medi-cal staff, and view the staff as friends.Memory jogger Remem- ber the five \"Ps\" when checking for signs of compromised blood supply in a child with a cast.

All Rights Reserved.424MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS \u0081 Explain to the child and parents that the cast must be worn as recommended. It shouldn't be removed and overly rigorous activities should be discouraged (to prevent dislodgment or malalignment of a fracture). The cut stops here\u2014promise! \u0081 When the fracture is healed, prepare the child for cast removal with the cast cutter. Let him hear the noise and feel the vibra-tions, and show him (on your body) how the cutter stops when it touches skin and won't, therefore, cut anything except the cast. \u0081 Inform the child that his skin will look different after cast removal, especially if it has been in the cast for weeks. Reas-sure him that this is temporary, and apply baby oil, then gently wash the area to remove the dead skin. (See Cast care .) \u0081 Instruct the child and parents in an exercise regimen to help regain muscle strength and function following the injury. Traction Although it is not as widely used now, traction is still used in some circumstances. Traction can be continuous or intermit-tent. It's used to: \u0081 stabilize or immobilize a certain body part \u0081 reduce muscle spasms\u0081 relieve pressure on spinal nerves\u0081 realign fractures or joint dislocations. Just hanging out Traction uses weights and pulleys to exert a pulling force and maintain the body part in correct alignment. Weights must hang freely and the ropes shouldn't have knots that could interfere with free movement. Serial X-rays are taken while the child is in traction in order to monitor progress and determine the need for changes in the direction and amount of traction pull. Central location The child should be kept in the center of the bed to maintain countertraction and prevent complications. Traction can cause muscle spasms that may require analgesics or muscle relaxants. The child is in bed for extended periods; therefore, circulatory and skin assessment is vital. Traction in twos There are two basic types of traction: skin skeletal. It's all relative Cast care Be sure to include these points in your teaching plan for the child with a cast and his parents:\u0081 mechanism of bone healing and necessity for casting\u0081 cast care, includ-ing air exposure, elevation, and movement \u0081 measures to protect the cast\u0081 measures for skin care\u0081 methods to re-lieve itching\u0081 measures to keep the cast dry\u0081 ways to test for sensation, movement, and circulation\u0081 measures for coping with swelling\u0081 ways to relieve skin irritation\u0081 monitoring for wound drainage\u0081 exercises for the Rights Reserved.425TREATMENTS PROCEDURES Skin traction Skin traction is a noninvasive traction that's especially useful for a child who may not require continuous traction. It's applied by placing foam rubber straps against the affected part and then securing the straps with elastic bandages. Sometimes, the straps have an adhesive backing. If this type of strap is used, the nurse should protect the skin by first apply- ing compound benzoin tincture or other skin protectant. Traction should be removed by two people. (See Types of skin traction .) Skeletal traction Skeletal traction exerts a greater force than skin traction by using wires or pins inserted into the bone. They're usually placed under anesthesia. Skeletal traction is continuous. (See Types of skeletal traction , page 426.) Nursing considerations The sight and idea of a body part in skeletal traction can be fright-ening to a child (and his parents). Explain what the child will see and feel before the traction is applied. Use dolls and toy traction Types of skin traction This chart describes the various types of skin traction. Traction Purpose Patient positioning Buck's extension Used for a fractured hip to prevent muscle spasms and dislocation\u0081 Child lies flat in bed. \u0081 Head of the bed is elevated only for activities of daily living.

In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Involve the family as much as possible to reduce anxiety, alle- viate boredom, encourage cooperation with the recommended treatment, and minimize disruption of the family structure.\u0081 Maintain the traction system and frequently check the ropes, pulleys, and weights for proper function. \u0081 Maintain correct alignment of the affected body part. Don't fall behind \u0081 Provide age-appropriate activities to help maintain the child's developmental level, prevent developmental delay, and alleviate boredom. \u0081 Frequently assess for signs of skin breakdown. Place sheepskin under the affected extremity to help alleviate pressure.\u0081 Provide footplates for the affected side to prevent footdrop. Pin and skin \u0081 For the child in skeletal traction, assess the pin insertion sites for signs of infection or tenting (new skin that has attached to the insertion site, creating a tentlike configuration); tenting may cause the skin to tear, which can promote infection.Types of skeletal traction This chart describes the different types of skeletal traction.

All Rights Reserved.427TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \u0081 Clean the area around the pin insertion sites frequently, and cover the tips of the pins to prevent injury to the skin or other parts of the child's body. Notify the doctor immediately if the pins become loose, and keep the child immobilized until skeletal trac- tion is assessed. Surgical repairs At times, surgical repairs may be necessary to promote normal growth and development. Examples of these types of repairs include tendon release and leg-length corrections. Surgery to release a tendon involves cutting a part of the tendon in order to decrease the tension in the muscle that the tendon controls. Ten-don release surgery is often used in correcting severe congenital clubfoot in young children. It can also be used on shoulder, hips, knees, or even thumbs. Leg lengthening or shortening is often used to treat children who have an abnormally short or long leg causing a discrepancy between the two legs. Lengthening requires several surgeries over an extended length of time and is used if there is a significant dif-ference ( /H110225 cm or 2 /H11033 ) between the leg lengths. Plates and screws (some may be external) are used to hold the cut bone in place and slowly pull apart the bone, allowing new bone to fill in the gap, thereby lengthening the bone. Bone growth restriction or short-ening is used if there is less than a 5 cm (2 /H11033 ) difference. Surgery is done to stop the epiphysis (growth plate) from promoting further growth. The metal plates and screws used may be removed after several months once complete healing has occurred. Nursing considerations As with any surgery, the child and family need to be prepared. Allow the child and the parents to express their fears and answer any questions they may have about the procedure itself. In addi- tion, follow these steps: \u0081 Following surgery, check the site for circulation, signs of infection, or complications.\u0081 Notify the health care provider if there are any abnormal signs. \u0081 Teach the parents how to care for the pin insertion site and signs and symptoms of any complications. Amputation Unfortunately, amputations occur in children as well as adults. An amputation may be needed because of a trauma; a disease process, such as osteosarcoma; or it may have occurred prena- tally due to teratogens, metabolic diseases in the mother, or small Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 427 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 427 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.428MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS The best prescription for feelings of fear, loss, and grief is a nurse who simply listens and validates those feelings.pieces of the amnion that cut off circulation to a certain body part (known as an amniotic band ). Only rarely is a congenital amputa- tion genetically determined. Occasionally, a hair or a loose piece of thread can cause a tourniquet on an infant's toes and feet or fingers and hands. This strand of hair or thread can wrap itself so tightly around a wiggling infant that it can cause significant damage to the extremity and may even lead to amputation if not caught in enough time (known as a hair tourniquet ). In rare cir- cumstances, it may be caused by child abuse. Teach the parents to daily take off mittens or booties and inspect for any loose threads or hair. A loss that lasts Limb amputation that isn't congenital can be traumatic to a child or adolescent and his family. It may be particularly damaging to the child's self-image. Everyone deals with feelings of loss in his own way and in his own time; there's no right or wrong way to grieve. Families need extra time and support to deal with the grief and loss they feel when they're given the news that amputation is required. Something in common It may be helpful to introduce the child and family to another family who has gone through an amputation and has learned to cope successfully with day-to-day activities and enjoy life. Support groups such as the Amputee Coalition have pediatric support groups in many areas around the country. Many amputations are treated with a prosthesis. Sometimes, stump shrink bandages are used to apply pressure, reduce swell-ing, and help mold the stump for fitting a prosthesis, which usually can be done within 4 to 6 weeks after the amputation. Quick studies Children quickly learn how to function with a prosthesis and can lead very active, normal lives. They should be reassured that amputation doesn't have to mean permanent disability. Many children participate in sports and other strenuous activi-ties while using a prosthesis. The nurse can play an essential role in helping the child and his family cope with this traumatic situation. Nursing considerations After the surgery, the nurse should provide basic postoperative care while keeping in mind some special considerations:\u0081 Provide care to prevent contractures and perform ROM exer- cises to keep the stump from becoming permanently flexed Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 428 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 428 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.429MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS abducted. (These exercises also increase muscle strength and improve mobility of the stump.) Let's get physical \u0081 Depending on the site and extent of the amputation, the child should begin to move and start PT as quickly as possible.\u0081 Teach the child and parents about proper care of the stump and application and maintenance of the prosthesis. \u0081 If the amputation is on a lower extremity, teach the child how to walk with crutches, then how to ambulate using a pros-thetic device. Refer the child for PT as he may need extensive training. \u0081 Assess for phantom limb pain, which is real pain and should be treated with analgesics as appropriate. (Tell the child and parents that this pain should gradually fade.) Musculoskeletal disorders Musculoskeletal disorders that may occur in children include congenital clubfoot, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), Ewing's sarcoma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (formerly Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease, utero in approxi- mately 1 of every 1,000 births. Boys are twice as likely to be affected as girls. If a family has one child with a clubfoot, the chances of having another affected child increase markedly. Although talipes equinovarus is the most commonly occurring type of clubfoot, other variations may be present and are identified according to the orientation of the deformity. (See Recognizing clubfoot , page 430.) What causes it Clubfoot may be caused by a mechanical force (the position in utero), through prenatal exposure to drugs or infections, or by an inherited factor. It can be a singular birth defect or associated with certain syndromes. An infant with a clubfoot should be care- fully examined for additional anomalies. How it happens Regardless of the cause of the clubfoot, the result is a nonfunc- tional position of the foot and ankle due to abnormal muscles Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 429 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 429 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.430MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS and joints and contracture of soft tissue. The position of the foot determines the classification of the clubfoot. The classic definition of talipes equinovarus requires these three components: plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle joint inversion deformity of the heel turning in of the forefoot. What to look for The deformity is usually obvious at birth. The foot is usually inverted (turned in), also known as a varus position . An everted (turned outward) foot is known as a valgus position . A single foot or both feet may be affected. The deformity may be mild with some flexibility noted, or severe with the foot completely rigid. In the most severe form, the foot has a clublike appearance. What tests tell you Early diagnosis of clubfoot is usually relatively simple because the deformity is obvious. However, X-rays may show superimposition of the talus and calcaneus bones and a ladderlike appearance of the metatarsals.Recognizing clubfoot Clubfoot (talipes) may have various names, depending on the orien-tation of the deformity, as shown 2015 Rights Reserved.431MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS Successful surgery for congenital clubfoot is usually followed by successful shoe shopping!Complications If identification and treatment of clubfoot isn't instituted early on, chronic impairment may result. The prognosis is good, however, for infants who receive treatment. How it's treated Treatment of clubfoot consists of manipulation of the foot to stretch the contracted tissues. Splinting is then applied to main-tain that correction. If treatment is begun shortly after birth, the correction is fairly rapid. If treatment is delayed for any reason, the foot quickly becomes more rigid, which can occur in a matter of days. Treatment is typically begun in the neonatal nursery. Straps and splints are applied and are quite effective until formal casting can be done. Casting call Casts are applied sequentially by first correcting the forefoot ad- duction, then the heel inversion, and then the flexion of the ankle. Casts are usually changed at 1- to 2-week intervals to allow the infant's foot to grow and to manipulate the foot gradually. Treat- ment lasts for several months depending on the severity of the deformation. To maintain the long-term correction, exercises and a night brace are commonly prescribed. Please release me In approximately one-half of patients with clubfoot, correc- tive surgery is required to release the tightened structures around the foot. The outcome of this surgery is usually good; the foot appears normal and is adequate for normal footwear and sports. For infants, surgery is usually limited to soft tissue to prevent interference with bone growth. From designer wedges . . . For the older child or the child with severe clubfoot, the bones of the foot may need to be realigned by using bone wedges. Casts are worn for months following surgery. A specialized splint called the Denis Browne boots or splint may sometimes be used. . . . to designer shoes This splint consists of specially made shoes attached to an adjustable bar that provides the eversion, rotation, and dorsiflexion needed to achieve a slight overcorrection. It's worn for several weeks and then worn only at night to help maintain this position. Compliance in using this orthosis can be an issue. Make sure you teach the parents on the importance of using it regularly. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 431 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd Kluwer.

Look for exaggerated appearances in the infant's feet. Apparent clubfoot (resulting from positioning in utero) can be differentiated from true clubfoot because an apparent clubfoot will easily move back to normal position. When caring for a child with clubfoot, follow these steps:\u0081 Don't use excessive force when assessing a clubfoot.\u0081 Stress to the parents the importance of prompt treatment; clubfoot demands imme-diate therapy and orthopedic supervision until growth is completed. Put up your feet and relax \u0081 After casting, elevate the child's feet with pillows; check the toes every 1 to 2 hours for temperature, color, sensation, motion, and capillary refill time and watch for edema. \u0081 Before discharge, teach parents to recognize signs of circulatory impairment, such as numbness or tingling of the toes, coldness in the toes, or lack of capillary refill.\u0081 Emphasize the need for long-term orthopedic care to maintain the correction. The agony of de feet \u0081 Help the parents (and child) deal with grief or other emotional issues that arise from this problem.\u0081 Teach parents the prescribed exercises that the child should do at home. \u0081 Urge parents to make sure the child wears his corrective shoes and splints during naps and at night. Make sure they understand that treatment for clubfoot continues throughout the entire growth period. Developmental dysplasia of the hip The hip joint develops early in utero. By the end of the first trimester, the shape of the joint is recognizable and the cartilage, ligaments, capsule, and vascular pattern are formed. Relationship problems DDH is a spectrum of conditions in which there's an abnormal relationship between the proximal femur and the acetabulum. It occurs in approximately 3 to 5 of every 1,000 live births. Females are six times more likely to be affected as males. A positive family history of DDH increases the risk fivefold.

All Rights Reserved.433MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS Frankly breech Another important risk factor for DDH is a breech presentation at birth. Children who present in a frank breech position have a risk of DDH almost 20 times higher than children who have a cephalic presentation. The way infants are carried in some cultures may also contribute to the development of DDH. (See Carried away with DDH .) Other associated abnormalities include oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid utero), torticollis, and metatarsus adductus (a form of clubfoot). What causes it Dislocation of the hip is usually a developmental problem in an otherwise normal child. It isn't always clear when it occurs. A child who develops a deformity in utero is usually more severely affected than the child who has a hip that dislocates after birth. What's in a name? Although congenital dislocation of the hip is a common term for DDH, it implies that the dislocation occurs at birth. However, the problem may occur over several months after birth. Therefore, developmental dysplasia of the hip is a more accurate description of the hip pathology that exists in this disorder. How it happens There are three typical forms of DDH: \u0081 Dysplasia is a result of the femoral head failing to exert appropriate pressure against the acetabulum. As a result, the femoral head becomes small and flattened and the acetabu- lum becomes shallow and eventually flat. A dysplastic hip may progress to a subluxated or dislocated hip. The abductor muscles of the hip will also shorten and contract. \u0081 The hip is considered subluxated when the femoral head (the ball) is in contact with the acetabulum (the socket) but not deeply centered within it.\u0081 Dislocation occurs when the femoral head (the ball) is no longer in contact with the acetabulum (the socket). (See Forms of DDH , page 434 .) What to look for A dislocation diagnosed in the first few weeks of life can be treated conservatively. If the diagnosis is delayed until walking age, reconstructive surgery is usually required for correction, which greatly increases the likelihood of complications.Cultured pearls Carried away with DDH Some experts sug- gest that the infant carrying practices of certain cultures may influence the development of DDH. For instance, the rate of DDH increases by 25 to 50 times among Native Americans, who traditionally carry their infants tightly swaddled, sometimes strapped to a cradleboard, which keeps the legs in an extended position. On the other hand, DDH is rarely seen in certain African populations in which the infant is carried with his front side bound to his mother's back. This position keeps the infant's legs flexed and abducted, which may prevent the development of DDH. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 433 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 433 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.434MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS It's important for the nurse to be aware of risk factors for DDH and to assess the infant and child carefully for signs of a hip problem. Physical signs of DDH include asymmetrical skin folds, Galeazzi sign, limited hip abduction, and hip instability. Asymmetrical skin folds When the infant is lying on his back with his hips and knees flexed at a 90-degree angle, the same number of skin folds should appear in the medial (inner) aspect of both thighs. If a hip is dislocated, the soft tissues of the thigh may fold down on each other like an accor- dion, producing a larger number of skin folds on the affected side. Galeazzi sign If there's a dislocation, the femoral head may be placed supe- rior to the acetabulum when the hips and knees are flexed at 90 degrees. This malpositioning will cause the knee on the af- fected side to be significantly lower than the other knee, a sign known as Galeazzi sign . Limited hip abduction The normal range of hip abduction in an infant is from 0 degrees (with thighs perpendicular to the table) to almost 90 degrees (with thighs resting on the table). In DDH, a shortening of the adductor muscle on the medial aspect of the thigh while the femoral head Forms of DDH These illustrations show a normal hip and the three presentations of DDH. Normal hip Dysplasia The acetabulum is more flattened than cup-shaped.SubluxationThe femoral head is in con- tact with the acetabulum but isn't deeply centered within it.Dislocation The femoral head is no longer in contact with the acetabulum. Memory jogger Here's an easy way to keep adduction and abduction straight. Adduction is moving a limb toward the body's midline; think of it as add- ing two things together. Abduction is moving a limb away from the body's midline; think of it as taking some-thing away like abducting , or kidnapping. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 434 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd Reserved.435MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS In neonates, a \"clunk\" during thigh adduction and abduction may be diagnostic of DDH.is displaced superiorly causes the thigh to be limited in its range. This sign may not be apparent in the neonate because, at this age, there hasn't been enough time for muscle spasms and contractures to develop. Hip instability Testing hip stability is important in the diagnosis of DDH. In neonates, this test is usually the only clue to a problem. A clunky diagnosis Barlow test and Ortolani's test are used to evaluate hip stability.\u0081 A positive Barlow test is noted when a clunk is heard as the examiner adducts the thigh toward the midline while trying to displace or dislocate the femoral head posteriorly.\u0081 A positive Ortolani's test occurs when a clunk is felt as the examiner abducts the thigh to the table from the midline while lifting up the greater trochanter with the finger. What tests tell you A Trendelenburg test can be used to assess for hip dislocation in children who are old enough to stand and bear weight. When the child stands on the affected leg, the opposite hip slants downward instead of remaining level. A limp or a waddle As the child walks, there's a characteristic limp known as the Trendelenburg gait . This limp is due to a weakness of the hip abductor muscles. If both hips are dislocated, the child will have lordosis and a waddling gait. X-rays will show the location of the femoral head and a shal- low acetabulum. X-rays are also used to monitor treatment or deterioration. Complications For children who don't receive treatment before age 7, treat- ment is very unsatisfactory. Delayed treatment may have lifelong implications for walking, development of back problems, and self- esteem. DDH may spine) \u0081 joint malformation\u0081 sciatic nerve \u0081 avascular necrosis of the femoral head \u0081 soft tissue damage\u0081 permanent disability. How it's treated Treatment of DDH depends on the severity of the dysplasia, how quickly the diagnosis is made, and the child's age and includes a Pavlik harness, spica cast, and surgical correction. Pavlik harness If treatment is instituted early, the success of treatment with a Pavlik harness is greater than 90%. As the child ages and treatment is delayed, the prognosis worsens. (See Two views of the Pavlik harness .) In some cases, a Pavlik harness cannot be used. If the family cannot consistently and correctly use the harness, another form of treatment should be used. Whoa, Nellie! In the child younger than age 6 months, careful positioning to maintain the hip in abduction with the head of the femur in the acetabulum is achieved with a Pavlik harness. This harness is worn at all times except for bathing until the hips are stable on examination. When the hips are stable, usually in 1 to 3 weeks, the harness is then used during sleep for 6 additional weeks. Harness hip hooray! If DDH is diagnosed during the neonatal period, the harness may be needed for only 2 to 3 months. The older infant may need to wear it for 4 or 5 months. Don't double up Parents should be taught how to apply the harness correctly and to avoid double and triple diapering (which can cause extreme abduction, leading to avascular necrosis). The harness doesn't interfere with the child's ability to receive immuniza- tions as the thighs remain exposed. Spica cast For the child older than age 6 months, a Pavlik harness can't reliably treat the dysplasia. These children require a spica cast to hold the hips in a flexed and abducted position. Traction is commonly used before the application of the cast to gently stretch out the soft tissues around the hip that have contracted. Traction is usually used for 2 to 3 weeks before placement of the cast. Sometimes the traction can be done at home.Two views of the Pavlik harness These illustra- tions show an infant in a Pavlik harness.

All Rights Reserved.437MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS A temporary setback When the cast has been applied, it usually remains on for several months and is removed and reapplied to accommodate growth. It may delay walking for a few months, but the child usually learns quickly how to walk when the cast is removed. Hold and turn Care for a child in a spica cast is essentially the same as that for a child in a Pavlik harness. Parents should be encouraged to hold the child as much as possible. The infant should be turned frequently to prevent skin breakdown. Surgical correction For the child older than age 18 months, surgical correction is usu- ally required. Surgery enables the removal of tissues that block re-duction and positioning of the femoral head into the acetabulum under direct visualization. Occasionally, a bone graft is required. What to do Listen sympathetically to the parents' expressions of anxiety and fear. Explain possible causes of DDH, and reassure them that early, prompt treatment will probably result in complete correction. You'd be cranky too During the child's first few days in a cast or harness, she may be prone to irritability due to the unaccustomed restriction of move-ment. Encourage her parents to stay with her as much as possible and to calm and reassure her. Assure parents that the child will adjust to this restriction and return to normal sleeping, eating, and playing behavior in a few days. If treatment requires a spica cast, follow these steps: \u0081 Position the child on a Bradford frame (a rectangular frame of pipe with attached sheeting used for immobile patients) elevated on blocks with a bedpan under the frame or on pillows to support the child's legs. Be sure to keep the cast dry and change the child's diapers often.\u0081 Turn the child every 2 hours during the day and every 4 hours at night. Check color, sensation, and motion of the infant's legs and feet. (Be sure to examine her toes, and notify the doctor of dusky, cool, or numb toes.) Investigate the itch \u0081 If the child complains of itching, she may benefit from diphen- hydramine (Benadryl) or another over-the-counter antihistamine, or you may aim a blow-dryer set on cool at the cast edges to Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 437 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 437 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

(Don't scratch or probe under the cast; investigate persistent itching.)\u0081 Provide adequate stimuli to promote growth and development. If the child's hips are abducted in a frog- like position, tell parents that she may be able to fit on a tricycle that the parent can push (if the child can't pedal) or an electric child's car. A change of scenery \u0081 Encourage parents to let the child sit at a table (by sitting her on pillows on a chair), sit on the floor for short periods of play, and play with other children her age. \u0081 Tell parents to watch for signs that the child is needing an adjustment of the cast and to notify the provider if any of the following are seen: skin breakdown, cyanosis, cool extremities, pain, or an ill-fitting or broken cast. Ewing's sarcoma Ewing's sarcoma is the second most common bone tumor in children and adolescents. It's fairly rare, with only approximately 150 new cases reported in the United States each year. It affects primarily young, white males younger than age 20. The tumor usually develops in the midshaft of the long bones of the arms and legs, although it's occasionally found in the pelvis, ribs, spine and, rarely, in the soft tissues or other bones. What causes it A consistent, chromosomal abnormality has been identified in the cells responsible for Ewing's sarcoma. The cause of this chromo-somal problem hasn't yet been identified. It doesn't appear to be inherited, and it isn't thought to be due to exposure to chemicals or radiation or to an environmental factor. How it happens Although Ewing's sarcoma is considered a form of bone cancer, it arises from a type of primitive nerve cell, which explains why the tumor can be found in the soft tissues. Off to a bad start Ewing's sarcoma is a cancer that spreads quickly. The tumor is ag-gressively malignant and approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with the disease have experienced metastasis, with some experts feeling that the majority of those affected will have a subclinical form of metastatic disease. The most common sites of metastasis include the lungs, other bones, and the bone marrow. itting her s of play, ng an of Kids with DDH stil l need to be ki ds\u2014 and a tric ycle is th e perfect fit for hi ps that are abducted i n a froglike positio n.

All Rights Reserved.439MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS In athletes like me, the signs and symptoms of Ewing's sarcoma might initially be diagnosed as a sports injury.What to look for Signs and symptoms of Ewing's sarcoma include pain and swelling over the affected site (even causing awakening at night), possible tenderness over the affected area, and weight loss. Occasionally a soft, tissue mass may be felt. Fever occurs in 25% of patients. If the tumor is over the leg bone, a limp may be present. If it's on one of the ribs, shortness of breath may be evident. In physically active chil- dren, the disease may be initially diagnosed as a sports injury. In some cases, a fracture may occur with only a seemingly minor injury. This is known as a pathologic fracture. P elvic prognosis The outcome for a child with Ewing's sarcoma is largely depen- dent on whether or not there has been metastasis. Prog-nosis is good in patients with a small, localized primary tumor. For patients with significant pelvic involvement or metastatic disease, survival rates are poor. New treatment options for these high-risk patients include autologous bone marrow transplants. What tests tell you \u0081 Serology reveals the cells of Ewing's sarcoma (the cells stain a characteristic blue color), which are described as small and round; they're tightly packed and arranged into compartments by bands of fibrous tissue. \u0081 Blood tests include a complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistries, and a test for lactase dehydrogenase (LDH). levels of LDH are associated with poorer prognoses. \u0081 X-rays reveal the tumor and, commonly, an area of bone de- struction around the tumor.\u0081 CT scanning and MRI should be performed to determine as precisely as possible the extent of local disease.\u0081 A chest X-ray, bone scan, and bone marrow biopsy may be per-formed to determine the extent of metastasis, if any. Complications As with any cancer, some complications arise due to treatment. Metastasis may result from the cancer itself. Children receiving prolonged, intensive treatments are forced to endure frequent venipuncture. Access devices are helpful to lessen the need for repeated needle sticks. When chemo gets complicated Complications of chemotherapy include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, and bone marrow suppression.

The child and family should be reassured that the hair will grow back after therapy, although the texture and color may be different. With prompt treatment, the prognosis is generally good. How it's treated Treatment includes chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Chemo- therapy is given in cycles over the course of 1 year. When surgery is performed, the tumor is usually removed without needing to amputate the limb. The site of tumor excision is then filled in with a graft or prosthesis to allow for normal limb function. For all children with cancer, pain control is a must. What to do Caring for a child with cancer can be a difficult, yet rewarding part of nursing. By offering support, assisting with necessary treat-ments, and helping the family adjust to the diagnosis, the nurse can have a significant impact on the lives of a child and his family during this time.\u0081 Because of the severity of the disease, be available to help the family and child cope with the diagnosis. Nurse in shining armor \u0081 Assure the child and parents that you're there to be their advocate; make sure their questions are answered promptly and facilitate communication between the family members and the health care team. \u0081 Prepare the child and parents for treatments and procedures.\u0081 Allow the child to make as many choices as possible during his day-to-day care; this helps give him a sense of control in a situa- tion that's likely to make him feel helpless. \u0081 Clarify the prognosis and help the child and family deal with their fears; to many people, a diagnosis of cancer is viewed as a death sentence. Growing up too fast \u0081 Help the child be a child while dealing with a very \"adult\" diagnosis; provide play activities and encourage interaction with peers. \u0081 Refer the child and family (including siblings) to support groups and other professionals with expertise in helping families cope with a cancer diagnosis. Cultured pearls Different cultures and religions have very different practices when it comes to dealing with children with severe illness or are facing death. The child and family should determine the best care path for them. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 440 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 440 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Fractures can occur in almost any bone, but the long bones are the most commonly fractured. Other common sites of fracture include the wrists, fingers, toes, and skull. What causes it Fractures commonly occur during athletic activities and accidents. They may also result from child abuse (suspected in the case of in-fants without a known cause for a weakened bone, multiple or re- peated episodes of fractures), bone tumors, or metabolic disease. How it happens Fractures occur when traumatic forces are exerted on the bone. Because children are more flexible than adults, they may not be as prone to fractures. Sticks and stones may bend my bones Rather than fracturing completely, children's bones tend to simply bend, buckle, or sustain an incomplete fracture. A stressful situation Stress fractures are associated with unusually strong physical stress and are commonly seen in children who suddenly begin a vigorous training program. (See Common fractures in children , page 442.) The remodeling team After a fracture occurs, the body quickly begins a repairing pro-cess. A blood clot is formed at the site of the fracture. Osteoblasts and fibroblasts then converge on the site and begin to lay down an organic matrix. This forms a callus into which calcium salts are deposited, evolving into bone tissue that connects the pieces of the original bone. After that happens, the callus is remodeled into a strong, permanent bone. What to look for Bone fractures are classified according to: \u0081 type of injury to the bone or surrounding tissue\u0081 whether they're open (in which the skin has been broken due to penetration of bone fragment or external trauma) or closed (in which the fracture is contained under the skin's surface) \u0081 whether there's involvement of the epiphyseal (growth) plate. Sudden and sharp Fractures usually cause sudden, sharp pain at the fracture site. Pain increases with movement and limits motion in the affected Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 441 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 441 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.442MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS part. Swelling, bruising, or discoloration around the site may occur. There may be obvious deformity or abnormal positioning of the affected part. What tests tell you X-rays provide the definitive diagnosis for a fracture. Occasionally, an incomplete fracture isn't seen initially on the X-ray and appears only after the film has dried after several hours. Serial X-rays are taken to monitor healing and check the alignment of the bone. Complications Complications of fractures include infection, particularly in open fracture. A fracture that affects the growth plate can interrupt and alter growth. The impact of this alteration depends on the area of the epiphyseal plate that's affected. The Salter-Harris classification system is used to determine the severity of the injury on the epiphyseal plate. Type I injuries typically Common fractures in children Bends, buckle fractures, greenstick fractures, and complete fractures commonly occur during childhood. Each of these fractures is described and illustrated below. Bends Bends are common in childhood because of the flexibility of children's bones. Children's bones can be bent up to 45 degrees, or possibly more, before breaking.Buckle fracturesBuckle fractures occur due to compression of the porous bone, causing a raised area or bulge at the fracture site.Greenstick fractures Greenstick fractures occur when the bone is bent beyond its limits, causing an incomplete fracture.Complete fractures Complete fractures occur when the bone is broken into separate pieces. Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 442 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.443MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS don't affect growth. Injuries identified as type III and above require intervention to prevent future dysfunction in the bone and affected body part. (See Salter-Harris classification system .) From bone to lung Fat embolism is a major, life-threatening complication of a fracture. Fat globules are released into the circulation and can be-come lodged in the capillaries of the lung, thereby decreasing the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Signs of an embolism are increasing blood pressure, dyspnea, and other signs of respiratory compromise.Salter-Harris classification system The Salter-Harris classification system divides growth plate fractures into five categories. These categories are based on the type of damage to the growth plate. Type I The epiphysis is completely separated from the metaphy-sis or end of bone. Although a type I fracture generally re-quires casting, it rarely requires manipulation. Growth disturbance isn't common unless the blood supply has been injured.Type II Type II is the most common type of frac-ture. The epiphysis and the growth plate are separated from the cracked me-taphysis. This type of fracture must be ma-nipulated and casted for normal growth to continue. Minimal shortening of the bone may occur but usually doesn't result in func-tional limitations.Type III Type III is a rare fracture that usually involves the lower tibia, or a long bone of the lower leg. It occurs when the frac-ture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and the growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery may be necessary. Growth usually isn't affected as long as the blood supply to the bone is intact.Type IV A type IV fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. It occurs most commonly in the humerus near the elbow. Perfect alignment must be achieved for normal growth to occur.Type V A crush or compres-sion injury, a type V fracture most likely occurs in the knee or ankle. It is an uncom-mon injury. Stunting of growth is possible and prognosis is poor. Surgery is required as well as future recon-structive or 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

It's a little easier on the eyes when there's clothing involved\u2014not to mention skin.How it's treated Reducing or realigning the bone into proper placement and allowing it to heal is the treatment required for a fracture. The reduction may be closed (through external manipula- tion of the body part) or open (done through surgery). Closed reductions are usually treated with casting. Surgical repair of a fracture involves the use of either inter- nal or external fixation devices. P ermanent hardware Internal devices (rods, pins, or wires) are permanent; they remain in the child unless a problem develops. External devices are pins or wires that are inserted through the bone and then attached to an external frame. When the bone heals, the devices are removed. Follow-up evaluation is essential to prevent and quickly treat complications that may arise. What to do Fractures are usually treated in an emergency setting. Formal preparation for treatments and procedures may not be possible. Prepare on the go Tell the child (and parents) everything that's being done as it's happening and provide as much support as possible to help ease the child's fears and enhance cooperation. \u0081 Provide emergency care to the child with a fracture; steps should be taken to quickly assess the injury, prevent further damage, and promote comfort.\u0081 Frequently check for neurologic and circulatory com- promise to the affected area. Cast caution \u0081 After the cast or splint has been applied, continue to as- sess the area around the cast.\u0081 When a fracture requires long-term immobilization with traction, reposition the patient often to increase comfort and prevent pressure ulcers, assist with active ROM exercises to prevent muscle atrophy, and encourage deep breathing and coughing to prevent pneumonia. Are you shocked? \u0081 Watch for signs of shock in the child with a severe open frac- ture of a large bone such as the femur.\u0081 Assist the child to regain normal function as quickly as pos- sible; encourage him to start moving around as soon as he can, help him walk, and demonstrate how to use crutches properly.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis JIA (formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of the connective tissue. It's a group of conditions characterized by the presence of chronic synovial inflammation. Immunogenetic traits in children with JIA are different from those in adults with adult rheumatoid arthritis. These traits may be significant because of their effect on the formation of cellular antibodies, the immune system, and consequent chronic inflammation. What causes it The exact cause of JIA is unknown. Some experts believe that a two-step process takes place. First, the child is genetically more likely to develop JIA. Second, an environmental trigger in a joint causes normal immunoglobulins within the joint to release harm- ful chemicals which in turn damage the tissue. This tissue injury may be a result of infection, possibly viral. Researchers haven't pinpointed a specific infectious gene marker or even identified the mechanism that provokes the systemic and local immune responses in children with JIA. How it happens Autoantibodies develop in response to injured joint tissue. These autoantibodies are known as rheumatoid factors . These factors then lodge in the joint's synovial fluid and cause inflammation. As the inflammatory process continues, the synovial membrane thickens, production of synovial fluid increases, and cellular composition is altered. This process results in pain, swelling, and limited mobility. What to look for There are three major presentations of JIA. Most children with JIA exhibit some joint swelling, warmth, and morning stiffness.

In early stages of the disease, only soft tissue swelling may be seen on X-ray. MRI of the involved joints may show joint damage. Hematologic tests may help confirm the diagnosis if clinical manifestations are present: \u0081 Rheumatoid factor is positive in only 15% of cases.\u0081 Leukocytes may be elevated, suggesting an inflammatory process. \u0081 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be normal or elevated. antibodies may be present.\u0081 Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, which are commonly found in adult patients with arthritis, may or may not be present in children with JIA.Types of JIA There are three major types of JIA, each with its own presentation. Oligoarthritis (formerly known as pauciarticular disease) Persistent oligoarthritis is characterized by chronic ar- thritis in four or fewer joints for the first 6 months of the disease. The large joints (knees, ankles, elbows) are most commonly affected. This presentation accounts for 50% of all JIA cases. The symptoms are typically mild with possibly little or no pain. Systemic features are uncom-mon but the eyes can be severely inflamed. If the disease progresses to affect more than four joints, it is known as extended oligoarthritis. Polyarticular pattern The polyarticular pattern of JIA most closely resembles the adult disease. Chronic pain and swelling occur in five or more joints, usually the knees, wrists, ankles, neck, and elbows. Systemic features are usually less prominent, although a low-grade fever, fatigue, and anemia may be present. This process may wax and wane over the course of years. It accounts for approximately 30% of all cases and affects girls more commonly than boys. Polyarticular arthri-tis can have either a positive or negative rheumatoid factor. Systemic JIA In systemic JIA, an acute presentation of the disorder, a salmon-pink rash appears on the trunk and extremities, often disappearing and reappearing quickly or moving to other areas. A high fever spikes intermittently over a cou-ple of weeks, and anorexia and weight loss are common. Swelling of the lymph glands or the liver or spleen arises. Joint involvement occurs later in the disease process. Other areas of the body may be affected, including the heart, lungs, and blood. This type of presentation accounts for less than 10% of all JIA cases and may be episodic. Re-mission of the systemic features may occur within 1 year. Psoriatic arthritis Children with psoriatic arthritis also have the skin afflic-tion known as psoriasis or have a close relative with the disease. They often have swelling and inflammation of a finger or toe and the nails will split or become discolored. Enthesitis-related arthritis The enthesis is the point where the tendon attaches to the bone. In this form of arthritis, the child has swelling and inflammation at the enthesis. The most commonly affected areas include the Achilles tendon and the knee. Other affected areas include the back (known as juvenile anky-losing spondylitis) or around the sacroiliac joint in relation to inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, the iris of the eye may become inflamed (iritis, uveitis, or iridocyclitis). Undifferentiated arthritis is labeled for those types of arthritis that do not fit into the previously mentioned cate- gories or fits into more than one category.

It's a self-limiting disease, and 70% to 90% survive JIA without functional limitations. However, some complications do occur: \u0081 In children with early-onset oligoarthritis disease involving only one knee, there may be a significant difference in leg length. Thrown another curve \u0081 The incidence of scoliosis may be up to 10 times higher in chil- dren with JIA than in the general population.\u0081 Cervical spine involvement and other skeletal abnormalities may develop in up to 70% of children with arthritis. \u0081 Anemia is a common feature of systemic and polyarticular arthritis. The eyes have it \u0081 Up to 30% of children with oligoarthritis develop an inflam- mation of the iris and ciliary bodies of the eye (uveitis), which produces no symptoms but may cause blindness if left untreated. \u0081 Children with JIA are at increased risk for iridocyclitis (inflam- mation of the iris and ciliary body in the eye). How it's treated Treatment of JIA aims to reduce disease activity, relieve symptoms, and maintain function. NSAIDs first unless pain is worse Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed to decrease inflammation and relieve pain; medications such as naproxen (Naprosyn/Aleve) or ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) may be used. Aspirin should not be used in children due to the rare but serious risk of developing Reye's syndrome. If NSAIDs fail, alternative medications are used. These medications include methotrexate (Rheumatrex), which has replaced gold salts as the second-line medication. Occasionally, local corticosteroid injec- tions or joint replacement is required. Systemic corticosteroids are not routinely used due to the high risk of side effects. Up and active ROM and muscle strengthening exercises are ordered and carried out by a physical therapist. Unless JIA is in the most acute stage, bed rest should be avoided. Involvement of the eye should be followed and treated by an ophthalmologist. A number of children find relief through complementary and alternative therapies. It is important to stress to the family that these therapies are used in addition to standard medical care and do not replace recom- mended Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.448MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS It's a balancing act. There's a fine line between protecting and overprotecting a child with JIA.What to do The child and his parents will need help adjusting to the realities of a chronic disease. Parents may tend to be over-protective and may need help to find the balance between allowing their child to live a normal life and protecting him from injury and complications. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor the child for signs of joint limitation and pain. \u0081 Teach the family about the disease process and how to monitor for complications.\u0081 Help parents acquire the skills needed to parent a child with a chronic illness. Helpful or harmful? \u0081 Help family members distinguish between harmless inter- ventions and those that are potentially harmful; some studies show that most patients will try alternative treatments for JIA, including copper bracelets, acupuncture, herbs and other medicines, and diet.\u0081 During inflammatory exacerbations, administer NSAIDs or pre-scribed medication on a regular schedule. Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head. It may involve the entire femoral head or only a portion of it. There may be a widening and flattening of the femoral head. The disorder can appear at any time between ages 2 and 12, although it's most commonly seen between ages 4 and 8. Boys are four times more likely to be affected than girls. The disorder is most prevalent in Whites and children of Chinese origin and rarely seen in African Americans. It usually affects only one hip. If both hips are symmetrically affected, an underlying systemic disorder should be considered. What causes it Necrosis (death) of the bone is caused by diminished blood supply to the femoral head. It isn't known what causes the blood supply to be interrupted. Epidemiologic studies show an increased association of Legg- Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease with such factors as low birth weight, older parental age at conception, and lower socioeconomic status, to name a few. HIV and short stature as well as delayed bone matura- tion for age also seem to be risk factors. Other theories have focused on conditions that could directly impede blood flow to the femoral head. Disorders Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.449MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS It's worth the wait. A few years of healing can result in completely normal bone in a child with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease.such as thrombophilia, may predispose a child to Legg- Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease. How it happens Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease has three distinct stages: The avascular stage is characterized by the inter- ference of the blood supply to the head of the femur; without an appropriate blood supply, death of the bone cells ( osteocytes) and bone marrow cells occurs. This stage can last several months to 1 year. During the revascularization stage , vascular and connective tissue invade the dead bone in a process called creeping substitution ; the necrotic tissue is replaced with living bone, although the bone isn't yet calcified. In the final stage, also called the healing stage , ossification occurs; this process can take between 2 and 3 years to complete. A job well done The replacement of necrotic bone may be so complete and perfect that a completely normal bone results. What to look for Typically, children with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease demonstrate a painless limp. Occasionally, pain is present and is made worse by activity. Pain is usually referred to the knee. Children may also complain of anterior thigh or groin pain. On examination, there is limited ROM in the hip joint. What tests tell you Symptoms may occasionally follow an injury, but studies usually show the disease was present before the injury. X-rays correlate with the progression of the disease and the extent of the necrosis. There may be evidence of decreased bone mass and a smaller ossification center. A subchondral (below the cartilage\u2014similar to the epiphyseal plate) fracture may be an early finding in the child with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease. As the disease progresses, X-rays will show changes. Complications Osteochondritis dissecans occurs in less than 5% of patients with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease.

Diversional activities keep boredom in check and will help keep development on track.It may break off and become lodged within the joint itself. The growth plate may be affected in severe disease. Prognosis depends on the child's age, the extent of femoral head involvement, the disease's duration, and ROM. Some long- term studies have suggested that osteoarthritis leading to the need for total hip replacement will commonly develop later in life. How it's treated Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease is a self-limiting disease with no known treatments to speed the return of blood to the femoral head. Keep it simple Treatment consists simply of protecting the joint by keeping the femoral head within the acetabulum. If the joint is deeply seated within the acetabulum and normal joint motion is maintained, then a reasonably good result can be expected. The goal of treatment is to reduce hip irritability, restore normal ROM, and prevent subluxation or disloca- tion. Surgical intervention is sometimes required. Children with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease should be kept non- weight bearing. Nonsurgical intervention includes PT, traction, and crutches. Casts and abduction bracing have been used in an attempt to hold the femoral head in place while the disease runs its course, but recent studies have shown no benefit from this type of treatment. What to do The child (and his parents) will need con- tinuous emotional support. They should be encouraged to talk about their fears, anxiety, and frustration. Explaining all procedures as well as the need for no weight bearing will help reduce anxiety. In some cases, a period of bedrest is required. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Administer analgesics as ordered.\u0081 Encourage parents to participate in their child's care.\u0081 Stress the need for follow-up care to monitor rehabilitation. P arty at Tommy's bedside! RSVP \u0081 Stress the need for home tutoring and socialization to promote normal mental and emotional growth and development.\u0081 Offer tips for making home management of the bedridden child easier; tell parents what special supplies are needed, such as paja- mas and trousers in a size larger than usually worn (with the side Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 450 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 450 5/22/14 8:04 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Slipped capital femoral epiphysis As the name implies, a child with SCFE has a portion of the femoral head distal to the growth plate (physis) that slips out of the socket causing pain and a limp. In many cases, the pain is referred to the knee. The SCFE can occur in one or both of the hips. Depending on how severe the slip is and how long it has occurred, the treatment and prognosis can be short and sweet or long and complex. What causes it It is not fully understood what causes SCFE, but it is seen more commonly in younger teens who are obese. There may be a genetic predisposition. Kids with endocrine disorders such as diabetes, hy- pothyroidism, or growth hormone deficiencies are more prone to having an SCFE. This may be due to the abnormal cartilage growth and mineralization that occurs with these disorders. How it happens Any time the force placed on the femoral head exceeds that of the growth plate (the capital femoral physis), an SCFE is bound to happen. No one is quite sure what causes a weakening of the growth plate, but some factors include the normal thinning and widening of the growth plate during growth spurts or trauma. Other conditions that affect normal bone health such as cancer or certain medications may also predispose a child to SCFE. What to look for The biggest symptom of SCFE is pain in the knee, groin, thigh, or hip. The pain may be mild or severe depending on the severity of the slip. Some children with a mild slip may experience stiffness. A limp is often noticed. Increased activity frequently brings increased pain. SCFE is often classified according to the time of presentation.Preslip \u2014Children with preslip SCFE have pain but no overt signs of displacement. A widening of the proximal femoral physis may be seen on X-ray. Acute \u2014Children presenting with acute SCFE have pain that is recent (less than 2 to 3 weeks). It is commonly seen with Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 451 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.452MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS traumatic injuries such as a fall and accounts for only 10% to 15% of cases. These children are in severe pain and may show a visible deformity. The child may refuse to bear weight. Children with an acute form of SCFE are at significant risk of further joint damage. They should be kept non-weight bearing until treatment is started. Chronic \u2014Chronic SCFE is the most common presentation of all types of SCFE. Pain can be vague and intermittent over a long period of time. The pain is commonly found in the knee, hip, groin, or thigh. On occasion, a diagnosis is missed or delayed because there is no actual hip pain. A limp is usually present with the foot of the affected side turning outward. ROM is decreased and painful in all directions. The upper thigh and gluteal muscles may begin to atrophy. Acute on chronic \u2014Children with chronic SCFE who suddenly have increased pain and symptoms are classified as acute on chronic presentation. Joint changes and effusion are typically seen. SCFE is also classified as stable or unstable or according to severity\u2014mild, moderate, or severe. What tests tell you X-rays are the most common test used for the diagnosis of SCFE. A widening or irregularity of the physis is seen. If the slip is very mild, an MRI or bone scan may be used. Ultrasounds or CT scans have not been shown to be any more effective in the diagnosis of SCFE than regular X-rays. Other lab tests may be used to identify additional causes of SCFE (such as hypothyroidism). Complications Complications of SCFE can cause permanent joint damage or a discrepancy in leg length. Osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis is essentially the death of the bone. It can occur with severe slips, a delay in treatment, or due to a complication of the treatment itself. Chondrolysis is a narrowing of the joint itself and a loss of cartilage often due to untreated SCFE. It can also be seen in children whose severe SCFE requires a prolonged period of bedrest. Children with SCFE are at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis. How it's treated Surgery is the treatment for SCFE. The orthopedic surgeon places a screw through the growth plate and femoral head to stabilize the joint. In many cases, the surgeon will also stabilize the opposite hip due to the high risk of slippage bilaterally. Postoperative care includes teaching the child how to use crutches or a walker and the gradual return to normal activities.

All Rights Reserved.453MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS What to do SCFE can be a frightening diagnosis for a teen (or child) and his family. Reassure the family that with proper treatment, the outcomes are generally very good. Allow the child to express his fears and answer any questions he may have. Explain the impor- tance of following the recommended treatment in order to prevent any long-term consequences. Osgood-Schlatter disease Osgood-Schlatter disease is not exactly a disease. It is an overuse injury of the knee in a growing adolescent. The patellar tendon becomes inflamed at the tibial junction, eventually leading to pain and swelling at the tibial tuberosity. It usually will go away as the child matures. What causes it Osgood-Schlatter disease happens when the repeated strain from activities exceeds the amount of give that the patellar tendon has. Athletic kids are more likely to develop Osgood-Schlatter disease than nonathletes. One-quarter to one-half of teens will have both knees affected. How it happens Active children often are involved in sports or other activities that require a lot of stress and contraction of the quadriceps. This contraction then exerts a pull on the developing patellar tendon. Re- peated strain leads to inflammation of the tendon (apophysitis), thus causing a slight tear. As the body tries to repair the tear, a callus is formed. The result is pain and swelling at the tibial tuberosity\u2014the bony protrusion on the tibia just below the kneecap. What to look for Knee pain is the hallmark symptom of Osgood-Schlatter disease. It starts out as a dull ache then increases with continued use. It is exacerbated by activities that require a lot of knee use (running, climbing stairs, kneeling, etc.). The pain goes away with rest. Other symptoms include tenderness and swelling at the tibial tuberosity and tight hamstrings and quads. What tests tell you The diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease is made by clinical examination. Unless there are unusual signs and symptoms such as redness, warmth, nighttime pain, or an acute onset of severe pain, X-rays are not needed.

The most common compli- cation is continued chronic pain. A persistent prominence of the tibial tubercle may occur. Very rarely, Osgood-Schlatter disease may cause a hyperextension of the knee known as genu recurva- tum (backward-bending knee). How it's treated Because the biggest problem with Osgood-Schlatter disease is pain due to overuse, treatment is geared toward controlling the pain and resting the knee. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Motrin/ Advil) or naproxen (Naprosyn/Aleve) may be used for 4 to 7 days to decrease the inflammation and provide pain control. Resting the knee is paramount. Unfortunately, the kids who are most likely to develop Osgood-Schlatter disease are also those most likely not to rest the knee. Gradual return to sports after therapy to stretch and strengthen the quadriceps is recommended. On rare occasions, surgery is needed to resect the ossicle that has developed or to remove the prominent tuberosity. What to do The name Osgood-Schlatter disease can frighten a child and the family. Reassurance that this is not a disease and will usually resolve after a short amount of rest and therapy is often all that the child needs to be able to deal with this diagnosis. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Help the child and family understand the importance of resting the knee as recommended and to not try to continue at the same level the activities that caused this injury to begin with. \u0081 Encourage the child, however, to be active as long as the pain is tolerable and resolves within 24 hours.\u0081 Educate the child and family on strengthening and stretching exercises of the quadriceps and hamstrings.\u0081 Encourage the use of a protective pad to prevent direct trauma to the tibial tubercle. Scoliosis Scoliosis is a spinal deformity; it's defined as a lateral curvature of the spine that's greater than 10 degrees and is always asso-ciated with some rotation of the involved vertebrae. Posterior curvature of the spine is known as kyphosis , and anterior curva- ture is known as lordosis some curvature is normal, excessive All Rights Reserved.455MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS either nonstructural (functional) or structural. (See Looking at scoliosis .) Scoliosis can occur at any age, but idiopathic scoliosis is seen in greatest numbers in children after age 8. Girls are four to five times more likely to be affected than boys, and the incidence is higher if another family member is affected. The deformity progresses during growth periods and stabilizes when vertebral growth is complete. What causes it In nonstructural scoliosis, the spine is structurally normal and the disorder never progresses to structural scoliosis. Non-structural scoliosis may be caused by poor posture, leg-length discrepancies, an irritated sciatic nerve, or an infectious pro- cess such as appendicitis. A very rare psychological scoliosis is known as hysterical scoliosis . Not sure about structure Structural scoliosis can be categorized by its major causes: neuromuscular, congenital, syndromic, or idiopathic. Neuro-muscular disorders such palsy, poliomyelitis, or muscular dystrophy can cause scoliosis. Birth defects, injuries, certain infections, tumors, and metabolic factors are also iden-tified causes. Connective tissue disorders leading to Marfan syndrome, neurofibromatosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, or rheumatic disease may also cause structural abnormalities. The cause of idiopathic scoliosis , the most common type of struc- tural scoliosis, is currently unknown. There may be a genetic component as some studies in identical twins show a higher incidence of idiopathic scoliosis than that of fraternal twins. Children also have a higher incidence of acquiring scoliosis if a parent had it. How it happens The spine is normally curved in order to maintain proper balance, with the muscles on either side of the spine support-ing it. If a lateral curve has developed, a convex rotation of the spine and ribs will eventually cause the vertebrae to become rotated or wedge-shaped. Muscles become contracted and a compensatory curve develops so that the body can maintain balance and posture. The curve either stabilizes on its own or progress. The amount of progression depends on the child's sex, the initial severity of the curve, and the remaining growth potential. The curve will naturally worsen as the spine con-tinues to grow.Looking at scoliosis The spinal defor- mity that occurs in scoliosis is shown in this Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 455 Meadows-Oliver_Ch11.indd 455 8:04 PM 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.456MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS The signs of scoliosis are even more obvious when the child bends over.What to look for Examination of the child usually begins with a general inspec- tion of the back with the child in a standing position. Obvious asymmetries can be seen, including: \u0081 one shoulder higher than the other \u0081 prominent scapula\u0081 uneven waistline\u0081 rib hump. Over for obvious As the child bends over, these asymmetries become even more obvious. The shoulder and hip levels become uneven. The head should normally align directly over the sacrum but, in persons with a spinal deformity, there may be deviation from the mid- line. These differences disappear in nonstructural scoliosis. Something suspicious Scoliosis classically produces no symptoms. If the child has pain, the scoliosis is likely due to some other disorder such as a bone or spinal cord tumor. Neurologic symptoms, wasting of the hands or lower extremities, and an age of onset younger than 10 years sug- gests a different cause. These secondary causes must be ruled out. In cases of secondary scoliosis, the curvature often will resolve when the underlying cause is treated. What tests tell you X-rays are used to evaluate the entire spine in the standing posi- tion, looking at both the anteroposterior and lateral planes.\u0081 Measurement of skeletal maturity and shoulder and hip levels determines the degree of scoliosis. \u0081 An abnormal forward bending test, in which the patient bends forward 90 degrees with the hands joined at the midline, demon-strates asymmetry of the shoulders and height of the ribs. \u0081 Two types of measurement devices\u2014a level plane ruler, used for measurement while the patient is bending over, and a sco liometer, designed to assess the angle of trunk rotation\u2014can be used to help determine the severity of the curve and guide management decisions. It can also be used to help reassure the child and her family. Complications Generally, scoliosis is mild and there are few problems. Some chil- dren with scoliosis will continue with back pain throughout adult-hood. Complications can sometimes lead to serious, Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.457MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS Severe curves can have severe consequences in a child with scoliosis.or even life-threatening sequelae. The curve can cause the thoracic area to become smaller, thus crowding the heart and lungs. This can lead to pulmonary and cardiac compromise. Negotiating the curves The severity of complications increases with the sever- ity of the curvature:\u0081 Severe curves can affect vital lung capacity, causing tachypnea or even hypoxia; severe restrictive lung disease and even death from cor pulmonale may occur if scoliosis is left untreated. \u0081 Large thoracic curves greater than 60 de- grees are associated with a shortened life span.\u0081 Large lumbar curvatures may lead to subluxation of the vertebrae and arthritic changes in the spine; disabling pain in adult-hood may result because of these changes.\u0081 Neurologic sequelae and paralysis may be a complication if the vertebral column is manipulated during surgery. \u0081 Infection is always a risk after surgery. How it's treated Treatment of scoliosis depends on the magnitude of the curve, skeletal maturity, and the risk of progression. No treatment is necessary in children with functional scoliosis or in whom the curve is less than 20 degrees. Structural scoliosis is treated as early as possible in order to lessen or prevent progression. Stretching and strengthening the back muscles improve posture and maintain flexibility. Brace yourself Bracing is used in skeletally immature children with curves between 20 and 40 degrees. A silastic, thoracolumbosacral brace is molded to the child and exerts gentle pressure on the spine. This brace is worn 23 hours per day until growth is complete, usually for several years. It's removed only for hygiene and skin care. This brace, also known as an underarm brace, can be fairly well concealed under clothing. A more cumbersome under-chin brace is sometimes needed with more complex curvatures. This brace is less likely to be concealed under clothes and may not be tolerated by the child. Bracing usually does not cure scoliosis but does prevent it from progressing further and may even decrease the amount of curvature noted at the end of treatment.

Activities are restricted for several months until the fusion is solid. What to do It's essential to assess continually for compliance, as noncompli-ance with recommended treatment measures may be detrimental. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Teach the prescribed treatment routines to the child and her parents, and explain the consequences of not following these recommendations (to help ensure the best possible outcome).\u0081 Emphasize activity restrictions; provide alternative exercises and activities that are beneficial. Stealth brace \u0081 Help the child find clothing that minimizes the appearance of the brace to enhance her self-image; teach her to wear a light T-shirt or jersey underneath the brace and to place a smooth cloth over the chin pad (to minimize skin breakdown and promote skin integrity). A strange new world \u0081 For children requiring surgical correction, preoperative teaching is essential. Prepare the child for the presence of various catheters, a special bed (Stryker frame), and the use of certain body mechanics in order to restrict bending at the fusion site. Peer support groups may also be helpful when the child can re-turn home. Quick quiz 1. The growth plate of the bone is known as: A. the epiphyseal plate.B. the metaphyseal plate.

Educating patients and families about Osgood-Schlatter disease should include teaching that: A. the disease progresses to a point that the child can no longer participate in any activity. B. the disease name is a misnomer and it is really an over- use injury. C. the disease means the child must be on bedrest until the injury resolves. D. the disease means the child can treat the pain with ice and medication and continue with all activities as before. Answer: B. Osgood-Schlatter disease is not really a disease but an overuse injury to the patellar tendon. It will heal with rest and maturity of the muscles and tendons. Children should be encouraged to stay active but not at the same level as before to prevent further injury to the tendon. Icing and short-term use of NSAIDs may help the pain.

Structures of the GI system The GI system consists of two major components: alimentary canal accessory organs of digestion. It's alimentary, my dear Watson The alimentary canal of the GI tract consists of a hollow, muscular tube that begins in the mouth and ends at the anus.

Digestion Digestion starts in the oral cavity, where chewing (mastication), salivation (the beginning of starch digestion), and swallowing (deglutition) take place. (See The growing GI system .) Growing pains The growing GI system Here are some highlights of the developing GI system during the first few years of life. Salivary assistance \u0081 Saliva production begins at age 4 months and aids in the process of digestion. Saliva contains mucus to protect oral mucosa and to coat food. Food breakdown begins in the mouth with the enzymes ptyalin and amylase.\u0081 The sucking and extrusion reflex (a reflex that protects the infant from food substances his system is too immature to digest) persists until ages 3 to 4 months. Stomach \u0081 The stomach capacity of the neonate is 30 to 60 ml and gradually increases to 200 to 300 ml by age 12 months and to 1,500 ml in the adolescent.\u0081 Up until ages 4 to 8 weeks, the neonatal abdomen is larger than the chest and the musculature is poorly developed.\u0081 Spit-ups are frequent in the neonate because of the imma-ture muscle tone of the lower esophageal sphincter and the low volume capacity of the stomach.\u0081 Peristalsis occurs within 2\u00bd to 3 hours in the neonate and extends to 3 to 6 hours in older infants and children.\u0081 Digestive enzymes are deficient until at least ages 4 to 6 months; gas, diarrhea, sensitization for food allergies, and microscopic hemorrhages can develop if solid foods are introduced before this time. Intestinal \u0081 From ages 1 to 3 years, the composition of intestinal flora becomes more adultlike and stomach acidity increases, re- ducing the number of GI infections.\u0081 Exposure to breast milk increases intestinal flora early on and provides some protection against viruses and pathologic flora.\u0081 Increased myelination of nerves to the anal sphincter allows for physiologic control of bowel function, usually at about age 2; psychological readiness for toilet training may occur at a later age. Liver \u0081 The liver is immature at birth, resulting in inefficient detoxify-ing of substances and medications. Medication dosages may need to be adjusted.\u0081 The liver's slow development of glycogen storage capacity makes the infant prone to hypoglycemia.\u0081 Infants are more prone to dehydration and fluid and electro-lyte imbalances due to greater body surface area, high rate of metabolism, and immature kidney function.

A fall in blood nutrients, a rise or fall in hormones govern-ing metabolism, hunger contractions from the stomach, and emotional input signal the hypothalamus to stimulate hunger. Fullness of the stomach, blood levels of nutrients and hor-mones, and emotions or habits stimulate the satiety center in the ventromedial area of the hypothalamus to decrease hunger. The tasteful tongue The tongue provides the sense of taste and is the strongest mus- cle in the body. Saliva secreted from the salivary glands moistens the mouth and lubricates the food bolus to ease swallowing. Look out stomach, here it comes! When a person swallows a food bolus: The upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing food to enter the esophagus. The epiglottis closes with swallowing to prevent food from being aspirated into the trachea. As food moves through the esophagus, glands in the esophageal mucosal layer secrete mucus, which lubricates the food and protects the esophageal mucosal layer from being damaged by poorly chewed foods. (See Choking hazards .) Lower esophageal contractions (called peristalsis ) gradu- ally push the food down the esophagus and through the lower esophageal sphincter into the stomach. Stomach Until the child is approximately age 2 years, the stomach is round. It will gradually elongate and take the adult shape and position in the abdomen by age 7 years. The stomach lies in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and is made up of three parts: The fundus is an enlarged portion above and to the left of the esophageal opening in the stomach; the cardiac sphincter is at the opening of the esophagus to the stomach. The body is the middle portion of the stomach. The pylorus is the lower portion of the stomach, lying near the junction of the stomach and the duodenum. The pyloric sphincter is at the opening of the stomach to the duodenum.It's all relative Choking hazards Foods that are round and less than 1\u00bc /H11033 (3.2 cm) in diameter can obstruct the airway of a child when swallowed whole. Teach parents to cut foods into small pieces to prevent obstruction of the airway. Common foods that may cause choking include:\u0081 hot dogs\u0081 Vienna Kluwer.

The lining of the stomach secretes gastrin in response to stomach wall distention. In turn, gastrin stimulates the release of highly acidic digestive secretions consisting mainly of pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin, hydrochloric acid, intrinsic factor, and proteolytic enzymes. Limited amounts of water, alcohol, and some drugs are absorbed in the stomach. Intrinsic factor is necessary for vitamin B 12 absorption. Triple overtime The stomach's three functions are to store food, mix food with gastric juices via peristaltic contractions, and slowly distribute this food (now called chyme ) into the small intestine through the pyloric opening for further digestion and absorption. Small intestine Nearly all digestion and absorption take place in the small intes- tine. The small intestine lies coiled in the abdomen and consists of three major sections: duodenum jejunum ileum. Contractions and digestive secretions break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, enabling the intestinal mucosa to absorb these nutrients, along with water and electro- lytes. Secretin and cholecystokinin are the hormones that affect intestinal secretions and gastric motility. Distribution center The surface area of the small intestine is increased by millions of villi in the mucous membrane lining. Digested food is absorbed through the mucosal walls and into the blood for distribution throughout the body. Failure to feed, malnutrition, ischemia, and infections affect the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, resulting in growth delays. Large intestine The ileocecal valve is the sphincter between the ileum of the small intestine and the cecum of the large intestine. It prevents secretions from returning to the ileum. By the time chyme Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 464 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.465ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY We aren't always the bad guys. As residents of the large intestine, we help synthesize vitamin K and break down cellulose. Newborn infants do not synthesize vitamin K for about the first week of life.through the small intestine and enters the ascending colon of the large intestine, it has been reduced to mostly indigestible substances. Downward spiral From the ascending colon, chyme passes through the transverse colon and descending colon to the rectum, and finally into the anal canal, where it's expelled. The anal sphincter voluntarily controls defecation except in infants and patients with spinal cord injuries. A large job description The large intestine doesn't produce hormones or diges- tive enzymes; it is, however, the site of water and sodium and potassium absorption. The mucosa produces alkaline secretions that lubricate the intestinal wall as chyme pushes through and protect the mucosa from acidic bacterial actions. The large intestine also harbors bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aero- genes , which help to break down cellulose into usable carbohydrates and synthesize vitamin K. Vitamin K is needed by humans for blood clotting. Older children and adults get most of their vitamin K from bacteria in the gut, and some from their diet. Babies have very little vitamin K in their bodies at birth. Vitamin K does not cross the placenta to the developing baby, and the gut does not have any bacteria to make vitamin K before birth. After birth, there is little vitamin K in breast milk and breast-fed babies can be low in vita-min K for several weeks until the normal gut bacteria start making it. Infant formula has added vitamin K, but even formula-fed babies have very low levels of vitamin K for several days. With low levels of vitamin K, some babies can have very severe bleeding\u2014sometimes into the brain, causing significant brain damage. This bleeding is called hemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). As a preventive measure, babies are routinely given vitamin K injections at birth. Accessory glands and organs Allied with the GI tract are the liver, biliary duct system, and pan- creas, which contribute the hormones, enzymes, and bile that are vital to digestion. Liver The liver is located in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen and is the body's largest gland. It plays an important role in carbohydrate metabolism, detoxifies various endogenous and exogenous toxins in plasma, and synthesizes plasma proteins, nonessential amino acids, and vitamin A.

All Rights Reserved.466GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS The stomach gets all the credit, but digestion would be a disaster without the accessory glands and organs!Essential storage The liver also stores essential nutrients, such as iron and vitamins K, D, and B 12. It secretes bile and removes ammonia from body fluids, converting it to urea for excretion in urine. Biliary duct system Bile is a greenish fluid that aids the small intestine to emul-sify and absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins and also neu-tralizes stomach acids. Bile exits through bile ducts that merge into the right and left hepatic ducts to form the common hepatic duct. This common duct joins the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form common bile duct to the duodenum. Gallbladder The gallbladder, located beneath the liver, stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver. Secretion of the hormone cholecystokinin causes the gall- bladder to contract and relax the ampulla of Vater, releasing bile into the common bile duct for delivery to the duodenum. Pancreas The pancreas is a large gland located behind the stomach and attached to the duodenum. The pancreas performs exocrine and endocrine functions. Its exocrine function involves cells that secrete digestive enzymes, bicarbonate, and hormones into the small intestine to aid in digestion. Alpha beta Langerhans The endocrine function of the pancreas involves the islets of Langerhans, which house alpha and beta cells. Alpha cells secrete glucagon, which stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver. Beta cells secrete insulin to promote carbohydrate metabolism. Diagnostic tests Tests used to diagnose GI disorders include barium enema, also called a lower GI series , allows X-ray visual- ization of the colon. Barium is dripped into the rectum by gravity, and a series of X-rays is taken as the barium passes through the lower GI tract.

They're easier to swallow when they're ice cold.Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the child and his parents. Prepare the child for insertion of the barium, and explain that he may be slightly uncomfortable as he changes positions on the X-ray table. Also explain that the child will have to wait until the test is over to go to the bathroom and that his bowel movements may look whitish until the barium has passed through his system.\u0081 Usually, the child will be on a liquid diet for 24 hours before the test. An interesting way to start the day \u0081 Bowel preparations are administered before the examination; an enema the night before the test, the morning of the test, or both may be used for children and infants. (Prepare the child for the enema and provide as much privacy as possible.) \u0081 Tell the child that X-rays will be taken on a test table and that he must hold still (even though he'll feel like he has to go to the bathroom). \u0081 Cover the genital area with a lead apron during the X-rays. Exit the barium \u0081 Hydrate the child well with electrolyte-containing fluids after the procedure to prevent dehydration and to help expel the barium to prevent barium impaction. Barium swallow A barium or diatrizoate meglumine (Gastrografin) swallow, also called an upper GI series , provides imaging of the upper GI tract. It's used primarily to examine the esophagus. Follow the swallow A series of X-rays is taken while the swallowed barium or Gastrografin moves into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to reveal abnormalities. The barium outlines the stomach walls and delineates ulcer craters and filling defects. Gastrografin and barium facilitate imaging through X-rays, but Gastrografin is less toxic if it escapes from the GI tract. Seeking the ileocecal valve A small bowel series is an extension of the upper GI series; additional imaging is done as the barium or Gastrografin flows farther down the GI tract through the small intestine to the ileocecal valve. Nursing considerations \u0081 Explain the procedure to the child and his parents. Tell the child that he'll need to take big swallows of a thick drink that looks like a milkshake (but doesn't taste as good). Explain Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 467 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.468GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS that pictures will be taken while he's drinking and afterward, and that he'll need to hold still during the X-rays.\u0081 Maintain the child on a nothing-by-mouth (NPO) status begin- ning at midnight before the test. \u0081 After the test, monitor bowel movements for excretion of barium and monitor GI function. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography In ERCP , a contrast medium is injected into the duodenal papilla to allow radiographic examination of the pancreatic ducts and hepatobiliary tree. Nursing considerations Obtain written, informed consent after explaining the procedure to the child and his parents. In addition:\u0081 Check the child's history for allergies to cholinergics and iodine. \u0081 Administer a sedative and monitor the child for the drug's effect. It's all over After the procedure: \u0081 Monitor the child's gag reflex. (The child remains on NPO status until his gag reflex returns.) \u0081 Protect the child from aspiration of mucus by positioning him on his side.\u0081 Monitor the child for urine retention. Endoscopy Endoscopy allows visualization of the GI system (and, when needed, biopsy of tissue) with a fiber-optic scope. The direct approach Fiber-optic testing allows direct visualization of the GI tract. Different types of fiber-optic testing are used to examine different portions of the GI tract: \u0081 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows visual inspection of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. \u0081 Colonoscopy allows direct visualization of the descending, transverse, and ascending colon. \u0081 Proctosigmoidoscopy allows inspection of the anus, rectum, and distal sigmoid colon. Nursing considerations \u0081 Explain the procedure to the child and his parents, and make sure that written, informed consent has been obtained. It's hard to hide from endoscopy! A fiber-optic scope can \"shine a light\" Rights Reserved.469TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \u0081 Oral and tongue piercings must be removed. They may acci- dently dislodge and enter airway as foreign bodies.\u0081 Prepare the child for sedation by explaining that it will make him sleepy and will keep him from hurting during the procedure. \u0081 A mild sedative may be administered before the examination; prepare the child for insertion of an intravenous (I.V.) line for sedation during this procedure. \u0081 The child may be kept on NPO status beginning at midnight before the test for an upper GI series.\u0081 The child may be placed on a liquid diet for 24 hours before the examination or require enemas and laxatives until the bowel is clear for a lower GI series.\u0081 After the procedure, assess vital signs for dyspnea and fever with a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in pulse, indi- cating the possibility of bleeding from perforation. Stool specimen Stool specimens are obtained to examine the stool for suspected GI bleeding, infection, or malabsorption. Tests include the guaiac test for occult blood and microscopic tests for ova, parasites, and fat. Nursing considerations Nursing interventions focus on proper collection and handling of the specimen.\u0081 Obtain the specimen in the correct container (the container may need to be sterile or contain a preservative). \u0081 Be aware that the specimen may need to be transported to the laboratory immediately or placed in the refrigerator.\u0081 For infants, stool specimens may be obtained from the diaper. However, apply a urine bag to prevent urine from contaminating the stool. Treatments and procedures Treatments and procedures for children with GI disorders include alternative feeding methods, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), GI intubation, and ostomy creation. Alternative feeding methods Children who are unable to take nutrients by mouth (for example, premature neonates with a poor sucking reflex, children who can't take in enough calories, or children with disorders of the mouth Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 469 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 469 5/22/14 8:17 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

The tip of the child's nose to the ear + the ear to the xiphoid process = the tube length.and esophagus, such as atresia and fistulas) are fed by alternative feeding methods. These methods include may be administered intermittently or continuously. Nursing considerations Explain to the child and his parents why the alternative feeding method is needed, and prepare the child for inser-tion of the feeding tube. Nasogastric and orogastric feedings In NG and OG feedings, a tube is inserted into the stomach by way of one of the nares (NG) or the mouth (OG). Follow these steps: \u0081 To determine the correct length of the feeding tube, measure from the tip of the child's nose to his ear and add to that amount the length from his ear to his xiphoid process. Cold coil in a cup \u0081 Lubricate the tube with sterile water or a water-soluble lubricant before administration.\u0081 Facilitate insertion of the NG tube by having the child take large swallows of water as the tube is being in- serted; allow the child to practice first.\u0081 When the feeding tube is secured, check placement immediately, at the start of intermittent feedings, and at least every 4 hours thereafter. \u0081 Inject 1 cc of air for infants and 5 cc of air for children into the feeding tube, and auscultate for gurgling sounds in the stomach when the air is injected. Alternate methods of checking placement are to aspirate a small amount of stomach contents and apply pH paper to check acidity level. Measure the tube from the nose or mouth to the end and record in the nurse's notes every shift. If the tube is to be left in place, an X-ray may be ordered to check placement. Recycle the residual \u0081 Check the residual amount of formula by aspirating stomach contents into a syringe. Record the amount of residual formula and the color, odor, and consistency of the gastric contents before refeeding the contents. \u0081 Administer feeding by gravity or feeding pump. Clear the clogs \u0081 Irrigate the feeding tube with 10 ml of sterile water after each feeding to prevent stagnant formula from clogging the tube.

All Rights Reserved.471TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES An infant who's receiving tube feedings still needs to suck. It provides stimulation and comfort.\u0081 Record the total amount of formula administered and describe how well it was tolerated. Observe for signs of aspiration and intolerance, including low oxygen saturation, difficulty breathing, increased crying or discomfort, and vomiting. Pinch and position \u0081 If the feeding tube will be removed after feeding, pinch the tube while withdrawing it to prevent aspirating fluid left in the tube.\u0081 Position the child with his head elevated during the feeding and for 1 hour afterward to prevent aspiration. Sucking for satiation \u0081 When feeding infants by NG or OG tube, nonnutritive sucking is essential for oral stimulation. It helps the infant to relate a full stomach with oral sucking and fulfills the developmental need to suck. tubes in the duodenum or jejunum. Feedings are administered as they are with NG and OG feedings; however, the residual gastric contents and tube place- ment don't need to be checked. Duodenum and jejunum feeding tubes aren't removed after and jejunostomy feedings Gastrostomy and jejunostomy feedings are administered with a surgically placed feeding tube. The tube has one exit site on the abdomen but is composed of two separate chambers, each with a unique entry port. One side of the tube ends in the stomach and is typically used for medication administration. The other side of the tube ends in the jejunum and is typically used for formula administration. It wouldn't work in outer space In gastrostomy and jejunostomy feedings: \u0081 Boluses of formula or water are administered by gravity or by feeding pump. \u0081 The feeding tube must be flushed with sterile water after each feeding to prevent clogs.\u0081 The child should be positioned with his head elevated at a 30-degree angle after feeding to prevent aspiration and encourage gastric emptying. \u0081 Long-term gastrostomy tubes have a button closure that allows for the removal of the gastrostomy tube between feedings.\u0081 As with NG or OG tubes, infants fed by gastrostomy tube should engage in nonnutritive sucking for oral stimulation.

Concentrate on TPN TPN is a highly concentrated solution of protein, glucose, vita-mins, and minerals. It's infused through I.V. tubing with a special filter to remove particulate matter and microorganisms. Low- glucose solutions may be administered through a peripheral I.V. line. High-glucose solutions are administered through central I.V. lines. Some medications, such as heparin and ranitidine (Zantac), may be added to the TPN solution and, therefore, shouldn't be administered separately. TPN is typically administered with an intralipid infusion that provides necessary lipids and calories. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for insertion of the peripheral or central line. It can be frightening to a child (or his parents) if a line is inserted in the neck or shoulder area. Using a doll to demon- strate may help the child understand what will happen. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor the infusion rate via the I.V. pump. Cycling TPN, if ordered, involves tapering the drip rate at the start and end of the infusion, which commonly requires hourly rate changes. Infection inspection \u0081 Assess the insertion site for signs of infection and infiltration because TPN can cause significant tissue damage.\u0081 Bags of TPN should be changed every 24 hours; tubing should be changed according to your facility policy. The doc- tor will order changes to the contents of the TPN solution based on the child's daily laboratory values. Inspect the bag of TPN; don't hang it if the solution appears cloudy or if there are precipitates visible (if so, return it to the pharmacy). Not too much, not too little \u0081 Monitor electrolytes for excesses and deficits, particularly hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia.\u0081 Monitor the child's blood glucose for hyperglycemia and administer insulin as ordered. \u0081 Reassure the parents that the TPN will provide all the nutri-tion the child needs.

It's used to:\u0081 empty the stomach and intestine \u0081 aid in diagnosis and treatment of stomach and upper GI tract disorders\u0081 decompress obstructed areas\u0081 detect and treat GI bleeding \u0081 administer medications or feedings. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for insertion of the NG tube with a simple, age-appropriate explanation. Because many children panic at the sight of the tube, it's important to maintain a calm and reassuring manner and provide emotional support. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 When inserting the tube, instruct the child to take swallows of water to ease insertion, which also gives the child a job to do and provides a degree of distraction. What goes in must come out \u0081 Maintain accurate intake and output records. \u0081 Record the amount, color, odor, and consistency of gastric drainage every 4 hours. \u0081 When irrigating the tube, note the amount of normal saline solution instilled and aspirated.\u0081 Check for fluid and electrolyte imbalances.\u0081 Provide good oral and nasal care. Make sure the tube is secure and doesn't put pressure on the nostrils. Anchors away \u0081 To support the tube's weight and prevent its accidental removal, anchor the tube to the child's clothing.\u0081 After removing the tube from a child with GI bleeding, watch for signs and symptoms of recurrent bleeding. Ostomy An ostomy is an opening in the intestines with the intestinal wall drawn to the abdomen. A stoma is created to allow passage of intestinal contents. An ostomy can be permanent or temporary, depending on the reason for the ostomy and how much of the intestine has been removed.

All Rights Reserved.474GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS I want to be just like my friends, and having an ostomy makes me feel different. It helps to talk about it and to have my questions answered.Correct the defect An ostomy is created to correct an anatomical defect, relieve an obstruction, or permit treatment of an infection or injury to the intestinal tract. The most common reasons for an ostomy in in- fants and children are imperforate anus, necrotizing enterocolitis, Hirschsprung's disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Location, location, location An ileostomy is placed in the ileum portion of the small intestine. A colostomy is placed in the large intestine and may be ascending, transverse, or descending, depending on where it's placed. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure in simple, age-appropriate terms, preparing the child and his parents for all aspects of the surgery. Prepare the child and his parents for the post- operative period, specifically, what the child will see on his body and feel. Bad timing For older children and adolescents who are already con- cerned with appearance and acceptance by their peers, concerns about body image and, for the adolescent, sexuality are likely. Encourage the child to express these concerns and ask questions. (A same-gender nurse may be easier for the child to talk with.) Been there, done that If possible, introduce the child to a peer who has had the procedure and is handling it well. Refer the child to other health care professionals who can help him deal with his body image issue. Also note the following:\u0081 Mucus secretions begin within 48 hours after surgery. \u0081 Fecal drainage begins within 72 hours after surgery.\u0081 Edema of the stoma is present for 2 to 3 weeks after placement. A wash and a pat-dry \u0081 When changing the stoma appliance (as needed), record the amount, character, color, and odor of the drainage; wash the stoma with soap and water, rinse, pat dry, apply adhesive material (skin sealant and stoma paste), and reapply the drainage bag. \u0081 Instruct the child and his parents in care of the ostomy.\u0081 If the skin is irritated, apply a protective ointment before apply-ing the appliance. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 474 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 474 \u0081 An infant's stoma may be left unpouched with a protective wafer around the stoma. P ouch protector \u0081 In young children, protect the pouch from being pulled off by using one-piece shirt-and-pant outfits.\u0081 To control odor in the appliance, use deodorant drops, aspirin, or mouthwash solutions. \u0081 A low-residue diet may be required; avoid gas-producing foods or foods with strong odors. P ass the salt \u0081 With an ileostomy, provide a diet high in sodium and potassium; avoid highly seasoned foods.\u0081 Protect the skin around the stoma from enzymes in liquid stool by using a skin protectant or by making sure that the opening to the wafer is cut close to the sides of the stoma. GI disorders GI disorders that may affect children include appendicitis, celiac disease, cleft lip and volvulus. Appendicitis Appendicitis is an inflammation and obstruction of the blind sac (vermiform appendix) at the end of the cecum. It's the most common major surgical disease in school-age children and its peak incidence occurs in children between ages 10 and 12 years. Although the appendix has no known function, it does regularly fill and empty itself with food. What causes it The appendiceal lumen becomes obstructed with fecal matter, cal- culi, tumors, or strictures from trauma or infection due to bacte-ria, viruses, or parasites. How it happens The obstruction of the appendiceal lumen sets off an inflamma-tory process that can lead to infection, thrombosis, necrosis, and perforation. If the appendix ruptures or perforates, the infected contents spill into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 475 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 475 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.476GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS Advice from the experts Abdomen assessment tips Keep these tips in mind when assessing a child's abdomen: \u0081 Warm your hands before beginning the assessment.\u0081 Note guarding of the abdomen and the child's ability to move around on the examination table.\u0081 Flex the child's knees to decrease muscle tightening in the abdomen.\u0081 Have child use deep breathing or distraction during the examination; a parent can help divert the child's attention.\u0081 Have the child \"help\" with the examination. Place your hand over the child's hand on the abdomen and extend your fingers beyond the child's fingers to decrease tick-lishness of palpating the abdomen.\u0081 Before palpation, auscultate the abdomen as palpation can produce erratic bowel sounds; lightly palpate tender areas last. When the pain from appendicitis stops suddenly, it's the calm before the storm\u2014of perforation or infarction, that is.What to look for At first, midabdominal cramps and tenderness are diffuse; eventu- ally, they localize in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) at McBurney's point. The child will guard against anyone trying to examine the abdomen. (See Abdomen assessment tips .) He may experience nausea and vomiting and have a low-grade fever. Later complaints include lethargy, irritability, constipation, and, rarely, diarrhea. Much ado about the RLQ Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds. As the inflam- mation increases, constant pain is noted in the RLQ with rebound tenderness; the pain is exacerbated by coughing and deep breathing. Calm before the storm If peritonitis occurs, abdominal distention and rigidity progress. Sudden cessation of abdominal pain signals perforation or infarction. What tests tell you Diagnosis of appendicitis is based on physical findings and characteristic clinical symptoms. A moderately elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with increased numbers of immature cells supports the diagnosis. Complications The most common complication of appendicitis is perito- nitis from appendix rupture, which is a clinical emergency. Signs and symptoms of peritonitis include fever, abdominal Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 476 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 476 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.477GI DISORDERS distention and rigidity, sudden relief of pain, decreased bowel sounds, nausea, and vomiting. Other possible complications in-clude ischemic bowel and postoperative wound infection. How it's treated Appendectomy is the only effective treatment for appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomies decrease recovery time and hospi-tal stay. If peritonitis develops, treatment involves GI intubation, parenteral replacement of fluids and electrolytes, and administra- tion of antibiotics. What to do Because appendectomies are usually performed on an emergency basis, there may not be time to formally prepare the child for surgery. Seize the day Seize the opportunities that nursing care provides (bedside care, transporting the child, administering medications) to provide brief explanations and answer the child's questions. At the very least, tell the child that he'll be given a special medicine and won't feel anything during surgery. Tell him where he'll be when he wakes up and when he'll see his parents. Tell the child what to expect when he awakens (I.V. line, NG tube, level of discomfort and what will be done to make him feel better). In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Position the child preoperatively in a semi-Fowler's or right-side-lying position with knees bent to decrease pain.\u0081 Administer I.V. fluids to prevent dehydration, and keep the patient on NPO status until surgery is performed.\u0081 Never apply heat to the right lower abdomen; this may cause the appendix to rupture.

The child is born with an intolerance of the protein.Celiac disease Celiac disease is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The disease usually becomes apparent between ages 6 and 18 months, after gluten- containing foods are introduced into the diet. Fami ly history increases the risk of developing celiac disease. A study done by Mayo Clinic and the National Institutes of Health estimates that about 1 in 141 people in the United States have celiac disease, although the disease often goes undiagnosed. Although celiac disease is most common in Whites, it can affect anyone. It is more common in people who have type 1 diabetes, a family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpeti-formis, Down syndrome or Turner's syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, or microscopic colitis. What causes it This disorder probably results from environmental factors and a genetic predisposition, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Some genetic mutations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease. How it happens When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the immune reaction damages the villi that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from food. The damage resulting from celiac disease makes the inner surface of the small intestine unable to absorb nutrients necessary for health and growth. As a result, children with celiac disease may become malnourished if the condition remains undiagnosed. What to look for Symptoms vary but typically include recurrent attacks of diarrhea and/or constipation, steatorrhea (fatty, foul-smelling stools), abdominal pain and distention, vomiting, anorexia, irritability, and coagulation difficulties from the malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Inspection reveals signs of generalized malnutrition and failure to thrive, such as a potbelly or muscle wasting. What tests tell you \u0081 Histologic changes seen on small-bowel biopsy specimens confirm the diagnosis.\u0081 A glucose tolerance test shows poor glucose absorption. Inspection of a child with celiac disease may reveal malnutrition.

Complications If not detected and properly treated, celiac disease can cause mal- nutrition, loss of calcium and bone density, lactose intolerance, and cancer. People with celiac disease who don't maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer. How it's treated Lifelong elimination of gluten from the child's diet is essential and is the only treatment for managing celiac disease. In addition to wheat, foods that contain gluten include barley, bulgur, durum, farina, graham flour, malt, rye, semolina, spelt of wheat), and triticale. A high-protein, low-fat, high-calorie diet that includes corn and rice products, soy and potato flour, breast milk or soy-based for- mula, and all fresh fruits is required. Supportive treatment includes gluten-free vitamins to supplement folic acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin B 12, and iron. Children may also receive ad- ministration of vitamins A, E, K, and D in water-soluble forms. What to do Because of the need for lifelong adherence to the diet, the child and his parents should be referred to a nutritionist who can help them make informed choices and plan a nutritious diet. (See Teaching points for celiac disease , page 480.) Cleft lip and palate A cleft lip and palate occur when the bone and tissue of the upper jaw and palate fail to fuse completely at the midline in the first trimester of pregnancy. They may occur separately or together. Cleft deformities usually occur unilaterally or bilaterally but rarely midline. Only the lip may be involved or the defect may extend into the upper jaw and nasal cavity. (See A look at cleft lip and cleft , 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.480GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS What causes it Cleft lip or palate most commonly occurs as an isolated birth defect. It may also occur as part of a chromosomal abnormality or after prenatal exposure to teratogens, such as anticonvulsant medications and alcohol. How it happens Defects originate in the second month of pregnancy, when the front and sides of the face and the palate shelves fuse imperfectly. What to look for Inspection reveals abdominal distention from swallowed air and difficulty swallowing or latching on to a bottle or breast. Cleft lip can range from a simple notch on the upper lip to a complete cleft from the lip edge to the floor of the nostril. A cleft palate that occurs alone (without cleft lip) may be partial or complete, involving only the soft palate or extending from the soft palate completely through the hard palate. What tests tell you Prenatal ultrasonography may indicate severe defects. A typical clinical picture confirms the diagnosis. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is obvious at birth. Cleft palate without cleft lip may It's all relative Teaching points for celiac disease Nursing interventions for a child with celiac disease focus primarily on educating the parents about caring for the child at home, with an emphasis on dietary needs:\u0081 Eliminate gluten from the diet.\u0081 Provide a diet that includes corn and rice products, soy and potato flour, and fresh fruits and vegetables; for the infant, give breast milk or soy-based formula. \u0081 Replace vitamins and calories; give small, frequent meals.\u0081 Monitor for steatorrhea; its disappearance is a good indicator that the child's ability to absorb nutrients is improving.\u0081 Read nutrition labels for sources of gluten. Packaged foods should be avoided unless they're labeled as gluten-free or have no gluten-containing ingredients. In addition to cereals, pastas, and baked goods\u2014such as breads, cakes, pies, and cookies\u2014other packaged foods that may contain gluten include beer; candies; gravies; imitation meats or seafood; processed dressings and sauces, including soy sauce; self-basting poultry; and soups. Some hair products and skin products contain also gluten. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 480 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 480 2015 Kluwer.

Notch with vermilion cleft lip and cleft palateCleft palate not be detected until a mouth examination is done or until feeding difficulties develop. Complications Speech difficulties and failure to thrive (due to inadequate oral intake) are possible complications of unrepaired clefts. In ad-dition, dentition problems, nasal defects, increased episodes of otitis media, hearing defects, and appearance are concerns. The infant is also at increased risk for aspiration and upper respiratory infections. Parents' feelings of shock, guilt, and grief may interfere with parent-child bonding. How it's treated Cheiloplasty (cleft lip surgery) is performed between birth and age 3 months; it unites the lip and gum edges. It's performed in anticipation of tooth eruption, providing a route for adequate nutrition and sucking. (See Preoperative cleft lip and cleft Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.482GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS A special feeding nipple may be needed for the infant with cleft lip or palate.An early start If cleft lip is detected on sonogram while the infant is in utero, fetal repair may be possible. Palatoplasty or staphylorrhaphy (cleft palate repair surgery) is performed between ages 12 and 18 months, before speech patterns develop. The infant must be free from ear and respiratory infections before surgery. A group effort Long-term, team-oriented care aims to address speech defects, dental and orthopedic problems, nasal defects, and possible alterations in hearing. What to do Parents may experience grief over the \"perfect\" child they had hoped for and expected. Those feelings may, in turn, cause feel-ings of guilt. Referral to a counselor or a cleft lip and palate support group may be helpful in working through these feelings so appropriate parent-child bonding can take place. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 To help determine an effective feeding method, assess the quality of the infant's sucking by determining if he can form an airtight seal around a finger or nipple that's placed in his mouth; special nipples are available for infants with cleft lip or palate.Advice from the experts Preoperative cleft lip and cleft palate care Nursing interventions before cleft lip or cleft palate repair will help to ensure an optimal outcome. Cleft lip \u0081 Feed the infant slowly and in an upright posi- tion to decrease the risk of aspiration.\u0081 Burp the infant frequently during feeding to eliminate swallowed air and decrease the risk of emesis.\u0081 Use gavage feedings if oral feedings are unsuccessful.\u0081 Give a small amount of water after feedings to prevent formula from accumulating and becoming a medium for bacterial growth.\u0081 Give small, frequent feedings to promote adequate nutrition and prevent tiring.\u0081 Hold the infant while feeding, and promote sucking between meals; sucking is important for speech development. Cleft palate \u0081 Be aware that the infant may be weaned from the bottle or breast before cleft palate surgery; he may be fed by syringe or he may be able to drink from a cup.\u0081 Feed the infant with a cleft palate nipple or a Teflon implant to enhance nutritional intake.\u0081 Teach the parents that the infant is suscep- tible to pathogens and otitis media from the altered position of the eustachian tubes.

Cleft lip \u0081 Maintain a patent airway; edema or narrowing of a previously large airway may make the infant appear to be in distress.\u0081 Observe for cyanosis to detect signs of respiratory com-promise as the infant begins to breathe through his nose.\u0081 Maintain an intact suture line; keep the infant's hands away from his mouth by using restraints or pinning his sleeves to his shirt.\u0081 Clean the suture line after feedings and apply antibiotic ointment if ordered. \u0081 Anticipate the infant's needs; this will help prevent crying.\u0081 Give extra care and support because the infant's emo-tional needs can't be met by sucking.\u0081 When feeding resumes, use a syringe with tubing to ad-minister foods at the side of the mouth to prevent trauma to the suture line; never use a straw for feedings.\u0081 Place the infant on his right side after feedings to pre-vent aspiration. (Don't put the infant in a prone position.)\u0081 Monitor for pain and administer pain medication as prescribed. Cleft palate \u0081 Position the infant on his abdomen or side to maintain a patent airway.\u0081 Assess for signs of altered oxygenation to promote good respiration.\u0081 Use a syringe or a cup for feeding to prevent injury to the suture line. Breast- or bottle-feeding or use of pacifier are based on surgeon's preference. \u0081 Keep hard or pointed objects (oral thermometers, uten-sils, straws, frozen dessert sticks) away from the infant's mouth to prevent trauma on the suture line.\u0081 Use elbow restraints to keep the child's hands out of his mouth; remove one restraint at a time.\u0081 Provide soft toys to prevent injury.\u0081 Distract or hold the infant to try to keep his tongue away from the roof of his mouth.\u0081 Start the infant on clear liquids and progress to a soft diet.\u0081 Rinse the suture line by giving the infant a sip of water after each feeding to prevent infection.\u0081 Don't brush the child's teeth for 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.\u0081 Do not run, climb, or play with the mouth for 1 or 2 weeks after surgery.\u0081 Postoperative complications: croup, laryngeal Administer decongestants or corticosteroids for con-gestion. Administer antibiotics to decrease possibility of infection. \u0081 Assess the child's ability to swallow, assess for abdominal distention from swallowed air, and monitor the child's respiratory status to detect signs of aspiration. \u0081 Monitor vital signs and intake and output to determine fluid volume status.\u0081 Prepare the child and his parents for surgical repair of the defect. \u0081 Monitor for complications and prepare the family to take over the follow-up care postoperatively.

The disease extends through all layers of the intestinal wall and may involve regional lymph nodes and the mesentery. What causes it Although the exact cause is unknown, possible causes include allergies and other immune disorders and infection (although no infecting organism has been identified). Genetic factors may also play a role. How it happens An inflammatory response causes mucosal ulcers to grow in size and depth in the mucosal wall of the GI tract. Fibrosis and stiffening of the mucosal wall can occur. Fistulas can develop between bowel loops or adjoining organs. Healing lesions develop scar tissue, leading to strictures. What to look for The child may report a gradual onset of symptoms, marked by periods of remission and exacerbation:\u0081 Acute symptoms include steady, colicky pain in the RLQ (cramping); diarrhea and flatulence; fever; and bloody stool. \u0081 Chronic symptoms, which are more typical of the disease, are more persistent and less severe. These symptoms include diarrhea (four to six stools per day), pain in the RLQ, excess fat in stool, weight loss, weakness and fatigue, cramping, and abdominal dis- tention. Retardation in growth and physical development can also occur. What tests tell you Laboratory test findings indicate an increased WBC count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Other findings include hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and decreased hemoglobin level. A string thing Barium enema shows segments of stricture separated by (\"string sign\"). Sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy show patchy areas of inflammation. A biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Laboratory analysis to detect occult blood in stool is usually positive. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 484 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 2015 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.485GI DISORDERS Complications Complications of Crohn's disease include intestinal obstruction, fistula formation between the small bowel and bladder, perianal and perirectal abscesses and fistulas, intra-abdominal abscesses, bowel perforation, growth retardation, and toxic megacolon. A toxic outcome Toxic megacolon is an acute dilation of the colon secondary to severe inflammation of bowel mucosa. Signs and symptoms are spiking fever, acute abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. The bowel mucosa shreds, leading to hemorrhage and peritonitis, and may cause death. How it's treated The inflammatory response is controlled by the administration of corticosteroids, aminosalicylates, anti-infectives, antidiarrheal medications, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and immunosup- pressive agents. Give the bowel a rest Effective treatment requires nutritional support with high-protein, high-calorie, low-fiber foods and supplements with iron, zinc, folic acid, and vitamins. Enteral formulas may be used as supplements. TPN may be administered to give the bowel a rest for healing. A temporary fix Surgical treatment may involve a bowel resection for obstructions or fistulas or a total colectomy with ileostomy if the bowel perforates or toxic megacolon occurs. Surgery doesn't cure Crohn's disease but relieves symptoms temporarily until the next exacerbation. What to do The child with Crohn's disease may need multiple hospitalizations. Child interrupted Do everything possible to \"normalize\" the child's life during hos- pital stays. Maintain routines to the extent possible. Encourage the child to keep up with schoolwork, provide age-appropriate activities and diversions to maintain development and alleviate boredom, and encourage his family and friends to spend as much time as possible with the child. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Administer analgesics and antispasmodics to decrease abdomi-nal pain and corticosteroids to decrease bowel inflammation.\u0081 Withhold food and fluids, using parenteral nutrition in place of feeding to rest the bowel.

Hepatitis Hepatitis is a communicable, inflammatory condition of the liver; it can be acute or chronic. Hepatitis can be caused by several viruses, and the incubation period differs depending on the type of virus that causes it. Such disease processes as cancer and liver abscesses may also cause hepatitis. Neonatal hepatitis can occur in an infant born to a hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive mother. What causes it There are several different viruses that cause hepatitis. ABCs (and Ds) of hepatitis Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the most common type in children and is transmitted by person-to-person contact (fecal-oral route) or through the ingestion of contaminated food, milk, or water. A child is at an increased risk in day care centers and when traveling to areas with contaminated food or water. HBV is transmitted by direct contact with contaminated blood, secretions, and feces, most commonly through perinatal exposure from an HBV-positive mother. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted by exposure to blood or blood products, I.V. or intranasal drug use, and sexual contact, and may also be transmitted perinatally. HCV is most commonly transmitted through transfused blood from asymptomatic donors. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) occurs only in people who also have HBV and is transmitted by intimate contact with a person who also has HBV. The E and the G Hepatitis E virus (HEV), not reported in children in the United States, is transmitted by inadequate hand washing or contami-nated food and water. HEV is seen in countries with poor Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 486 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 486 5/22/14 8:17 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Need I say more?sanitation as the virus is shed in stool. Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is a newly recognized virus also not reported in children. HGV is transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, I.V. drug abuse, and sexual contact. How it happens Exposure to the virus or causative agent causes an inflam- matory reaction in the liver. Lesions develop and cause necrosis of hepatic cells and scarring. Blood flow becomes obstructed, causing engorgement and hepatomegaly. Bile ducts become obstructed and bile accumulates in the blood, causing jaundice. In mild forms of hepatitis, the liver cells regenerate and the patient recovers. In severe forms of hepatitis, the liver becomes necrotic and death occurs. What to look for Assessment findings are similar for the different types of hepa titis. Typically, signs and symptoms progress in several stages. Tired and irritable In the prodromal stage, the child complains of fatigue, anorexia, mild weight loss, malaise, irritability, headache, weakness, photo-phobia, and nausea with vomiting. Assessment reveals fever, the onset of clinical jaundice, dark-colored urine, and clay-colored stools. Children younger than age 2 years are commonly asymp-tomatic with HAV. Itchy and uncomfortable During the clinical jaundice stage, the child has itching, abdomi- nal pain, indigestion, skin rashes, and hives. Palpation reveals RUQ discomfort and an enlarged, tender liver. What tests tell you Elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine ami-notransferase, alkaline ESR and bilirubin levels are elevated, and prothrombin time is elongated. A view from the side A hepatitis profile, which identifies antibodies specific to the causative virus, establishes the type of viral hepatitis. A liver biopsy is performed if chronic hepatitis is suspected. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 487 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 487 5/22/14 8:17 PM Kluwer.

All that's left is failure without remission.Complications Complications of hepatitis include cirrhosis, liver cancer, chronic hepatitis, pancreatitis, myocarditis, pneumonia, aplastic anemia, and life-threatening fulminant hepatitis. No turning back Fulminant hepatitis causes unremitting liver failure with encephalopathy, which progresses to coma and usually leads to death within 2 weeks. Signs and symptoms of coma. Notice of necrosis A decrease in hepatomegaly is an ominous sign of tissue necro- sis. Children with HBV have a much greater chance of becoming chronic carriers than adults and of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. How it's treated Treatment of hepatitis is supportive and focuses on rest, comfort, and good nutrition. Such medications as diphenhydramine (Bena-dryl) are administered to decrease the inflammatory process and relieve itching from the rash. Interfering with hepatitis Alpha-interferon is administered for the treatment of HBV and HCV if the patient is older than age 18 years. Ribavirin (Virazole), a teratogenic drug, is administered for HCV. A liver transplant may be needed for end-stage HBV disease. Prevention of HBV is the treatment for HDV. Hepatitis prevention Immunoglobulin is administered within 2 weeks of exposure to HAV or HBV to prevent the disease. The neonate born to an HBV-positive mother should receive the HBV vaccine and hepati- tis B immunoglobulin within 12 hours of birth. Additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at ages 1 and 6 months. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 488 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 488 5/22/14 8:17 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.489GI DISORDERS A few needle sticks is a small price to pay. HAV vaccine is recommended for all children beginning at age 12 months and HBV vaccination is recommended for all neonates. When a child has hepatitis, it's the parents who need an education\u2014on everything from hand washing to recognizing signs of worsening disease.A boost of prevention The HAV vaccine is recommended as part of routine well- child care in areas where the disease is prevalent. The first dose is given between 12 and 18 months, followed by a booster 6 months later. Come one, come all The HBV vaccine is recommended for all neonates before they're discharged from the hospital. A second booster is given between 1 and 2 months, a third booster is given between 6 and 18 months. What to do Hepatitis is a frightening diagnosis for parents. Provide reassurance and assist parents in getting their questions answered. Prepare the child for blood draws and I.V. line insertions. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Promote comfort to decrease abdominal discomfort. A little here, a little there \u0081 Provide small, frequent meals and snacks to support nutrition. \u0081 Administer antiemetics to decrease nausea and antihistamines to decrease itching; avoid acetaminophen (Tylenol) and other drugs metabolized by the liver. \u0081 Limit activity to promote rest. Back to school \u0081 Educate the parents about the disease. \u0081 Teach the parents about preventive measures, such as immunizations, good hand-washing habits, and proper disposal of diapers; explain the need to avoid sharing contaminated items.\u0081 Instruct the parents to contact a health care provider before administering medications or over-the-counter prod- ucts (because of impaired liver function). \u0081 Instruct parents to watch for signs and symptoms that indicate worsening of hepatitis, leading to fulminant hepatitis. Hirschsprung's disease Hirschsprung's disease is the absence of parasympathetic ganglionic cells in a segment of the colon, usually at the distal end of the large intestine. The lack of nerve in- nervation causes an absence of, or alteration in, peri- stalsis in the affected part of the colon. (See A look at Hirschsprung's disease, page 490.)

The disease may coexist with other con-genital anomalies, particularly Down syndrome and anomalies of the urinary tract. How it happens As stool enters the affected part, it remains there until additional stool pushes it through. The affected part of the colon dilates; a mechanical obstruction may result. What to look for In a neonate, history commonly reveals a failure to pass me-conium and stool within the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. On inspection, the infant may have abdominal distention and easily palpable stool masses. When stool does pass through, it's liquid or ribbonlike.A look at Hirschsprung's disease Hirschsprung's disease is a congenital disorder of the large intestine characterized by the absence or marked reduction of parasympathetic ganglion cells in the colorectal wall.

He may exhibit signs of dehydration, including pallor, dry mucous membranes, and sunken eyes. What tests tell you \u0081 Rectal biopsy provides definitive diagnosis by showing the absence of ganglion cells.\u0081 Suction aspiration, using a small tube inserted into the rectum, also determines the absence of ganglion cells. \u0081 Full-thickness surgical biopsy under general anesthesia may be performed if findings from suction aspiration are inconclusive.\u0081 Rectal manometry reveals failure of the internal anal sphincter to relax and contract. \u0081 Abdominal X-rays show distention of the colon. Complications Disease progression causes the most complications, including severe diarrhea, bowel perforation, sepsis, incontinence, stricture formation, enterocolitis, and hypovolemic shock. In infants, the main cause of death is enterocolitis (when not treated), caused by fecal stagnation that leads to bacterial overgrowth, production of bacterial toxins, intestinal irritation, profuse diarrhea, hypovolemic shock, and perforation. How it's treated Surgery is the treatment of choice in these children and should be performed as soon as the child's fluid and electrolyte imbalances are stabilized. Out with the bad Laparoscopic surgery involves pulling the ganglionic segment of bowel through to the anus to remove the affected portion. Surgery is usually delayed until the infant is at least age 10 months. If a total obstruction is present, a temporary colostomy or ileostomy may be necessary to decompress the colon. Next, a second sur-gery is performed to remove the affected segment of bowel and close the ostomy. What to do The infant's parents will need a great deal of emotional support. Prepare them for each procedure, including surgeries, by offering thorough explanations and making sure that their questions are Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 491 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 491 5/22/14 8:17 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

Preoperative care \u0081 Administer I.V. fluids to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and prevent dehydration and shock.\u0081 Maintain NPO status and insert an NG tube for gastric decompression. Forced evacuation \u0081 Administer isotonic enemas (normal saline solution or mineral oil) to evacuate the bowels; don't administer tap water due to the risk of water intoxication. \u0081 Administer antibiotics (and an antibiotic enema) as ordered. Postoperative care After colostomy or ileostomy, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor fluid intake and output; an ileostomy is especially likely to cause excessive electrolyte loss. \u0081 Keep the area around the stoma clean and dry; use colostomy or ileostomy appliances to collect drainage.\u0081 Monitor for return of bowel sounds to begin diet. After corrective surgery, follow these steps: \u0081 Keep the wound clean and dry to prevent infection.\u0081 Don't use a rectal thermometer or suppositories. Bowel sounds = dinner bell \u0081 Begin oral feedings when active bowel sounds begin and NG drainage decreases.\u0081 Educate the parents about suture line care. \u0081 Teach the parents how to recognize the beginning signs of constipation, such as straining during defecation and a distended abdomen, fluid loss and dehydration (decreased urine output, sunken eyes, poor skin turgor), enterocolitis (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, sudden marked abdominal distention), and stric- tures (abdominal distention, constipation, vomiting).

Intussusception Intussusception is a telescoping or invagination of a bowel seg-ment into itself, the most common site being the ileocecal valve. It usually occurs at about age 6 months but can occur in children up to age 3 years and, rarely, in older children. It's three times more likely to occur in males than in females and is more likely to occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Intussusception can be fatal, especially if treatment is delayed for more than 24 hours. (See Understanding intussusception .) What causes it The cause of intussusception is unknown in most cases. It may result from polyps, hyperactive peristalsis, or an abnormal bowel Understanding intussusception In intussusception, a bowel section invaginates and is propelled along by peristalsis, pulling in more bowel. In this illustration, a portion of the cecum invaginates and is propelled into the large intestine. Intussus-ception typically produces edema, hemorrhage from venous 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.494GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS lining. It may also be linked to viral infections because seasonal peaks are noted (spring and summer). How it happens When a bowel segment invaginates, peristalsis propels it along the bowel, pulling more bowel along with it. Invagination causes inflammation and swelling at the affected site. Edema eventually causes obstruction and necrosis from occlusion of the blood supply to the bowel. What to look for The medical history may reveal intermittent attacks of colicky pain characterized by screaming, drawing knees to the chest, sweating, and grunting. Parents report vomitus containing bile or fecal material, which can lead to dehydration, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and metabolic alkalosis. They also describe the pas-sage of red, \"currant jelly-like\" stool containing mucus and blood. Tender to the touch Inspection and palpation may reveal a distended and tender abdomen with a palpable, sausage-shaped abdominal mass. Other clinical signs include fever, increased pulse, shallow respirations, and decreased blood pressure (shocklike state). What tests tell you \u0081 Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound or computed tomography show a soft tissue mass and signs of complete or partial obstruction. \u0081 Barium enema confirms colonic intussusception when it shows the characteristic coiled spring sign.\u0081 A WBC count as high as 15,000/\u00b5l indicates obstruction.\u0081 A WBC count higher than 15,000/\u00b5l indicates strangulation. \u0081 A WBC count higher than 20,000/\u00b5l indicates bowel infarction. Complications Without proper treatment, strangulation of the intestine may occur, with gangrene, shock, perforation, and peritonitis. These complications can be fatal. How it's treated An NG tube is inserted to decompress the intestine and minimize vomiting. Ten percent of children with intussusception may have spontaneous reduction of the bowel. Therapy may include hydro- static reduction or Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.495GI DISORDERS When time is of the essence, use caregiving opportunities to prepare the child for surgery.Forceful introduction During hydrostatic reduction, air pressure or a solution of barium or water-soluble contrast medium is introduced into the rectum. The force from the fluid or air moves invaginated bowel back into its original position. If at first you don't succeed . . . reduce or resect Surgery is indicated when hydrostatic reduction fails, intussusception recurs, or signs of shock or peritonitis are present. Manual reduction is attempted first by pulling the intussusception back through the bowel. If manual reduction fails, or if the bowel segment is gangrenous or strangulated, re- section of the affected bowel segment is performed. What to do Intussusception is a painful condition; onset of symptoms may be sudden and severe. The child may be inconsolable and the parents are likely to be terrified and distressed from seeing their infant or toddler in so much pain. Provide the parents with as much emotional support and reassur-ance as possible. Explain on the go Because intussusception is treated as an emergency, use caregiv- ing opportunities (during bedside care, medication administra-tion, transport to testing areas) to provide as much explanation as possible about tests and procedures, and make sure the parents' questions are answered. Music to soothe To the extent possible, allow the parents to remain with the child to comfort him (by holding him, stroking the child's face and hands, singing a soothing song). Better days ahead For the child who's old enough to understand, provide simple ex-planations as procedures are being performed, and reassure him that you're there to help him and he'll feel better soon. \u0081 Prepare for enema insertion (barium or water-soluble contrast medium) to confirm the diagnosis and reduce the invagination by hydrostatic pressure.\u0081 Monitor vital signs; a change in temperature may indicate sepsis. \u0081 Monitor intake and output to prevent dehydration and adminis- ter I.V. fluids as ordered.\u0081 Monitor NG tube output and replace volume lost, as ordered.\u0081 Administer pain medication as ordered.

All Rights Reserved.496GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS \u0081 For the child who has undergone hydrostatic reduction, monitor for the passage of stool (and barium, if used) to determine the need for surgery. Postoperative care After surgery, encourage the parents to stay with the child as much as possible. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Administer antibiotics as ordered to prevent infection. \u0081 Monitor the incision site for signs of infection, such as inflam- mation, drainage, and suture separation.\u0081 Monitor for the return of bowel sounds to allow advancement of the diet. \u0081 Continue to offer emotional support and encouragement to the parents. Pyloric stenosis Pyloric stenosis is hyperplasia (increased mass) and hypertrophy (increased size) of the circular muscle at the pylorus, the lower opening of the stomach leading to the duodenum. The increased mass and size of the muscle narrows the pyloric canal, preventing the stomach from emptying normally. Pyloric obstruction leads to vomiting and gastritis from prolonged filling of the stomach. It's most commonly seen in boys between ages 1 and 6 months. What causes it The exact cause of pyloric stenosis is unknown. It isn't an in- herited disorder but may be associated with malrotation, esopha-geal atresia, and anorectal malformations. How it happens Spasms of the pylorus muscle cause the narrowing of the passage-way between the stomach and duodenum. Swelling and inflam-mation further reduce the size of the lumen and could result in complete obstruction. Normal emptying of the stomach is pre- vented, resulting in vomiting and gastritis. What to look for Palpation reveals an olive-shaped bulge below the right costal margin and a distended upper abdomen. Waving and projecting The child experiences projectile vomiting during or shortly after feedings. The vomiting is preceded by reverse peristaltic waves (left to right) but not by nausea.

Symptoms of malnutrition and dehydration are present despite the child's apparent adequate intake of food. What tests tell you \u0081 Vomitus is positive for blood.\u0081 hypokalemia, and Abdominal ultrasound and endoscopy reveal a hypertrophied sphincter.\u0081 An upper GI series reveals delayed gastric emptying. Complications Complications of pyloric stenosis include malnutrition, dehydra- tion, infection, and metabolic alkalosis and failure to thrive. How it's treated The child remains on NPO status before surgery. I.V. fluids are administered to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances and prevent dehydration, and an NG tube is inserted and kept open for gastric decompression. Surgi- cal intervention consists of a pyloromyotomy performed by laparoscopy. What to do Provide the child with an age-appropriate explanation of all tests, procedures, and surgery. Make sure the parents' questions are answered. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor vital signs and intake and output to assess renal func- tion and check for dehydration.\u0081 Record the amount of vomitus as well as its frequency, charac-teristics, and relation to feedings. \u0081 Perform daily weight measurements on the same scale to assess growth.\u0081 Assess abdominal and cardiovascular status to detect early signs of compromise.\u0081 Position the child, preferably on his right side, to prevent aspi-ration of vomitus.

Going with the flow \u0081 Position the child on his right side, allowing gravity to help the flow of fluid through the pyloric valve; elevate the child's head after feeding. \u0081 Administer analgesics around the clock for pain management. \u0081 Teach the parents proper incision site care and to monitor for signs and symptoms of infection and dehydration. Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia are among the most serious congenital anomalies in neonates. They may develop separately but usually occur together. There's a higher incidence with prematurity and maternal polyhydramnios. An unhealthy relationship In tracheoesophageal fistula, an abnormal connection develops between the trachea and the esophagus. In esophageal atresia, the esophagus is closed off at some point, and food can't enter the stomach through the esophagus. Combo conditions These conditions may occur in several combinations and may be associated with other anomalies of the heart, anorectal area, or genitourinary system. (See Types of tracheoesophageal anomalies .) What causes it These conditions are a result of the failure of the embryonic esophagus and trachea to develop and separate correctly. How it happens In the fetus, there's a defective separation of the foregut into the trachea and esophagus at about 4 to 5 weeks' gestation. The esophagus fails to meet the stomach and ends in a blind pouch. What to look for At delivery, the neonate has frothy saliva in the mouth and chok-ing and coughing due to excessive secretions. With feeding, he experiences sudden coughing and gagging and shows signs of Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 498 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 498 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.499GI DISORDERS feedings coming out of nose and mouth. He may stop breathing and become cyanotic as the feeding is aspirated into the lungs. Three classic signs are cyanosis, choking, and coughing. Belly full of air Stomach distention occurs when air from the trachea enters the esophagus or the stomach directly (through a fistula). Aspiration pneumonia occurs when the esophagus joins the trachea and food regurgitates through the fistula into the lungs. What tests tell you A radiopaque catheter is inserted into the esophagus, and an X-ray is taken to see where the catheter goes or what obstruction it hits. Bronchoscopy is performed to visualize the fistula between the trachea and esophagus. Chest X-ray shows pneumonia and a dilated, air-filled upper esophageal pouch. Complications Complications include leaking at the anastomosis site, stric- tures, gastroesophageal reflux, feeding difficulties, and Types of tracheoesophageal anomalies Congenital malformations of the esophagus occur in about 1 in 4,000 live births.

How it's treated Tracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia require surgical correction and are usually surgical emergencies. (Insertion of an NG tube is impossible in a neonate with esophageal atresia.) A pump in the pouch A sump pump may be inserted in the esophageal pouch to remove accumulated secretions, reducing the risk of aspiration. A gastros-tomy tube may be placed to decompress the stomach. The child's respiratory status must be closely monitored to maintain a patent airway. I.V. fluids are administered to prevent dehydration, and the patient is placed on NPO status. Ligate and lengthen Surgical correction is performed to ligate fistulas and anastomose the esophagus to the stomach. Esophageal lengthening may be needed if the esophagus is too short to join the stomach. A chest tube may be inserted to drain intrapleural fluid and air. Antibiotics are administered to treat aspiration pneumonia. What to do Explain all procedures to the parents, make sure their questions are answered, and provide support and reassur-ance. Allow them to spend as much time as possible with their child. In addition: \u0081 Suction excessive secretions from the mouth and pharynx frequently, and elevate the neonate's head to prevent aspiration.\u0081 Maintain NPO status; begin I.V. fluids. \u0081 Don't allow the infant to suck on a pacifier; this increases saliva secretions. Postoperative care After surgery, involve the parents in the child's care to help com- fort the child, reassure the parents, and prepare them for caring for the child at home. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 An NG or OG tube is attached to low-suction or gravity drain- age; document the amount and character of the drainage at least every 4 hours.\u0081 Gastrostomy feedings may be given until the esophagus heals. Assess for distress \u0081 Monitor for signs of respiratory distress. \u0081 Monitor chest tube drainage and care of the chest tube site.

Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, recurrent inflammation of the colon and rectal mucosa with varying degrees of ulceration, bleeding, and edema. It usually begins in the rectum and sigmoid colon and may extend upward into the entire colon. What causes it Although the etiology of ulcerative colitis is unknown, it may be related to an abnormal immune response in the GI tract, pos-sibly associated with genetic factors. It's more prevalent among people of Jewish heritage and in higher socioeconomic groups. How it happens Vasoconstriction initiates an immune response, producing rup- tured capillary walls. The swollen bowel then develops ulcers. Healing ulcers can develop scar tissue, which results in stric- tures and obstructions. What to look for The hallmark sign of ulcerative colitis is frequent attacks of wa- tery, bloody diarrhea (in many cases containing pus and mucus) interspersed with asymptomatic remissions. However, one of the earliest signs may be growth failure due to poor nutritional intake resulting from anorexia. Other symptoms include urgency with defecation, abdominal pain, cramping, fever, and chills. What tests tell you Sigmoidoscopy confirms rectal involvement in most cases by showing increased mucosal friability, decreased mucosal detail, and thick inflammatory exudate. Colonoscopy may be used to determine the extent of the disease and look for evidence of inflammation. A biopsy performed during the colonoscopy can help confirm the diagnosis. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 501 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 501 8:17 PM 2015 Reserved.502GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS What's in the stool? Barium enema is used to evaluate the extent of the disease and detect complications. Stool specimen analysis reveals blood, pus, and mucus but no pathogenic organisms. Other laboratory tests reveal an elevated WBC count, an elevated ESR, decreased hemo- globin level and hematocrit, and elevated C-reactive protein. Complications Ulcerative colitis can lead to a variety of complications, depend- ing on the severity and site of inflammation. Nutritional deficien-cies are the most common complications, but the disease can also lead to perineal sepsis with anal fissure, anal fistula, perirectal deficiency anemia, coagulation defects, and toxic megacolon. There's also an increased risk of colorectal cancer. How it's treated The goals of treatment are to control inflammation, replace nutri- tional losses and blood volume, and prevent complications. Down with inflammation! Medical treatment begins with the administration of corticoste-roids or other anti-inflammatory agent, such as aminosalicylates, to decrease inflammation and probiotics to increase intestinal flora. Supportive treatment includes dietary therapy and bed rest. \u0081 Parenteral nutrition is used for children awaiting surgery or showing signs of dehydration and is intended to give the bowel a chance to rest. \u0081 A low-residue diet may be ordered for the patient with mild signs and symptoms.\u0081 Blood transfusions or iron supplements may be needed to cor-rect anemia.\u0081 Surgery, the treatment of last resort, is performed if the patient has toxic megacolon. (The most common surgical procedure is total proctocolectomy with ileostomy, which may cure the disease.) What to do Nursing care focuses on teaching the parents about diet, medica- tions, and stress reduction:\u0081 Encourage small, frequent meals of a diet low in bran and fiber- rich foods. (See Nutrition by culture .) \u0081 Stress the importance of compliance with the medication regimen.\u0081 Promote stress reduction through relaxation and distraction.

This results in vessel compression and ischemia. What causes it The twisting in volvulus may result from an anomaly of rotation, an ingested foreign body, or an adhesion. In some cases, the cause is unknown. How it happens A prolapsed portion of mesentery causes the bowel to become twisted. The twisted bowel is obstructed, leading to bowel disten-tion and decreased absorption of water and electrolytes. Vomiting also occurs due to the obstruction. A decreased blood supply to the affected bowel leads to necrosis. (See What happens in volvulus , page 504.) What to look for The child complains of severe abdominal pain and has bilious vomiting, which increases after feedings. Inspection reveals a distended abdomen with absent bowel sounds. The parents may report the passage of bloody stool.Cultured pearls Nutrition by culture Nutrition varies among cultures and religions because dietary practices differ. Children need a well-balanced diet for growth and development, especially children on specific diets. The nurse should do a comprehensive nutrition assessment and teach proper nutrition practices to enhance growth and development in children while respecting the cultural practices and beliefs of the family. Here are some tips on special cultural diet restrictions and characteristics: \u0081 If the child is a vegetarian, the nurse should know proper protein foods to substitute for the lack of meat in the diet.\u0081 Some Jewish children eat kosher meats that are typically high in sodium, which may be a problem in certain disease processes.\u0081 In many cultures, such as Hispanic, Asian, and Black cultures, use of herbal preparations in their diets and as medici-nal treatments is common. The nurse should be aware of the types of preparations the child is eating or taking. Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd 503 Meadows-Oliver_Ch12.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.504GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS What tests tell you Abdominal X-rays show multiple distended bowel loops and a large bowel without gas. An upper GI series and barium enema help confirm the diagnosis. Blood chemistry indicates hyperkale- mia and hypocalcemia. Complications Without immediate treatment, volvulus can lead to strangulation of the twisted bowel loop, ischemia, infarction, perforation, and fatal peritonitis. Chain of events Short gut syndrome may develop after surgical correction if an extensive area of bowel is removed. This syndrome results in de-creased absorptive surface area which, in turn, leads to decreased absorption of nutrients.What happens in volvulus Although volvulus may occur anywhere in a bowel segment long enough to twist, the most com- mon site, as the illustration depicts, is the sigmoid colon, causing edema within the closed loop and obstruction at its proximal and distal ends. Normal bowel segment 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.505QUICK QUIZ How it's treated If the bowel is distended but viable, surgery consists of detorsion (untwisting). If the bowel is necrotic, surgery includes resection anastomosis. Prolonged TPN and I.V. administration of anti- biotics are usually necessary. What to do The child and his parents will need reassurance because the child may be in extreme pain. Because tests may be required on an emergency basis, tell the child what's being done, step-by-step, as each test is being performed. When the child is relatively comfortable and able to listen, prepare him for surgery with age-appropriate explanations about what will happen. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor bowel sounds and bowel movements. \u0081 Give pain medications as ordered.\u0081 Maintain NPO status until surgery is performed; begin adminis-tration of I.V. fluids to prevent dehydration.\u0081 Insert an NG tube to decompress the stomach. Postoperative care \u0081 Maintain the administration of I.V. fluids until the bowel has healed and bowel sounds return.\u0081 Monitor the use of opioid analgesics that decrease GI motility. \u0081 Educate the parents about preventing constipation (for example, increasing the intake of oral fluids, increasing activity, adding high-fiber foods to the diet, and the proper use of stool softeners).

All Rights Reserved.506GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS 2. A 12-year-old boy is admitted to the pediatric unit with complaints of RLQ abdominal pain and vomiting. When the nurse checks on the child 2 hours later, he states that the pain has stopped. The nurse should suspect that: A. he had indigestion, which has been relieved. B. he's afraid of going to surgery.C. his appendix has ruptured.D. he has irritable bowel syndrome. Answer: C. Abdominal pain in the RLQ and vomiting are symp- toms of appendicitis. When the appendix ruptures, a sudden relief of pain occurs, after which the pain resumes more severely. 3. An 18-month-old child is admitted to the pediatric unit with intussusception. As the nurse is preparing the child for a barium contrast reduction, he passes a soft brown stool. What should the nurse do? A. Notify the doctor in order to cancel the procedure. B. Prepare the child for emergency surgery.C. Take vital signs and monitor for abdominal sounds.D. Administer an enema to clear the rectal area for testing. Answer: A. Passing a normal-looking brown stool indicates that the child no longer has an invaginated section of bowel. 4. The nurse is completing discharge teaching for a child and her parents regarding her diet to treat celiac disease. Which meal selection would be appropriate for this child? A. A bologna sandwich on whole wheat bread, a chocolate chip cookie, and a glass of milk B. A vegetable pizza, an apple, and a diet cola C. A corn tortilla with hamburger and cooked vegetables and a glass of fruit juice D. A hot dog on a roll, celery and carrot sticks, and a chocolate milk shake Answer: C. Celiac disease is intolerance to wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Some of these children also have lactose intolerance, especially when they have an acute episode of the disease.

Along with the nervous system, the endocrine system regulates and integrates the body's metabolic activities. (See Endocrine system components , page 508.) Too little, too much Altered endocrine function involves a hyposecretion or hyper- secretion of hormones, which affects the body's metabolic processes and function. Nursing care involves measures to support hormonal secretion, such as hormone replace- ment, or curtail secretion, such as radiation therapy. Inborn errors of metabolism involve a biochemical alteration that affects metabolism. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 507 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 507 PM Reserved.508ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Endocrine system components Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream to regulate body function. This illustration shows the locations of the major endocrine glands (except Thymus Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.509ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY The pituitary may be petite, but it's the master gland of the endocrine gland ) rests in the sella turcica, a depression in the sphe- noid bone at the base of the brain. Small but mighty This pea-sized gland connects with the hypothalamus via the infundibulum, from which it receives chemical and nervous stimulation. The pituitary has two main regions: anterior pituitary posterior pituitary. Prolific producer The anterior pituitary, also called adenohypophysis , makes up 80% of the pituitary gland. It produces seven hormones: growth pituitary, , makes up about 20% of the pituitary gland. It serves as a storage area for antidiuretic hormone (ADH), or vasopressin , and oxytocin, which are pro- duced by the hypothalamus. Thyroid gland The thyroid gland lies directly below the larynx, partially in front of the trachea. Its two lateral lobes\u2014one on either side of the trachea\u2014join with a narrow tissue bridge, called the isthmus , to give the gland its butterfly shape. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 509 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 509 Rights Reserved.510ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Thyroid lobe duo The two lobes of the thyroid gland function as one unit to produce the hormones triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4), and calcitonin. T3 and T 4 are collectively referred to as thyroid hormones (THs), the body's major metabolic hormones. They regulate metabolism by speeding cellular respiration. The calcitonin-calcium connection Calcitonin maintains the blood calcium level by inhibiting the release of calcium from bone. Secretion of calcitonin is con-trolled by the calcium concentration of the fluid surrounding the thyroid cells. Parathyroid glands The parathyroid glands are the body's smallest known endocrine glands. These glands are embedded on the posterior surface of the thyroid, one in each corner. PTH: A parathyroid production Working together as a single gland, the parathyroid glands pro-duce parathyroid hormone (PTH). The main function of PTH is to help regulate the blood's calcium balance. This hormone adjusts the rate at which calcium and magnesium ions are removed from urine. PTH also increases the movement of phosphate ions from the blood to urine for excretion. Adrenal glands There are two adrenal glands in the body; each gland is situated on top of a kidney. These almond-shaped glands contain two distinct structures\u2014the adrenal cortex and the medulla\u2014 glands. Adrenal cortex The adrenal cortex is the large outer layer of the adrenal gland and forms the bulk of the gland. It has three zones, or cell layers: zona glomerulosa , the aldosterone zona fasciculata , the middle the glucocorticoids cortisol (hydrocortisone), cortisone, and corticosterone as well as small the sex hormones androgen and estrogen zona reticularis , the innermost zone, which mainly some sex hormones.

I deserve a raise!Adrenal medulla The adrenal medulla, or inner layer of the adrenal gland, func- tions as part of the sympathetic nervous system and produces two catecholamines: epinephrine norepinephrine. A leading role Because catecholamines play an important role in the autonomic nervous system, the adrenal medulla is con-sidered a neuroendocrine structure. Pancreas The pancreas, a triangular gland, is nestled in the curve of the duodenum, stretching horizontally behind the stomach and extending to the spleen. The pancreas performs endo- crine and exocrine functions. Acinar cells make up most of the gland and regulate pancreatic exocrine function. Clusters of islets The endocrine cells of the pancreas are called the islet cells , or islets of Langerhans . These cells exist in clusters and are found scattered among the acinar cells. The islets contain alpha, beta, and delta cells that produce important hormones:\u0081 Alpha cells produce glucagon.\u0081 Beta cells produce insulin. \u0081 Delta cells produce somatostatin. Gonads The gonads include the ovaries in the female and the testes in the male. Ovaries The ovaries are oval-shaped glands in females located on either side of the uterus. They produce ova (eggs) as well as estrogen and progesterone. It's a girl thing Estrogen and progesterone are responsible for:\u0081 promoting the development and maintenance of female sex characteristics \u0081 regulating the menstrual cycle \u0081 maintaining the uterus for pregnancy\u0081 preparing the mammary glands Reserved.512ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Testes The testes are located in the scrotum. They produce the male hormone testosterone, which stimulates and maintains male sex characteristics. They also produce spermatozoa. Hormones Hormones are complex chemical substances that trigger or regulate the activity of an organ or a group of cells. They include pituitary hormones, THs, adrenal hormones, and androgens and estrogens. (See Effects of altered hormonal function .) Pituitary hormones Pituitary hormones include the anterior pituitary FSH, LH, and prolactin) and the posterior pituitary hormones (ADH and oxytocin). Each of these hormones has a particular function: \u0081 GH, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, affects most body tissues. It triggers growth by increasing protein synthesis and fat mobilization and decreases carbohydrate use. \u0081 TSH is secreted by follicles to mature and secrete estrogen in the female. In males, it stimulates development of the seminiferous tubules.\u0081 LH, secreted by pituitary gland, produces the rup-ture of the follicle, which results in the discharge of a mature ovum in the female. In the male, it stimulates the production of androgens, particularly testosterone.\u0081 Prolactin is the is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It controls the concentration of body fluids by altering the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to water.\u0081 Oxytocin, secreted by the posterior pituitary gland, stimulates the of the uterus and the letdown reflex in lactating women. Thyroid hormones The THs are T 3 and T 4. These hormones are necessary for nor- mal growth and development and act on many tissues to increase metabolic activity and protein synthesis.

Together, aldosterone, angiotensin II, and renin are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension.\u0081 Androgens are male sex hormones; they promote male traits, especially secondary sex characteristics, such as facial hair and a low-pitched voice. \u0081 Estrogens are responsible for the development of female sex characteristics.Hormone Hypofunction Hyperfunction hormone secretion\u0081 3 \u0081 Hypothyroidism\u0081 Myxedema\u0081 Hashimoto thyroiditis\u0081 Greatly reduced general growth (extent depends on age at which deficiency occurs)\u0081 Mental retardation (in infants)\u0081 Exophthalmic sexual function\u0081 Cushing's syndrome\u0081 Severe impairment of growth with slowing in skeletal maturationEffects of altered hormonal function Reserved.515ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY Pancreatic hormones The islets of Langerhans are small clusters of endocrine cells in the pancreas. These structures contain cells that produce insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin: \u0081 Insulin: a hormone that raises the blood glucose level by trigger- ing the breakdown of glycogen to glucose\u0081 Glucagon: lowers the blood glucose level by stimulating the con-version of glucose to glycogen \u0081 Somatostatin: inhibits the release of GH, corticotropin, and certain other hormones Hormone release and transport Although all hormone release results from endocrine gland stimu- lation, release patterns of hormones vary of PTH (by the parathyroid gland) and prolactin (by the anterior pituitary) occurs fairly evenly throughout the day.\u0081 Corticotropin (secreted by anterior pituitary) and cortisol (secreted by the adrenal cortex) are released in spurts in response to body rhythm cycles; levels of these hormones peak in the morning.\u0081 Secretion of insulin by the pancreas has both steady and spo-radic release patterns. Hormonal action When a hormone reaches its target site, it binds to a specific receptor on the cell membrane or within the cell. Polypeptides and some amines bind to membrane receptor sites. The smaller, more lipid-soluble steroids and THs diffuse through the cell mem- brane and bind to intracellular receptors. Right on target! After binding occurs, each hormone produces unique physiologic changes, depending on its target site and its specific action at that site. A particular hormone may have different effects at different target sites. Hormonal regulation To maintain the body's delicate equilibrium, a feedback mecha- nism regulates hormone production and secretion. The mecha-nism involves hormones, blood chemicals and metabolites, and the nervous system. The feedback mechanism may be simple or complex. For normal function, each gland must contain enough appro- priately programmed secretory cells to release active hormone on Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 515 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 515 5/22/14 8:34 PM Reserved.516ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Unsupervised cells Secretory cells need supervision. A secretory cell can't sense on its own when to release the hormone or how much to release. It gets this information from sensing and signaling systems that integrate many messages. Together, stimulatory and inhibitory signals actively control the rate and duration of hormone release. It's nice to be recognized When released, the hormone travels to target cells, where a re- ceptor molecule recognizes it and binds to it. The sensitivity of a target cell depends on how many receptors it has for a particular site. The more receptor sites, the more sensitive the target cell. Diagnostic tests Diagnostic tests are used to assess endocrine system problems and metabolic function in the pediatric population:\u0081 Blood glucose tests are used to diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabe- tes mellitus. Blood glucose tests commonly used for the pediatric patient include the fasting blood glucose test and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\u0081 Growth hormone tests are used to determine pituitary function. The human growth hormone (hGH) test helps detect hypopituita-rism, whereas the growth hormone suppression test is used to diagnose pituitary hyperfunction.\u0081 Neonatal screening , which began in the 1960s, is now per- formed in every state and may consist of tests for a variety of diseases. Typically, neonatal screens are performed for commonly occurring diseases that may cause severe mental retardation or death without early detection and treatment. These tests are all done by dried filter paper blood spots. A very small amount of blood is required and is usually obtained by a heel stick. An example of endocrine and metabolic tests that may be screened for during newborn screening include phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup and congenital hypothyroidism.\u0081 Thyroid function tests are used to determine thyroid function and include T 4 and T 3 studies. \u0081 Radioimmunoassay is a test used to measure minute quantities of hormones. Glucose, fasting plasma The fasting plasma glucose test (also known as the fasting blood sugar test ) is commonly used to screen for diabetes mellitus. It measures plasma glucose levels after an 8-hour fast. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 516 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 516 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.517DIAGNOSTIC TESTS To fast or not to fast In the fasting state, plasma glucose levels decrease, stimulating the release of the hormone glucagon. Glucagon then acts to raise plasma glucose by accelerating glycogenolysis, stimulating glyco- neogenesis, and inhibiting glycogen synthesis. Normally, secretion of insulin checks this rise in glucose levels. In diabetes, however, absence or deficiency of insulin allows persistently high glucose levels. And the level is . . . The normal range for fasting plasma glucose varies according to the laboratory procedure. Normal values after a fast of at least 8 hours differ according to the age of the child: \u0081 premature neonates\u201440 to 65 mg/dl (SI, 2.2 to 3.6 mmol/L) \u0081 young children (birth to age 2 years)\u201460 to 110 mg/dl (SI, 3.3 to 6.1 mmol/L)\u0081 children (ages 2 to 18 years)\u201460 to 100 mg/dl (SI, 3.3 to 5.6 mmol/L). Glucose tells all A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher obtained on two or more occasions confirms provisional diabetes mellitus. An impaired blood glucose level is 125 mg/dl. A borderline or transiently elevated level requires a 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose test or an OGTT to confirm the diagnosis. Nursing considerations \u0081 Explain the procedure to the parents and the child, and en- courage the parents to stay with the child.\u0081 Determine how long the child must fast. \u0081 Determine if the timing of the patient's medication will interfere with the test results and withhold medication if indicated. Backup plan \u0081 Apply a topical anesthetic (when possible) to two spots so an alternate puncture site will be available if the first one isn't successful. \u0081 Specify on the laboratory request the time the patient last ate, the sample collection time, and the time he received the last pre-test dose of insulin (if applicable). Glucose tolerance, oral The OGTT measures carbohydrate metabolism after ingestion of a challenge dose of glucose. A 2-hour OGTT is typically done to diagnose diabetes mellitus in children. (See Administering oral glucose solutions , page Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 517 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.518ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Small rewards, such as stickers, can help make the five needle sticks needed for blood glucose testing a little sweeter.Up to the challenge? The body absorbs the challenge dose rapidly, causing plasma glucose levels to rise and peak within 30 minutes to 1 hour. The pancreas responds by secreting more insulin, causing glucose levels to return to normal after 2 to 3 hours. During this period, plasma and urine glucose levels are monitored to assess insulin secretion and the body's ability to metabolize glucose. Occasionally, glucose levels are monitored for an additional 2 to 3 hours to aid in the diagnosis of hypogly- cemia and malabsorption syndrome. A little intolerant Some patients with diabetes may have fasting plasma glucose levels in the normal range; however, insufficient secretion of insulin after ingestion of carbohydrates causes plasma glucose levels to rise sharply and return to normal slowly. This decreased tolerance for glucose helps confirm diabetes. Nursing considerations Explain to the child and his parents that the test usually re- quires five blood samples and five urine specimens. Provide the child with coping mechanisms and help him deal with the multiple blood draws by giving him a small reward, such as a sticker, after each blood draw. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Instruct the parents that the child must fast for 8 to 12 hours before the test because the first blood test is a fasting glucose level.\u0081 Send blood and urine samples to the laboratory immediately, or refrigerate them.Administering oral glucose solutions The oral glucose load in a glucose tolerance test usually varies from 50 to 100 g. The American Diabetes Association recommends a glucose dose of 40 g/m2 of body surface area, as calculated by a nomogram based on height and weight. Other authorities advocate a glucose load of 1.75 g/kg of body weight, which is especially useful in testing pediatric patients. Glucose in disguise Many patients become nauseated after drinking the overly sweet glucose solution. One way to make the solution more palatable is to dissolve it in water, flavor it with lemon juice, and chill it. Another way is to substitute Glucola, a carbonated drink, or Gel-a-dex, a cherry-flavored gelatin, for All Rights Reserved.519DIAGNOSTIC TESTS \u0081 Specify blood and urine collection times and the time the child last ate.\u0081 As appropriate, record the time that the child received his last pretest dose of insulin or oral antidiabetic drug. Blood totals \u0081 If the patient is an infant or young child, keep an ongoing record of repeated specimen collection and a total of the amount of blood collected. \u0081 As ordered, resume administration of medications withheld before the test. Growth hormone, human The hGH test is used to detect hypopituitarism. Also known as growth hormone and somatotropin , hGH is a protein secreted by the anterior pituitary and is the primary regulator of human growth. Children generally have higher hGH levels than adults; these levels can range from undetectable to 16 ng/ml (SI, 16 mcg/L). The hGH test, a quantitative analysis of plasma hGH levels, is usually performed as part of an anterior pituitary stimulation or suppression test. The lowdown on levels Increased hGH levels may indicate a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor (commonly an adenoma), which causes gigantism in chil-dren and acromegaly in adults and adolescents. The highs . . . Patients with diabetes mellitus sometimes have elevated hGH levels without acromegaly. Suppression testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. . . . and the lows Pituitary infarction, metastatic disease, and tumors may reduce hGH levels. Dwarfism may be caused by low hGH levels, but confirmation of the diagnosis requires stimulation testing with arginine or insulin. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for the test with a simple, developmentally ap- propriate explanation. Tell the child and his parents that another sample may have to be drawn the following day for comparison. Explain to the parents that the laboratory requires at least 2 days of samples for analysis. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 519 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 519 5/22/14 8:34 PM Rights Reserved.520ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS As a pituitary- based steroid, I'm off-limits before a growth hormone test. I do my job so well that I could alter the results.In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Withhold all medications that affect hGH levels, such as pituitary-based steroids, as ordered. If these medications must be continued, note this on the laboratory request. \u0081 Make sure the patient is relaxed and recumbent for 30 minutes before the test because stress and physical activity elevate hGH levels. Explain that the child must fast and limit physical activity for 10 to 12 hours before the test. \u0081 Between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. on 2 consecutive days, or as ordered, draw venous blood and send it to the laboratory. Growth hormone suppression The growth hormone suppression test, also known as the glucose loading test , is used to diagnose pituitary hyperfunction. It evaluates excessive baseline levels of hGH from the anterior pituitary by measuring the secretory response to a loading dose of glucose. Failure to suppress Normally, hGH raises plasma glucose and fatty acid concentra- tions; in response, insulin secretion increases to counteract these effects. A glucose load should suppress hGH secretion. In a patient with excessive hGH levels, the failure to suppress hGH indicates anterior pituitary dysfunction and confirms a diagnosis of acromegaly or gigantism. Glucose normally suppresses hGH to levels ranging from undetectable to 3 ng/ml (SI, 3 mcg/L) in 30 minutes to 2 hours. In a patient with active acromegaly, basal hGH levels are elevated to 75 ng/ml (SI, 75 mcg/L) and aren't suppressed to less than 5 ng/ml (SI, 5 mcg/L) during the test. In children, rebound stimulation may occur after 2 to 5 hours. Rest and repeat When the hGH levels are unchanged or increased in response to glucose loading, hGH hypersecretion is indicated and may confirm suspected acromegaly or gigantism. This response may be verified by repeating the test after a 1-day rest. Nursing considerations Explain the test to the child and his parents. Tell the child that he may experience nausea after drinking the glucose solution, and prepare him for the needle sticks. In addition: \u0081 Withhold all steroids; if these or other medications must be con- tinued, note this on the laboratory request.

Guthrie screening The Guthrie screening test, also known as the phenylalanine test , is a screening method used to detect elevated levels of serum phe-nylalanine, a naturally occurring amino acid essential for growth and nitrogen balance. Metabolic upset Elevated levels of phenylalanine may indicate PKU, a metabolic disorder inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. An infant with PKU usually has normal phenylalanine levels at birth, but after he begins feeding with breast milk or formula (both of which con- tain phenylalanine), levels gradually rise because of a deficiency of the liver enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. The resulting accumulation of phenylalanine, phenylpyruvic acid, and other metabolites hinders normal development of central nervous system cells, causing mental retardation. Three's a charm The serum phenylalanine screening test detects abnormal phe- nylalanine levels through the growth rate of Bacillus subtilis , an organism that needs phenylalanine to thrive. To ensure accurate results, the test must be performed after 3 full days (preferably 4 days) of breast milk or formula feeding. (In some states, a pre-liminary test is required 25 hours after birth.) Danger ahead Growth of B. subtilis on the filter paper indicates that serum phenylalanine levels are high enough to overcome the antagonist. Such a positive result suggests the possibility of PKU; diagnosis requires exact serum phenylalanine measurement and urine testing. A positive screening test may also result from hepatic disease, galactosemia (an inherited, autosomal-recessive disor-der of galactose metabolism), or delayed development of certain enzyme systems. (See Confirming PKU .) Nursing considerations Explain the test to the parents. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Perform a heel stick and allow the blood to drip onto the filter paper, filling each circle. \u0081 Reassure the parents of a child who may have PKU that early detection and continuous treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet can prevent permanent mental retardation.Confirming PKU After the Guth- rie screening test detects the possible presence of PKU, serum phenylalanine and tyrosine levels are mea-sured to confirm diagnosis. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. If this enzyme is absent, increas-ing phenylala-nine levels with concomitant decreasing tyrosine levels indicate PKU. Samples are obtained by venipuncture. Serum phenyl-alanine levels greater than 4 mg/dl and Reserved.522ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS \u0081 Note the infant's name and birth date and the date of the first breast milk or formula feeding on the laboratory request; send the sample to the laboratory immediately. Neonatal galactosemia Galactosemia is a genetic disorder. A patient lacks the liver enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltrans- levels remain abnormally high. Ultimately, galactosemia may cause hepatomegaly, kidney failure, cata-racts, or brain damage. If the disorder goes untreated, death may result in 75% of infants with the disorder. From sea to shining sea The galactosemia test is mandatory in all 50 states. To detect galactosemia, two tests may be run on the dried filter paper blood spot sample: First, the level of galactose in the blood is determined. If this test is abnormally high (usually considered total galactose levels greater than 10 mg/dl), a Beutler assay is per-formed on the sample to measure GALT enzyme activity. Where's the GALT? Galactosemia is diagnosed if there's no detectable GALT enzyme activity. After the positive diagnosis of galactosemia is made, treatment must begin immediately. Nursing considerations \u0081 Screening will provide the best results if it's done after the infant has received a milk-based feeding.\u0081 Be sure to indicate the infant's feeding and blood transfusion status on the filter paper blood sample. \u0081 Protect the filter paper blood sample from heat, which may damage the GALT enzyme. (See Galactosemia interference .) Neonatal T 4 and TSH blood-spot test Mandatory in all 50 states, a T 4 test is performed as part of the neonatal screening with the sample placed as a blood spot on filter paper. A low T 4 level (less than 6 mg/dl) must be followed by a TSH level, which may be performed on the same blood sample or from a separate sample. (See Collecting a filter paper sample .)Galactosemia interference Factors that may alter galactose-mia test results include:\u0081 use of aspirin, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, vitamin deriva-tives, primaquine, enzyme activity pre-cipitate hemolytic episodes\u0081 performing the test after a hemo-lytic episode or a blood transfusion, which can cause false-negative results\u0081 failure to use a collection tube containing the proper antico-agulant or to adequately mix the sample and anticoagulant\u0081 hemolysis caused by rough handling of the sample.

All Rights Reserved.523DIAGNOSTIC TESTS The birth surge Also known as the neonatal thyrotropin test , the neonatal TSH test confirms congenital hypothyroidism. TSH levels normally surge after birth and trigger a rise in TH, which is essential for neurologic development. At age 1 to 2 days, TSH levels are nor- mally 25 to 30 \u00b5IU/ml (SI, 25 to 30 mU/L). Thereafter, levels are normally less than 25 \u00b5IU/ml (SI, 25 mU/L). Failure to respond In primary congenital hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland doesn't respond to TSH stimulation, which results in lower TH levels and higher TSH levels. Early detection and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism are critical to prevent mental retardation and cretinism. Neonatal TSH levels must be interpreted in light of T 4 con- centrations. Elevated TSH that's accompanied by decreased T 4 indicates primary congenital hypothyroidism. Depressed TSH and depressed T 4 may be present in secondary congenital hypothyroid- ism. When TSH is normal and is accompanied by depressed T 4, hypothyroidism due to a congenital defect or transient congenital hypothyroidism due to prematurity or prenatal hypoxia may be the cause. A complete thyroid workup must be done to confirm the cause of hypothyroidism before treatment can begin. (See Neonatal TSH interference .)Advice from the experts Collecting a filter paper sample To collect a specimen for neonatal TSH test- ing using the filter paper method, gather the following equipment and follow the easy steps below. Equipment \u0081 Alcohol swabs\u0081 Sterile lancet\u0081 Specially marked filter paper\u0081 Labels\u0081 GlovesSteps \u0081 Assemble the necessary equipment, wash your hands thoroughly, and put on gloves.\u0081 Wipe the infant's heel with an alcohol swab and then dry it thoroughly with a gauze pad. \u0081 Perform a heel stick and squeeze the infant's heel gently, filling the circles on the filter paper with blood, while making sure the blood satu-rates the paper.\u0081 Gently apply pressure with a gauze pad to ensure hemostasis at the puncture site.\u0081 Allow the filter paper to dry, label it appro-priately, and send it to the laboratory. Neonatal TSH interference Several factors may alter TSH levels, or the results of tests used to mea- sure TSH levels in the neonate:\u0081 Corticoste-roids, T 3, TSH injection raise TSH levels.\u0081 Failure to let a filter paper sample dry completely may alter results.\u0081 Rough han-dling of a serum sample may cause hemoly-sis, which may alter results.

A sample is sent for T 4 and TSH levels. Perform a venipuncture or heel stick, collect and label the sample, and send it to the laboratory immediately. Thyroxine test T4 is an amine secreted by the thyroid gland in response to TSH from the pituitary and, indirectly, to thyrotropin-releasing hor-mone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Cons, pros, and suspects The rate of secretion is normally regulated by a complex sys-tem of negative and positive feedback involving the thyroid, the anterior pituitary, and the hypothalamus. T 4 is the suspected precursor (or prohormone) of T 3 and is converted to T 3 mainly in the liver and kidneys. The T 4 that binds Only a fraction of T 4 (about 0.3%) circulates freely in the blood; the rest binds strongly to plasma proteins, primarily to T 4- binding globulin (TBG). This minute fraction of free-circulating T 4 is responsible for the clinical effects of thyroid hormone. TBG binds so tenaciously that T 4 survives in the plasma for a relatively long time, with a half-life of about 6 days. This test measures the total circulating T 4 level when TBG is normal. More testing ahead Serum T 4 testing is performed to evaluate thyroid function and to monitor thyroid replacement therapy. Abnormally elevated levels of T 4 are consistent with pri- mary and secondary hyperthyroidism, including excessive T 4 (levothyroxine [Synthroid]) replacement therapy. Overt signs of hyperthyroidism require further testing, and in doubtful cases of hypothyroidism, the TSH or TRH test may be indicated. (See Thyroxine levels in children .) Nursing considerations Explain the test to the child and his parents. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 As ordered, withhold medications that may interfere with test results. If these medications must be continued, note this on the laboratory request. (If the test is being performed to monitor thyroid therapy, the patient should continue to receive daily thyroid supplements.) \u0081 Perform a venipuncture, collect a sample, and send the sample to the laboratory immediately.Thyroxine levels in children T4 levels change as the child grows:\u0081 cord blood\u20147.4 to 13 mcg/dl (SI, 95 to 168 nmol/L)\u0081 younger than age 1 month\u20147 to 22.6 mcg/dl (SI, 90 to 292 nmol/L)\u0081 ages 1 month to 1 year\u20147.2 to 16.5 mcg/dl (SI, 93 to 213 nmol/L) \u0081 ages 1 to 5 years\u20147.3 to 15 mcg/dl (SI, 94 to 194 nmol/L)\u0081 ages 5 to 10 years\u20146.4 to 13.3 mcg/dl (SI, 83 to 192 nmol/L)\u0081 ages 10 to 15 years\u20145.6 to 11.7 mcg/dl (SI, 72 to 151 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. Rights Reserved.525DIAGNOSTIC TESTS When it comes to potency, T3 has T4 beat. Its effect on body metabolism dominates the effect of T4.Triiodothyronine test (serum) The T 3 test is a highly specific immunoassay that measures total serum content of T 3 to investigate clinical indications of thyroid dysfunction. It helps diagnose T 3 toxicosis, hypothy- roidism, or hyperthyroidism and helps monitor the course of thyroid replacement therapy. T3 is the more potent thyroid hormone. At least 50% and as much as 90% of T 3 is thought to be derived from T 4. The remaining 10% or more is secreted directly by the thyroid gland. Like T 4 secretion, T 3 secretion occurs in response to TSH released by the pituitary and, secondarily, to TRH from the hypothalamus. A little T 3 goes a long way Although T 3 is present in the bloodstream in minute quantities and is metabolically active for only a short time, its impact on body metabolism dominates that of T 4. T3 binds less firmly to TBG, so it persists in the bloodstream for a short time; half of it disappears in about 1 day, whereas half of T 4 remains for 6 days. It's all on the level Normally, serum T 3 levels in children are: \u0081 neonate\u201470 to 260 ng/dl (SI, 1.16 to 4 nmol/L)\u0081 children ages 1 to 5 years\u2014100 to 260 ng/dl (SI, 1.54 to 4 nmol/L) \u0081 children ages 5 to 10 years\u201490 to 240 ng/dl (SI, 1.39 to 3.7 nmol/L)\u0081 children ages 10 to 15 years\u201480 to 210 ng/dl (SI, 1.23 to 3.23 nmol/L). A tandem rise Serum T 3 and T 4 levels usually rise and fall in tandem. However, in T 3 toxicosis, only T 3 levels rise, whereas total and free T 4 levels remain normal. T 3 toxicosis occurs in patients with Graves' disease, toxic adenoma, or toxic nodular goiter. T 3 levels also surpass T 4 levels in patients receiving thyroid re- placement containing more T 3 than T 4. In iodine-deficient areas, the thyroid may produce larger amounts of the more cellularly active T 3 than T 4 in an effort to maintain the euthyroid state. Nursing considerations Explain the test to the child and his parents, and allow a parent to be present during the venipuncture. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 As ordered, withhold medications that may influence thyroid function, such as steroids and propranolol (Inderal). If such Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 525 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.526ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS medications must be continued, record this information on the laboratory request.\u0081 Perform a venipuncture, collect the sample, and send it to the laboratory immediately. \u0081 If a patient must receive thyroid preparations, such as T 3 (liothyronine [Triostat]), note the time of drug administration on the laboratory request. Treatments and procedures Common treatments and procedures used in the care of a child with an endocrine and metabolic system disorder include radioac-tive iodine ( 131I) therapy and thyroidectomy. 131I therapy A form of radiation therapy, 131I therapy is used to treat hyper- thyroidism in children, particularly Graves' disease. It shrinks functioning thyroid tissue, decreasing circulating TH levels. After oral ingestion, 131I is rapidly absorbed and concentrated in the thyroid as if it were normal iodine, resulting in acute radia-tion thyroiditis and gradual thyroid atrophy. 131I causes symptoms to subside after about 3 weeks and exerts its full effect only after 3 to 6 months. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure and check the patient's history for allergies to iodine. Expecting a glow The idea of ingesting a radioactive material may be frightening to the child and his parents, especially when they hear about the precautions that must be taken. Reas- sure the child and his parents that this treatment will affect only the thyroid and that all the radioactive material will be excreted from the body. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Unless contraindicated, instruct the patient to stop TH antagonists 4 to 7 days before 131I administration because these drugs reduce the sensitivity of thyroid cells to radiation. \u0081 Tell the child to fast overnight because food may delay 131I absorption. Until my nurse explained my 131I treatment, I thought I was going to be Radioactive Man! Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 526 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 526 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.527TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES \u0081 If the patient received an unusually large dose of 131I or if treat- ment was for cancer, he may stay in the hospital for monitoring. In such cases, observe radiation precautions for 3 days. \u0081 Don't allow pregnant nurses to care for the child. \u0081 Encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids for 48 hours to speed excretion of 131I. At home with radioactive iodine If the child will be discharged after treatment, instruct the parents about observing radiation precautions at home:\u0081 Tell the parents that the child must urinate into a lead-lined con- tainer for 48 hours. \u0081 Tell the parents that the child must use disposable eating uten-sils, and avoid close contact with young children and pregnant women for 7 days after therapy. \u0081 Advise the parents to dispose of urine, saliva, and vomitus properly; urine and saliva will be slightly radioactive for 24 hours, and vomitus will be highly radioactive for 6 to 8 hours after therapy. Thyroidectomy Thyroidectomy (removal of all or part of the thyroid gland) is performed to treat hyperthyroidism and respiratory obstruction from goiter. Subtotal thyroidectomy , which reduces secretion of TH, is used to correct hyperthyroidism when drug therapy fails or radiation therapy is contraindicated. After surgery, the remaining thyroid tissue usually supplies enough TH for normal function, although hypothyroidism may occur later. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for surgery with an age-appropriate explanation, including the postoperative appearance of the site of surgery. Tell the child that his throat may be sore for a few days after surgery and that medication will be given to make him feel better. Keep in mind that the child may be fearful of having his \"throat cut\"; provide clarification and answer all questions. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Iodine preparations are typically administered before surgery; to improve the taste of the preparation, mix it with fruit juice.\u0081 Check for laryngeal nerve damage by asking the child to speak as soon as he awakens from anesthesia.\u0081 Watch for signs of respiratory distress. Tracheal collapse, mucus accumulation in the trachea, laryngeal edema, and vocal cord paralysis can all cause respiratory obstruction with sudden stridor and restlessness.

Endocrine and metabolic disorders Endocrine and metabolic disorders that may a deficiency of TH secretion during fetal development or early infancy. If left untreated, it will seriously affect mental development. Congenital hypothyroidism is three times more common in girls than in boys. The early bird catches the best prognosis Early diagnosis and treatment produces the best prognosis. Infants treated before age 3 months usually grow and develop normally. Athyroid children (born without a thyroid gland) who remain untreated beyond age 3 months and children with Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 528 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 528 5/22/14 8:34 PM Rights Reserved.529ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS acquired hypothyroidism who remain untreated beyond age 2 years suffer irreversible mental retardation. Skeletal abnormalities are reversible with treatment. What causes it Congenital hypothyroidism is caused by defective embryonic development (most common cause), causing congenital absence or underdevelopment of the thyroid gland. It can also occur as an inherited autosomal-recessive defect in the synthesis of T 4 (next most common cause). Mom's meds Congenital hypothyroidism in infants can result if the mother took antithyroid drugs during pregnancy. Other causes include chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and iodine deficiency during pregnancy. How it happens Hypothyroidism in infants and children is related to decreased TH production or secretion, which may result from one of several causes: \u0081 Loss of functional thyroid tissue can be caused by an autoimmune process.\u0081 Defective thyroid synthesis may be related to congenital defects; thyroid dysgenesis (defective development) is the most common defect. \u0081 Hypothyroidism may also be related to decreased TSH secretion or resistance to TSH.\u0081 If left untreated, lack of adequate TH levels seriously affects the nervous system and bone growth. What to look for The signs of untreated hypothyroidism usually appear at age 6 weeks:\u0081 The infant with hypothyroidism may sleep more than usual; older children may show signs of lethargy. \u0081 He may have noisy respirations due to tongue enlargement. (The tongue may also be dry.) Cold to the touch \u0081 The extremities may be cold, and the overall body temperature may be lower due to decreased metabolism.\u0081 The child's neck will be short and thick. \u0081 The extremities appear short and fat; the legs appear shorter in relation to trunk 529 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd METABOLIC PROBLEMS Constipation consternation The abdomen becomes enlarged because of intestinal obstruc- tion from constipation (which results from hypotonia of the intes-tinal tract). \u0081 Other signs include delayed dentition; dry, scaly skin; easy weight gain; and slow pulse. Whoa, horsey Infants may have a hoarse cry, persistent jaundice, and respi- ratory difficulties. Older children may exhibit bone and muscle dystrophy, cognitive impairment (which develops as the disorder progresses), and stunted growth or dwarfism (short stature with the persistence of infant proportions). What tests tell you Elevated TSH level associated with low T 3 and T 4 levels points to congenital hypothyroidism. Because early detection and treatment can minimize the effects of congenital hypothyroidism, all states require measurement of infant TH levels at birth through neonate screening tests:\u0081 Thyroid scan and 131I uptake tests show decreased uptake levels and confirm the absence of thyroid tissue in athyroid children. \u0081 Increased gonadotropin levels accompany sexual precocity in older children and may coexist with hypothyroidism. \u0081 An electrocardiogram shows bradycardia and flat or inverted T waves in untreated infants.\u0081 Hip, knee, and thigh X-rays reveal the absence of the femoral or tibial epiphyseal line and delayed skeletal development that's markedly inappropriate for the child's chronological age. Complications If hypothyroidism isn't treated by age 3 months, skeletal malfor- mations and irreversible mental retardation can occur; treatment helps to prevent retardation. Learning disabilities and accelerated or delayed sexual maturation may also occur. How it's treated The treatment for congenital hypothyroidism is lifelong therapy with synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine, liothyronine). Supplemental vitamin D may also be prescribed to prevent rickets resulting from rapid bone growth. Surgery may be performed for the underlying cause such as a pituitary tumor. The child should have routine monitoring of T 4 and TSH levels as well as periodic evaluation of growth to ensure that thyroid replacement is adequate.

P arents\u2014and nurses\u2014need to know when the TH replacement dosage is too high or too low.What to do The child and his parents will need ongoing support and encour- agement. They should be encouraged to express their concerns and feelings and may need help to develop effective coping mechanisms. Referral to a support group may be extremely help- ful. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 When caring for a neonate, make sure neonatal screening has been done to allow for early detection of the disorder. \u0081 Stress to the parents the importance of lifelong treatment, in- cluding TH replacement therapy as well as routine blood work to adjust the medication as the child grows.\u0081 Administer medications as ordered.\u0081 Offer support and encouragement to the parents. Too high, too low \u0081 After initiation of treatment for infantile hypothyroidism, monitor blood pressure and pulse rate, and report hyper-tension and tachycardia immediately. (Normal infant heart rate is approximately 120 beats/minute.) These signs as well as fever, irritability, and sweating indicate that the dose of TH replacement medication is too high.\u0081 Teach the parents to look for signs and symptoms of inadequate treatment (a dose that's too low), including fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, and constipation. Plan ahead \u0081 Adolescent girls require future-oriented counseling that stresses the importance of adequate TH replacement during pregnancy. \u0081 If the infant's tongue is unusually large, position him on his side and observe him frequently to prevent airway obstruction. Don't delay If treatment is delayed and signs and symptoms develop: \u0081 Help the child and his parents develop effective coping skills.\u0081 Provide meticulous skin and mucous membrane care. \u0081 Check rectal temperature every 2 to 4 hours; keep the patient warm, as needed. Cushing's syndrome Cushing's syndrome is a disorder of adrenal hyperfunction.

How it happens A loss of normal feedback inhibition by cortisol occurs in Cushing's syndrome. Elevated levels of cortisol don't suppress hypothalamic and anterior pituitary secretion of corticotropin- releasing hormone and corticotropin. The result is excessive levels of circulating cortisol. What to look for The unmistakable signs of Cushing's syndrome include adiposity of the face (moon face), neck, and trunk and reddish purple striae on the skin (especially the abdomen). In addition, a child with some or all of the following signs may have Cushing's syndrome: \u0081 weight gain\u0081 muscle \u0081 sleep disturbances\u0081 water retention\u0081 amenorrhea\u0081 thin hair and thin, fragile skin (ruddy complexion)\u0081 thinning extremities with muscle wasting and fat mobilization\u0081 bruising, petechiae, and ecchymoses \u0081 delayed wound healing \u0081 buffalo hump\u0081 hirsutism\u0081 truncal obesity. What tests tell you A low-dose (overnight) dexamethasone suppression test, elevated 24-hour urine free cortisol levels, and high nighttime cortisol levels (indicating the absence of circadian rhythm) confirm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

What to do Children with Cushing's syndrome require painstaking assessment and supportive care:\u0081 Frequently monitor vital signs, especially blood pressure; care- fully observe the hypertensive child who also has cardiac disease. \u0081 Check laboratory reports for hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria. What goes in might not come out! \u0081 Check for edema and carefully monitor daily weight and intake and output; the cushingoid child is likely to retain sodium and water. \u0081 To minimize weight gain, edema, and hypertension, ask the dietitian to provide a diet high in protein and potassium but low in calories, carbohydrates, and sodium. Infection prevention \u0081 Use protective measures to prevent infection (a significant problem in Cushing's syndrome).\u0081 Carefully perform passive range-of-motion exercises for chil- dren who have osteoporosis and are bedridden.

Injuring islet cells and triggering type 1 diabetes is my job\u2014 it's what I do.Absolutely insufficient Type 1 diabetes mellitus (characterized by absolute insulin insuf- ficiency) is the most common childhood endocrine disorder. No longer rare, the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood is rising dramatically because of the increase in childhood obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity induces resistance to insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake. It's characterized by insulin resistance with varying degrees of insulin secretory defects. Diabetes mellitus (types 1 and 2) can occur at any age, but type 1 has a peak incidence at ages 10 to 15 years. What causes it Diabetes mellitus is caused by genetic factors and autoimmune fac- tors (type 1) and may also develop as a result of a viral infection. Genetic factors Type 1 isn't inherited, but predisposition plays a part in its develop-ment. Type 2 diabetes has strong polygenic (caused by several genes) familial susceptibility. Blame it on dad Children born to fathers who have type 1 are about three times more likely to develop diabetes mellitus than children born to mothers with type 1. Autoimmune factors About 70% to 85% of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus patients are found to have pancreatic islet cell antibodies. Straggler antibodies These antibodies disappear in most people after diagno-sis. It's thought that the presence of these antibodies makes the immune system vulnerable to a trigger event, such as a virus, bacteria, or chemical irritant. Viral infection Several viruses, including coxsackie B, mumps, and congenital rubella, have been associated with the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Vulnerable to viruses The pancreatic islet cells are susceptible to injury by these viruses and can suffer damage or be changed. This alteration triggers an autoimmune response. The virus becomes a trigger to the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 535 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 535 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.536ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS How it happens Diabetes mellitus is characterized by disturbances in carbohy- drate, protein, and fat metabolism. Insulin allows glucose trans-port into the cells for use as energy or storage as glycogen. Free the fatty acids! Insulin stimulates protein synthesis and free fatty acid storage in adipose tissues. Deficiency of insulin or insulin resistance and secretory defects compromise the body tissues' access to essen- tial nutrients for fuel and storage. What to look for The three cardinal signs of diabetes mellitus are polyuria, polydip- sia, and polyphagia. Other general signs and symptoms may include:\u0081 weakness and fatigue \u0081 nocturia in a child who has already attained nighttime control \u0081 dehydration (dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor)\u0081 weight loss and hunger\u0081 vision changes (retinopathy or cataract formation) \u0081 frequent skin and urinary tract infections \u0081 skin changes (cool temperature and dry, itchy skin, especially on the hands and feet). Type 1 in a hurry A child with type 1 diabetes mellitus will have rapidly developing symptoms, muscle wasting, and loss of subcutaneous fat. A child with type 2 diabetes will have more subtle symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, weakness, fatigue, and fre- quent infections developing over time. The pancreas' last stand A onetime remission of symptoms may occur shortly after insulin treatment is started. It's a last-ditch effort by the pancreas to produce insulin. The child may not need insulin for up to 1 year but may need oral antidiabetic drugs. Symptoms of hyperglycemia will reappear, and the child with type 1 diabetes will be insulin-dependent for life. Vaguely type 2 In children with type 2 diabetes mellitus, vague, long- standing symptoms develop gradually. These include:\u0081 severe viral infection \u0081 other endocrine diseases \u0081 recent stress or trauma\u0081 use of drugs that increase blood glucose levels\u0081 obesity, particularly in the abdominal area. Even in the face of diabetes mellitus, I respond to therapy by making insulin one last time. It's my insulin swan song.

Other findings include: \u0081 two-hour postprandial blood glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl\u0081 increased glycosylated hemoglobin level\u0081 urinalysis that may show acetone or glucose \u0081 diabetic retinopathy, which may be revealed by an ophthalmic examination. Complications Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypoglycemia may occur as well as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus are nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. If the diabetes isn't well controlled, complications can occur as early as 2 to 3 years after diagnosis. Therefore, good control and regimen compliance are necessary to postpone or prevent complications. How it's treated Treating the child with diabetes mellitus takes a multidisciplinary approach. Team diabetes The child, parents, and health care professionals (including an en-docrinologist, nutritionist, and a diabetes nurse educator) should all be involved in the treatment plan. It may also be necessary for a mental health professional to be included because the treatment plan can have an impact on the child's emotional and psychologi-cal health. Meal planning, exercise, and, sometimes, insulin or oral antidiabetic agents are prescribed to normalize carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism and avert long-term complications while preventing hypoglycemia. Type 1 diabetes Patients with type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily because of their absolute insulin deficiency. The insulin need changes and is affected by emotions, nutritional intake, activity, illness, and events such as puberty. (See Insulin injection sites in children , page 538.) Insulin dosages are based on home blood glucose monitoring. Insulin can be administered as one or two injections per day or by insulin pump (continuous S.C. administration).

All Rights Reserved.538ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Type 2 diabetes Patients with type 2 diabetes may require insulin to control blood glucose levels unresponsive to diet and oral antidiabetic agents, or during periods of acute stress. Patients with other types of diabetes commonly require daily insulin therapy to achieve blood glucose control. (See Insulin therapy .) The first-line medication used is metformin because of its effects on weight loss and insulin resistance.

Rebel with restrictions As the child grows, compliance may become an issue. A child or adolescent may simply become overwhelmed or tired of taking medication and adhering to dietary restrictions. These feelings should be recognized as normal. Referral to a support group will help the child and his parents cope with the diagnosis and its implications.Insulin therapy Insulin is administered as prescribed. There are several routes of administration and devices for injection. Subcutaneous route Insulin is usually given by subcutaneous (S.C.) injec- tion with a standard insulin syringe. S.C. insulin can also be given with a penlike injection device that uses a dis posable needle and replaceable insulin cartridges, eliminating the need to draw insulin into a syringe. Jet-propelled Jet-injection devices are expensive and require special cleaning procedures, but they disperse insulin more rapidly and speed absorption. These devices draw up insulin from standard containers, which enable the patient to mix insulins, if necessary, but require a special proce-dure for drawing it up. After the insulin is drawn up, it's delivered into the S.C. tissue with a pressure jet. Pump it up! Multiple-dose regimens may use an insulin pump to deliver insulin continuously into S.C. tissue. The infusion rate selector automatically releases about half of the total daily insulin requirement evenly over 24 hours. The patient releases the remainder in bolus amounts before meals and snacks. Ready, set, rotate! When administering insulin injections S.C., the injection sites should be rotated. Because absorption rates differ at each site, rotating the injection site within a specific area such as the abdomen is recommended.I.V. and I.M. routes Regular insulin or insulin lispro may also be administered intramuscularly (I.M.) or I.V. during severe episodes of hyperglycemia. These are the only types of insulin that should ever be administered by these routes. Investigational routes Researchers are working on newer, more efficient ways of administering insulin. Two newer methods of insulin administration are the intranasal delivery method and the programmable implantable medication system (PIMS). Both methods are still experimental. Up your nose with an aerosol Intranasal administration uses aerosolized insulin com-bined with a surfactant; it's administered as a nasal spray. Because nasal solutions are less potent than S.C. insulin, dosages are higher. Batteries included Now undergoing clinical trials, the PIMS has an implant-able infusion pump unit that holds and delivers the insulin, and a delivery catheter that feeds insulin directly into the peritoneal cavity. The pump, encased in a titanium shell, contains a tiny computer to regulate dosages and runs on a battery with a 5-year life span. The patient uses a handheld external radio transmitter to control insulin release. Because the PIMS has no built-in blood glucose sensor, the patient must monitor his glucose levels several times per day.

Like a hawk! \u0081 Monitor the child closely for signs and symptoms of DKA or HHNS. Suspect DKA or HHNS if the child exhibits Kussmaul's respirations, develops a fruity odor to his breath, and shows signs and symptoms of severe dehydration. Notify the doctor imme diately if these indications are evident.\u0081 If the child has DKA or HHNS, treatment may include fluid and electrolyte replacement, increased insulin therapy, and therapy to reduce acidosis. Administer doses of I.V. insulin as prescribed. (Monitor blood glucose levels frequently during insulin infusion.)\u0081 Monitor the child closely for signs and symptoms of hyper-glycemia and hypoglycemia (caused by an excessively rapid reduction in blood glucose level). Teach these signs and symp-toms to the child and his parents and provide specific instruc-tions on how to handle each condition. (See Hypo or hyper? ) \u0081 Make sure the child and his parents understand that he should base his meal plan on a balanced diet that incorporates the six basic food groups. Fitting in \u0081 Concentrated sweets are discouraged, so teach the child and his parents about alternate snack ideas to help him feel more like his peers. (See Diabetes mellitus teaching tips .)

Galactosemia Galactosemia is an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism and is a rare disorder. Neonate screening for the disorder is required in most states.

This enzyme is one of three needed to metabolize galactose to glucose. Without GALT, galactose accumulates in the blood, which leads to hepatic dysfunction, cirrhosis, and subsequent jaundice. The jaundice is noticeable during the first few weeks of life. Portal hypertension occurs as the spleen becomes involved. What to look for Infants with the disorder appear normal at birth. Soon after ingesting milk, which is high in lactose, they begin to vomit and lose weight. Galactosemia is not related to and should not be confused with lactose intolerance. cataracts.It's all relative Diabetes mellitus teaching tips Long-term management of diabetes mellitus requires extensive patient\u2014and parent\u2014education: \u0081 Review the prescribed meal plan and teach the child (and his family) how to adjust his diet when engaged in extra activity.\u0081 Advise the child and his parents about aerobic exercise programs; explain how exercise affects blood glucose levels, and provide safety guidelines. \u0081 Instruct the child on insulin administration, if prescribed, including type, peak times, dosage, drawing up the insulin, mixing (if applicable), administration technique, site rotation, sharps dis-posal, and storage.\u0081 Teach the child (and his parents) how to perform blood glucose monitoring.\u0081 Instruct the child on oral antidiabetic therapy, if prescribed, including dosage, frequency and time of administration, and potential adverse reactions.\u0081 Tell the child and his parents about the Internet as a source of information and about the American Diabetes Association Web site (www.diabetes.org).

Galactose levels are increased in the blood and urine (galactosuria), and levels of GALT activity in erythrocytes are decreased or absent. Complications Complications of galactosemia include ovarian dysfunction, cataracts, abnormal speech, cognitive impairment, motor delay, and growth retardation. How it's treated The disorder is treated by eliminating dietary galactose (generally available as lactose), including breast milk. Lactose-free or soy protein formulas are recommended and, as the child grows, a balanced, galactose-free diet must be main- tained. (See Diet for galactosemia .) What to do Nursing care focuses on education: \u0081 Teach the child and parents about the disorder and pro-vide emotional support and counseling; psychological and emotional problems may result from the difficult dietary restrictions.\u0081 Teach the child and parents about the critical importance of adhering to the diet. \u0081 Teach the parents about normal physical and mental growth and development to help them recognize develop-mental delay.\u0081 Help the mother deal with feelings of loss, and even guilt, which may result from the inability to breast-feed. Graves' disease Graves' disease, also called hyperthyroidism in childhood, is associated with exophthalmos and an enlarged thyroid gland. Most cases occur in children between ages 6 and 15 years. The disease may be present in infants whose mothers were thyro- toxic during pregnancy. What causes it Graves' disease is caused by an autoimmune response to TSH receptors.

They don't realize these behaviors can be symptoms of Graves' disease.How it happens In Graves' disease, T 4 production is increased and the thyroid gland is enlarged (called a goiter ). It's characterized by autoan- tibodies that attach to and then stimulate TSH receptors on the thyroid gland. Stimulation overload A goiter may be the result of increased stimulation of the thyroid gland or a response to increased metabolic demand. The latter occurs in iodine-deficient areas of the world, where the incidence of goiter increases during puberty (a time of increased metabolic demand). These goiters commonly regress to normal size after puberty in males but not in females. What to look for Symptoms of Graves' disease begin gradually and develop on and off during a period of 6 to 12 months. Irritability and excessive motion are the most prominent symptoms. The child may also exhibit: \u0081 hyperactivity\u0081 short attention span\u0081 insomnia \u0081 tremors \u0081 weight loss despite a tremendous appetite\u0081 rapid, pounding pulse (even during sleep)\u0081 skin warm and flushed\u0081 widened pulse pressure\u0081 cardiomegaly\u0081 exophthalmos.

Teach parents to be label- readers and, when in doubt, to ask the pharmacist.suppress the formation of T 4. Hypermetabolic symptoms will subside 4 to 8 weeks after therapy begins, but remission of Grave's disease requires continued therapy for 6 months to 2 years. The child must be monitored closely for signs of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. If these conditions occur, the medication is discontinued until the counts return to normal levels. Ablation to the rescue If the child is unable or unwilling to comply with the medication regimen or if he has a toxic reaction to the medication, ablation therapy with 131I is used to reduce the size of the thyroid gland. When in doubt, take it out Surgical removal of all or most of the thyroid may be necessary in the young adult. After ablation or surgical removal of the thyroid, the child must remain on lifelong thyroid replacement therapy. What to do Explain the disorder to the child and his parents and prepare the child for all treatments and procedures:\u0081 Teach the parents of a child being treated with antithyroid drugs or radioisotope therapy to identify and report symptoms of hypo- thyroidism. Keep it cool \u0081 Encourage a cool, quiet environment that's conducive to rest until there's a response to drug therapy; restrict physical activity.\u0081 Advise the child with exophthalmos or other ophthalmopathy to wear sunglasses or eye patches to protect the eyes from light; moisten the conjunctiva frequently with isotonic eyedrops.\u0081 To meet the child's increased metabolic demand, pro- vide a balanced diet with six meals per day. Cough with caution \u0081 Tell the child who has had 131I therapy not to expecto- rate or cough freely because his saliva is radioactive for 24 hours; stress the need for repeated measurement of serum T 4 levels and reassure the child and his parents (who may be frightened by the term \"radioactive\"). \u0081 Instruct the child taking PTU or methimazole (and his parents) to take these drugs with meals to minimize gastro- intestinal (GI) distress and to avoid over-the-counter cough preparations because many contain iodine.\u0081 Stress the importance of regular medical follow-up visits after discharge because hypothyroidism may de- velop 2 to 4 weeks postoperatively 544 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd Reserved.545ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS Elevated plasma isoleucine and ketoacidosis cause the maple syrup odor in MSUD.Long-term commitment \u0081 Explain that the child will need lifelong TH replacement. (Encourage him to wear medical identification and to carry his medication with him at all times.) Maple syrup urine disease An inborn error of metabolism, MSUD is a rare disorder in which there's a defect in the amino acid metabolism of leucine, isoleu-cine, and valine. This defect leads to cerebral degeneration. How sweet it isn't MSUD derives its name from the sweet, burnt sugar, or maple syrup smell of the urine. What causes it MSUD is inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait. How it happens In MSUD, the enzymes necessary to break down the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine are either absent, inactive, or only partially active. Origin of the odor Because of the enzyme deficiency in MSUD, levels of BCAAs and their by-products, called ketoacids , become elevated. These elevations, particularly the elevation in leucine, cause neurologic symptoms. The elevation of plasma isoleucine and ketoacidosis is associated with the maple syrup odor. What to look for Assessment findings of MSUD may be evident within 2 weeks of birth. Findings may include:\u0081 urine with the odor of maple syrup \u0081 feeding difficulties \u0081 absence of Moro's reflex\u0081 irregular respirations\u0081 seizures.

Early treatment can prevent retardation. How it's treated BCAAs, such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are restricted. The child is given a diet that's high in thiamine. If necessary, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or both may be performed. What to do The family should be referred to a nutritionist who can teach them about the foods to restrict and encourage. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Test urine and blood after the first 24 hours of feeding. \u0081 Check diapers for color, amount, and odor of urine.\u0081 For neonates discharged within 24 hours of birth, ensure home visits by a nurse to obtain blood samples for testing; facilitate rapid test results and refer the parents to the pediatrician if test results are abnormal.\u0081 Stress to the parents the importance of the restricted diet and provide support as necessary.\u0081 Encourage the parents to bring the child for needed follow-up care; frequent appointments are necessary for blood work and to maintain balanced amino acid levels. Phenylketonuria PKU is an inborn error in amino acid (specifically phenylalanine) metabolism. It results in high serum levels of phenylalanine, increased urine concentrations of phenylalanine and its by- products, cerebral damage, and mental retardation. An error by any other name PKU is also called phenylalaninemia and phenylpyruvic oligo- phrenia . The disorder occurs in 1 of approximately 14,000 births in the United States. About 1 person in 60 is an asymptomatic carrier. The case for early detection Although blood phenylalanine levels approach normal at birth, they begin to increase within a few days. By the time they reach significant levels (about 30 mg/dl), cerebral damage has begun. Such irreversible damage is probably complete by age 2 or 3 years. Early detection and treatment can minimize cerebral damage. Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 546 Meadows-Oliver_Ch13.indd 546 5/22/14 8:34 PM Kluwer.

No studying is required!What causes it PKU is transmitted through an autosomal-recessive gene. How it happens In PKU, an almost totally deficient activity of phenylalanine hy- droxylase, an enzyme that acts as a catalyst in the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, results in phenylalanine accumulation in the blood and urine. This accumulation leads to brain damage and mental retardation. What to look for The patient may have a family history of PKU. Typically, the his- tory reveals no apparent abnormalities at birth. Brain on hold By age 4 months, the untreated child begins to show signs of arrested brain development, including mental retardation and, later, personality disturbances (schizoid and antisocial personality patterns and uncontrollable temper). About one-third of patients have a history of seizures, which usually begin between ages 6 and 12 months. Many patients also show a precipitous decrease in IQ in their first year. Got the blues? On inspection, the patient typically has a lighter complexion than unaffected siblings and may have blue eyes. He may also exhibit macrocephaly, eczematous skin lesions, or dry, rough skin. Hyper, irritable, and repetitive The child is usually hyperactive and irritable. He exhibits purposeless, repetitive motions, and has an awkward gait. A musty odor from the skin and urinary excretion of phenylacetic acid may also be noted. What tests tell you Most states require screening for PKU at birth; the Guthrie screening test on a capillary blood sample (bacterial inhibi-tion assay) is a reliable indicator of the disorder. Because phenylalanine levels may be normal at birth, the infant should be evaluated after he starts protein feedings; in the infant with PKU, levels are usually abnormally high by day 4. More quantitative fluorometric or chromatographic Rights Reserved.548ENDOCRINE AND METABOLIC PROBLEMS Dietary phenylalanine restriction is the best way to protect me in a child with PKU.Complications Phenylalanine accumulation causes mental retardation. How it's treated To prevent or minimize brain damage, phenylalanine blood levels are kept between 3 mg/dl and 9 mg/dl by restricting dietary intake of the amino acid phenylalanine. The lowdown on phenylalanine During the first month of life, a special, low-phenylalanine amino acid mixture is substituted for most of the protein in the diet, supplemented with a small amount of natural foods. An enzymatic hydrolysate of casein, such as Lofenalac powder or Pregestimil powder, is substituted for milk in the diets of affected infants. Dietary restrictions are required throughout life. Don't overdo it! Such a diet calls for close monitoring. The body doesn't make phenylalanine, so overzealous dietary restriction can induce phenylalanine deficiency, causing lethargy, anorexia, anemia, skin rashes, and diarrhea. What to do Teach the parents about PKU, and provide emotional support and counseling. Psychological and emotional problems may result from the difficult dietary restrictions. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 If the child is experiencing seizures or has some mental dys-function, implement safety measures to prevent injury; refer the parents and child to appropriate community resources. Just say \"no\" to chicken and cheese \u0081 Teach the child and his parents about the critical impor- tance of adhering to his diet; the child must avoid breads, cheese, eggs, flour, meat, poultry, fish, nuts, milk, legumes, and aspartame (NutraSweet). Also, the child will need frequent tests for urine phenylpyruvic acid and blood phenylalanine levels to evaluate the effectiveness of the diet.\u0081 Refer the family to a nutritionist. \u0081 Teach the parents about normal physical and mental growth and development to help them recognize developmental delay from excessive phenylalanine Kluwer.

As a result, deviation from the restricted diet becomes more likely, which increases the risk of further brain damage. Encourage the parents to allow the child some choices in the kinds of low-protein foods he eats to help make him feel trusted and more responsible, which will encourage compliance. Quick quiz 1.

They help the body fight infection or invaders through different mechanisms but usually work together for the same goal. Both sys- tems essentially arise from an organ known as bone marrow which, although housed within the bones, has little relationship to the skeletal system. Hematologic system Bone marrow contains the essential element in the hematologic system: the stem cell. The stem cell is sometimes referred to as the pluripotential stem cell , meaning it has the ability to Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 551 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 551 5/22/14 8:40 PM Rights Reserved.552HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS A mother's work is never done! It's from me that new cells are created for all three main blood cell types.transform into more than one type of blood cell. Every blood cell in the body arises from a stem cell. Did you say organ system? Although it's a fluid, blood is one of the body's major organ sys-tems. It continually circulates through the heart and blood vessels, carrying vital elements to every part of the body. Blood formation Early in utero, the process of blood formation, called hematopoiesis , occurs in the liver and spleen. These organs retain some hematopoietic ability throughout life. After birth, the red bone marrow becomes the main site of hematopoiesis. Yellow with age In infants and young children, all bones contain red bone marrow (red from the production of red blood cells [RBCs]) and are, therefore, capable of hematopoiesis. However, as the child approaches adolescence and bone growth ceases, the bone marrow in many bones can't form blood cells because the marrow has transformed to yellow bone marrow (yellow from fat deposits), although it can usually revert to red bone marrow during times of increased blood cell demand. Only the ribs, sternum, vertebrae, and pelvis continue to contain red bone marrow and produce blood cells. Have a blast The stem cells contained in the red bone marrow create primitive blood cells called blast cells . Blast cells are the least mature form of blood cell and are the precursors to RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. These cells are normal and shouldn't be confused with the blast cells seen in leukemia and other cancers. Like a fine wine These blast cells then stay in the bone marrow to mature. The matu- ration of blood cells, called differentiation , occurs in stages; thus, in normal bone marrow, you can see different forms of all the blood cell lines. (See Human blood cell development .) Mature blood cells travel by blood throughout the body to perform specific functions. Blood components Blood is composed of plasma and cells. Plasma is the fluid portion of the blood. It's 90% water and 10% solutes, such as proteins, Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.553HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM Human blood cell development All blood cell types originate from the same stem cell. The chart below shows how this stem cell becomes differentiated, developing into each blood cell type. Yolk sac Stem cell Lymphoblast Lymphocytes B lymphocytes Plasma cells (immunoglobulin [Ig] G, blood cells) and dissolved nutrients. The three main cell types in the blood originate from blast cells and include: RBCs, or erythrocytes WBCs, or leukocytes platelets, or thrombocytes RBCs In addition to the bone marrow, some RBCs are stored in the liver or spleen. RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues and carry carbon di-oxide away from tissues. When tissue is low on oxygen (hypoxia), a hormone from the kidneys called erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more RBCs. Synthetic forms of erythro- poietin are now used to stimulate RBC production in premature neonates and patients receiving chemotherapy to help them main- tain higher blood cell levels.

Bilirubin binds with albumin for transport to the liver cells to conjugate with glucuro- nide, forming direct can't be excreted in urine or bile, it may escape to extravascular tissue, especially fatty tissue and the brain, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia and skin that appears icteric (or jaundiced). Too much bilirubin may result in brain damage\u2014a condition known as kernicterus. In newborns, the normal range of bilirubin levels are determined by the baby's age in hours. For instance, an infant who is 48 hours old will have a different range of accept-able levels than does an infant who is 96 hours old. Other things that may place a newborn at risk for hyperbilirubinemia are being born premature, having a sibling who has had hyperbilirubinemia, or having a blood group incompatibility with the mother (such as the mother having an O /H11001 blood type and the baby having an A /H11001 blood type). Oxygen is carried in the cell in a protein (globin) and iron (heme) structure known as hemoglobin . If adequate amounts of iron aren't available, the protein structure can't be formed and RBCs can't carry their normal amount of oxygen. Lead can also replace iron in the molecule, causing toxicity. WBCs WBCs fight different types of infection that occur in or on the body; each type of WBC has its own role in fighting infection. The two main categories of WBCs are granular leukocytes (granu- locytes) as bacteria, by phagocytosis \u0081 eosinophils , which act in allergic reactions and may defend against large parasites and lung and skin infections \u0081 basophils , which release heparin and histamine, are involved in inflammatory and infectious reactions, and are known as mast cells when they exist in body tissues. Not a granule to be found Agranulocytes include: \u0081 lymphocytes , which are the main cells that fight infections and include natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and T cells Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 554 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 554 5/22/14 8:40 PM \u0081 monocytes , which, along with neutrophils, help devour invading microorganisms by phagocytosis and also form macrophages in the body tissues. Platelets Platelets adhere to one another and plug holes in vessels or tissues where there's bleeding. This action is part of a larger coagulation (clotting) process. Platelets also release serotonin at injury sites. Serotonin, a vasoconstrictor, decreases blood flow to the injured area. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such platelet aggregation. Hemostasis Hemostasis is a complex process by which the body controls bleeding. When a blood vessel ruptures, local vasoconstriction and platelet clumping (aggregation) at the injury site initially help prevent hemorrhaging.Two types of leukocytes Leukocytes vary in size, shape, and number and are characterized as granular and nongranular. Granular Granular leukocytes ( granulocytes) are the include: \u0081 basophils , which contain cytoplas- readily with alkaline dyes\u0081 neutrophils , which are finely granular and recognizable have few, if Rights Reserved.556HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Never fear\u2014the immune system is here! It protects the body from invaders with its army of lymphocytes.Like a waterfall Activation of the coagulation system, called the extrinsic cascade , involves the release of thromboplastin from the damaged tissue cells. However, formation of a more stable clot requires initiation of the complex clotting mechanism known as the intrinsic cas- cade system . When endothelial vessel injury or a foreign body in the blood- stream activates the intrinsic cascade, activating factor XII trig- gers clotting. Finally, prothrombin is converted to thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, which is necessary for creation of a fibrin clot. Immune system The body protects itself from foreign invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, through the organs and cells of the immune system. The components of the immune system work together to recognize \"self\" from \"non- self\" and to rid the body of those substances recognized as \"non-self.\" Immune system organs Immune system organs and tissues are described as lymphoid because they're all involved with the growth, development, and dissemination of lymphocytes. These organs and tissues \u0081 tonsils \u0081 Peyer patches in the intestine. Lymph nodes Lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped structures located along a network of lymph channels. Most abundant in the head, neck, axillae, abdomen, pelvis, and groin, they help remove and destroy antigens (substances capable of triggering an immune re- sponse) that circulate in the blood and lymph. Lymph nodes filter lymphatic fluid and return it to the bloodstream. Lymphocytes in waiting Lymph nodes filter foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, and can serve as waiting stations for lymphocytes that might be needed in that area to fight infection.

All Rights Reserved.557IMMUNE SYSTEM Once I mature in the thymus, I'm ready and willing to function normally.Nodes of concern In children, the lymphatic system grows rapidly between ages 3 and 6 years. At this age, slightly swollen (less than 0.5 cm) lymph nodes in the neck and groin areas are common. Lymph nodes that should cause concern are: \u0081 enlarged (greater than 1 cm in diameter), firm, painless, and fixed to the skin (malignancy)\u0081 painful, soft, and producing heat (local inflammation or infection) \u0081 nodes in the supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary regions. Thymus The thymus is located in the mediastinal area of the chest and may look quite large on the chest X-ray of a neonate. The thymus is largest in the preadolescent period. After adolescence, it begins to shrink in size. The thymus uses hormones to enable maturation of lymphocytes, produced by the bone marrow, into T lym- phocytes (T cells). The mature T cells can then function normally. Spleen The spleen functions as a reservoir for blood and blood cells. It also acts like a screen to filter out unwanted invaders and help break up old RBCs that lose their elasticity with age and can't squeeze through the fine mesh of the spleen. The spleen is particularly good at filtering out one specific bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae . Children without a spleen or with a nonfunctioning spleen (such as those with sickle cell disease) are more at risk for invasive streptococcal infections and should be put on prophylactic penicillin (until the age of at least 5 years) and will need immediate antibiotics if they have a fever. Tonsils The tonsils consist of lymphoid tissue that serves as a storage site for lymphocytes and can also produce some lymphocytes. In children, the tonsils may normally be slightly enlarged between ages 3 and 6 years (while the immune system is at its peak of development). Sounds of silence? Parents of a 3- to 6-year-old child will commonly report that he snores. Snoring at this age is usually due to the enlarged tonsils partially obstructing the airway during All Rights Reserved.558HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS I'm the great antigen hunter. I release the hounds (antibodies) on invading forces!Immune system cells All immune system cells are produced in bone marrow. The main cells of the immune system are B cells (B lymphocytes), phago-cytes, and T cells (T lymphocytes). B cells B cells, which are involved in humoral immunity, produce anti-bodies. Each B cell is programmed to make a specific antibody. In humoral immunity, a B cell will divide and differentiate into plasma cells when it encounters its triggering antigen. The plasma cells will secrete antibodies to the antigen. To find and bind These antibodies then travel in the blood and lymph, which circulate throughout the body. When the antibodies find the anti-gen, they bind to it to tag it so other immune system cells can de- stroy it. Gobs of globulins Some antibodies are proteins that perform special functions and are called immunoglobulins . There are five types of immu- noglobulins (Igs) produced by B cells: IgA defends external body surfaces and is present in colostrum, saliva, tears, and nasal fluids as well as respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and genitourinary secretions (neonates have small amounts of this Ig and are more susceptible to an overgrowth of organisms in mucous membranes such as oral Candida ). IgD is found on the surface of B cells and functions in con- trolling lymphocyte activation or suppression. IgE is the antibody responsible for hypersensitivity reactions; it has an immediate response to an antigen and stimulates the re- lease of heparin and histamine from mast cells. IgG makes up the majority of plasma antibodies and is the main antibacterial and antiviral antibody; transfusions of IgG specific for viral diseases, such as varicella (chickenpox), are useful in treating children who are exposed but have decreased immune function (such as those on chemotherapy). IgM is the first Ig produced during an immune response; because it's very large, IgM is usually seen only in the blood and can't pass into tissues to fight infections.Memory jogger If hu- moral im-munity is all Greek to you, you're right! To remember what humoral immunity is, think Greek. B-cell anti-bodies travel in the blood and lymph, which the ancient Greeks called the humors of the body. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 558 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 558 Reserved.559IMMUNE SYSTEM Immunoglobulins are like me\u2014they never forget! Once they fight an antigen, they remember it as the enemy if it ever has the nerve to show up again.Phagocytes Phagocytes are immune cells that engulf, kill, and digest particu- late matter and foreign invaders. Phagocytes include neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages. Macrophages are a type of mono- cyte; they're versatile scavenger cells found in tissues throughout the body. In addition to their phagocytic action, macrophages: activate T cells secrete various blood products, including clotting factors, enzymes, and regulatory molecules. T cells T cells are responsible for cell-mediated immunity. Lymphocytes derived from bone marrow migrate to the thymus, where they ma-ture into T cells. In cell-mediated immunity, T cells directly attack antigens, including bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. They have the ability to identify an antigen (target cell) and produce lymphokines that attack the target directly. Cell-mediated immu-nity is also responsible for tissue and transplant incompati- bility rejections and delayed hypersensitivity reactions (such as a positive tuberculin test response). There's definitely a T in team Different types of T cells work together to create the best immune response possible. Helper T cells (CD4/H11001 cells) stimulate B cells to mature into plasma cells that produce Igs to fight antigens and to also remember them if they occur again in the future. Search and destroy The helper T cells also help the killer T cells (CD8/H11001 cells) to more readily recognize the antigen and attack directly. Killer T cells bind to the surface of the invading antigen and dis- rupt the cell membrane, causing the antigen's destruction. Complement system The complement system is composed of several proteins that are important in the inflammatory process. It's activated by the antigen-antibody complexes (classic pathway) or toxins released by antigens (alternate pathway). The complement system is one of the body's primary defenses; it immediately assists in mast cell degradation, which enhances vas-cular permeability and assists in attracting neutrophils to the site.Memory jogger To re- member where B cells and T cells mature, mind your Bs and Ts: B cells = Bone marrowT cells = Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd Reserved.560HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions are one of the body's immune re- sponses to an antigen and may be immediate (occurring within minutes) or delayed (may take several hours). There are four types of hypersensitivity reactions, each serving a specific function. Type I: Atopy or anaphylaxis In some people, certain antigens (allergens) induce B-cell produc- tion of IgE, which binds to receptors on mast cell surfaces. The mast cells degranulate and release various mediators, including mucus secretion, leading to such symptoms as wheezing, hives, and rhinorrhea. Second time around IgE is produced in sufficient quantities only with repeated expo- sure and, therefore, may have little effect with occasional aller-gic reactions. Because severe reactions may not occur with the first exposure to a drug or allergen, the body may only produce antibodies, which will react with the second exposure. In severe reactions, anaphylaxis may occur, resulting in respiratory and cardiac arrest. Someone may not react to an antibiotic the first time\u2014even if they are allergic\u2014but react the second or third time. Type II: Cytotoxic response IgG and IgM are involved in tissue-specific hypersensitivity reac- tions (type II). The type II hypersensitivity response generally involves the destruction of a target cell by an antibody directed against cell-surface antigens. Deadly complement Binding of an antigen and an antibody activates the complement system, which ultimately disrupts the cellular membranes, causing cell death. Cytotoxic T cells and NK cells also contribute to tissue death in type II hypersensitivity. Examples of type II hypersensi- tivity include transfusion reactions and hemolytic disease in the neonate. Type III: Immune complex Immune complex-mediated (type III) reactions are similar to type II in that the complex recognizes the same type of antigen. How-ever, in type II, the antigen is found on the cell or organ surface, whereas in type III, the antigen is free-floating and is attacked regardless of where it's located. If the antigens are left in the Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 560 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 560 PM Kluwer.

Attack first, ask questions later Autoimmune disorders are caused by type III reactions in which the immune complexes have difficulty distinguishing between normal and abnormal tissue and may attack both. These disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. Type IV: Cell-mediated hypersensitivity In type IV hypersensitivity, antigen is processed by macrophages and presented to T cells. Release the lymphokines! T cells function by releasing lymphokines , which recruit and activate leukocytes. The coagulation (kinin) and complement pathways also contribute to tissue damage in this type of reaction. The most serious reactions occur with transplantation when the transplanted tissue is perceived as foreign and attacked. Type IV reactions also occur with exposure to plants or sub- stances that trigger a response resulting in contact dermatitis. Diagnostic tests Tests used to diagnose hematologic and immunologic problems in children include allergy skin testing, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and CBC with differential. Allergy skin testing Children commonly have short-term allergic problems that may disappear as the child grows older. A child older than age 2 years with a history of chronic allergic symptoms, such as coughing, runny nose, watery eyes, and upper respiratory congestion, may need to be evaluated for allergies. Symptom management with medications (such as antihistamines) is recommended until the child reaches age 4 years or older. If symptoms persist beyond this age, allergy testing may be warranted. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 561 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd All Rights Reserved.562HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Bone marrow aspiration is used to withdraw a small amount of bone marrow. In bone marrow biopsy, a small section of bone is removed.RAST to the rescue Allergy skin testing examines specific allergic antigens. The radio- allergosorbent test (RAST) identifies antigens in the blood that are causing an immunologic reaction mediated by IgE. The quantity of circulating IgE correlates well with the clinical severity of the allergic symptoms. The family tree of allergy When testing is started, a pediatric allergist obtains a detailed history from the family and the child in an attempt to identify the specific antigen. Allergy skin testing entails injecting small amounts of common allergic antigens under the skin (intrader- mal) to assess for localized reaction. RAST is recommended when there's a strong suspicion that a specific substance is responsible for the allergy problem. Nursing considerations Allergy shots run the risk of causing an anaphylactic reaction, and the nurse should be prepared to provide emergency care. The child should remain in the facility for at least 15 minutes after the shot to be monitored for an injection site reaction and signs of an impending anaphylactic reaction. A song and a wiggle The child should be prepared for injections (for testing and treatment) and given a \"job\" to do such as holding very still. Distraction techniques (such as telling the child to wiggle his toes or sing a song) may help reduce the child's anxiety and enhance cooperation. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy are slightly different tests that are usually done for the same rea-son. Both tests are done to view the integrity of function of the bone marrow as an organ. Bone bank withdrawal In bone marrow aspiration, a specially designed needle with a stylet is inserted into the center of the bone to with-draw bone marrow. The front and back crests of the iliac bone are most commonly sampled in children. In a bone marrow biopsy, a section of bone is taken, revealing all levels of bone and bone marrow. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 562 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 562 5/22/14 8:40 PM Rights Reserved.563DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Don't be alarmed! A WBC count of 15,000 to 20,000/\u00b5l is normal in a healthy neonate like me.To aspirate or biopsy\u2014that is the question Ideally, the marrow should show a wide variety of cell types in various stages of maturation. Primary, malignant, blast leuke-mic cells with few normal cells are seen in leukemia. When a solid tumor, such as neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma, has metastasized to the bone marrow, a biopsy may be more helpful in showing the clumps of tumor cells among some normal cells. Both tests show whether the bone marrow is functioning normally. Nursing considerations Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy can be performed under light general anesthesia or with a local injection to numb the area. An oral or intravenous (I.V.) sedative may be given before the proce- dure. Prepare the child for the test with an age-appropriate expla- nation, and monitor for sedation or adverse effects of anesthesia. Tell the child that a parent may stay with him during the test. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Apply a pressure dressing after the procedure, which should be sufficient to stop blood loss.\u0081 Be aware of the proper handling and labeling of the specimens to prevent the need to repeat the aspiration; multiple tests may be performed on the specimens obtained.\u0081 Provide a mild analgesic as ordered; postprocedure pain is short-term after aspiration and consists of a dull ache for about 24 hours after biopsy. CBC with differential One of the most important tests for general screening for hematologic and immune problems is the complete blood count (CBC). An additional test that may be ordered is the differential , which is used to determine the percentage of WBCs that are present. Decrease = disorder In general, the CBC reveals the numbers of the three main blood cells (WBCs, RBCs, and platelets). Decreased values in any cell line may be an indication of a disorder related to the bone marrow or the immune system or may be the result of infection. What's up with the whites? WBC counts vary with age. \u0081 A healthy neonate typically has higher counts of 15,000 to 20,000/\u00b5l, with 60% to 70% being lymphocytes. \u0081 The typical adult WBC count of 5,000 to 10,000/\u00b5l is generally present in children after age 2 years. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 563 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 563 5/22/14 8:40 PM Reserved.564HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS \u0081 Counts over 15,000/\u00b5l in children older than age 6 months should be considered high and abnormal (although this doesn't necessarily indicate serious illness). Seeing red Although the RBC count is included in the CBC, the hemoglobin level and hematocrit are usually used as a gauge of the number of RBCs present: \u0081 Hemoglobin is a molecule responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissue and is somewhat affected by age. Higher levels of 15 to 20 g/dl are present in the neonate but, within 2 months, the normal range will be 12 to 15 g/dl. \u0081 Hematocrit is approximately three times the level of hemoglo- bin, and normal ranges are 35% to 45%. This level is affected by hy- dration level and may be elevated with dehydration and decreased if the child has fluid overload. P ediatric and parental platelets Platelet counts should be between 150,000 and 500,000/mm3, re- gardless of age. Nursing considerations Prepare the child for venipuncture and allow the parent to be present to comfort the child. After the venipuncture, monitor the site for signs of continued bleeding. Treatments and procedures Treatments and procedures used for children with hematologic and immunologic problems include blood transfusion and bone marrow transplantation. Blood transfusion Blood transfusion is necessary if levels of blood cells become too low or if the child is experiencing symptoms caused by a decrease in the number of available cells. Pump up the vascular volume Generally, transfusions are aimed at increasing volume within the vascular system, increasing RBCs to improve oxygenation, or increasing the number of platelets to reduce or correct bleeding problems: \u0081 Whole blood is transfused if trauma with bleeding occurs and the risk of shock is present because of decreased Kluwer.

Reassure the child and his parents that the blood used for transfusion is safe.volume. Blood loss from surgery may also require whole blood to replace cells and plasma.\u0081 In children who have decreased levels of RBCs only, transfusion with packed RBCs is indicated. Because plasma is removed from these concentrated RBCs, transfusion increases intravascular volume only mini-mally (only small amounts of WBCs and platelets are contained in the transfused RBCs). \u0081 Platelets are transfused when counts are below 60,000/mm 3 with symptoms of active bleeding. If the count is below 20,000/mm3, transfusion with platelets is recom- mended due to the risk of spontaneous intracranial bleeding, which can lead to death. Nursing considerations Prepare the child and his parents for the procedure. Re-assure the parents (and the child, if old enough) about the measures that are taken to ensure the safety of transfused blood products. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Double-check the child's name, identification number, name bracelet, ABO group, and Rh status with another nurse to help prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions. If there's a discrepancy, don't administer the blood product and notify the blood bank immediately.\u0081 Start the blood transfusion within 30 minutes after it arrives from the blood bank. If you can't start the transfusion in this time-frame, return the blood product to the blood bank.\u0081 Take baseline vital signs just before the start of the transfusion and every 15 minutes during the transfusion. Bone marrow transplantation Bone marrow transplantation is used to treat such diseases as acute leukemia, aplastic ane-mia, and severe combined immunodeficiency disease. The hematopoietic stem cells may be malignant themselves or may have been de-stroyed by aggressive therapy for malignant disease. Sometimes the stem cells are absent or just don't work like aplastic anemia. Share and share alike With transplantation, marrow or stem cells are transplanted from a twin or another human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor (usually a sibling) in the All Rights Reserved.566HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS stem cells will produce normal, healthy cells. Autologous bone marrow transplantation is another option for some patients. In this procedure, the patient's own marrow or stem cells are harvested from healthy tissues or harvested and then treated to re- move malignant cells. The cells are then returned to the patient. A harvest of plenty During bone marrow harvest, marrow is extracted from a matched donor with multiple bone marrow aspirations; 200 to 500 ml of marrow are collected, processed, and purified. Getting ready to receive The recipient is given high-dose chemotherapy to destroy the malignant marrow and WBCs that might cause a reaction. On the day of the transplant, the recipient is given total-body radiation to further destroy components of the malignant bone marrow and to destroy WBCs throughout the body that may identify the trans-fused cells as foreign and destroy them. From harvest to seed The collected donor marrow, which looks like a blood product, is then transfused through an I.V. line. If the transfusion is success-ful, the transplanted stem cells will reseed the bone marrow and start producing normal blood cells. Graft battles host A great risk after bone marrow transplantation is that the new bone marrow may produce B cells that interpret the normal body tissue as being foreign and attack it. This is commonly seen in the skin, eyes, liver, and other organs and is known as graft- versus-host disease (GVHD). The donated cells must be HLA-matched to prevent GVHD. Typically, this complication will start after the stem cells have engrafted (about 2 weeks after the transplant). Although some GVHD may not be harmful, if the stem cells continue to produce cells that attack tissue, the effect can be dramatic, with sloughing of skin, organ malfunction or failure, and eventual death. Nursing considerations The donor and the recipient should be prepared for the procedure with age-appropriate explanations. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Administer immunosuppressants, such as steroids and cyclo- sporine (Sandimmune), Kluwer.

Hematologic and immunologic disorders Hematologic and immunologic disorders that may affect children include acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), allergic rhinitis, aplastic anemia, atopic dermatitis, hemophilia, Hodgkin's disease, iron deficiency anemia, leukemia, sickle cell anemia, SLE, and thalassemia. HIV/AIDS The identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s foreshadowed a worldwide epidemic that crosses all ethnic, cultural, and age barriers. Although the initial cases were primarily among gay men, the virus then expanded into all groups, including infants and children. What causes it HIV, a retrovirus, has the ability to enter a cell and incorpo- rate itself into the cell's ribonucleic acid, essentially chang-ing the genetic structure and causing the cell to slowly die. A stranger in friend's clothing Because HIV becomes part of the cell, the body's normal defense mechanisms (from the immune system) don't recognize it as foreign, and the virus goes unchallenged. Out of control From the first single cell, the virus replicates and then enters other cells, eventually infecting several cells and rendering them nonfunctional. When a large number of cells become infected, the normal ability to control common organisms is compromised, and the person develops AIDS.

All Rights Reserved.568HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS How it happens Transmission of HIV occurs by contact with infected blood or body fluids and is associated with identifiable, high-risk behaviors, including sexual intercourse with multiple partners, I.V. drug use, and pregnancies in HIV-infected women. It's different for kids The mode of transmission in children has always been different from that in adults. Although transmission in adolescents may occur from sexual contact or I.V. drug use, these issues aren't common factors in transmission to the younger child. Potential sources of infection in children include:\u0081 being born to an untreated, infected mother\u0081 breast-feeding from an infected mother \u0081 blood transfusions with HIV-tainted blood products (hemo- philiacs with contaminated factor VIII or other factor products that were pooled from multiple donors before blood donations were routinely screened). Destructive domino effect HIV has a particular affinity for the CD4/H11001 helper T cell as well as monocytes and macrophages. The virus invades these cells and ren- ders them nonfunctional, resulting in suppressed cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The degree of immunosuppression will progress and, eventually, result in opportunistic infection and even death. Diagnosing HIV/AIDS HIV was historically suspected when a person developed an indi- cator disease listed in the following chart and a CD4/H11001 count was monitored and the antibody was detected. The current method for diagnosing a person as being HIV positive is to detect the virus itself and look at the \"viral load\" to determine the extent of the in- fection. This allows for quicker diagnosis because the body takes time to develop an antibody. A person now is considered to have AIDS if the CD4 /H11001 lymphocyte count is below 200. What to look for In adults, the diagnosis of AIDS was historically based on CD4/H11001 counts and the presence of indicator diseases , which are oppor- tunistic infections associated with HIV disease. (See Indicator diseases and HIV .) In children, these diseases are less common until the infection is more severe. However, infants and children are particularly sus-ceptible to fungal diseases. Children who are HIV-positive tend to have repeated bacterial infections, such as otitis media, that don't respond to All Rights Reserved.569HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS Indicator diseases and HIV This chart describes some common infections associated with HIV disease in children, along with their characteristic signs and symptoms, and their treatments. They are no longer required to diagnose AIDS. Infection Signs and symptoms Treatment Bacterial Mycobacterium avium complex A primary infection acquired by oral ingestion or inhalation; can in-fect the bone marrow, liver, spleen, GI tract, lymph nodes, lungs, skin, brain, adrenal glands, and kidneys; is chronic and may be localized and disseminated in its course of infectionMultiple, nonspecific symptoms con- sistent with systemic illness (fever, fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, abdominal pain, and chronic diarrhea); physical examination findings: emaciation, lymphadenopathy, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopeniaTreatment regimens vary and can include two to six drugs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommend that every patient take either azithromycin (Zithromax) or clarithromycin (Biaxin). Many experts prefer ethambutol (Myambutol) drugs caused by the fungus Candida albicans that exists on teeth, gingivae, and skin and in the oropharynx, vagina, and large intestine; majority of infections are endogenous and related to inter- ruption of normal defense mecha- nisms; possible human-to-human transmission, including transmission in neonates (who de-velop thrush after vaginal delivery)Thrush (the most prevalent form in HIV-infected individuals): creamy, curdlike, white patches surrounded by an erythematous base, found on any oral mucosal surface; nail infec- tion: inflammation and tenderness of tissue surrounding the nails or the nail itself; vaginitis: intense pruritus of the Pneumonia caused by ; also has properties of fungal infec- tion; exists in human lungs and is transmitted by airborne exposure; the most common life-threatening opportunistic infection in individu- als with AIDSFever, fatigue, and weight loss for several weeks to months before respiratory symptoms develop; respiratory symptoms : dyspnea (usually noted initially on exertion and later at rest) and cough (usually starting out dry and nonproductive and later becoming productive)Co-trimoxazole (Bactrim) may be given orally or I.V., although about 20% of patients with AIDS are hypersensitive to sulfa drugs. I.V. pentamidine may be given but can cause many adverse effects, including permanent diabetes mellitus. prevention and follow-ing treatment includes co-trimoxazole, Rights Reserved.570HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS The incubation period for children averages only 17 months, and the signs and symptoms of HIV resemble those in adults. Ini- tially, the child may have flulike symptoms and then may remain asymptomatic for years. As the disease progresses, neurologic signs from HIV encephalopathy and symptoms of an opportunistic infection may manifest. (See HIV classification in children .) What tests tell you Virologic assays that directly detect HIV (such as HIV DNA poly- merase chain reaction and HIV RNA assays) must be used to di-agnose HIV infection in infants younger than 18 months. Virologic diagnostic testing in infants with known perinatal HIV exposure is recommended at ages 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to Indicator diseases and HIV (continued) Infection Signs and symptoms Treatment Protozoan (continued) Cryptosporidiosis An intestinal infection caused by the protozoan Cryptosporidium; transmitted by person-to-person contact, water, food contaminants, and airborne exposure; small intes-tine is the watery diarrheaNo treatment currently exists that can eradicate the infecting organism.

Virologic diagnostic testing at birth should be con- sidered for infants at high risk of HIV infection. A positive viro-logic test should be confirmed as soon as possible by a repeat virologic test on a second specimen. HIV antibody assays alone can be used for diagnosis of HIV infection in children with peri-natal exposure who are 18 months of age or older and in children with nonperinatal exposure. Screen with ELIZA, confirm with the blot In children and adolescents with nonperinatal exposure to HIV, the recommended protocol is initial screening with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After checking and re- checking the results, findings are confirmed by the Western blot test or an immunofluorescence assay. Back-up blood tests Other blood tests support the diagnosis and are used to evaluate the severity of immunosuppression:\u0081 The CD4 /H11001 and CD8/H11001 cell subset counts determine the risk of HIV being converted to AIDS. As the CD4/H11001 level lowers, the risk of AIDS conversion increases, with levels below 200 cells/\u00b5l considered diagnostic of AIDS (with or without the presence of another disease or condition).HIV classification in children The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's revised classification system for HIV-infected children is based on four categories. Category Symptoms and criteria Category A A child is mildly symptomatic when he has two or more symptoms, such as enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen or recurrent or persistent upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, or otitis media. Category B A child is moderately symptomatic if he has developed more serious illnesses, such as oropharyngeal candidiasis, bacterial meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, hyperplasia complex, or toxoplasmosis. Category C A child is severely symptomatic if he has developed serious bacterial i nfections, such as septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, bone or joint infections, or abscess of an internal organ or body cavity or infec- tions, such as candidiasis (esophageal or pulmonary), encephalopathy, lasting longer or Pneumocystis children rarely develop Kaposi's sarcoma. Category N A child is not symptomatic if he or she has no signs or symptoms considered to be the result of HIV infection or if he or she has only one of the conditions listed in Category A. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 571 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 571 5/22/14 8:40 PM Reserved.572HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS \u0081 CD8/H11001 killer T cell counts are monitored, as is the ratio of CD4/H11001 to CD8/H11001, which may give an indication of decreased percentage of CD4/H11001 cells, and AIDS conversion. \u0081 A CBC may provide an overall view of the health of the child but a special test is required to distinguish between types of lymphocytes. Complications Complications of HIV infection may include opportunistic infec- tions, failure to thrive and nutritional deficits, malignancies, and HIV encephalopathy. In addition to treatment for HIV itself, the patient may be on various drugs to treat or control opportunistic infections, including antibiotics for bacterial infection, steroids for control of symptoms, and chemotherapy if malignancies are present. These drugs can cause an array of severe adverse reac- tions, including peripheral neuropathy, seizures, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. How it's treated There's no cure for HIV infection; however, several types of drugs are used to treat the disease and prolong life. Many treatment protocols combine three or more drugs to produce the maximum benefit with the fewest adverse reactions. Combination therapy also helps to inhibit the production of mutant HIV strains resistant to particular drugs. The 076 study (named after research number) In the late 1980s, the National Institutes of Health conducted a study involving several medical centers across the country designed to reduce the incidence of HIV-positive babies born to HIV-positive mothers. Historically, about 33% of babies born to HIV-positive mothers would be infected with the virus. By treat-ing the mother in the last month of pregnancy and the baby upon birth, the risk was reduced to about 8%. This dramatic decrease established the need to identify and treat all HIV pregnant women. Do-good drugs Several drugs are known to be effective against HIV and can be used in different combinations. Current treatment may depend on several factors including renal status and resistance patterns. Detailed preferred and alternative regimens are outlined in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web site Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.573HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS Sometimes, having someone just listen is the best medicine for a family dealing with HIV/AIDS.\u0081 darunavir/ritonavir /H11001 TDF/FTC \u0081 raltegravir (RAL) /H11001 TDF/FTC What to do Many parents and children equate this diagnosis with a death sentence. Despite the increasing numbers of people who are living with AIDS (because of new treatments), the diagnosis is likely to be terrifying and devastating to the entire family. People who are HIV positive may live long lives and HIV may be considered a chronic disease in some persons. A listening ear The diagnosis is also profoundly distressing because of the disease's social impact and the discouraging prognosis. Listen to the child and his parents because they may feel alone and isolated and may need a safe person with whom they can talk. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Use standard precautions to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. \u0081 Monitor the child for changes in vital signs, especially low- grade fevers of above 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C). Infection detection \u0081 Observe for evidence of infection or lesions, including signs of skin breakdown, cough, sore throat, and diarrhea.\u0081 Maintain strict confidentiality as a stigma remains with this disease and the family may not want the diagnosis to be common knowledge.\u0081 Refer the family to counselors and agencies that can help them cope with the diagnosis as well as provide concrete forms of assistance (such as help with finances and transportation and educating day care or school personnel).\u0081 Educate family members on symptoms of infections that may be of concern and make everyone aware of standard precautions (use of gloves) when dealing with the child's bodily fluids. Allergic rhinitis Inhaled airborne antigens, such as dust and pollen, may cause an immune response that results in watery eyes (allergic conjunctivi-tis) or an inflammation of the nasal mucosa (rhinitis). Depending on the allergen, allergic rhinitis may occur seasonally (hay fever) or year-round (perennial allergic rhinitis). What causes it Allergic rhinitis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE. Hay fever occurs in the spring, summer, and fall and is Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 573 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd All Rights Reserved.574HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS usually induced by airborne pollens from trees, grass, and weeds. In the summer and fall, mold spores may also cause it. It may be difficult to identify the exact source of allergic rhini- tis. Major perennial allergens and irritants include: \u0081 house dust and molds and fungi \u0081 animal dander \u0081 processed materials or industrial chemicals\u0081 tobacco smoke, directly or from clothes worn while smoking (a major offender in children). Hope for the future Children who have allergic symptoms beginning before age 2 years may outgrow them or may have reduced symptoms with time. How it happens Once the antigen is recognized by the immune system, a type I hypersensitivity reaction occurs. IgE is created by the conversion of B cells to plasma cells. Histamine release results in the swell- ing of the mucous membranes. Secondary sinus infections and middle ear infections may be triggered, and nasal polyps caused by edema and infection may increase nasal obstruction. What to look for Allergic rhinitis may produce symptoms that vary by age and may be difficult to distinguish from viral upper respiratory infections: \u0081 The patient complains of sneezing attacks, rhinorrhea (profuse, watery nasal discharge), nasal obstruction or congestion, itching nose and eyes, and headache or sinus pain.\u0081 Allergic rhinitis doesn't normally cause fever unless a secondary infection is present; fever with viral illnesses, such as an upper respiratory infection, isn't uncommon.\u0081 A family history of allergies, asthma, and atopic dermatitis ( eczema) may indicate that symptoms are IgE mediated.\u0081 Symptoms lasting longer than 2 weeks may indicate a more allergic than infective cause, especially if the child hasn't had a fever. (See Allergic shiners .) What tests tell you Most laboratory tests aren't helpful in determining if a short-term illness is an allergy. A large number of eosinophils are seen in specimens of sputum and nasal secretions. The activity of the eosinophils isn't completely understood, but they're known to destroy parasitic organisms and play a role in allergic reactions.Allergic shiners In allergic shiners, blood circulation around the eye backs up around the orbit, resulting in dark circles under the eyes or Dennie's sign (a peculiar horizontal Reserved.575HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS Antihistamines at bedtime help a child be bright- eyed, bushy-tailed, and ready (if not willing) for school in the morning.Sneezing in your sleep CBC will be normal with either short- or long-term allergic prob- lems but may be helpful in ruling out a more serious illness if fever is present. Skin testing for allergies, or RAST , is helpful after the symptoms are present for several weeks and begin to affect the quality of life, especially by causing sleep disturbances. Short-term or less severe allergic rhinitis remains primarily a clinical diagnosis in children. Complications Complications of allergic rhinitis are rarely serious but affect the quality of life of the child and his family. The child may have sleep disturbances from a runny nose, frequent sneezing, or coughing caused by postnasal drip. The nose knows Nosebleeds (epistaxis) may occur as a result of the allergic rhi- nitis itself or from overuse of medications, which dries mucous membranes. Children with allergic rhinitis are more susceptible to otitis media, sinusitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, and other infec- tions of the upper respiratory tract. How it's treated Treatment of allergic rhinitis is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing infection. Treatment may include removing the environmental allergen and administering drug therapy. Anti- histamines block histamine release and decrease the overall reaction and swelling of the tissue. This action reduces the inflammation of the mucous membranes and decreases nasal drainage. Overuse of antihistamines may dry out the mucous membranes, causing sneezing and nosebleeds. Timing is everything One adverse effect of antihistamines (diphenhydramine [Benadryl]) in children is sedation. Use of antihistamines should be avoided before going to school and are usually more appropriate at bedtime or naptime. Newer antihista- mines, such as loratadine (Claritin) and cetirizine (Zyrtec), have been approved for use in older children and are nonsedating. Up your nose with a nasal spray! Other therapies may include topical nasal corticosteroids to con- trol exacerbations. Long-term management may include immu-notherapy or desensitization with injections of allergen extracts administered preseasonally, seasonally, or Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 575 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd Reserved.576HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Atopic dermatitis sets up a vicious cycle. Itching leads to scratching, which causes vasoconstriction and makes itching even worse!What to do Stress the importance of taking daily antihistamines, and teach the parents and child about their potential adverse effects and ways to reduce the child's exposure to the identified environmental allergen: \u0081 Monitor a child who has received an allergy injection for at least 30 minutes to detect adverse reactions.\u0081 Determine if family history is consistent with allergic problems and be aware that asthma is more common with familial history of allergies. \u0081 Because many of the allergy medications are over-the-counter, make sure the parent is giving the correct dose. Atopic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema , is a chronic condition of the skin characterized by superficial skin inflammation and intense itching. The skin doesn't hold moisture or oil and becomes dry, scaly, and itchy. Although this disorder may appear at any age, it typically begins during infancy or early childhood. What causes it The exact cause is unknown but an allergic component is strongly suspected. A family history commonly reveals adults with childhood histories of atopic dermatitis, other forms of aller- gies, or asthma. To matters worse . . . Exacerbating factors include irritants, skin infections (commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus ), and some allergens. Exposure to food allergens (such as milk pro- teins, soybeans, fish, or nuts) may coincide with flare-ups of atopic dermatitis. How it happens Scratching the skin causes vasoconstriction and intensifies itch- ing, resulting in reddened, weeping lesions. Eventually, the lesions become scaly and lichenified. Usually, they're located in areas of flexion and extension, such as the neck, antecubital fossa, popliteal folds, and behind the ears. In infants, the lesions are also common on the cheeks and may look like a windburn. What to look for Atopic dermatitis begins with skin drying and then cracking, even- tually leading to open sores with bleeding. These open sores are susceptible to secondary infections. Children commonly scratch Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 576 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 576 5/22/14 8:40 PM Reserved.577HEMATOLOGIC IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS To manage dermatitis, there's a \"laundry\" list of do's and don'ts.in their sleep and can do most of the skin damage at that time if the itching isn't controlled. Heat, sweating, dry skin, and cloth-ing with wool or coarse materials tend to worsen the itching sensation. (See Infant with atopic dermatitis .) What tests tell you Elevated levels of IgE and eosinophils are seen in this disorder, but routine laboratory values, such as CBC, aren't affected. Al-lergy testing may be warranted in the older child, but avoiding the allergen may not affect the course of atopic dermatitis. Complications Atopic dermatitis may disrupt the family in general because it's a chronic condition that requires daily care. The child may have sleep difficulties from constant pruritus (itching). From scratching to scarring Skin damage from scratching leaves the child susceptible to secondary infection that may require either topical treatment with antibiotic ointment or systemic antibiotics. Scarring may occur due to excoriations from scratching. How it's treated Measures to ease this chronic disorder include meticulous skin care with moisturizers such as petroleum jelly, environmental control of offending allergens, and drug therapy (often topical steroids). The overall treatment plan is aimed at controlling the symptoms\u2014particularly the pruritus\u2014and restoring moisture to the skin to prevent further drying. Too clean, too dry Excessive bathing leads to further reduction of skin oils and worsens the dryness. Once-daily bathing in warm water with cream-based soaps, such as Tone, Dove, Caress, or Ivory cream, can relieve symptoms. Frequent application of nonirri- tating topical lubricants is important, especially after bathing or showering. Vaseline and Crisco shortening have been used in the past with some positive results and may be alternatives for families with limited budgets. Wash, then wear\u2014hold the bleach Minimizing exposure to irritants, such as wool and harsh detergents, also helps control symptoms. New clothes should be washed before wearing to avoid exposure to irritating dyes or chemicals.

Drug therapy involves the use of topical corticosteroids and an-tipruritics. A mild steroid cream, such as hydrocortisone 1%, can relieve the inflammation and associated itching and may be mas- saged into the affected area two to three times per day for 1 week. Diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine (Atarax) are effective antipruritics but may cause sedation. These medications are especially useful at bedtime to reduce nighttime scratching and resulting skin damage. What to do The nurse plays an important role in the management of atopic dermatitis and is commonly the key source of critical daily care plans for minimizing the impact of this condition on the child and his family: \u0081 Instruct all caretakers about the management of the skin lesions.\u0081 Make the family aware that atopic dermatitis is a chronic condi- tion that isn't usually related to an identifiable allergen. \u0081 Make sure the parents are aware of such serious complica-tions as infection and emphasize the need for evaluation of any open, draining areas. Hemophilia A hereditary bleeding disorder, hemophilia results from a deficiency of specific clotting factors. Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia) results from deficiency of factor VIII; hemophilia B (Christmas disease) results from deficiency of factor IX. There are two less common types of hemophilia. Hemophilia C is a deficiency of factor XI. Von Willebrand's disease includes a defi-ciency in von Willebrand's factor, an important protein necessary for platelet adhesion. What causes it The inheritance pattern is X-linked recessive in about 80% of all hemophilia cases. Hemophilia C is transmitted by an autosomal recessive trait in both sexes. Von Willebrand's disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 578 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 578 Kluwer. Rights Reserved.579HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS How it happens Hemophilia produces mild to severe abnormal bleeding. After a platelet plug develops at a bleeding site, the lack of clotting factor prevents a stable fibrin clot from forming. Although hemorrhaging usually doesn't occur immediately, delayed bleeding is common. A matter of degrees Hemophilia may be severe, moderate, or mild, depending on the degree of normal clotting (factor VIII) activity:\u0081 In severe disease, there's less than 1% normal clotting activity. \u0081 In moderate disease, there's 1% to 5% normal clotting activity. \u0081 In mild disease, there's 5% to 50% normal clotting activity. Most children with hemophilia (60% to 70%) demonstrate the severe form. What to look for There's usually a family history of hemophilia or bleeding prob- lems in men. The circumcision clue Bleeding can occur spontaneously, and the neonate may have pro-longed bleeding times with routine blood collection for neonate tests. It's also common to diagnose hemophilia when the child has excessive and prolonged bleeding after circumcision. Mountain out of a molehill Later, spontaneous or disproportionately severe bleeding after minor trauma may produce large subcutaneous and deep intra-muscular hematomas. Signs and symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion include restlessness, anxiety, confusion, pallor, cool and clammy skin, chest pain, decreased urine output, hypotension, and tachycardia. What tests tell you \u0081 A coagulation screen shows a normal prothrombin time (PT) with a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT).\u0081 Factor VIII coagulant activity is decreased in hemophilia A and is normal in hemophilia B. \u0081 Factor IX is decreased in hemophilia B and normal in hemo-philia A.\u0081 Platelet aggregation and platelet count is normal A and Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 579 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd Rights Reserved.580HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS P arents of a child with hemophilia must become safety experts!Complications Any type of hemophilia puts the child at risk for bleed- ing\u2014even with normal activities\u2014making it extremely important to take safety precautions during activities that could place the child at risk. Head's up! The greatest risk is with a head injury with intracranial bleeding or bleeding into joints. Joint mobility may be affected with re-peated joint injury and may cause decreased range of motion. Any injury may cause bleeding into tissue that may require clot- ting factor transfusion and hospitalization for monitoring. The incredible expanding spleen Injury of the spleen with resulting bleeding may be life- threatening as the spleen expands with blood, causing hypovolemic shock. Historically, hemophiliacs were infected in large numbers with HIV and hepatitis C before screening for these viruses in blood products was started. How it's treated Hemophilia isn't curable, but treatment can prevent crippling deformities and prolong life. Increasing plasma levels of deficient clotting factors helps prevent disabling deformities caused by re- peated bleeding into muscles, joints, and organs. Everyone in the pool! Hemophilia A or B can be treated with pooled factor obtained from blood products. Historically, these products ran a risk of transmitting viral illness, but current recombinant factor VIII and IX are safe and free from viral infection. Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is a synthetic vasopressin analog. It has a minimal antidi-uretic effect but does increase the factor VIII level up to fourfold. It has no effect on factor IX. Hemophilia C and von Willebrand's disease are treated with DDAVP , and factor VIII replenishment may also help in von Willebrand's disease. What to do The nurse's role involves educating the parents about safety issues while monitoring the child for acute problems. The child must be-come accustomed to restrictions in activities and precautions that may make him feel different from his peers. Counseling may be needed to help the child deal with these issues and to help ensure compliance. In addition, follow these steps:\u0081 Observe for evidence of bruising, bleeding, or change in mental status. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 580 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 580 5/22/14 8:40 PM Rights Reserved.581HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 If transfusions are ordered, monitor for blood product reac- tions, such as fever, chills, or irritability. Do try this at home \u0081 Because home infusions are commonly done (minimizing the need for hospitalization), educate the parents about the process and refer them to a home care infusion agency. \u0081 Teach the family about age-appropriate safety measures, includ- ing padding hard surfaces and, later, wearing a bicycle helmet and other protective gear during sports activities.\u0081 Teach the parents to recognize signs of bleeding by monitor- ing for nosebleeds and color of stool. Fresh blood in stool or black, tarry stools are signs of gastric bleeding; excessive swal-lowing during sleep may be a sign of bleeding and swallowing the blood. Quash the rebellion \u0081 As the child grows older, assess his participation in new activi- ties and reinforce the need for safety measures. Including the child in these discussions and allowing him as much choice as possible will help keep the growing child's normal tendency to rebel against restrictions in check.\u0081 Make families aware of such support groups as the National Hemophilia Foundation, and inform them about any local support sources. Hodgkin's lymphoma Hodgkin's lymphoma, formerly known as Hodgkin's disease, is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. In the pediatric age-group, it affects primarily adolescents, although children as young as age 3 years have been diagnosed with the disease. This type of cancer causes painless, progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and other lymphoid tissue. And the good news is . . . Although the disease is fatal if untreated, recent advances have made Hodgkin's lymphoma potentially curable, even in advanced stages. With appropriate treatment, more than 90% of patients live at least 5 years. What causes it Like most malignancies, the exact cause is unknown. It's found worldwide and can occur at any age but is most common after the second decade of life. It is known that most Hodgkin's lym- phoma occurs when B cells develop a mutation the DNA. The Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 581 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd All Rights Reserved.582HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS mutation causes a large number of oversized, abnormal B cells to accumulate in the lymphatic system, where they crowd out healthy cells and cause the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma. How it happens Lymph nodes, most typically in the chest and neck area, take a malignant turn and don't grow into normal lymphatic tissue. The malignant nodes become hard and enlarged, leading to firm-to- hard masses in the neck and chest. Bigger isn't better Enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues results from proliferation of lymphocytes, histiocytes and, rarely, eosinophils. Patients also have distinct chromosome abnor- malities in their lymph node cells. What to look for Hard, swollen lymph nodes of the supraclavicular, axillary, or groin areas that aren't erythematous or tender are classic charac-teristics of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Imaging tests used to diagnose Hodgkin's lymphoma include X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Spreading swelling The painless swelling of the lymph nodes progresses to the axil- lary, inguinal, mediastinal, and mesenteric regions. (See Staging Hodgkin's lymphoma .) In addition to the symptoms of the primary disease, secondary symptoms associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma (any of which warrants bone marrow biopsy to assess for more extensive disease) may include: \u0081 unexplained fever above 100.4\u00b0 F (38\u00b0 C) \u0081 night sweats without fever\u0081 unexplained weight loss of more than 10% of total body weight in the previous 6 months\u0081 severe pruritus causing skin excoriation. What tests tell you CBC is usually normal unless the child has anemia from malnutri- tion or bone marrow involvement. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be elevated, but this test is nonspecific and ESR may be elevated with any infection. Bone marrow biopsy may rule out or confirm metastatic disease. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 582 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 582 DISORDERS Staging Hodgkin's lymphoma Treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma depends on its stage (the number, location, and degree of involved lymph nodes). The Ann Arbor classification system, adopted in 1971, divides Hodgkin's lymphoma into four stages, which are then subdivided into categories. Category A includes patients without defined signs and symptoms, and category B includes patients who experience such defined signs as recent, unexplained weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Stage I Hodgkin's lymphoma appears in a single lymph node region or a single extralymphatic organ.Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma appears in two or more nodes on the same side of the diaphragm and in an extralymphatic organ.Stage III Hodgkin's lymphoma spreads to both sides of the diaphragm and, per-haps, to an extralymphatic organ, the spleen, or both.Stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma disseminates, involving one or more extralymphatic organ or tissues, with or without associated lymph node involvement. Chest X-ray makes diagnosis of a mediastinal mass a snap. CT scanning and MRI can confirm enlarged nodes in other areas.Verify, then confirm Chest radiography that verifies the presence of a medi- astinal mass remains the easiest way to confirm the diag-nosis, but further evaluation with enhanced CT scanning or MRI will confirm the presence of other enlarged nodes throughout the body. Bone, liver, and spleen scans may help determine whether metastatic disease is present. It's a hoot! A lymphangiogram has historically been used to identify enlarged nodes but is less valuable now that improved radiologic studies are available. The diagnosis must be confirmed by lymph node biopsy showing the presence of Reed-Sternberg cell (a double nucleus cell that looks like an owl) or malignant lymphatic tissue consistent with a histologic type of Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.584HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Combination therapy with the COPP/MOPP protocol is the mainstay of chemotherapy enlarging nodes that may restrict lung movement and create respiratory distress. The nodes may also press against the heart, causing cardiac arrhythmias if the mass is large and untreated. Metastatic disease may cause anemia and decreased blood counts if bone marrow disease is extensive. It may invade and compromise bone, the liver, or the spleen. When treatment gets complicated Today, most complications are related more to therapy, with short- and long-term consequences:\u0081 Short-term radiation may cause severe, localized skin reactions, although usually less severe than those seen in adult malignancies as doses are lower in children.\u0081 Immunosuppression with decreased ability to fight all types of infection is common with decreased blood counts from chemo- therapy. \u0081 Anemia is common, although transfusion may not be required.\u0081 Lowered platelet counts are seen but usually aren't severe and rarely cause major bleeding prob-lems. If the platelet count is below 60,000/mm 3 or hemoglobin is below 8 g/dl, transfusion with a specific blood product may be considered. Long-term legacy One of the most severe, long-term problems of Hodgkin's lymphoma is secondary malignancies, which develop in up to 5% of long-term survivors. Acute myelocytic leukemia is the most common. Sterility is another severe long-term complication and is caused by chemotherapeutic agents. Radiation may cause decreased bone and tissue growth, which can be a major cause of scoliosis and kyphosis in childhood survivors. How it's treated Hodgkin's disease was one of the first malignancies to demonstrate the superiority of treatment with multiple chemotherapeutic agents (versus a single agent). Mopping the floor The mechlorethamine, Oncovin (vincristine), procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) research protocol of the mid-1960s immediately changed the prognosis for Hodgkin's disease to a survival rate of more than 50% in adults and children. The Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 584 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 584 5/22/14 8:40 PM Kluwer. Rights Reserved.585HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS drugs from the MOPP protocol remain staples of therapy, al- though the less toxic cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may be used in place of mechlorethamine in children. Several other drugs may be effective, including doxorubicin (Adriamycin), bleomycin (Blenoxane), and vinblastine (Velban). What to do Care of children with malignancies is usually coordinated through one of several pediatric oncology centers. Nursing care is based on the treatment protocol and understanding the adverse effects of the drugs and therapies used: \u0081 Watch for and promptly report adverse effects of radiation and chemotherapy (particularly anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and bleeding). \u0081 Minimize adverse effects of radiation therapy by maintain- ing good nutrition, encouraging fluid intake, pacing activities to counteract therapy-induced fatigue, and keeping the skin dry in irradiated areas.\u0081 Prepare the child (and his parents) for all tests and treatments, including adverse effects of therapy. Encourage the child to ex-press his feelings, which may include fear and anger. \u0081 Provide emotional support and offer appropriate reassurance. Make sure the family knows that the local chapter of the American Cancer Society is available for information, financial assistance, and supportive counseling. Iron deficiency anemia Iron deficiency anemia is a disorder of oxygen transport in which the amount of hemoglobin circulating in the blood is inadequate. Without sufficient iron, the body can't produce the hemoglobin molecule because the heme component is primarily iron. Some heavy competition Excesses of other heavy metals (such as lead) may com- pete for iron-binding sites and cause a lack of hemo-globin that may lead to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency anemia is most common in the youngest and oldest children in the pediatric age range (infants and tod-dlers, and adolescents). What causes it Iron deficiency anemia can be caused by inadequate intake of iron in the diet, malabsorption of iron through the GI tract, or chronic blood loss.o c om- cy Heavy metals compete for iron - bindin g sites and lack o f hemoglobin can lead to iron deficienc y. I think I'll sti ck with f olk Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.586HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS A gift from mom In the last trimester of pregnancy, the fetus draws what iron it needs from the mother. In the last month, it draws enough iron stores for approximately 6 to 12 months. If the mother is deficient in iron or the neonate is more than 4 weeks premature, the infant may not have sufficient iron stores and, eventually, becomes anemic. This condition is usually evident by 9 to 12 months of life but can occur earlier if the child is more premature, especially less than 32 weeks' gestation. How it happens Anytime there is blood loss, there is loss of iron. Adoles- cents with heavy menses are at risk for iron deficiency anemia because they lose blood during menstruation. GI bleeding can result from regular use of some over-the- counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. If too little iron is consumed, over time, children can become iron deficient. Iron from food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine. An intestinal disorder, such as celiac disease, which affects the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron deficiency anemia. If part of the small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect the body's ability to absorb iron and other nutrients. In developing countries, a leading cause of iron deficiency is infestation from parasitic worms (hookworms, whipworms, roundworms). Got milk? Cow's milk allergy (common in Blacks and Asians), due to heat- labile protein in cow's milk, causes inflammation of the GI tract with chronic blood loss and decreased absorption. This allergy is a common source of iron deficiency anemia. In adolescents, iron deficiency anemia is commonly related to fad dieting and overcon-sumption of snack foods containing little or no iron. You are what you eat Adolescent girls are at risk for iron deficiency anemia during their growth spurt and at the beginning of menses, especially if periods are irregular. Adolescent boys are at a lower risk, although boys and girls may have poor dietary habits or eat fad diet foods. Vege- tarians and vegans aren't at increased risk if they plan their diets with adequate sources of iron. What to look for Clinical symptoms may be mild until anemia is severe, causing a pale appearance and decreased activity. Toddlers may have a in an all lly, and ng cause of Who knew? Most o f the iron used to build hemoglobin comes from the GI tr act,rr where it's resorbed from dead RBC s.

Other symptoms include:\u0081 fatigue \u0081 inability to concentrate \u0081 palpitations\u0081 dyspnea on exertion\u0081 craving for nonnutritive substances such as ice, dirt, or starch \u0081 tachycardia \u0081 dry, brittle nails\u0081 concave, or \"spoon-shaped,\" fingernails. What tests tell you Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell distribution width (RDW), and ferritin tests may be used in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. Lower than normal hemoglobin levels indicate anemia. The nor- mal ranges for children vary depending on the child's age and sex. Hematocrit is the percentage of the blood volume made up by RBCs. Like hemoglobin, the hematocrit values differ according to the child's age. The RDW will show RBCs that are smaller and paler in color than normal cells in children with iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin is a protein that helps the body store iron. A low level of ferritin usually indicates a low level of stored iron. Bleached out bull's eye Iron deficiency anemia is a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, meaning the RBCs are small and pale. RBCs with decreased iron appear bleached out, resembling a bull's eye target. Because the cells are small, the mean corpuscular volume, the mean corpuscu- lar hemoglobin, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentra-tion are low. Serum iron levels are decreased. Complications Untreated iron deficiency anemia can cause stress on all body tissue, with decreased oxygenation. Severe anemia poses the greatest risk to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Increasing evidence suggests that children with even mild iron deficiency have less ability to concentrate and greater difficulty in school. Overtreatment with replacement iron can occur when toxic levels of iron build up, which may cause excessive iron deposits, affecting the liver, heart, pituitary glands, and joints. Pica may lead to eating lead-based paint and can result in lead poisoning. How it's treated The main treatment is correction of the underlying problem. If chronic blood loss or GI bleeding is suspected, appropriate inter-vention is needed. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 587 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 587 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.588HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS In with the iron If the problem is nutritional, the child's diet should be adjusted to increase iron intake. Good sources of dietary iron include red meat, organ meat, legumes (such as kidney and pinto beans), green leafy vegetables, raisins, and dried apricots as well as iron-fortified cereals and formula. Milk has little iron and may actually cause the anemia by preventing the intake of other iron-rich foods (if the child fills up on milk). It's supplementary, my dear Watson! In addition to dietary changes, the child may be placed on oral iron supplementation, although iron supplements aren't absorbed as well as iron from dietary sources. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children with hema- tocrit below 34% (hemoglobin level less than 11.3 g/dl) be placed on supplemental iron. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may be added to the supplement because it helps with iron absorption. Breast milk has low levels of iron, but the iron that is present is extremely well ab-sorbed and is adequate for most infants. If an infant is drinking formula, it should be iron-fortified. What to do Nursing care focuses on educating the parents about diet and treatment regimens:\u0081 Monitor the child's compliance with the prescribed iron supple- ment therapy. \u0081 Teach the parents of infants the importance of using iron- fortified infant cereals or iron-fortified formula.\u0081 Teach the parent or adolescent about good iron sources in the normal diet; if the child is a vegetarian, explain the importance of incorporating iron-rich vegetable sources into the diet.\u0081 Caution the child and parents that taking iron supplements may result in dark green or black stool; supplements can also cause con-stipation and this may need to be treated with prunes or a laxative.\u0081 Make sure the parents understand the dosage and administra-tion of oral iron supplements; stress the importance of storing the supplements safely because they're a major source of poisoning in children.\u0081 Taking iron supplements with vitamin C sources (like orange juice) may help absorption. Leukemia Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, includ- ing the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Leukemia usually starts in the WBCs with an abnormal, uncontrolled t - gContrary to popular belief , ff I'm not a good source of iron. Check back with me when you need some calcium Rights Reserved.589HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS overproduction of WBCs by the stem cells in bone marrow. The nonfunctional, leukemic cells infiltrate the tissues of the body and replace normal cells. Children are most commonly diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which involves the lympho- cytic WBC cell line, or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), which involves the granulocytic-myelocytic WBC cell line. What causes it The exact cause of leukemia is unknown. It seems to develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There's an increased incidence of ALL in children with Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Other risk factors include exposure to large doses of ionizing radiation or drugs that suppress bone marrow. Certain viruses, such as human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I, are also associated with an increased risk for leukemia. How it happens Leukemia is thought to occur when some blood cells acquire mutations in their DNA. This causes a rapid production of WBCs which results in the accumulation of immature, nonfunctional cells called blast cells . The blast cells multiply continuously, regardless of the body's needs. However, the proliferating blast cells don't attack and destroy normal cells. Rather, they crowd out other healthy, functional cells, robbing them of nutrition essential for me- tabolism, leading to pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells being produced by all cell lines). Needed: Crowd control Eventually, the bone marrow becomes packed with the malignant cells, and they spill out into the peripheral blood where they can be seen on microscopic slides. What to look for Signs and symptoms of ALL and AML are similar and are related to suppression of elements of the bone marrow:\u0081 RBC and platelet levels are reduced as the stem cells are no longer producing them, which leads to anemia with decreased hemoglobin.\u0081 A low platelet count leads to bruising, bleeding, and multiple nosebleeds; minor trauma, such as bumping into furniture, may cause large bruises. \u0081 Because the WBCs are immature and nonfunctioning, the ability to fight infection is diminished, and the child may experience high fevers and show signs of sepsis.

All Rights Reserved.590HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS What tests tell you \u0081 Blood counts show thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The WBC count in a CBC will be very high (usually over 25,000/\u00b5l) and the differential determines cell type. \u0081 Lumbar puncture is performed to detect meningeal involve- ment; cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals abnormal WBC invasion of the central nervous system (CNS).\u0081 Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy confirm the disease, showing mostly malignant blast cells present in large numbers. (These tests are also used to determine whether the leukemia is lymphocytic or myelogenous, which will help determine treatment and prognosis.) Complications Because leukemia and its treatment affect all blood cell lines and the immune system, complications vary and can be severe. Infec-tions are of particular concern. Fungus alert Children on long-term immunosuppressive therapy may have overgrowth of fungal infections, such as candidiasis, or little resis-tance to severe fungal infections such as aspergillosis. Disruptions in the child's and the family's routine may cause major problems with school or socialization as well as stress and anxiety. How it's treated Both forms of acute leukemia are treated with combinations of I.V. chemotherapy drugs aimed at killing the malignant stem cells plus leukemia cells that may have migrated to other areas of the body. AML is more resistant; there- fore, the treatment regimens are more severe, usually requiring more hospitalizations. Because I.V. chemo-therapy can't penetrate the CNS and spinal fluid, treat- ment of the CNS involves intrathecal chemotherapy and low-dose radiation of the spine and head. Treatment may also include: \u0081 antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral drugs\u0081 colony-stimulating factors, such filgrastim (Neupogen), to spur the growth of granulocytes, RBCs, and platelets\u0081 transfusions of platelets to prevent bleeding and RBCs to pre- vent anemia. Transplant to the rescue Bone marrow transplantation has become a standard treat- ment for AML when the child is in remission because a transplant improves long-term survival.

All Rights Reserved.591HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS What to do Leukemia is a devastating diagnosis for the child and his family. The child must deal not only with the disease but also with the adverse effects of treatment. The child should be prepared for all tests and treatments, and emotional support should be offered to his family. Referral to additional support services may be needed. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Educate the child and his family about the disease and treat- ments (including treatment-related problems). \u0081 Assess for bleeding, bruising, fatigue, or signs and symptoms of an impending infection.\u0081 To control infection, place the patient in a private room and institute reverse isolation. Coordinate care so the child doesn't come in contact with staff members who also care for patients with infections or infectious diseases. \u0081 Provide guidelines for reducing such adverse effects of chemotherapy as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Make sure the parents understand how to administer medications to treat these adverse effects.\u0081 Make the parents aware that any fever is serious and may be life-threatening; a health care provider should immediately evaluate the child with a fever. Sickle cell anemia Sickle cell anemia is an inherited, autosomal-recessive ge- netic disease that affects the RBCs, which become acutely sickle-shaped. They occlude small vessels, causing pain and decreased function. The two common variants of sickle cell anemia are hemoglobin SS (Hgb SS) and hemoglobin SC (Hgb SC) disease. Symptoms are usually severe with Hgb SS and moderate or undetectable in Hgb SC. What causes it The child must receive the autosomal-recessive gene from both parents to have the condition. The defective hemoglobin (hemo-globin S) takes on the classic sickle shape with decreased oxygen- carrying capacity and inability to flow through capillaries. Carriers of sickle cell trait have few symptoms and only on rare occasions. How it happens Sickle cell anemia occurs as a result of a mutation in the gene that encodes the beta chain of hemoglobin. This mutation causes a structural change in hemoglobin. A single amino acid change from glutamic acid to valine occurs in the sixth position of the betahe- moglobin chain. Any fe ver is cause for concern in a child with leukemi All Rights Reserved.592HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Hemoglobin S is for sickle When hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) occurs, the hemoglobin S in the RBCs becomes insoluble. As a result, the blood cells become rigid and rough, forming an elongated crescent, or sickle, shape. Sickling can cause hemolysis (cell destruction). Capillary traffic jam Sickle cells accumulate in capillaries and smaller blood vessels, causing occlusions and increasing blood viscosity. This increased viscosity impairs normal circulation, causing pain, tissue infarc- tions (tissue death), swelling, and anoxic changes that lead to further sickling and obstruction. Low on O 2 Sickle cell crisis occurs when a patient with sickle cell anemia experiences cellular oxygen deprivation from, for example, an in- fection, exposure to cold or high altitude, or overexertion. A chain of events then ensues. (See Understanding sickle cell crisis .) What to look for All infants are screened for sickle cell on the newborn screen- ing test so children with sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait should be identified early. Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually don't develop until after age 6 months because large amounts of fetal hemoglobin protect infants until then. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher oxygen concentration and inhibits sickling. Swollen hands and feet (hand-foot syndrome) may be the first signs of sickle cell anemia in babies. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped RBCs blocking blood flow out of their hands and feet. Periodic episodes of pain, called sickle cell crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped RBCs block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen, and joints. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, an important organ in fighting infection\u2014making children more vulnerable to infections. Children with sickle cell anemia usually receive prophylactic antibiotics until the age of 5 years to prevent potentially life-threatening bacterial infections. Children with sickle cell disease may have delayed growth and anemia because the sickle cells have a shortened life span compared to normal RBCs (20 days for sickle cells versus 120 days for normal RBCs). A telling history The patient's history includes chronic fatigue (due to chronic anemia), unexplained dyspnea or dyspnea on exertion, joint swell-ing, aching bones, severe localized and generalized pain, leg ulcers (rare in children), and frequent infections.

Necrotic tissue Damaged tissue Inflamed tissue Hypoxic cellsMicroinfarct Mass cells obstructing capillary lumen Capillary may reveal jaundice or pallor. A young child may appear small for his age. The spleen will usually be enlarged and palpable. Sickle cell crisis In sickle cell crisis, symptoms include severe pain, hematuria, lethargy, irritability, and pale lips, tongue, palms, and Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd All Rights Reserved.594HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS Being trapped inside me definitely qualifies as a crisis\u2014an acute sequestration crisis, to be specific.Isn't one enough? Four different types of crisis can occur: In painful crisis , patients report severe abdominal, thoracic, muscle, or bone pain and, possibly, increased jaun- dice, dark urine, or a low-grade fever. Aplastic crisis results from bone marrow depression and is characterized by pallor, lethargy, sleepiness, dyspnea, markedly decreased bone marrow activity, RBC hemolysis, and possible coma. Acute sequestration crisis , occurring in infants, may cause sudden, massive entrapment of RBCs in the spleen and liver; if untreated, lethargy and pallor progress to hypovolemic shock and death. Hemolytic crisis results from complications of the disease rather than the disease itself; degenerative changes cause liver congestion and enlargement, and chronic jaundice develops and worsens. The spleen is often nonfunctioning from being infarcted by sickle cells. What tests tell you \u0081 Hemoglobin levels will be low, and sickle cells will be seen on microscopic slide.\u0081 Additional blood tests show low RBC counts, elevated WBC and platelet counts, a decreased ESR, increased serum iron levels, decreased RBC survival, and reticulocytosis.\u0081 Genetic tests will help identify the status of the parents and can be used to assess sibling status. Because of the importance of early diagnosis, it has become standard for all neonates to be tested at birth for both carrier and disease state. Complications Clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia vary, resulting in a wide range of complications related to occlusion of the blood ves-sels. Complications include stroke, acute chest syndrome, organ damage, retinal damage/blindness, and priapism. A stroke can occur if the sickle cells block blood flow to the brain. Acute chest syndrome is a life-threatening complication of sickle cell anemia that causes chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome can be caused by a lung infection or by sickle cells blocking blood vessels in the lungs. It may require emergency medical treatment with antibiotics and other treatments. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 594 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd All Rights Reserved.595HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS Sickle cells can block blood flow through blood vessels, immediately depriving an organ of blood and oxygen. Chronic deprivation of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs, including the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Organ damage can be fatal. The blood vessels that supply the eyes can get blocked by sickle cells and, over time, can damage the retina and lead to blindness. Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. As a result, boys with sickle cell anemia may experience painful, long-lasting erections\u2014a condition called priapism. This can damage the penis and eventually lead to impotence. How it's treated Bone marrow transplant offers the only potential cure for sickle cell anemia. Transplants are recommended only for people who have significant symptoms and problems from sickle cell anemia. As a result, treatment for sickle cell anemia is usually aimed at avoiding crises, relieving symptoms, and preventing complications. Treatments may include medications to reduce pain and prevent complications and blood transfusions and supplemental oxygen. To prevent life-threatening bacterial infections, children with sickle cell anemia may begin taking the antibiotic penicillin when they're about 2 months of age and continue taking it until they're 5 years old. To relieve pain during a sickle crisis, over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers may be recommended. When taken daily, hydroxyurea reduces the frequency of painful crises and may reduce the need for blood transfusions. Hydroxy- urea seems to work by stimulating production of fetal hemoglo- bin\u2014a type of hemoglobin found in newborns that helps prevent the formation of sickle cells. Long-term use of hydroxyurea may increase the risk of infection. In children with sickle cell anemia at high risk of stroke, regular blood transfusions can decrease their risk of stroke but may cause an excess amount of iron to build up in the body. Excess iron can damage the heart, liver, and other organs. Therefore, people who undergo regular transfusions may need iron-chelating treatment with deferasirox (Exjade) to reduce iron levels. Because infections can be very serious in children with sickle cell anemia, children should be up-to-date on all of their immunizations. What to do A child who experiences the pain of a crisis will likely be fearful of future crises, as will his parents. This may have a significant impact on the child's life. He may be afraid to participate in nor- mal activities for fear of bringing on a crisis, and his parents may become overprotective. Pain is often severe. Always believe the patient about their level of pain. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 595 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 595 5/22/14 8:40 PM Kluwer.

Yeeouch!In pursuit of normal Prevention and education are the keys to leading a normal life, and participation in a support group may be extremely helpful in this regard. To prevent sickle crisis, the goal is to maintain as high a state of oxygenation as possible: \u0081 Be aware that excessive exercise or activity may precipitate crisis.\u0081 Avoid tight or restricting clothes such as elastic at the end of sleeves. \u0081 Promote relaxation and stress-reducing activities because men-tal stress may play a role in crisis.\u0081 Encourage the child to attend school and social functions while being aware that he may be more susceptible to infection.\u0081 Explain the need to avoid flying in unpressurized aircrafts.\u0081 Stress the importance of immediate evaluation of fever; chil- dren with sickle cell anemia are functionally asplenic and are at risk for pneumococcal sepsis. Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is an autoimmune disease. For unknown reasons, the body turns on itself and attacks healthy cells and tissues leading to inflammation and damage. It generally affects adolescent girls and women between ages 15 and 45, but it can be seen at other ages. Neonatal lupus is seen in infants of women with SLE. Lupus is more common in African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. What causes it The exact cause of SLE is unknown, although there are likely genetic, environmental, and, possibly, hormonal influences. Exposure to ultraviolet light, infections, stress, and pregnancy are known precipitating factors. How it happens The formation of autoantibodies in lupus occurs for unknown reasons. These autoantibodies join together with antigens to form soluble immune complexes and are deposited in multiple body tissues, including the skin, joints, lungs, heart, kidneys, brain, and blood vessels. A complex reaction Symptoms appear due to inflammatory reactions and tissue damage that occur after the deposition of these immune com-plexes. Defects in the body's production of Rights Reserved.597HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS cellular and humoral responses cause increased B-lymphocyte production and autoantibody reactions against T-lymphocytes, rendering them ineffective. What to look for SLE is a multisystem inflammatory disease of the joints, serous linings, kidneys, skin, and CNS; therefore, symptoms may be wide-spread. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the organ involvement. Common findings include: \u0081 painful and swollen joints\u0081 muscle pain\u0081 unexplained extreme fatigue \u0081 alopecia\u0081 skin rashes, including the characteristic \"butterfly\" (malar) rash over both cheeks and the nasal bridge, which are extremely sensi-tive to sun\u0081 peripheral vasospasm (Raynaud's phenomenon). Getting involved As the disease progresses, systemic involvement increases. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy may occur. Inflam-mation of the lung and heart linings may cause chest pain and dyspnea. CNS involvement can produce seizures, coma, hemiple- gia, and behavioral disturbances, including psychosis. Renal SLE can progress rapidly and is the leading cause of death in people affected with this disease. What tests tell you Antinuclear antibody test (ANA) is positive in patients who have active untreated disease; however, a negative test doesn't completely exclude SLE. A CBC may be ordered. People with lupus are prone to developing anemia. Low WBC counts and low platelets may also occur. Kidney and liver function tests may be ordered to assess the function of these organs because they can be adversely affected by lupus. \u0081 ESR is usually commonly seen.\u0081 Proteinuria may be noted on urinalysis and is one of the initial signs of renal involvement.\u0081 Imaging tests such as a chest X-ray and echocardiogram may be ordered. A chest X-ray may reveal inflammation in the lungs and an echocardiogram may reveal problem with heart valves that may be associated with lupus. CT scan or MRI may identify patho- logic conditions of the brain due to SLE.

The inflammation can affect many parts of the body including the kidneys, brain, blood vessels, heart, and lungs. Lupus can cause serious kidney damage, and kidney failure is one of the leading causes of death among people with lupus. Many people with lupus experience memory problems and may have difficulty expressing their thoughts. Lupus may lead to blood problems, including anemia and increased risk of bleeding or blood clotting. It can also cause vas-culitis (inflammation of the blood vessels). Having lupus increases the chances of developing an inflammation of the chest cavity lining (pleurisy). Lupus can also cause pericarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle, arteries, or heart membrane). The risk of car-diovascular disease and heart attacks is increased in patients with lupus. People with lupus are more vulnerable to infection because both the disease and its treatments weaken the immune system. Infections that most commonly affect people with lupus include urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, yeast infections, salmonella, herpes, and shingles. Toxicity from the medications can cause growth failure, adrenal suppression, Cushing's syn-drome, osteoporosis, and aseptic necrosis. Liver damage and bone marrow suppression can occur with immunosuppressant use. Retinal damage may occur with the use of hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Amenorrhea may result either from the disease itself or from the medications used to treat it. How it's treated Although SLE can't be cured, people with the disease can achieve remission and lead a high-quality life. Treatment may include drugs and other approaches: \u0081 Corticosteroids are a mainstay of SLE treatment; they've been shown to significantly reduce mortality and should be used in all patients with renal, cardiac, and CNS involvement. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteo- porosis), high blood pressure, diabetes, and increased risk of infection.\u0081 Immunosuppressants may be added if disease control is inadequate with steroids. Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, de-creased fertility, and an increased risk of cancer.\u0081 Anti-inflammatory medications, such as NSAIDs and cy- clooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, may be used to help decrease pain and inflammation associated with SLE. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 598 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 598 5/22/14 8:40 PM IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug used to treat the inflammation associated with this disease. Side effects can include GI upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina. \u0081 Holistic treatment approaches include fostering healthy behaviors, such as diet, rest, and exercise. What to do Nursing care aims to promote the best possible outcome for the child with a chronic illness. Interventions are directed toward preventing flare-ups, maintaining growth and develop- ment, preventing infection, and preserving skin integrity. In children with lupus, the nurse should:\u0081 Teach the child to avoid such precipitating factors as sun exposure and stress. \u0081 Promote self-esteem, especially in adolescents. The use of hypoallergenic make-up, wigs, and other aids will help cover up the disfiguring effects of this disease.\u0081 Instruct the child to layer clothing and use mittens and sock liners to help decrease the discomfort associated with Raynaud's phenomenon.\u0081 If needed, refer the child and her family to support groups or for mental health treatment to help them cope with the diagnosis. Thalassemia Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less hemoglobin and fewer RBCs in the body than normal. Several types of thalassemia exist, including alpha-thalas- semia, beta- thalassemia, Cooley's anemia, and Mediterranean anemia. Phi beta defective synthesis Beta-thalassemia is the most common form of this disorder, resulting from defective beta-polypeptide chain synthesis. It occurs in three clinical forms: major, intermedia, and minor, and the prognosis depends on which form of beta-thalassemia the child has.\u0081 Children with thalassemia major may survive into adulthood but generally have reduced life spans. \u0081 Children with thalassemia intermedia develop normally into adulthood, although puberty is usually delayed. \u0081 People with thalassemia minor can expect a normal life span. (See Ethnicity and thalassemia .)Cultured pearls Ethnicity and thalassemia Thalassemia is most common in people of Mediterranean ancestry (es- pecially Italians and Greeks) but also occurs in people from southern China, India, and South-east Asia. Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 599 Meadows-Oliver_Ch14.indd 599 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.600HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC PROBLEMS What causes it Thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia result from homozygous inheritance of the partially dominant autosomal gene responsible for this trait. Thalassemia minor results from heterozygous inheritance of the same gene. How it happens In each disorder, total or partial deficiency of beta-polypeptide chain production impairs hemoglobin synthesis and results in continual production of fetal hemoglobin, lasting even past the neonatal period. What to look for In thalassemia major, the infant is well at birth but develops severe anemia, bone abnormalities, failure to thrive, and life-threatening complications. In many cases, the first signs are pallor and yellow skin and sclera in infants ages 3 to 6 months. Large but not in charge Later clinical features include splenomegaly or hepatomegaly with abdominal enlargement, frequent infections, bleeding ten-dencies, and anorexia. These signs and symptoms are also found: \u0081 Children usually have small bodies and large heads. \u0081 If untreated, older children may have an enlarged maxilla, depressed bridge of the nose, and protruding lips.\u0081 Children become susceptible to pathologic bone fractures as well as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and other com- plications that result from iron deposits in the heart and other tissues due to repeated blood transfusions.\u0081 Patients with thalassemia intermedia show some degree of anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly; thalassemia minor may cause mild anemia but usually produces no symptoms and is commonly overlooked. What tests tell you Hemoglobin levels and RBC counts are low, and reticulocyte and bilirubin levels are elevated. X-rays of the skull and long bones show thinning and widening of the marrow space because of overactive bone marrow. (See Skull changes in thalassemia major .) Quantitative hemoglobin studies show a significant rise in hemoglobin F. With prolonged disease, there may be increased levels of serum ferritin from RBC lysis and chronic transfusion. Complications Possible complications of thalassemia include iron overload and infection. People with thalassemia can get too much iron Skull changes in thalassemia major This illustration of an X-ray shows a char-acteristic skull abnormality in thalassemia major: diploetic fibers extending from lamina, Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.601HEMATOLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC DISORDERS in their bodies, either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and endocrine system. They also have an increased risk of infection\u2014especially if they have had a splenectomy. In cases of severe thalassemia, children can develop bone deformi-ties, splenomegaly, slowed growth, and heart problems. Thalas-semia can cause the bone marrow to expand, which causes bones to widen. This can result in abnormal bone structure, especially in the face and skull. Bone marrow expansion also makes bones thin and brittle, increasing the chance of fractures. Splenomegaly can worsen anemia by reducing the life of RBCs. Some patients may require a splenectomy. Anemia can contribute to a decreased rate of growth. Puberty also may be delayed in children with thalassemia. Heart problems such as congestive heart failure and arrhythmias may be associated with severe thalassemia. How it's treated Thalassemia intermedia and thalassemia minor generally don't require treatment. Treatment for thalassemia major generally involves repeated packed RBC transfusions to maintain higher hemoglobin levels. Transfusions may be needed as frequently as every 3 weeks. A stem cell transplant may be used to treat severe thalassemia in select cases. Don't overdo it! These transfusions must be administered judiciously to mini- mize iron overload. Deferoxamine (Desferal) is a chelating agent commonly given to eliminate excess iron from the body. Increased demand for folic acid requires supplements to help maintain nor- mal levels. What to do Provide emotional support to the parents; encourage them to express their feelings and concerns and make sure that their ques-tions are answered. Explain all tests and procedures. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Monitor for adverse reactions during packed RBC transfusions, such as fever, chills, and irritability.\u0081 Make the parents aware of the inherited nature of the disorder so they can seek genetic counseling. \u0081 Educate the parents on the nature of the disease and the symptoms of low hemoglobin, such as fatigue and paleness, and the risk of failure to thrive.\u0081 Encourage a normal lifestyle to the extent possible.\u0081 Provide education about adequate diets, which can reduce the risk of further complications, including anemia and growth problems.

Without you, we'd be out there for the whole world to see!Anatomy and physiology The integumentary system, which consists of the skin and its components, is the largest organ system in the body. At birth, the skin is only 1 mm thick; the dermal layer of the skin doubles in thickness at maturity. The great protector The skin protects most of the other organ systems by acting as a mechanical barrier. Other functions include sensory perception, temperature regulation, vitamin synthesis, and excretion of wastes through sweating. Structures of the skin The skin is composed of layers of tissue. Append- ages of the skin include the hair and glands. Skin layers The skin consists of two layers and a sublayer, the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue:\u0081 The epidermis , or outermost covering, provides a protective barrier to external trauma and limits the loss Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 603 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.604DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS of body contents to the environment; dermatologic problems are characteristically evident on the epidermis.\u0081 The dermis consists of connective tissue that gives the skin strength and elasticity; it contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.\u0081 The hypodermis lies below the dermis and is composed of loose connective tissue, or adipose tissue. It contains larger blood vessels, lymph channels, and nerve trunks. This layer attaches the skin to the underlying bones, acts as a cushion and temperature insulator, and determines the skin's contours. (See Structure of the skin .) Thin-skinned Skin layers act to prevent water loss, which varies with environ- mental temperature and humidity as well as the proportion of body surface exposed. Thus, fluid loss in the preterm neonate is greater than in an adult because the neonate's skin is thinner. Hair Hair changes markedly during the stages of development. Fetal comb-over Fine body hair, or lanugo , is found in utero over most of the fetus but decreases as the fetus approaches full-term. The neonate's scalp hair varies greatly in amount and is usually lost before growth of permanent hair, which gradually thickens. Growth spurt Puberty causes additional growth of hair in the axilla and pubic regions of both genders; boys experience facial hair growth. Glands The main glands of the skin are:\u0081 sebaceous glands , or sebum-producing glands, which contain the hair follicles and keep the skin supple by minimizing water loss. They're more prevalent on the scalp, forehead, nose, chin, and genitalia.\u0081 sweat glands , which may be eccrine (function as the body's heat-regulating mechanism by producing sweat) or apocrine (ma- ture at puberty and cause the unpleasant body odor associated with sweating).

The part of the growth that protrudes is shaved off at skin level.Fungus finder A drop of 20% KOH is added to skin scrapings to dissolve debris before the scrapings are placed on a slide. When the slide is heated, the skin cells dissolve, leaving fungal elements visible on microscopic examination. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the parents and the child. Tell the child what to expect, including discomfort he may experience, and suggest coping strategies such as distraction techniques. Skin biopsy Skin biopsy is the removal of a section or an entire lesion for microscopic analysis to determine its cell structure and make a diagnosis. (See Recognizing skin lesions .) A skin biopsy specimen can be biopsy\u0081 punch biopsy \u0081 excisional biopsy. The closest shave In a shave biopsy, the protruding portion of the growth is excised at skin level and the specimen is sent for microscopic examination. Pulled and punched In a punch biopsy, the skin surrounding the lesion is pulled taut, and the punch is introduced firmly into the lesion. The punch is then rotated to obtain a tissue specimen, or plug . The plug is lifted with forceps or a needle and the surgeon severs as deeply as possible into the fat layer. The wound is then sutured closed. Out, out, darn lesion In an excisional biopsy, a scalpel is used to excise the lesion completely.

Cells are scraped from the base of a vesicle to obtain moist, cloudy debris, or exudate . The cells are then placed on a slide, air-dried, and stained with Wright's or Giemsa stain. Multinucleated giant cells are indicative of either herpesvirus or varicella. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the parents and the child. Tell the child what to expect, including discomfort he may experience, and suggest coping strategies such as distraction techniques. Treatments and procedures Management of skin disorders may include a variety of therapeutic procedures, including laser surgery and skin grafting. Laser surgery Laser is the common term for light amplification by simulated emission of radiation. Lasers are used in surgery to divide adhe-sions or to treat lesions of the skin. The most common types of la- sers used are the pulsed dye laser, the argon laser, and the carbon dioxide laser, each of which emits light at a different wavelength. Complications Complications associated with laser surgery include secondary infections, keloid or pyrogenic granuloma formation, localized dermatitis, and hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the parents and the child and prepare the child for discomfort he may experience. Make sure to prepare the child (and the parents) for the appearance of the treated area after laser surgery because it will probably look much worse than it does before treatment (some laser treatments leave skin raw and oozing). Reassure the child that this is normal and the area will heal quickly. After the laser After laser surgery: \u0081 Apply dressings as ordered.\u0081 Instruct the parents in care of the treated area. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 609 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 609 5/22/14 8:47 PM Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.610DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS \u0081 Stress to the child and parents the importance of avoiding trauma to the lesion or picking at the scab. Skin grafting During skin grafting, a section of skin is separated from its blood supply and implanted over an area where skin has been lost due to burns, injury, or surgical debridement of diseased tissue. 'Tis better to give than receive The area from which the skin is removed is referred to as the donor site . For donor areas in which appearance or joint move- ment is important, the graft is transplanted intact. In flat areas where appearance is less critical, the graft may be meshed (fenes- trated) to cover up to three times its original size. It's then placed on what's known as the recipient site . A healthy loan Skin from the patient's own healthy skin (autograft) may be used. If an autograft isn't available, a homograft (cadaver skin) or xenograft (pigskin) may be surgically attached. Keys to success The skin graft may be a split-thickness graft (involving the epider- mis and superficial dermis) or a full-thickness graft (involving the epidermis and all layers of dermis). To be successful, grafts must have a sufficient blood supply, have contact with the recipient area, be free from infection and mechanical trauma, and have minimal bleeding or fluid accumulation. Nursing considerations Explain the procedure to the parents and the child. Prepare the child for the postgrafting appearance of the donor site and the re-cipient site. Reassure the child that the sites will heal, but tell him that this may take some time. After graft After grafting, follow these steps: \u0081 Observe the donor and graft sites dressings for fluid drainage and odor; if these occur, notify the doctor. \u0081 Observe the child for pain at the graft sites because this may indicate infection.\u0081 Monitor the child's temperature every 4 hours because a rise in temperature may also indicate the present of infection. \u0081 Instruct the parents on the care of the donor and recipient sites and include them in the child's care as much as possible (includ-ing dressing changes). Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 610 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 610 Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.611DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS After skin grafting, the parents may need to be reassured that holding and cuddling their child won't hurt him.\u0081 Teach parents to recognize the signs of infection (such as pain, a rise in temperature, fluid drainage and odor) and instruct them to report these signs immediately. \u0081 Stress to the parents (and the child) the importance of protecting the donor and recipient sites from trauma.\u0081 Encourage the parent to hold and comfort the child despite the presence of the bulky dressings; reassure them that the dressings allow them to hold their child without hurting him. Dermatologic disorders Dermatologic disorders that may affect children and adolescents include acne, burns, contact dermatitis, and scabies. Acne Acne is a chronic skin disorder of the pilosebaceous unit , which consists of sebaceous glands that produce sebum (an oily substance) and open onto the skin surface. Comedones, pustules, nodules, and nodular lesions characterize this inflammatory disease. Facing up to acne Acne is the most prevalent pediatric skin condition especially among adolescents and is typically observed on the face, chest, upper arms and back, and neck, where a large number of seba- ceous glands are located. It appears predominantly during middle to late adolescence often paralleling puberty and with a peak incidence at ages 16 to 17 in girls and ages 17 to 18 in boys. It's a common skin problem in all ethnic populations and affects males more severely than females. Neonatal acne takes approximately 1 month to resolve spontaneously. Lasting legacy Even though acne is self-limiting, the psychosocial impact and significance of acne on the quality of life of adolescents can have a negative effect on their self-esteem. What causes it Although the exact etiologic mechanism remains unknown, many factors affect the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response that's evident in acne: \u0081 Androgenous hormones play a role in the development of acne; circulating androgens stimulate the production of sebum.\u0081 Many adolescent girls have an increased incidence of acne before their menstrual periods, also suggesting a hormonal link. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 611 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd Rights Reserved.612DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS It figures! A pimple's favorite place to be is where everyone can see. Go ahead\u2014 indulge! Contrary to popular belief, there's no evidence linking chocolate, nuts, fried foods, or carbonated beverages to the tendency to develop or increase the severity of acne.\u0081 Genetic factors seem to play a role because acne appears to run in families.\u0081 Certain medications are known to aggravate acne, including corticosteroids, phenytoin, lithium, androgens, and hormonal contraceptives containing norethindrone and norgestrel.\u0081 Adolescents commonly cite stress as a precipitating fac-tor, but there's no evidence of a clear association. \u0081 Ingestion of specific foods, such as chocolate, hasn't been found to be associated with the tendency to develop acne. How it happens Acne results from a combination of factors causing a keratin plug to develop within the follicular canal that opens onto the skin's surface. During adolescence, androgens stimulate sebaceous gland growth and production of sebum, which is secreted into dilated hair follicles that contain bacteria. The resulting en-vironment permits the overgrowth of gram-positive bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Volcanic eruption Continued accumulation of follicular contents results in perforation of the follicular wall; the contents leak into surrounding tissue and cause an inflammatory reaction and the characteristic skin lesions of acne. What to look for Patients with acne usually exhibit two types of lesions: Noninflammatory lesions consist of closed comedo- nes (whiteheads) or open comedones (blackheads). Inflammatory lesions consist of papules, pustules, and nodules or cysts that may result in permanent scarring of the skin. In full view Inspection reveals acne lesions, most commonly on the face, neck, shoulders, chest, and upper back. The area around the infected follicle may appear red and swollen. The rupture or leakage of an enlarged plug into the dermis produces inflammation and characteristic acne pustules, papules, or, in severe forms, acne cysts or abscesses. If the patient has previously picked or squeezed the lesions, scars may be visible. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 612 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.613DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS Acne classification Classification of acne is based on the type of lesions observed. Mild acne involves primarily noninflammatory lesions with or without a limited number of inflammatory papules or pustules. Moderate acne involves noninflammatory lesions with more in- flammatory papules and pustules present. Scarring is usually non- existent or mild. Severe acne involves noninflammatory lesions along with numerous extensive inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules. Scarring is more prevalent and usually dictates oral therapy. What tests tell you The diagnosis of acne is typically based solely on clinical appearance of the lesions. Complications Adolescents typically perceive acne as distressing and may need additional emotional support from the nurse as well as the family. In severe cases, the child may become withdrawn or depressed. Additional complications may occur: \u0081 Permanent scarring can result from compulsive picking of acne lesions.\u0081 Isotretinoin (Accutane) causes teratogenicity and can't be taken if the adolescent is pregnant or lactating; two negative pregnancy test results must occur before initiating treatment and effective contraception must be used by the sexually active adolescent girl starting at least 1 month before starting Accutane. Informed consent is necessary, and registration with the federally mandated iPLEDGE program requires monthly laboratory studies and office visits. \u0081 Systemic antibiotics can interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives; sexually active adolescent girls using hormonal contraceptives should use a backup method of con-traception for the first 2 weeks of systemic antibiotic therapy to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\u0081 Sun exposure may cause excessive burning in a child taking cer-tain medications (such as tetracycline [Sumycin] and Accutane) and should be avoided. How it's treated Various treatments are used and may be topical or systemic, depending on such factors as history, severity, types of lesions, psychological impact, cost-effectiveness, and benefit-risk assess- ment. Usually, several treatments are used Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 613 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 613 5/22/14 8:47 PM 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.614DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS On the skin or in the mouth Mild acne usually requires only topical therapy such as benzoyl peroxide, which is available over the counter. Adolescents with persistent acne may need follow-up with a primary care provider or dermatologist for further treatment. Moderate acne generally requires topical and oral medications. Severe acne is treated initially with topical and oral medications, and isotretinoin ( Accutane) is added if the acne fails to resolve. Acne lesions may be slow to resolve, with improvements typically taking up to 6 weeks. The patient should be taught to observe for adverse effects specific to these preparations, such as lethargy, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Skin care 101 The child can help ensure successful acne treatment by: \u0081 developing health-promoting behaviors, such as getting adequate rest, participating in moderate exercise, eating a well-balanced diet, and reducing stress \u0081 using good hygiene practices, including washing with mild soap and water twice per day, and avoiding abrasive and dry-ing cleansers or aggressive measures (such as scrubbing) \u0081 resisting the temptation to pick or squeeze blemishes \u0081 avoiding the use of aggravating agents, such as oil-based cosmetics, face creams, and hair sprays and gels. A referral to a dermatologist is necessary for further treat- ment. (See Teaching about acne .) Topical therapy Lotions and creams tend to be less drying than topical medica- tions in gels or solutions. There are three main categories of topical acne therapy: Keratolytics include benzoyl peroxide (Benoxyl), azelaic (Klaron), and dapsone (Aczone). Systemic therapy Adolescents who have moderate to severe inflammatory acne that isn't successfully controlled with topical medications or those with widespread acne will generally require additional therapy with systemic oral medications. Antibiotic resistance It's all relative Teaching about acne Be sure to include these points in your teaching plan for the child with acne:\u0081 myths about the causes of acne\u0081 predisposing factors\u0081 how acne develops\u0081 stages of severity\u0081 medications (such as benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin, antibiotics, and isotretinoin)\u0081 other care measures, includ-ing hygiene and cosmetic use.

It causes me to be depressed sometimes.may be minimized when used for short-term therapy or combined with topical agents rather than used as a monotherapy. All of these medications, except isotretinoin, may be used along with the topical acne preparations. The dope on drugs Acne is treated systemically with antibiotics, that tetracycline and minocycline should be taken on an empty stomach but is using doxycycline, it should be taken with food. (Tetracycline is contraindicated during pregnancy and in children younger than age 8 because it discolors developing teeth; erythromycin is an alternative for these patients.) Anti biotics should be discontinued once the acne is under good control. Other systemic acne treatments include isotretinoin, hormonal contraceptives, and oral spironolactone. Oral contraceptives and spironolactone are used solely to treat female adolescents. Intralesional therapy Acne may also be treated with intralesional injections of corti- costeroids. This procedure involves injection of a corticosteroid (usually triamcinolone [Kenalog]) into the acne cysts with a fine needle. This therapy reduces skin inflammation and may help prevent scarring. What to do Be prepared to discuss psychosocial concerns and self-esteem issues while reinforcing that acne is self-limiting and slow to resolve. Severe acne can lead to serious emotional problems. The child may endure teasing by her peers, leading to feelings of embarrassment or humiliation. He may become withdrawn and, in severe cases, clinically depressed. In these cases, re-ferral to a psychologist, social worker, or other professional is indicated. In addition, follow these steps: \u0081 Encourage compliance with specific treatment regimens. \u0081 Monitor the child for potential adverse effects associated with the prescribed drug therapy.

Burns Burns are caused by excessive heat but are also related to expo- sure to cold, chemicals, electricity, or radiation. When the skin is burned, it loses its ability to perform its normal physiologic functions. Educational efforts aimed at burn prevention have significantly decreased the number of burn injuries and deaths among children. However, fire and burn injuries remain a leading cause of uninten- tional, injury-related death in children younger than age 14 years. What causes it Burn injuries result from various causes and represent a severe trauma to the body. Exposure to thermal, chemical, and electrical and radioactive sources can cause burn injuries. Thermal burns Thermal burns, the most common type, are usually the result of residential fires, automobile accidents, children playing with matches, improperly stored gasoline, space heater or electrical malfunctions, or arson. Other causes include improper handling of firecrackers, scalding accidents, kitchen accidents (such as a child climbing on top of a stove), and access to dangerous items (such as a hot iron). Chemical burns Chemical burns result from contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injec- tion of acids, alkalis, vesicants, or noxious agents commonly used in cleaning products. Electrical burns Electrical burns usually occur after contact with faulty electrical wiring or from inserting conductive objects into electrical outlets.

I can't be trusted to make adult decisions about dangerous situations.Many infants and toddlers sustain electrical burns by chewing on electric cords. Other burns Burns also may occur from:\u0081 skin being rubbed harshly against a coarse surface (called fric- tion or abrasion burns ) \u0081 sun exposure (minor burns) \u0081 child abuse (intentionally inflicted injuries from such actions as immersion in hot water and contact with hot objects such as cigarettes). How it happens Children, especially those younger than age 5 years, are at greater risk for burn injuries. Developmentally, children have a limited ability to act promptly and properly in a dangerous situation, such as a fire and an explosion, or when they're exposed to dangerous items (such as a pot on the stove and a hot iron). Thermal and chemical burns disrupt the normal protective function of the skin, leading to various sequelae. In an electrical injury, the heat generated by the electricity passes through the body, causing injury to the tissues. Two levels of response to the burn injury occur: local systemic. Local response Local response represents local tissue damage to the skin: \u0081 Edema results from increased capillary permeability forcing water, protein, and electro- lytes into the interstitial spaces. \u0081 Fluid loss from the burn-injured skin is a result of the inflamma-tory response.\u0081 Significant circulatory alterations cause capillary stasis in the burned area. \u0081 Thrombi develop, leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis, caus-ing pain and edema. Systemic response Systemic response to burns may involve various body systems: \u0081 Cardiovascular changes occur, such as burn shock caused by dramatic alterations in circulation; tachycardia and tachypnea occur to compensate for decreasing vascular volume and in- creased oxygen needs. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 617 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 2015 Wolters Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.618DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS Burns can make you hot all over! When burns occur, metabolism increases and body temperature rises.A tight squeeze \u0081 Compartment syndrome, requiring surgical correction, may occur when severe edema causes a tourniquet-like effect that compromises circulation and entraps nerves. \u0081 The respiratory system may be compromised by smoke inhala- tion; injuries can range from tissue edema of upper respiratory airways to impaired gas exchange in the alveoli. Constricted and depressed \u0081 Renal changes occur, such as renal vasoconstriction, reduced renal plasma flow, and depressed glomerular filtration.\u0081 Gastrointestinal (GI) ischemia may occur as perfusion to the GI tract and liver is decreased. \u0081 Gastric ileus may occur, with digestion almost ceasing.\u0081 Metabolism is greatly increased, which can lead to prolonged starvation and extensive energy needs. Changing spaces \u0081 Fluid shifts from the vasculature to the extravascular spaces and altered concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate occur. \u0081 Elevated body temperature occurs as a result of in- creased metabolism, even in the absence of infection.\u0081 The neuroendocrine system attempts to restore equilibrium by secreting trophic hormones to stimulate various organs. Fragile: Handle with care \u0081 Increased cell fragility and loss of circulatory red blood cells leads to anemia and the production of lactic acid.\u0081 Growth and development are retarded with severe burn injuries due to growth hormone suppression. \u0081 The patient is prone to infections, such as nosocomial infections, due to loss of skin and tissue integrity and an im-mature immune system. What to look for Assessment of the child with a burn injury should begin with a thorough history. A description of events surrounding the burn injury should include the cause and the duration the agent was in contact with the skin. The history also consists of how and when the injury occurred, treatment of the burn, and history of previous burns. A matter of degree Burns are assessed according to degree (depth of damage), extent (percentage of body surface area), and specific body part involved.

All Rights Reserved.619DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS One goal of assessment is to determine the depth of skin and tis- sue damage: In first-degree burns , damage is limited to the epidermis, causing erythema and pain. In second-degree burns (partial thickness), the epidermis and part of the dermis are damaged, producing blisters and mild to moderate edema and pain. In third-degree burns (full thickness), the epidermis and the dermis are damaged; no blisters appear, but white, brown, or black leathery tissue and thrombosed vessels are visible. Fourth-degree burns are rare, and damage extends through deeply charred subcutaneous tissue to muscle and bone. (See Gauging burn depth .) TBSA or not TBSA Another assessment goal is to estimate the size of a burn, which is usually expressed as a percentage of the total body surface area (TBSA). The TBSA, together with the body part affected, deter- mines morbidity, mortality, and management strategies.Gauging burn depth One method of assessing burns is determining their depth. As shown in this illustration, a partial- thickness burn damages the epidermis and part of the dermis, whereas a full-thickness burn damages the epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous and muscle. Epidermis Dermis Subcutaneous tissue Normal skinPartial thickness Full Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 619 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd Rights Reserved.620DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS 10% of TBSA = a hospital stay For children, burns that make up 10% or more of TBSA are con- sidered critical and require hospitalization. In addition, significant burns of the hands, feet, face, ears, and genitalia also require im- mediate hospitalization. Children's larger body surface areas put them at high risk for fluid volume and heat loss leading to dehy-dration. (See Estimating the extent of a burn .) Inspect to detect Inspection reveals other characteristics of the burn as well, including location, pattern, and extent. Assess for sensation and degree of pain, and check for blanching and capillary refill of the nail beds. \u0081 Lung auscultation may reveal respiratory compromise, tachypnea, or stridor.\u0081 Assessment of the cardiovascular system may reveal tachycar- dia, narrow pulse pressure, and hypotension. \u0081 The child may have decreased urine output. Complications Nursing care of a burn patient is challenging because many organ systems are affected by the burn injury. Potential complications depend on the depth and severity of the burn as well as its specific cause. The most common complications and leading causes of death are respiratory complications and sepsis. Other possible complications include:\u0081 burn shock \u0081 it's treated Superficial first-degree burn injuries and partial-thickness burns heal spontaneously with reasonable care. Minor burns Management of minor burns includes removing burned clothing, cleaning with mild soap and tepid water, and leaving blisters intact. In addition: \u0081 Nothing should be applied to the burn except a clean cloth that is (usually) treated with antimicrobial ointment or cream. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 620 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 620 Rights Reserved.621DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS \u0081 Tetanus prophylaxis is necessary if no history of immunization is available, if more than 5 years has passed since the last immuni-zation, or if the child has not completed the full vaccine series. \u0081 A mild analgesic or moist soaks may be administered to relieve pain. Moderate or severe burns If the burn involves a large area of the body surface or critical body parts, it represents severe trauma and usually requires treat-ment at a specialized burn center. Emergency management of major burns begins with stopping the burning process and placing the child in a horizontal position. In addition:\u0081 Establish and maintain a patent airway, initiating cardiopulmo-nary resuscitation if necessary. \u0081 Remove burned clothing and jewelry while keeping the child warm.Advice from the experts Estimating the extent of a burn To estimate the extent of a burn in a pediatric patient, use the Lund and Browder chart. To use the chart: \u0081 Mentally transfer your patient's burns to the body chart shown here.\u0081 Then add up the corresponding percentages for each burned body section. Relative percentages of areas affected by growth At birth0 to 1 yr2 to 4 yrs5 to 9 yrs10 to 15 All Rights Reserved.622DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS \u0081 Cover the burn to prevent contamination. \u0081 Until transported to a medical facility or burn center, don't allow the patient to eat or drink anything; intravenous (I.V.) fluids with lactated Ringer's or normal saline solution should be started and oxygen therapy provided at 100%. In the unit Initial management of the major burn in the burn unit includes maintenance of an adequate airway. I.V. fluid replacement should be started as soon as possible. Intubation and mechanical ventila- tion may be necessary. In addition: \u0081 A urinary catheter is inserted to adequately measure urine output.\u0081 A nasogastric tube may be necessary to decompress the stomach; later, it may be used to administer a high-protein, high- calorie diet or total parenteral nutrition (which may be necessary if the GI tract is dysfunctional).\u0081 Baseline laboratory studies are performed.\u0081 I.V. pain medication is administered.\u0081 Topical wound cleaning is begun to prevent infections.\u0081 Tetanus prophylaxis is administered if required. In general General wound management includes wound debridement, hydro- therapy for dressing removal and debridement, topical antimicro-bial therapy, nutritional therapy, physiotherapy focusing on range of motion and contracture prevention, and skin grafting. What to do Burns are one of the most painful injuries a child can sustain. Severe burns are life-threatening. The child and his parents will need a great deal of emotional support and reassurance. Every effort should be made to make the child as comfort- able as possible during such painful procedures as debridement. Depending on the child's age, it may be difficult for him to un-derstand why doctors and nurses are inflicting pain during such procedures. The reasons for these treatments should be explained repeatedly, and the child should be encouraged to express his feel-ings, which may include fear and anger. Referral to a therapist and a support group may be needed to help the child and parents deal with the traumatic injury and any altered body image because such traumas can have long-lasting psychological effects. Similar referrals are needed if severe scar- ring or disfigurement is anticipated. Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 622 Meadows-Oliver_Ch15.indd 622 8:47 PM Kluwer.

When the fire dies down Ongoing management and rehabilitation should include prevent- ing wound infections and complications (such as heat loss and contractures), promoting wound healing, managing the child's pain and promoting comfort, promoting adequate nutrition, and providing psychosocial support for the child and his family. The child and his family should be educated about long-term needs and follow-up care. Education about safety issues, including pre- vention of future burns, should be conducted in a nonjudgmental manner with genuine interest and concern, making appropriate referrals as needed. Contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis occurs as an acute or chronic inflamma- tory response due to a hypersensitivity reaction to a natural or synthetic chemical substance resulting in a localized flare. The irritating substance can be a primary irritant or a sensi- tizing agent or allergen. What causes it Irritant dermatitis is caused by the toxic effect of the substance directly on the skin. The extent of the rash and itching depends on the length of exposure and the concen- tration of the irritant. Common irritants include: \u0081 detergents, harsh soaps, fabric softeners, bubble bath, and baby wipes\u0081 bathing too frequently \u0081 saliva, urine, and feces.

All Rights Reserved.624DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS Following the clues from a thorough history will lead you to the prime suspect\u2014 the offending substance in contact dermatitis.Allergic annoyances Allergic dermatitis occurs with exposure to substances that cause an immunologic response triggered by an allergen to which the child has become sensitized. Sensitizing reactions occur with repeated or prolonged exposure to such substances as: \u0081 plant oils (poison ivy, oak, and sumac)\u0081 nickel-containing jewelry\u0081 clothing with woolen or rough textures \u0081 topical medications, such as neomycin (Mycifradin) and lanolin \u0081 perfumed soaps or cosmetics\u0081 latex. How it happens In primary irritant dermatitis, the toxic substance causes damage to the stratum corneum and the skin's lipid film, impairing the protective barrier mechanism of the skin. The toxic substance is then absorbed into the skin, resulting in vasodilatation, edema of the upper dermis, inflammatory infiltrates, and breakdown of epidermal cells. Vesicles or bullae that rupture ooze and crust may develop as a result of the fluid accumulating between the epidermal cells that act as a sponge. Not immune to an immune response Allergic dermatitis is due to an immune response caused by the sensitizing chemical entering the dermis and combining with epidermal proteins to form a new molecule that acts as an antigen. This antigen enters the local cutaneous lymphoid tissue, causing an inflammatory reaction. What to look for A thorough history should elicit information about: \u0081 exposure to new or unusual substances\u0081 repeated exposure to a substance \u0081 history of diarrhea or infrequent diaper changes \u0081 location and distribution of the rash related to specific areas of the body\u0081 treatments or forms of at-home management. Oozing, scaling, and itching\u2014Oh, my! Mild irritants and allergens produce erythema and small vesicles that ooze, scale, and itch. Strong irritants may also cause blisters and ulcerations.

A severe allergic reaction also produces marked edema of the affected Kluwer. All Rights Reserved.625DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS What tests tell you Tests should be reserved for a time when the child isn't expe- riencing acute, active dermatitis. There are two methods used to determine allergy: \u0081 The patch test identifies specific allergens. The suspected substance is applied to a patch left in place on the child's skin for a specified period. If the area under the patch is red and swollen when the patch is removed, the test is positive and the child is considered allergic to the offending substance. \u0081 In skin testing , the suspected allergen is introduced intrader- mally on the child's back or upper arm. Complications Complications of contact dermatitis include secondary infections and trauma from scratching. The child may have serious concerns about his appearance and body image. How it's treated The keys to successful treatment are identification and removal or elimination of the causative agent and appropriate skin care and management. Resolution of contact dermatitis typically takes 2 to 3 weeks. How offensive! When the offending substance has been identified and eliminated from the child's environment, management consists primarily of treating and preventing worsening of symptoms: \u0081 For diaper dermatitis, change diapers frequently, use air-drying if possible, and avoid rubber pants.\u0081 Hydrocortisone cream 1% (Dermacort) should be used sparingly for no more than 5 days. \u0081 Antifungal agents may be necessary if secondary infection develops. A soak in the tub \u0081 Burrow solution soaks, Aveeno or oatmeal baths, and cool com- presses may soothe itching and vesicular rashes.\u0081 Petroleum-based or lanolin and petroleum-based emollients may be applied to dry and chaffed skin but must be avoided if the skin is inflamed. Ditch the itch! \u0081 Topical corticosteroids may be administered two to three times per day; oral antihistamines are commonly prescribed for itching.\u0081 Referral to a dermatologist for patch testing may be necessary.

P arents are more likely to listen (and learn) when they aren't put on the defensive.What to do Management requires problem solving to determine the cause of the skin reaction and to find a mutually agreeable solution:\u0081 Educate the child and his family about hygiene practices to prevent infections. \u0081 Teach the parents about antipruritic agents and their proper use to relieve discomfort and itching. Replace; don't recycle \u0081 Discuss proper use and regular replacement of skin care and make-up products.\u0081 Educate the parents and the child about ways to prevent future exposures, such as wearing protective clothing and using such blocking agents as Ivy Block for prevention of plant oil contact dermatitis. Leave the judging to Judy \u0081 Establish a professional rapport with the child and his parents and provide education in a nonjudgmental man-ner; parents may become defensive and are less likely to listen when they feel they're being judged or their parent- ing skills are being questioned.\u0081 Encourage the child to express concerns about his appearance and body image. Scabies Scabies, a highly transmissible parasitic skin infestation, is characterized by burrows, pruritus, and excoriations with secondary infections. It characteristically spreads by skin-to-skin contact to family members, intimate contacts, and among school children. Prolonged contact is needed to become infected. What causes it Scabies is a contagious disease caused by the scabies mite, Sar- coptes scabiei , which burrows into the stratum corneum of the epidermis and deposits eggs and feces. (See Scabies: Cause and effect .) How it happens The female scabies mite burrows under the skin and forms a small tunnel that's evident as a fine, wavy, dark line with a black dot at the end. The mite extends the burrow, laying up to three eggs per day as she travels. The eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, thus continuing the process.

All Rights Reserved.627DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS What to look for \u0081 The lesions initially produce no symptoms, but sensitization to the mites occurs in about 3 weeks. At that time, intense itch-ing occurs, becoming more severe at night. Loads of lesions \u0081 Infants have dozens of lesions, whereas older children commonly have fewer than 10. Children younger than age 2 years usually have lesions on the feet and ankles; in older chil- dren, most lesions are found on the hands and wrists. \u0081 Inspection reveals characteristic gray-brown burrows, which may appear as erythematous nodules when excoriated; second-ary excoriation and the burrows and papules. \u0081 Papules of various sizes may exist simultaneously and are typically distributed in such areas as the finger webs, flexor surfaces of the wrist, elbows and axillary folds, along the belt line, and on the lower buttocks. What tests tell you \u0081 Microscopic examination reveals the characteristic eight- legged scabies mite, eggs, or feces. (Scrapings from an un-scratched burrow should be placed in saline or mineral oil. The scrapings shouldn't be placed in KOH because it can dissolve the mites, eggs, or feces.)\u0081 The burrow ink test reveals the presence of burrows. This test involves applying a drop of ink or a blue or black felt- tipped pen to a suspected burrow, wiping off the excess ink with an alcohol pad, and examining the area with a magnifying glass for an ink-stained burrow. Complications A secondary bacterial infection from scratching is one possible complication of scabies. Postscabetic syndrome may occur, characterized by lesions and itching that commonly persist for days to weeks following treatment. How it's treated Pharmacologic treatment with a thin layer of scabicide (applied after a soap and water bath) to the entire body (except the eyes) is usually recommended: \u0081 Be especially careful to gently massage the cream into the fingernails, scalp, behind the ears, all folds and creases, and the feet and hands; in 7 days, reapply the cream to the child and all symptomatic contacts.Scabies: Cause and effect Infestation with S. scabiei \u2014the itch mite\u2014causes scabies. The top illustration shows the mite (enlarged); it has a hard shell and measures a microscopic 0.1 mm. The bottom illustra-tion depicts the ery-thematous nodules with excoriation Hmmm . . . looks like Mom vacuumed just like the nurse told her to!\u0081 Permethrin 5% cream (Elimite) is safer and more effective than lindane and is safe for infants as young as age 2 months; the cream should be left on for 8 to 14 hours and then removed with bathing and shampooing. The use of mitts for the hands and socks to cover the feet may reduce the chance of the young child sucking and ingesting the scabicide during the time that the cream is on the skin. Fighting the mighty mite \u0081 Lindane 1% cream (Kwell) is contraindicated for children younger than age 6 months and for those with seizure disorders because it has potential central nervous system effects. If used, the cream is applied from the neck down and is left on for 8 to 12 hours before bathing. Treatment is then repeated in 1 week. What to do All family members, friends, and school and day care contacts should undergo treatment simultaneously with the infected indi-vidual, even if they're asymptomatic. Parents should be educated about the course of the disease and told that the rash and itching commonly persist for up to 3 weeks. Oral antihistamines (such as Benadryl or Atarax) may be necessary if itching is pronounced. Children are no longer infectious 24 hours after treatment has started and may return to school or day care. Instruct the parents to: \u0081 Wash all bed linens and clothing with hot water and then dry for 40 minutes in a hot dryer. Hoover Whole House \u0081 Vacuum the entire house. \u0081 Store nonwashable items in sealed plastic bags for 2 weeks.\u0081 Use meticulous hand washing and good hygiene to avoid secondary infections. \u0081 Trim the child's fingernails short to avoid excoriation from scratching.\u0081 Use soothing lotions and bathe with Aveeno or a similar product to control itching. Tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp) Tinea cutaneous fungal infection of the scalp and hair. It characteristically spreads through direct and indirect contact with infected humans and animals such as dogs and cats and sharing of personal items, such as hats, combs, and brushes, in addition to close contact with infected fomites such as bedding, couches, and soft stuffed toys. It occurs more frequently in hot, humid climates and among individuals living in overcrowded conditions and in disadvantaged areas.

What causes it Tinea capitis is the most common contagious fungal infection in children younger than 12 years old. It is caused predominately by the dermatophyte Trichophyton tonsurans and involves both the scalp and hair shaft. How it happens Dermatophytes attach to the epidermis skin layer of the scalp and may invade the hair shaft, often resulting in hair breakage and temporary alopecia. An exaggerated cell-mediated response occurs and results in severe inflammation, leading to varying degrees of itching, scaling, pustules, and papules. What to look for \u0081 Erythema and scaling of the scalp \u0081 Pustules, papules, often yellow honeycomb crusts\u0081 Varying degrees of pruritus \u0081 Broken hairs at the scalp level resembling a dotted black stubbled appearance or patchy hair loss\u0081 Adenopathy may occur. What tests tell you Microscopic examination of hair and scalp scrapings using KOH wet mount can detect and immediately confirm the dermatophytes. The use of a fungal culture is more sensitive but does take addi- tional time to obtain the results. Complications In severe cases of tinea capitis, permanent alopecia may result. If symptoms do not improve, refer to a dermatologist. How it's treated \u0081 Oral antifungal medication such as griseofulvin for a minimum of 8 weeks but may be extended to 12 to 16 weeks and should con-tinue for 1 to 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms; medication absorption is enhanced if given with whole milk or other foods high in fat.\u0081 Selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue) shampoo two to three times weekly, leaving it on the scalp for 10 minutes before rinsing to eradicate the All Rights Reserved.630DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS What to do \u0081 Use shampoo with selenium sulfide for all family members for several weeks to prevent infection.\u0081 Clean all potentially contaminated objects that came into contact with the infected child's head. \u0081 Avoid sharing personal items, such as hats, combs, brushes, towels, bedding, etc., or anything that may have had close physical contact with the infected child's head. \u0081 Discourage scratching or touching of scalp and hair. Tinea corporis (ringworm of the fungal skin infec- tion commonly known as ringworm because of the characteristic pattern of annular (ring-shaped), scaling, erythematous plaques with sharply defined borders. It is found on the trunk and limbs, excluding hands, feet, head, and groin. What causes it Tinea corporis is most prevalent during the preadolescent years. with these dermatophytes occurs typically with infected humans, infected animals, fomites (such as wrestling mats and towels), and, less frequently, from the soil or from infection on other anatomic locations on the same individual such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot). How it happens Dermatophytes that are transmitted from an infected person, animal, or fomite attach to the superficial epidermis skin layer and release keratinases that invade and multiply within the stratum corneum. About 1 to 3 weeks later, the dermatophytes invade the epidermis peripherally and increase the proliferation of the basal cell layer. This results in epidermal thickening, and the lesion begins to appear as a ring-shaped lesion with an erythematous, scaly border with a healthy center. What to look for \u0081 Slightly raised ring-shaped lesions with pink boarders ranging in size from 5 mm to 3 cm\u0081 Lesions may be singular or multiple but usually not very numerous. \u0081 Lesions are more commonly found on exposed areas of the body.\u0081 Mild pruritus or burning sensation may be present.

All Rights Reserved.631DERMATOLOGIC DISORDERS What tests tell you KOH scraping of the lesion's border can confirm the dermato- phyte's hyphae and spores but cannot identify the specific species of dermatophyte involved. Dermatophyte test medium (DTM) is used for selective recognition of the dermatophytic fungus, which is the causative agent in ringworm. A fungal culture is more sensi-tive but takes more time to obtain results. How it's treated \u0081 Treat with topical antifungal medications 8 weeks before resolu- tion. Apply cream once or twice daily as prescribed. \u0081 Do not use topical corticosteroids or combination antifungal/corticosteroid preparations, which can cause infections to persist or recur. \u0081 Use oral antifungal agents if unresponsive to topical therapy or the ringworm recurs or is extensive. Griseofulvin is often the drug of choice. What to do \u0081 Avoid sharing of personal items to prevent the spread of the lesions. \u0081 Wash hands before and after applying the cream to the lesions.\u0081 Avoid touching or scratching the lesions. \u0081 Wash clothing that comes in contact with affected areas once removed.\u0081 Clean wrestling mats after use.\u0081 Discourage athletes from practice until at least 72 hours after treatment begins and lesions should be covered before resump- tion of any contact sport. Quick quiz 1. Which statement about the integumentary system and its components is true? A. It's the largest organ in the body and serves primarily as an insulator. B. It can only protect the body from trauma that's mechani- cal in nature. C. It consists of just the dermis and epidermis. D. Its main function is to act as an organ of excretion. Answer: A. The integumentary system, which consists of the skin and its components, is the largest organ system in the body. It functions to shelter most of the other organ systems, protecting them while acting as a mechanical barrier.

It has an insidious onset and ini-tially affects the legs, pelvis, and shoulders. Children with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy have difficulty climbing stairs, fall frequently, and exhibit Gower's sign when standing from a sitting position. They also toe-walk and have a waddling gait and lumbar lordosis. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy causes Kluwer.

It occurs most commonly in children ages 6 months to 2 years, and primarily results from eustachian tube dysfunction. Otitis media can be classified as acute otitis media or otitis media wi th effusion. Complications may atelectasis, perforation, or cholesteatoma. Listen up! Complications of otitis media can cause permanent ear damage. Otoscopic view Classifications Acute otitis mediaIn acute otitis media, there's infected fluid in the middle ear, and rapid onset of symptoms such as pain; symptoms, how-ever, have a short duration. Otitis media with effusion In otitis media with effusion, there's usually asymptomatic fluid in the middle ear. It may be acute, subacute, or chronic in nature.

Perforation A hole in the tympanic membrane signals perforation. It's caused by chronic negative pressure in the middle ear, inflam-mation, or trauma. CholesteatomaCholesteatoma is a mass of entrapped skin in the middle ear or temporal lobe. Meadows-Oliver_CP1.indd C3 Meadows-Oliver_CP1.indd C3 2015 Wolters Kluwer.

In infants, hydro- cephalus causes the head to grow at an abnormal rate. In infants and children, it may cause signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as a tense and bulging anterior fontanel, irritability, and lethargy.

The resulting impaired intestinal mobility causes severe intractable constipation. Colonic obstruction then occurs, dilating the bowel and occluding the surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels.

When sebum blocks a hair follicle, one of two types of acne occurs. In inflammatory acne , bacteria grow in the blocked follicle and lead to inflammation and eventual rupture of the follicle. In noninflam- matory acne , the follicle remains dilated accumulating but doesn't rupture. Acne develops in 80% to 90% of adolescents or young adults, primarily between ages 15 and 18; however, the lesions can appear as early as age 8.

Open comedo (blackhead) An open comedo protrudes from the follicle and isn't covered by the epidermis. Melanin or pigment of the follicle causes the black color.

It mainly involves the heart, joints, central nervous system, skin, and subcutaneous tissues. The antigens of group A streptococci bind to receptors in the heart, muscle, brain, and synovial joints, causing an autoimmune response. Because of a similarity between the antigens of the streptococcus bacteria and the antigens of the body's own cells, antibodies may attack healthy body cells by mistake. Rheumatic heart disease refers to the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever and includes pancarditis (myocarditis, pericarditis, and endocarditis) during the early acute phase and chronic valvular disease later.
