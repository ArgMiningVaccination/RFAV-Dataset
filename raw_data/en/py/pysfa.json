Coronis also took another lover during her pregnancy, a man named Ischys. When Apollo found out about it, he had his sister Artemis kill her. When Coronis was on her funeral pyre, Apollo had the god Hermes cut out her unborn child. He named the boy Asclepius and brought him to Chiron, a centaur who was considered the best teacher in the world. Chiron knew all about science, athletics, and warfare and was known for teaching all the Greek heroes and demi-gods. Education Although most of the boys under Chiron focused on athletics and warfare lessons, Asclepius was more interested in healing and the sciences. He excelled at both, easily becoming the best doctor Chiron had ever trained. His success was due in part to his helpful nature (his name means 'unceasingly gentle'). That concern extended to all animals. The myths say that he once came across a snake and either healed it or saved it. To return the kindness, the snake licked his ears and gave him all of its knowledge about healing and resurrection. The story about Asclepius was remembered everywhere; the international symbol for medicine is a caduceus, which is a snake wrapped around a branch. The Caduceus, International Symbol for Medicine | | Career, Death, and Resurrection Once Asclepius had finished his training, he traveled throughout Greece helping people. He was soon so famous that when the call went out for the famous Calydonian Boar Hunt Asclepius was invited. Asclepius was so talented at his craft that he eventually learned the secret of bringing people back from the dead. He brought so many people back to life that when Hades learned about what he was doing, he was afraid that no one would ever stay in the Underworld again. He complained to his brother, Zeus. Zeus, realizing that life and death had to be left to the gods, struck Asclepius with a thunderbolt and killed him. There are two stories about what happened to the great healer after that. Some say that Zeus resurrected him later on the condition that he would never bring another person back to life without his permission. The other version is that he was brought into the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus, the Serpent Holder. Children and Legacy Asclepius had five daughters - Hygieia (hygiene), Panacea (medicine), Aceso (healing process), Iaso (recuperation from sickness), and Aglaea (healthy glow). He also had three sons - Machaon, Podaleirios and Telesphoros. All eight children were by Epione, the Goddess of Soothing Pain. Asclepius also had a son, Aratus, by Aristodama. All of his children became famous healers. Machaon and Podaleirios also led the Thessalian army at Troy, though Machaon died during the war. Lesson Summary Asclepius was the son of Apollo and Coronis. He loved healing so much that he became better at it than his tutor, Chiron, and his father, the god Apollo. He became so skilled that he learned how to bring the dead back to life. The gods did not approve, causing Zeus to strike him down with a thunderbolt. Whether he was resurrected or made into a constellation, his children carried on his work, spreading their knowledge throughout Greece. "}
