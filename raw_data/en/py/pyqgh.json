Glantz 4 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I extend my utmost respect and gratitude to the elders, home-based caregivers, health and social service providers who have participated in this project. I hope to bring changes merited by the trust and insight you have bestowed upon me. I thank the entire staff, past and present, at the Comit\u00e1n Center for Health Research (CISC) for the many resources that have enabled me to explore well-being in Chiapas. I am ever committed to CISC and to the friendships that have grown from our work. I am forever indebted to George and Jane Collier, Mark and Mimi Nichter, and Ana Alonso for superior guidance, both professional and personal. I aspire to be a mentor of such calibre. To the professors, support staff, and graduate students of Anthropology Department at the University of Arizona, I extend my sincere appreciation for the wonderful learning environment you form. The American Association of University Women, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson Johnson & Johnson Foundation, and the University of Arizona provided generous financial assistance, upon which my doctoral degree has rested. For unending support and encouragement, I offer my heartfelt appreciation to Lupita Alvarez, Crist\u00f3bal Alvaro, Elvira Alvaro, Maricela Freydberg, Goldade, Rosy Guill\u00e9n, David Halperin, Linda Hunt, Imelda Mart\u00ednez, Ben McMahan, Kristin Morris, Margaret Ram\u00edrez, Georgina S\u00e1nchez, Jeff Sczechowski, Janine Laura Tremaine, Barbara Wolf, and Kimetha Vanderveen. Please, please allow me to reciprocate. As for the gratitude my family deserves, words fall frustratingly short. I hope that my actions convey the love of learning, the impetus to help, and the respect for life that you all inspire in me. 5 DEDICATION This dissertation, the effort it entailed, the insight it yields, the degree it confers, and the hope it brings, is dedicated to elder Chiapanecos, and to my children Jessica and Nicol\u00e1s, whose strong, loving spirits are the culmination of the lives of countless elders - Chiapaneco and otherwise. 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS................................................................ 16 LIST OF TABLES............................................................................ 19 ABSTRACT.................................................................................... 20 CHAPTER 1.

I describe my work as part of a larger process, still unfolding, that I helped initiate and continue to trace as an ethnographer engaged in participant observation. My long-term residence and applied health research in Chiapas, graduate training in medical anthropology, and institutional backing from the Comit\u00e1n Center for Health Research (an NGO where I have worked since 1994) equipped me to catalyze engagement around elder health in Comit\u00e1n. To do so, I drew on formative research, a multi-stage participatory process that is iterative and draws upon multiple methods and actors to identify and define a problem, then develop, monitor, and assess locally-congruent interventions. Specifically, I conducted: 1) ethnographic research on middle and lower class elders living alone and with family; 2) an elder health needs and resources survey of 300 households; 3) interviews with elders, home-based caregivers, and formal care providers; 4) an interinstitutional elder health conference and 5) a strategic planning meeting, which spawned 6) an independent working group that is currently exploring potential elder care strategies, with 7) my ongoing facilitation. In detailing elders' lives, problems, and care, I at once address the specific issue of elder well-being in Chiapas as seen by elders, caregivers, and providers, and describe the social relations of community action to provide basic elder care. I take stock of historical factors that have altered family relations and elder care dynamics in Chiapas, including structural adjustment, 21 epidemiological and demographic transitions, globalization, and migration, as well as resultant local and regional socio-political struggles. I give special consideration to the household production of health, gendered differences in elder health and care resources, and the social relations of health care-seeking and therapy management. My findings challenge popular misconceptions regarding elder entitlement and access to economic, cultural, and social capital, and indicate potential solutions. This dissertation, then, illuminates how anthropological research can facilitate community-based problem solving. 22 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION, IMMERSION, IMPETUS A. Engaged anthropology of elder health and care As an engaged medical anthropologist, three interwoven queries underpin my work. First, what can we learn from the study of culture and social organization that informs us about the health of a population, how illness is distributed and experienced, and how family members, neighbors, and social institutions respond to the afflicted? Second, what can we learn from studying people's illness experiences and illness caretaking that informs us about cultural norms and values, social relations, and the way expectancies are mediated by contingencies? Third, how can we apply these insights to public health problem-solving in a manner that at once acknowledges cultural variability and universal human rights? In this dissertation, I provide an account of how I employed medical anthropological research to facilitate critical reflection on the primary health care needs of the elderly in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico. The dissertation at once documents elders' health care needs, and the quality of support they receive from their families and health care providers, while describing the collaborative problem-solving process that I helped facilitate, which raised local awareness and brought together key community actors to explore ways of improving elder well-being. My concerns about elder well-being in Chiapas were initially inspired by my interaction - as a friend, neighbor, colleague, wife, mother, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, 23 Godmother, comadre1 - with Chiapanecos during my extended residence there (1991- 1992, 1994-2000, 2004-2005). By describing Do\u00f1a Cristina, an older Chiapaneca woman near whom I lived for years, I sketch the physical and social landscape that motivated me to delve into elder health and care in Chiapas. B. Do\u00f1a Cristina2: life of an older woman in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico I met Do\u00f1a Cristina in 1995 at a birthday party for a mutual friend. I arrived at the door just as this 65-year old woman was struggling to knock with a plate of stuffed jalapeno peppers in one hand, and a multi-colored Jello castle in the other. Do\u00f1a Cristina lived around the corner, and ran a small convenience store out of her front room. It was stocked floor to ceiling with pasta, cereal, soap, candy, chips, soda, trinkets. I became a loyal customer, and saw her a few times a week. I worried whenever I saw do\u00f1a Cristina's store closed, because it meant that she wasn't feeling well. This occurred more frequently as time went on. She had hypertension, but would only take her medication when she had enough money to buy it. She also said she was on a \"forced diet,\" eating less \"good food\" because it was too expensive. Arthritis hit her during the dank rainy season. She used to crochet, but her sore joints and poor eyesight bothered her. These symptoms were punctuated by colds, coughs, indigestion. But Do\u00f1a Cristina always worked. Over the years, I learned a bit about her life. Among the youngest of eight children, she was born on a farm outside Comit\u00e1n, where her parents had toiled for the landowners. As a young girl, she moved to Comit\u00e1n and worked as a maid in an upper class home. Around age 16, she married a mason's apprentice. They had three children, bang-bang-bang. She hand-washed and ironed clothes, charging by the dozen, sold snacks, raised hens, but found it harder to make ends meet, as her children aged and her husband's drinking increased. When her children were in their early teens, her husband left for good, which she describes as a relief. Soon, her daughter married and moved to Mexico City. Her youngest son died in a car accident. Her oldest son helped her set up her front-room store and often dropped off her grandson when he and his wife needed a babysitter, but as he grew larger and she became weaker, he was a handful. 1 In this document, I reserve the use of italics to denote words untranslated from English. 2 In this document, all names of elders are pseudonyms. 24 Do\u00f1a Cristina had very little income, and had lived without child support, pension, savings, or property. She lived in a house that her son \"lent\" her, a cement-block structure, with a few rooms, no frills, a Coca Cola emblem painted on the front. As larger grocery stores sprung up around her, she began selling women's clothing, cilantro from her tiny garden, tostadas in her doorway on weekend evenings. Every peso counted. Support from the government was meager. Do\u00f1a Cristina had no health insurance because neither she, nor her husband, or children had formal employment. For health care, she waited in line at the Health Center, with varying results, or simply went to the nearby pharmacy. To her frustration, she was not old enough or poor enough to receive public assistance, although she did recount one instance of public investment. One year, the governor was scheduled to tour the \"quaint, colonial\" streets of Comit\u00e1n, so all of the streets on the route between the Town Hall and the Mayor's mansion were paved. Do\u00f1a Cristina's dusty dirt road turned into a beautiful street, which increased car traffic and clientele. Do\u00f1a Cristina had siblings, an ex-husband, children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, neighbors, and acquaintances from the Catholic church, but she could not really count on anyone for care. In the evenings, she would read the Bible or listen to the radio in only the company of her parrot. In many ways, do\u00f1a Cristina is representative of elder women in Comit\u00e1n. I wondered what the future held for her and others. Would families, the state, the community care for them? This triggered research that continues today. My dissertation describes this unfolding process. 25 C. My immersion - academic, personal, professional - in Chiapas I approached this exploration from a privileged position, fully immersed academically, then personally and professionally in Chiapas. A student of anthropology and education, I began my academic trajectory in Chiapas in 1990, when I first visited the state to conduct participant observation in a continuing education program for indigenous teachers. I analyzed rural, indigenous teachers' empowerment via formal and hidden curricula of their government-run training program. I followed this research experience with a study of language use and learning among the urban working population, from which developed a culturally- and contextually-appropriate adult ESL course. During the same period, I became versed in conducting bibliographic and on-site data searches, data entry, and coding of sociodemographic and political indicators in southeast Mexico as a research assistant for Anthropologist/Latin Americanist George Collier. Finally, I collaborated in the founding of a bilingual elementary school, in which I subsequently taught Chiapaneco children and adults. These academic endeavors gave me incentive to interact with people of all walks of life at home, in schools, on playing fields, at research centers, in the street, in businesses. I polished my Spanish and acquired a Chiapaneco accent. I got my feet wet in anthropology and education. Mostly, I became enamored with the people, the place, and the cultures. In 1994, three events deepened my immersion in Chiapas. First, the Zapatista uprising rattled the state, indeed the nation. As did the world, I immediately saw Chiapas in a new light. What had seemed a colorful mecca of cultural confluence was suddenly charged 26 with conflict, as the Zapatistas contested entrenched social, political, and economic inequities. My personal interest in supporting positive change in Chiapas was awakened. Given the wariness of the Mexican government of foreigners in Chiapas, however, I would have to avoid overt political and religious activism. In studying health, I hoped to find a practical, pan-partisan cause that would allow me to help Chiapanecos while not calling attention to my presence. Second, my personal immersion in the region deepened when, later in 1994, I married a native Chiapaneco. I settled in Comit\u00e1n with my husband, and we established a tae kwon do school, where I did everything from balancing the books to teaching classes to mopping floors. The relationships forged with the students exist today, and I have gained God-children and compadres through the school. Later, my close relationships with Chiapanecos grew exponentially when, in 1998 and 1999, I gave birth to my daughter and son, both in Comit\u00e1n. With these events, I came to envision Chiapas as a life-long home, where I would grow old alongside my husband, children, and extended family. Figure 1.1, Photo, Namino and some extended family in Chiapas. 27 My professional engagement was not far behind. Upon moving to Comit\u00e1n, I had to find a job, but soon learned that, with the exception, perhaps, of archeology, Comit\u00e1n is not an anthropological stronghold. (By contrast, in the central highlands of Chiapas, where I had previously lived, there is a long-standing tradition of sociocultural anthropology. In fact, people joke that the average central highland family is conformed of father, mother, children, and an anthropologist.) My professional life took a turn when I stumbled upon the Comit\u00e1n Center for Health Research, my third immersion-shaping event of 1994. Founded in 1990, the Comit\u00e1n Center for Health Research (Centro de Investigaciones en Salud de Comit\u00e1n, CISC), touts a long, deep involvement health and health care in of Chiapas. CISC is a non-government organization aimed at informing the development of interventions promoting health and well-being, equitable gender relations, fair access to quality health services, and information exchange among relevant institutional actors and population groups. Simultaneously, CISC strives to shape strategic human resources to apply their skills in social science and public health in Chiapas. In 1994, CISC hired me as a researcher, but I envision my work as more that of a translator: between Spanish and English, medicine and anthropology, quantitative and qualitative, men and women, rich funders and marginalized Chiapanecos, North and South, urban and rural, paper and reality. CISC's work highlights how unequal power relations reflected in social inequalities, including gender, class, and ethnicity, are manifest in health-related situations. The Center has been especially attentive to 28 marginalized and vulnerable populations, such as people living with HIV/AIDS, women facing domestic violence, economically and socially denigrated indigenous populations, and teens with little legal reign over their health. Yet in its first decade, CISC had not focused at all on older adults. For my PhD, then, I revisited the question of elder well- being, forging a new thematic axis around elder health and care at CISC. My experience at CISC informed and was informed by my subsequent graduate training, for which I purposefully chose the University of Arizona in Tucson. Its Department of Anthropology boasts a strong tradition of applied anthropology, as well as a seasoned medical anthropology program. There, I found work done by Mark Nichter in the applied, community-based research tradition that I longed to master and apply in Chiapas. Others, such as Ana Alonso, based work on a rich tradition of research in Mexico. The location, too, attracted me. The northern border region of Mexico would certainly shed light on Chiapas, Mexico's southern border. Further, close proximity to both Native American and Mexican communities meant that I could study while being steeped in the cultures that so intrigued me, and also that my husband and children, all having lived their entire lives in Chiapas, would have access to Mexican social circles, food, language, and flights. Tucson seemed the closest we could be to home while away from home. My graduate training in medical anthropology provided me with a theoretical focus on inequity in health and health care as well as practical strategies by which to apply this theory to solutions. Because of my work background at CISC and my life experiences in 29 Chiapas, I was always able to link issues and tools presented in the abstract with specific, on-the-ground problems and research in Chiapas. Additionally, CISC has been an attentive audience for the knowledge and skills that I have gained in graduate school. I recognized very quickly that all of my work at CISC had focused on health disparity, mediated by interpersonal power relations, much of this specifically related to gendered inequities. I also realized that CISC's mode of operations has not only a name (community-based participatory research), but also advantages and certain little- discussed risks. Coursework and ongoing work at CISC underscored the value of integrating a formative research approach to fortify research processes and outcomes, as well as the utility of a applying a critical social capital perspective. These orientations (detailed in Chapter 2) came to structure my doctoral research. 30 D. Questions guiding the dissertation Thus, the pressing problem of elder health care, personal investment in solving it, support from CISC, and the tools to address it converged, placing me in an ideal position to facilitate a process of exploration and action to transform elder well-being in Comit\u00e1n. The queries initially inspired by people like Do\u00f1a Cristina as far back as 1990 evolved over the following years into the questions guiding my dissertation: \u0001 What are elders' principal health problems? \u0001 What resources (family, state, civil society) do elders draw on to address these problems? \u0001 How and why are elder health, resources, and care-seeking strategies gendered? \u0001 How has broader sociodemographic change impacted elder well-being? \u0001 How can local people be engaged in exploring and transforming elder health and care? \u0001 How can I - as an engaged medical anthropologist - facilitate this process? 31 Figure 1.2, Photo, Comit\u00e1n street. Figure 1.3, Photo, Santo Domingo Church. E. Socio-historical urgency of elder well-being in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico Chiapas, initially a study-abroad destination and then my home and workplace, became the field site in which I explored these questions. The urgency of studying these issues at this moment in time arises from the socio-historic context and the impact of this history on community and household relations as well as on health institutions and policy. 1. General regional history Chiapas is a very rich land. The state boasts farmland (cultivated mainly in corn, coffee, and beans); grazing land and cattle; forests; petroleum reserves; hydroelectric resources; and tourist attractions (colonial cities, archeological sites, rivers, beaches, and ecological 32 regions). Despite these resources, the majority of Chiapanecos have long been - and remain - very poor. The Mexican Revolution brought the hope of economic redistribution and social justice. Indeed, this decade-long struggle culminated in Mexico's 1917 Constitution, which charters high ideals of state responsibility for social and economic rights. Nevertheless, critics contend that Chiapas' wealth has persisted in the hands of a few landowners who have used their political clout to modernize Chiapas in order to preserve their power and wealth, while the vast majority of those Chiapanecos who worked to make Chiapas rich have remained poor. From this perspective, the Mexican Revolution merely threatened - without thwarting - enduring efforts of the rich to reform the state for their own benefit (Benjamin 1996). After depression hit the country in the 1930s, recovery took the form of import- substitution industrial development coupled to agrarian reform to assure production of cheap basic foods. The state's programs were managed by a one-party umbrella government under the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional). Validated by managed elections from one presidential term to the next, the PRI fostered state-led petroleum and manufacturing industries, but the policy of holding down basic food prices ultimately brought agricultural crisis and basic food shortfalls. Agrarian producers began to replace basic consumption products (such as corn and beans) with products destined for international commerce grown agroindustrially. Subsidies and agrarian reform, along 33 with public education, social security, and health investment helped keep unrest in check. In the post-OPEC years from 1973 to 1982, Mexico accepted loans for development of petroleum and other development infrastructure from the world banking system (Collier G. 2005, Benjamin 1996). Mexico seemed to have found a solution to its economic woes. But then world oil prices plunged in 1982, leaving Mexico with ever-escalating external debt and a threat of default. To avert default, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Interamerican Bank forced Mexico to refinance the debt and restructure its budget. In 1983, the Mexican government began structural adjustment, with efforts on cleaning up public finances, restructuring national businesses, and opening the country to international financial capital via free market policies. The latter strategy transformed the country from one of the most closed to one of the most open economies in the world (Ocampo Guzm\u00e1n 1999). At the same time that the government curtailed subsidies for peasant production, especially in farming country, many returned to agriculture in an attempt to develop a \"diversified portfolio\" of livelihoods (Collier G. 2005). For peasant farmers, corn came to represent a sort of life insurance, grown for subsistence and cash. Under the 1988-94 presidency of Salinas de Gortari, restructuring led to the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which while opening up the rest of the economy would purportedly stimulate \"backward\" segments of agriculture to reorganize in order to assure the production of basic foodstuffs as well as 34 export crops. Chiapanecan agriculture, however, has proven to be very vulnerable to external competition. Chiapaneco farmers are less productive than many foreign counterparts and their cost of production is superior, compounded by myriad middlemen as well as global monopolies on raw resources. Free trade has therefore squeezed out a great number of Chiapanecan producers. Agriculture in Chiapas is now split between: a) highly technical and mechanized commercial agriculture managed nationally and dedicated to export crops such as coffee and bananas as well as to beef and corn for the national market; and b) labor-intensive subsistence farming by peasants in marginalized areas that lack agrarian infrastructure. (Ocampo Guzm\u00e1n 1999) The impoverishment of the peasant farming economy has provoked many Chiapanecos to migrate, both to more urban and frontier areas within Chiapas, as well as to other parts of Mexico, and increasingly to try their luck in the United States (Collier G. 2005). Migratory flows through the state also include northbound Central Americans and Chiapanecos who migrate locally in pursuit of in-state seasonal work. While migrants are predominantly young men, their movement impacts the comparatively sedentary women, children, and elders. Not only has participation in the global economy undermined the agricultural basis of peasant life, but it has also split rich and poor across lines of opportunity, such as the ability to pay for now indispensable agrochemicals and to engage in off-farm activities such as trucking (Collier G. 2005, Ocampo Guzm\u00e1n 1999). Class stratification and 35 political schisms have become more pronounced between and among both peasants3 and landowners (Collier G. 2005). Free trade has thus not brought well-being to the majority of Chiapanecos, whose futures now are affected more by international capital than by Mexican and Chiapas government policy. Chiapas is rich in natural resources and cheap labor, but these factors of production have lost their relative weight given the configuration of international competition; transnational capital, science, and technology that are now key factors, as well as inputs that Chiapas lacks. Evidence suggests that free trade, rather than a silver bullet, has provoked a fall in Mexican national production, increased unemployment, decreased income, and has dangerously skewed the balance between exterior commerce and foreign investment4. This led to the extreme devaluation of the peso in late 1994, as well as to immense internal and external debt. (Ocampo Guzm\u00e1n 1999) Neoliberal fallout in Chiapas has provoked protest, among which the 1994 political- military uprising of the Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (EZLN) has been the most prominent \"awakening.\" The Mexican government's response has been deemed too little, too late. Benjamin concludes, While the national government has dramatically increased spending in the state in an attempt to smother discontent, it has proven unwilling or unable to reform the basic socioeconomic structure of Chiapas, which gave rise to the conflict in the first place. (Benjamin 1996: 260) 3 Collier defines 'peasant' as \"rural people who produce their own food or who are closely connected to others who produce for subsistence, as contrasted wit those who farm commercial crops primarily for sale and profit\" (Collier, G. 2005: 8). 4 By 1980, for instance, Mexico imported 25% of its corn (Collier, G. 2005: 94-96). 36 2. Impact on community and household relations Mexico's economic dynamic has widened the gap between rich and poor and wreaked havoc on community and household dynamics, changing the relationships between women and men, young and old, and among community members and groups. While mutual dependency, sharing, and complementary domestic activities used to underpin much of Chiapanecan family and community life, today, control of capital, finance, and political power have become the crucial differentials in this new market orientation. Commerce, market production, and consumption have fractured entire communities along class, political, and religious fault lines. Economic relationships used to be subsumed in social ties; now, economic relations remain purely economic. The money- based economic system has also prompted a shift from a rank-based political system to a class-based politics, in which leaders (often young) may seek personal gain to the detriment of community benefit (Collier G. 2005). At the level of household, families that used to rely on working together for subsistence now must send members out to earn cash. Further, women's traditional ways of contributing to household strategies have been undermined by the reorientation of work toward men's wage work and business. (Collier et al. 2000; Collier G. 2005) The definition of family support, for men, no longer centers on provisioning their household with corn, but instead with commodities bought with earnings, i.e. \"seeking money\" over \"seeking food\" (Collier, G. 2005: 114, Collier 1994). Collier et al. (2000) argue of the nearby Central Highlands: 37 Highland Chiapas has been undergoing socio-economic transformation in recent years, changing the social formation underpinning the very meaning of interpersonal relationships in family life and production. Families used to subsist on labor-intensive production, which all household members shared, guaranteeing all members rights to consumption. Growth of the commercial economy has drawn individuals, especially men, out of the agrarian food-securing economy into money-making activities that threaten the ideology and practices of shared consumption in the home. When men feel justified in spending 'their' earnings on drink and fancy clothes, women and children may go hungry, yet have lost the ability to revindicate their claims on men's earnings on the basis of production in which they shared. (Collier et al. 2000: 48) In addition to marital conflicts, Collier (2005) notes that the focus on wage work has made the generation gap between young 'upstart' men and their elders more pronounced. He observes that, \"In the past, there was a general correlation of increasing age with wealth, but since 1981, this correlation has reversed\" (Collier G. 2005: 114). Economic independence of youth also changed courtship and marriage dynamics, shifting from long, costly courtships tying families together, to socially-isolating elopement. Collier contends, \"The process of change has... favored the young over the old, men over women, and has altered the meaning of working together within extended families\" (Collier 1994: 82, also Collier G. 2005). Factors influencing the shift in household, kinship, and gender ideals include rising rates of education, life expectancy, women's participation in the paid workforce, urbanization, and infrastructure (electricity, running water); as well as declines in fertility rates, a shift from agriculture-based economy to remittance-based economy, insecurity of male employment, and 'modern' images of family life overcoming 'traditional' patriarchal family relationships (e.g. in the media). We can expect such changes to impact elder health and care. 38 3. History of health institutions and services in Chiapas and in Comit\u00e1n Health institutions and services in Comit\u00e1n, too, reflect the legacy of Mexico's twentieth century development of strong state institutions that grew in the post-depression years but have been compromised and seriously challenged by structural adjustment imposed on Mexico after the 1982 external debt crisis. Following the revolution, Mexico's progressive constitution promised a state that would offer education, health, and social services while guaranteeing economic and social rights. However, government fulfillment of the its promises proved problematic at best in the first two decades after the Revolution (c.f. Benjamin 1996). State institutions only emerged with strength as Mexico recovered from the 1930s depression through import- substitution industrial development. In this context, health and social services developed much as other state-led institutions, centralized from the nation's capitol with a with burgeoning bureaucracy, oriented primarily to urban, formal-sector employers and unionized workers in the state-sponsored industries and bureaucracies, with weak reach to rural areas or to provincial towns or cities in the peripheries. Yet health and social services did extend further in the late 1970s and early 1980s as Mexico accepted loans for development. This era saw the construction of state health facilities in small cities such as Comit\u00e1n, the staffing of health services by professionals trained in Mexico's national university system, and even the outreach of services to rural clinics through primary care staff in some areas. The Comit\u00e1n General Hospital was 39 developed by a group of very committed health professionals out of the left in the 1970s. For a time, this hospital was one of the most innovated, best-run hospitals in Chiapas (G. Collier, personal communication, 2007). With Comit\u00e1n on the health map, it was also during the early 1980s that the future founders of CISC, young progressive health providers, made their way to Comit\u00e1n. Such expansion suffered setbacks and severe reversals after world oil prices plunged in 1982. The setbacks continued through structural adjustment imposed on the country by global financial institutions in the years thereafter. Mexico redirected much of its social welfare budget to the refinancing of external debt. Health and other professionals on government salaries frozen in the face of rampant inflation began to moonlight in the private, fee-based sector. The budgets for health supplies shrank relative to costs, leaving hospitals and clinics without the medications formerly made available to patients on a fee or nominal cost basis, resulting in a growing role of private pharmacies. Health institutions tended to shrink to the irreducibles of physical plants and bureaucratized, unionized work staff as health services seeped out into the private sector for those well- enough off to pay. (Collier 2005, G. Collier, personal communication, 2007) Yet another consequence of post-1982 structural adjustment in Mexico was the growth of civil society and non-government institutions to fill the gap left by the shriveling state services and the elimination of safety nets even in urban areas. Chiapas, including Comit\u00e1n, benefited from the growth of civil society, especially after Mexico City's 1985 40 earthquake, which contributed to an exodus of much of the capitol's middle class to small cities in the provinces where life was more affordable and less fraught with the intractables of Mexico City's mega-growth. Ironically, thus, Comit\u00e1n has gained in its educated professional-class educators and health and social service workers even in the face of structural adjustment embraced as neoliberal policy. These professional classes straddle under-funded and functionally challenged state institutions, the private sector, and civil society NGOs competing for foundation and World Bank funding. (G. Collier, personal communication, 2007) Meanwhile, since the 1994 Zapatista rebellion, which was in part a reaction to the cutback in state programs under austerity, Comit\u00e1n and Chiapas have experienced a burgeoning of state and civil-society palliatives for the region's structurally marginalized economy and polarized politics. This has added to the influx of middle-class professionals in social services. These, at the same time, have had to deal with the needs of refugees into Comit\u00e1n, of ladino small-holders and indigenous peasants affiliated with the ruling party who were driven out of the Zapatista heartland immediately to the east of Comit\u00e1n by the rebels in and after 1994. Today, Comit\u00e1n is home to at least five distinct classes, an artifact of its history (G. Collier, personal communication, 2007). Comit\u00e1n was a frontier of agrarian Chiapas as it developed in the 19th century, and of the Lacand\u00f3n Rainforest, where logging occurred at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th centuries. The old local elites, who made their 41 fortunes in this era on the backs of indigenous (Tojolabal) indentured slaves, have city homes in Comit\u00e1n even though their key sources of wealth were/are control of the state government (and thus state resources like hydroelectric power), as well as ranching, logging, and coffee in more rural areas. This class includes renowned Comiteco novelist Rosario Castellanos and her family, as well as Absal\u00f3n Castellanos Dom\u00ednguez, the repressive state governor in the 1970s and early 80s, whom the Zapatistas kidnapped. Then there is an old mestizo middle class of businessmen and craftsmen, as well as the popular class of poor ladinos. Most of the elders with whom I worked belong to this group. On the other hand, there are more recent arrivals to the city and those who have left and returned. Small-holder ladinos and indigenous types affiliated with the government that the Zapatistas drove out of eastern Chiapas in 1994 form a group of recent immigrants. Finally, Comit\u00e1n is home to a professional class, middle class in income and with corresponding values and attitudes. These individuals are mostly from elsewhere, but also include the university educated children of Comit\u00e1n's elite families. They are now linked to federally-funded institutions and to civil society, and include leading CISC researchers and the elder health care providers with whom I conducted research. In general, Comit\u00e1n's power holders have not concerned themselves with the health of the city's most marginalized, voiceless class, which includes the elders about whom this dissertation concerns. In this dissertation, I note how this legacy of structural inequality and class difference between health service providers and their elder patients impacts elders' health and caring resources in Comit\u00e1n. 42 These local relations are embedded in the larger context of elder health and care in Mexico, detailed in Chapter 3. In this contextual overview, I discern particularities that distinguish aging, elder health, and elder care in Mexico from dynamics elsewhere in the world, posing challenges to addressing elder well-being throughout the nation. In doing so, I question common assumptions about what Mexican elders' health problems are and the institutions they can count on to satisfy their care needs. Four key circumstances influences elder health and care in Mexico. First, distinctive epidemiological and demographic transitions in Mexico require a custom-designed elder health care response.Mexico's distinctions include: unusually accelerated aging of the Mexican population, Mexico's growing non-infectious disease burden, and the perseverance of infectious disease. The state response has to be based on knowledge of local conditions and distinctions between and among population sub-groups, because ill health and care resources are very inequitably distributed. Second, the Mexican health care system has been designed to meet the needs of a younger, more homogenous population, making it inadequate to serve this emerging group of older adults residing in very distinct contexts. Finally, entitlement among Mexican elders to care and resources in the household may also be less pervasive and less predictable than hoped for due to a potential decrease in the number of household members and shifts in the values underlying Mexican elders' entitlement to home-based care. Mexicans' moral identity includes a sense of responsibility for the most vulnerable sectors of society, including the very young, the very old, and the invalid. The well-43 being of these groups is a barometer of wider social health, such that their illth is a warning sign that the social fabric is becoming unraveled in the face of today's social and economic dilemmas. In this context of rapid change, the relations of the personal to the social become clearly manifest in health problems and care. As Collier notes, The loss of traditional protections within communities comes at a time when government support, particularly rural subsidies, are also declining. As these protections erode, the very poorest people... have begun to fall out of the bottom strata of their communities.... (Collier, G. 2005: 123). In Mexico, there is a sense that the government is responsible for providing universal health care, and there is discourse on the moral obligation to provide family-based care. But, there is also some recognition that family and state have not resolved the needs of certain sub-groups. While not necessarily absolving these two institutions of their responsibilities, civil society has stepped in to address some of these issues, for instance among women and indigenous populations in Chiapas. Now, elders' needs will have to be met by collaborative efforts between the state, family, and civil society (especially non-government organizations like CISC). 44 F. Chapter overview: Formative research process and products My task has been to facilitate this process. I did this by using data as the hook to create links between these various sectors and the multiple stakeholders within each. I used various strategies to accomplish this dual job: conducting an elder health forum; a survey; interviews; and a strategic planning meeting, which spawned an independent working group. Figure 1.4 outlines the unfolding steps in my ongoing formative research on elder health and care. Having outlined the national, regional, and local context, as well as my immersion in it, in Chapter 1; set out guiding theoretical and methodological tenets in Chapter 2; and described the larger context of elder health and care in Mexico in Chapter 3; in Chapter 4, I describe how I initiated local engagement in elder health and care in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico. I drew on CISC's institutional backing to organize an elder health forum. Participants included many health and social service providers, local researchers, the media, and a few elders. Although attendance was limited to 30 people, a reporter asserted that, had we opened the doors to the general public, \"the soccer stadium wouldn't be big enough to hold everyone.\" At this forum, participants identified useful, urgent research issues, voiced initiatives for action, and committed to collaboration in research. This is a clear expression of research that is both intervention and data, the merging of process and product. 45 Figure 1.4, Unfolding steps in formative research on elder health and care.

Further, I problematize \"community,\" as forum attendees were primarily upper-middle class professionals who could not be equated with \"the community\" of Comit\u00e1n. My next step was to talk with those who did not participate in the forum, i.e. elders. Further impetus to do so came from practitioners' comments about the lack of baseline data on elder health problems and care. They wanted what they referred to as a \"diagnostic assessment.\" To access this data, I coordinated the design and application of an elder health and care survey5, described in Chapter 5. With CISC colleagues, I structured the 340 questions to gather data comparable to national findings, and added issues deemed locally-relevant based on CISC's expertise, forum insight, and pilot surveys. We surveyed 300 elders aged 50 and up, stratified by age, gender, and neighborhood. To understand the experience behind the numbers, and allow elders to voice their concerns, I also conducted semi-structured interviews and open-ended dialogue with elders and home-based caregivers. Three threads run through the cases: 1) the gendered nature of elder health and care, 2) the inadequacy of local health care services, and 3) economic vulnerability. I provide a comprehensive description of elders' demographics, problems, and care strategies. Additionally, I present twenty commonly-held assumptions about elder well- being and care, and how the formative research illuminated these misconceptions. 5 Methods were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Arizona to ensure the highest ethical treatment of human subjects. 47 I then continue to weave insight from open-ended interviews and survey data together to form a detailed description of elder health problems in Chapter 6 and care strategies in Chapter 7. I stress that most of the maladies plaguing elders in Comit\u00e1n did not differ greatly from those faced by elders in the United States and elsewhere; the context was the distinguishing factor. In Comit\u00e1n, elders confronted ill health with very limited social, economic, and structural resources. This situation not only made it difficult to avoid and address problems, but exacerbated them, as well. The surveys, interviews, and case narratives all indicate the gendered nature of elder health and care. Indeed, my initial review of census data had revealed a potential anomaly regarding elder well-being in Chiapas: statistics on life expectancy that suggested that elder men were outliving elder women. This trend, if substantiated, contrasts with global and national feminization of aging in which women outlive men. In Chapter 8, I describe how elder women not only suffered from some health problems distinct from those plaguing men, but also how elder women faced a disproportionate ill health burden compared to their local male counterparts, and often to their national female cohort. I then draw on insight gained about their lives to spotlight fundamental gendered contrasts in life experiences that might contribute to the documented health and care inequities. These revolved around the opportunity costs of marriage and children, the repercussions of life work, and the burden of lack of infrastructure. These gendered 48 inequities contrasted with health care services that seemed to assume that elder men and women confronted similar ill health burdens with a similar store of resources. The Mexican government has made great efforts to provide health care for much of its population. The state has achieved considerable advances over the past few decades, especially in the areas of maternal, infant, and child health. That said, the data presented in the previous chapters indicate that attention and resources dedicated to addressing elder well-being has been insufficient. In Chapter 9, I explore specific health care services accessed by elders in Comit\u00e1n, from the perspectives of those who provide this care: health care practitioners6. I contrast providers' official version and their unofficial assessment, and how both perspectives differed greatly from elders' experiences. I suggest that contrasts were an artifact of class-based differences between marginalized elders and the upper-middle class professionals who supposedly served them. Despite their concern and good intentions, providers had a distorted view of elders' situations. On the other hand, practitioners were ideally positioned to identify inter-institutional challenges and the underlying misallocation of state resources and misguided priorities among state policy makers above them. My next task would be to create a space in which to initiate a discussion of these contrasting perspectives and then engage stakeholders in using this insight to shape \"the politics of the possible.\" 6 Hereafter referred to as \"providers\" or \"practitioners\" to distinguish them from people who care for elders outside the clinical setting, referred to as \"home-based caregivers\" or \"caregivers.\" 49 The most widely embraced proposal at the initial forum and in interviews with providers was to hold a meeting in which interested individuals might strategize together. In Chapter 10, I detail how I organized, this time independently of CISC, the \"first strategic meeting for planning related to health and well-being in the third age.\" This meeting began with reflection on forum content. We then discussed survey progress and preliminary results, participants' insight directly applicable to subsequent research. Infused with both concern and hope, the conversation then turned to the formation of an independent (from government and non-government institutions) working group. Participants decided to establish this group then and there. They carefully created its title (Committee for Integral & Multidisciplinary Care for Older Adults, CAIMAM), crafted a mission statement, discussed guidelines for membership and decision-making, and appointed a coordinator. In this way, a community-based organization was born of interaction regarding community-generated insight and local interest in transformative action; \"the community\" in this case consisted of professional health and social service providers and CISC researchers. I then discuss how, in the process of the Strategic Meeting and in the creation of the CAIMAM working group, I managed to both engage local people and then hand over the reigns. I consciously worked to reverse roles so that rather than expert researcher and project organizer, I became a facilitator, while local people took over as a group (rather than as disparate individuals). So, after jumpstarting local action, I transitioned into an advisory role as this group matured. 50 In the final section of Chapter 10, I present a recent attempt to maintain interest and inspire problem-solving in CAIMAM. Drawing on providers' suggestions, I document an emerging notion of what primary elder care in Comit\u00e1n might look like. I present this in the form of a very rough sketch of components of an Elder Primary Health Care (EPHC) system. In this model, I consolidate the wide range of needs and resources identified by providers into components that may serve as the foundation for local critique and creative problem-solving. My goal is to encourage CAIMAM to bring together key individuals and institutions to review this and other options, select facets that are appropriate and viable, and develop a plan to refine, propose, and enact intervention. In my ongoing role as facilitator, I hope to provide insight from a medical anthropology stance regarding how to ground the group's proposals in the reality revealed by the formative research. The CAIMAM working group has gone on to initiate and carry out activities, including forging collaboration with the state through ongoing CAIMAM meetings, conducting inter-institutional elder care events, reviving previous proposals for changes in local government, and generating a new research proposal on quality of life among older adults. In Chapter 11, I briefly outline these initiatives and my roles in them. I then describe two of my strategies - and varying degrees of success - to engage stakeholders from afar. I first tried sending the mass of survey data in a CD containing hundreds of tables of percentages. I soon realized that these tables, and even the summary documents 51 I produced from them, were too quantitative and inspired no interaction at all. The format left a chasm between numbers and local environment. A subsequent, particularly fruitful strategy resulted from teaming up with fellow graduate student, Ben McMahan. We took data from the survey and mapped it via Global Information Systems (GIS). Specifically, we used GIS to generate various sets of maps from the survey database, addressing a myriad of health- and care-related issues and using an array of GIS visualization tools, aimed at inducing diverse types of thinking exercises. McMahan than shared these maps with local stakeholders, including CAIMAM participants, CISC personnel, and other local researchers. On one level, the maps were prolific ethnographic elicitors, evoking direct reflection on and evaluation of the data presented. At a deeper level, the maps encouraged appropriation of the research products and process. Beyond evidencing the potential of the formative research-participatory GIS merger in catalyzing problem-solving initiatives, this strategy inspired reflection on the power relations between researchers and local people in participatory research. In Chapter 12, I discuss how adopting the formative research framework and viewing the problem of elder health and care from a social capital perspective allowed me to overcome two shortcomings of community-based participatory research: the reification of community and the idealization of participation. I then describe the resources (i.e. economic, cultural, and especially social capital) actually available to elders and to health care providers in Comit\u00e1n. This analysis allows me to then make informed recommendations regarding how to foster convertible capital among elder health and care 52 stakeholders in Comit\u00e1n, including elders, home-based caregivers, local non-government organizations, health care providers and the institutions in which they work. I posit my role as a catalyst and facilitator, linking and mobilizing people around what they feel they have a moral imperative to do (the politics of responsibility) and what they can do, and do well (the politics of possibility). This conclusion, representative of my whole dissertation and indeed my life's work, exemplifies how I have done both anthropology in elder health, applying practical lessons from qualitative research to support local people in on-the-ground community-based problem solving; and anthropology of elder health, gleaning strengths of social science theory to critically examine and critique health practice, policy, and research itself. In other words, it is an account of striving to engage in real world problem solving and maintain a critical perspective, what Mark Nichter terms \"engaged anthropology.\" Figure 1.5, Photo, elder sitting by her hearth. 53 CHAPTER 2. ISSUES, METHODS, AND THEORIES ENGAGED Overview of Chapter 2 In preparation for discussing my research, I draw on literature to outline issues, methodological approaches, and theoretical perspectives. First, I introduce the interwoven topics of aging, gender, and well-being, as well as contextual factors shaping their confluence. I then propose a feminist life-course perspective as a fruitful orientation for studying aging-gender-health interplay. Second, I outline methodological approaches guiding my work. Initially, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model informed my research. However, as I attempted to identify and delineate \"the community\" with which I would work, I found the CBRP approach wanting, as it takes \"the community\" for granted and tends to idealize \"participation,\" often obscuring relations of power among stakeholders. I could not assume one reified community, nor could I presume the unproblematic nature of participation. These realizations moved me to practice formative research and to apply a critical social capital perspective. Blending these various approaches allowed me to engage local stakeholders in the research, while problematizing the notions of \"community\" and \"participation\" so often posited as key to healthy people and healthy research. The combination of the feminist life-span perspective, the formative research model, and the social capital orientation guide this dissertation. These are not new concepts; development and neoliberal reform have long-drawn attention to issues of equity, community-based research, and social capital dynamics. Insight gained from years of 54 refinement of these methods and theories through their application to other issues allowed me to apply them successfully to a nascent dilemma: elder health and care. In this dissertation, I detail my trajectory through the stages of formative research to understand and address elder well-being in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico. My goal was as much about gathering data and refining theories as about initiating and facilitating a process. Chapters following this literature review detail both process and product. 55 A. Aging, gender, and health 1. General context Aging, gender, and health have multiple meanings, and the three cannot be understood in isolation. Among the contextual factors that shape their confluence are health transitions; continually evolving culture and ideology; and changes in social policy, institutions, and services. The health transitions are two-fold. Demographic transition, or increasing longevity, has been brought about by decreasing fertility and mortality rates. Epidemiological transition refers to decreasing infectious and acute illness, with increasing disability and chronic-degenerative illness (Salgado & Wong 2003, WHO 2003, PAHO/WHO 2002, Reyes Fausto 2001). The interplay between these two transitions and gender has yielded the feminization of aging, or the global tendency for women to live longer and suffer from higher rates of chronic disease and disabilities than men (PAHO/WHO 2002, WHO 2002, Restrepo & Rozental 1994). Increased longevity and growing numbers of elderly represent both a success and a challenge. Longer lives are not always healthy lives, and there is much disparity among and between groups in terms of life span and quality (WHO 2002, PAHO/WHO 2002). The confluence of aging, gender, and health is also shaped by the culture and ideology surrounding each notion. In terms of the social construction of aging, for example, in biomedicine, aging has been defined as a continuum of physical, psychological, and cognitive decay. Notions of gender, also socially constructed, have dictated roles of men and women, for instance that older men retire while older women continue with 56 housework and caring for young and infirm family members. Influential social constructions of health include the idea of menopause as a dreaded deficiency disease. Such notions of aging, health, and gender are continuously contested and ever-evolving. Further, shifts in culture and ideology impact and are impacted by social policy, institutions, and services. For instance, changes in retirement eligibility policy, restructuring of health institutions, and shifts in health services all impact the experience of aging, gender, and health. 2. Life-course perspective A fruitful orientation from which to study the interplay of aging, gender, and health is the feminist life-course perspective. Old age is often segregated conceptually from young and middle adulthood. Gerontology and geriatrics, for instance, have tended to focus exclusively on old age and the elderly, often arbitrarily defined (e.g. the American bureaucratic system splits young from old at age 65). Aging, however, is a cumulative experience spanning one's entire life (Climo 1992, Cohen 1994, Lock 1993a). The life- course (or life-span) perspective highlights how earlier biological, physiological, psychological, social, historical, and environmental experiences influence and anchor trajectories in old age. This approach posits people as individuals existing in groups or cohorts, which age (and seek health care) in extremely different environments. Exploration focuses on relationships between individuals and cohorts to social constructions (such as roles and norms), processes, and structures (Browne 1998, Climo 1992, Estes 2001). 57 Life-course analyses spotlight three interwoven influences: social location, sociohistorical period, and personal biography. Briefly, social location refers to the social hierarchy into which one is born, which is shaped by personal and social attributes (such as gender, race, and class), and is associated with a range of advantages and disadvantages. Sociohistorical period embraces the macrosocial context shaping people's experiences at a particular chronological age. Personal biography refers to the unique ways in which individuals adapt to social location and sociohistorical period (Browne 1998). Nancy Kreiger's work on an ecosocial perspective is relevant here. She argues for \"pathways of embodiment,\" which involve the interplay between the \"constraints and possibilities of our biology, as shaped by our species evolutionary history, our ecological context, and individual histories\" and \"societal arrangements of power and property and contingent patterns of production, consumption, and reproduction\" that shape individual and community biosocial trajectories (Kreiger 2001: 672). While the term \"embodiment\" has been used in many different ways in the social science literature, Krieger defines it as, \"the way we literally incorporate, biologically, the world in which we live, including our societal and ecological circumstances\" (Kreiger 2005: 351). \"Embodiment\" in Kreiger's sense of the term, is brought into sharper focus by viewing the impact of stressors at particular stages of life as well as cumulatively across a lifespan. Applying this perspective, Nichter, for instance, notes global health life-course data that suggest 58 that malnutrition and communicable diseases experienced early in life predispose populations to chronic illness later in life. This adds an important dimension to thinking about a third epidemiological transition generally characterized by emerging and re- emerging diseases related to accelerated globalization and antibiotic resistance (Nichter 2007). While the utility of a life-course approach is clear, this model has been evaluated as wanting in at least three ways (Estes 2001). In this dissertation, I attempt to avoid these shortcomings. To address the critique that a life-course model overemphasizes the individual level, I discuss sociohistorical period in a way that suggests how the state, the macro-economic structure, the sex/gender system, and the medical-industrial complex influence health and aging. To offset a second critique of the life-course approach - that it neglects intracohort variability - I endeavor to bring to the forefront the repercussions of variation in personal biography. Finally, my focus (described below) on axes of oppression based on ascribed, naturalized categories over which people have relatively little personal control (such as gender, race, and class) is my response to the critiqued tendency of life-course studies to affirm choice as an unproblematized determinant of the life-course. 59 3. Feminist life-course perspective In reflecting on aging over the life-course, assuming a life-course approach goes hand-in- hand with advocating a feminist perspective,7 the reason being that many impediments to elder well-being carry over from a lifetime of reduced opportunity and oppression based on gender and other inequalities. While feminist theory emphasizes production and reproduction that wanes in the elderly years, and may lose sight of the circumstances of the elderly, feminist analysis can fruitfully address the experience of aging. However, a number of \"women's issues\" run across the life-course, including work, health, poverty, domination, and exploitation (Browne 1998). Additionally, by embracing feminism in the sense of a general commitment to counter all forms of oppression (as in MacKinnon 1989 and hooks 1981), a feminist life-course perspective highlights how inequalities follow individuals throughout life, and how the experience of aging intersects with and is shaped by gender, race, class, and other oppressions, as well as by sociohistorical time (Browne 1998, Katz Olson 2001). Uniting the life-course perspective with feminism is an especially powerful approach given the tendency for various types of social difference to be experienced together in a \"matrix of domination,\" such as the exacerbation of ageism by sexism and racism (Collins 1991: 225, Katz Olson 2001, Mullings 1997). While aging provides a foundation for solidarity because of the sheer numbers of individuals who experience it, a feminist perspective illuminates the continuum of 7 This analysis also coincides with a political economy of aging perspective, described by Estes (1991) as, \"...attendant to the sociostructural conditions and dynamics of aging and aging policy. It is essentially concerned with class, gender, and racial/ethnic divisions in society as they explain resource distributions in old age as a function of the relations of capital and the state.... A proper political economy will, by definition be sensitive to the integral connections between macrostructural conditions and the private and intimate experience of old age\" (Estes 1991: 31). 60 privilege within broad categories of subordinated groups (e.g. elderly, women, people of color). Thus, while I explicitly identify examples of gender-differentiated life-course influences, I include notes on the effects of other axes of social marginalization. The feminist life-course perspective entails a holistic, rather than an age-segmented, approach to lives. Three topics of interest are pathways, turning points, and accumulation of dis/advantage. To study pathways, life trajectories of men and women can be mapped out to determine which patterns are most physically and psychologically adaptive. Turning points refer to changing trajectories of advantage or disadvantage. The snowballing effects of socioeconomic status, social support networks, and even health itself can favor (ill)health in later years, and this cumulative dis/advantage is often gendered (Moen 1996). I emphasize how the cumulative effects of gendered experiences throughout the life course mean that women and men confront old age, illness, and care- seeking with different stocks of resources, including social capital (discussed below). 61 B. Methodological orientations 1. Community-based participatory research Initially, I sought to understand the ways that generation, gender, and health intersect among elders in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, via a community-based participatory research (CBPR) orientation. By community-based participatory research, I refer to, \"the process of producing new knowledge by systematic inquiry, with the collaboration of those affected by the issue being studied, for the purposes of education and taking action or effecting social change\" (Macaulay 1999: 775. See also Cornwall & Jewkes 1995, Leung 2004, McAllister et al. 2003). Participatory research has its roots in social justice movements in international development settings in the 1980s, and has since become common in community development, health development, and health promotion. I was attracted to CBPR as a means of avoiding two common propensities in health research: 1) drawing on individual rather than community-level data8, and 2) considering informants as passive subjects. CBPR offers a means of focusing on group-level data, and of embracing local knowledge, expertise, and resources in approving, planning, implementing, assessing research and interventions, and disseminating results (Vastine et al. 2005, Dickert & Sugarman 2005, Macaulay et al. 1999, Cornwall & Jewkes 1995, McAllister et al. 2003). 8 For instance, clinicians focus on individual patients, while epidemiologists examine aggregate individual- level data to understand populations (Macaulay 1999). 62 Cornwall & Jewkes (1995) argue for the need to distinguish participatory research9 from other research, as all health research requires participants, and all researchers are participants, which would make it seem that all health research is participatory. To clarify, they posit not the methods, but the location of power in the research process as the key difference between participatory and conventional approaches. In asking who defines, conducts, analyzes, represents, owns, and acts on research, attention is focused on the central issues of power and control (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Table 2.1 displays the extremes of the continuum between participatory and conventional research, most work falling in the middle ground between the two. Conventional methods and research should not be discarded but rather valued as complementary (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). CBPR does not refer to a novel method, but a distinct research approach or orientation: CBPR entails research, education, and action with and for - versus on - the community. It is co-operative in that local people and researchers are to take equal ownership of, and contribute equally to, the research process. It is participatory in that local people collectively analyze their lives and identify which issues should be researched, how to research them, and toward what ends. Selecting topics that the group wants to address validates members' experiential knowledge and cultural context, and may mean that 9 Participatory research is an umbrella term for a wide range of applications and labels, including: Rapid Epidemiological Assessment, Rapid Ethnographic Assessment, Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA), Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP), Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), Participatory Action Research (PAR), Participatory Research (PR), Development Leadership Teams in Action (DELTA), Popular Epidemiology, and Critical Epidemiology. These entail varying degrees (from project to project, stage to stage within a project, person to person) of participation and sharing of power, including agency, representation, leadership, and decision-making. Its catch-all nature makes the definition of participatory research a source of contention. (Macaulay 1999, Cornwall & Jewkes 1995, Chambers 1994, Brown 1997). 63 researchers have to forgo personal interests and pre-determined methods. Through discussion, participants develop a critical awareness of the relationship between their own social context (from individual to community to broader sociopolitical system) and its impact on community-level problems (such as ill health and disease). (Leung 2004, Macaulay 1999, Cornwall & Jewkes 1995) Leung observes that CBPR is not about \"surrendering but \"sharing power\" (Leung 2004: 499).10 Further, in CBPR, local people and researchers may share responsibility. First, in assuming active roles in conducting research, community members may take on some responsibility for the success of the research itself. Second, when researchers acknowledge community members' stake in and contributions to the project, community involvement confers on the community some moral responsibility for the research. (Dickert & Sugarman 2005, Macaulay 1999) 10 Cornwall & Jewkes (1995) distinguish four modes of participation varying from \"shallow\" to \"deep\" participation: contractual, consultative, collaborative, and collegiate (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995. See also Chambers 1994). 1. Contractual participation, in which outside experts identify and define everything from the problems to the solutions, contracting community members into projects outside their ultimate control. 2. Consultative participation, in which community members are asked for their opinions and consulted by researchers prior to interventions. 3. Collaborative participation, in which researchers and community members work together on projects designed, initiated, and managed by researchers. 4. Collegiate participation, in which researchers and locals work together as colleagues with varied skills in a process of co-learning where local people control the process. The project promoter is a \"catalyst and strategist.\" Theoretically, participatory research is situated at the collegiate level of participation. In reality, this is rare; most of what is labeled 'participatory' is contractual, in which community members are involved in data collection, but have no power over setting agendas and ownership of results (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). 64 Table 2.1, Participatory versus conventional research. Participatory research Conventional research What is the research for? Action Understanding w/perhaps action later Who is the research for?

Process Outcomes Adapted from Cornwall & Jewkes 1995: 1669. See also Chambers 1994. Various advantages of participatory methods and community involvement have been noted. Mutual community-researcher respect, community participation, researcher- community collaboration, and incorporation of local cultural context have proven to be effective means for implementing successful interventions benefiting the communities involved. For researchers, community-level focus and participation can distinguish key research questions, as well as individuals and subgroups with specific needs or vulnerabilities. Community involvement can fortify trust between researchers and informants. It can also confer legitimacy on a project, by engaging local people in expressing their concerns and perspectives. Community buy-in and participation may 65 increase the quantity and quality of data, as new research questions are evoked, and participants are motivated to ensure that data gathered are locally meaningful. By generating usable findings, CBPR helps ensure that positive action (not just measurement) is part of the research, such that research and social action are balanced. For their part, participants, the locality in which the research is conducted, and/or the wider population may gain: a) protection via the identification of hazards and risks as well as potential protections; b) enhanced health; c) ethical/political legitimacy via the opportunity to express their views and concerns in time for these to be incorporated in the project; d) increased local knowledge, capacity, and empowerment via sharing responsibility with researchers. A goal is that participants come to \"own\" the research process and increase their ability to identify and address their problems to improve their lives. (Dickert & Sugarman 2005, Macaulay 1999, Leung 2004, Vastine et al. 2005). CBPR entails co-learning process and capacity building, as all involved learn new skills and hone existing capabilities, e.g. to work in a team or partnership; identify problems, reach a common understanding, develop and implement solutions; and document the process (Marincowitz 2003, Macaulay 1999). Results of CBPR can be locally applicable as well as relevant elsewhere, as issues with particular local manifestations may transcend project and community boundaries (McAllister et al. 2003). 66 2. Problematizing community-based participatory research By community, CBPR proponents mean, \"a group of people who share a common interest, for example, cultural, social, political, health, economic interests - but not necessarily a particular geographic association\" (Macaulay 1999: 775. See also Marincowitz 2003). By participation, they refer to, \"collaboration of those affected by the issue being studied\" (Macaulay 1999: 775). Initially, I used the CBPR approach to orient my fieldwork. Among my first steps was to delineate \"the community.\" I soon ran into problems. Who comprises \"the community\"? Who are \"those affected\"? Individuals had overlapping and even competing allegiances to different groups, and the politics of inclusion and exclusion is ever-present. At the same time, I realized that, although CBPR proponents and health promoters alike champion participation and collaborative personal relationships, these are always saturated by power relations and therefore can be harmful. My fieldwork forced me to take a critical stance. I could not assume one reified community, nor could I take for granted the nature of participation. Instead, I would have to continuously delineate \"community\" and \"participation\" as part of the research. To do so, I adopted a formative research approach and applied the lens of social capital. These two tools - formative research and social capital - allowed me to navigate the power-laden side of \"community\" and \"participation\" inherent in both elder health care and health research. 67 3. Formative research Moving beyond CBPR, the formative research model is open to a critical questioning of \"community.\" Formative research posits inequitable relations and tentative collaboration among myriad stakeholders rather than equitable participation among a reified community (as in CBPR). The formative approach entails probing \"community\" and embedded structures of power. Additionally, while the literature offers little guidance in how best to operationalize and implement CBPR (Vastine et al. 2005, Dickert & Sugarman 2005, McAllister et al. 2003, Chambers 1994), Nichter's notion of formative research (Nichter 1990, Nichter et al. 2002, Nichter et al. 2004) elucidates this process research, so that it can be applied, evaluated, further developed, and applied again. Nichter posits formative research11 as a multi-stage participatory process that is iterative 11 My review of Ovid/Medline articles published from 1996 to the present (most post-2000) containing the term \"formative research\" in the title and/or abstract indicates the term's myriad meanings, usually referencing research goals, methods, and/or communities from which data is drawn. Most of these \"formative research\" projects do not: \u0001 Prioritize local participation in developing the research proposal, goals, methods, collection, or evaluation, or in conducting and monitoring intervention. \u0001 Feature multiple methods, but rather use one data collection technique, at times quantitative. \u0001 Sustain participation over time, but rather refer to participation in one task: developing an intervention strategy. Once developed, the strategy is not subject to ongoing documentation, evaluation, or monitoring of community response. Using formative research to inform a research (vs. intervention) proposal is rare. \u0001 Assume an iterative dynamic via ongoing exchange between researchers and target communities such that the interwoven expertise of all participants is continually used to adjust, refine, and monitor research/intervention. \u0001 Engage in assessing the interface between local health culture and public health/medical practice (Nichter et al. 2004). Most research considers just one side of this divide, for example, only physicians or only patients. \u0001 Address power relationships among stakeholders (researchers, informants, community members, media, et al.). \u0001 Call for ongoing participation of a community-elected social scientist. 68 and draws upon multiple methods and actors to identify and define a problem, then develop, monitor, and assess locally-congruent public health interventions12. In his words, Formative research refers to a process that begins with a grounded and contextual examination of what a study population thinks, does, and says about some domain of experience.... The purpose of this examination is to inform critical thinking about studies and interventions developed to address one or more areas of focal interest.... This research process continues beyond the collection of background data to instrument development, where it plays an important role in generating and weighing options..., identifying the best methods of delivery, and monitoring participants' responses over time, enabling mid-course correction. (Nichter et al. 2002: S41-42) This heuristic is based on some fundamental tenets. First, the process should be a partnership with study populations, rather than a top-down dynamic. This entails being aware of and confronting hierarchies of power and authority that traditionally frame researcher-subject relationships. All people, institutions, and groups involved in the formative research process are recognized as both experts and interested stakeholders. Second, the project should develop into a \"cyclical formative-reformative process\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1914). Ideally, as rapport among those involved increases, growing insight and empathy facilitate more comprehensive and honest feedback, such that interventions may be evaluated and improved in real time. This dynamic shapes the overarching vision of the project as well as minute, day-to-day activities. All participants need to be self-aware, -critical, and -reflective in order to promote mutual collaboration, reciprocal respect, and co-learning. Third, because the aim is to help meet local needs in a way that makes cultural sense, certain kinds of data are indispensable, such as context and contrasts between discourse and actions. Accurately and respectfully representing 12 Research is also conceptualized as an intervention, in and of itself. 69 stakeholders' perspectives and behaviors requires privileging emic perspectives. Formative research, then, must be well-grounded by qualitative methods. However, this does not preclude using quantitative tools in tandem with qualitative approaches. In fact, a combination of methods is often the most effective means of eliciting the breadth and depth of information required for successful intervention. A fourth quality of this formative research approach is ongoing participation of one or more social scientist/s who can monitor and guide actors such that the project adheres to these tenets. In CBPR, outsiders are supposed to become redundant as the process takes off and locals take over. Yet, without an outsider, it is difficult to recognize and negotiate the power relations implicit in the dynamics of \"community\" and \"participation.\" In formative research, the social scientist never becomes superfluous, as this is the person who is acutely aware of varying interpretations, agendas, and means for enacting some actions while blocking others. This is the person who is aware of expressions of \"community\" needs or priorities, often expressed by individuals on behalf of groups with the phrases, \"We think...\" or \"we want.\"13 In keeping with the partnership perspective of formative research, it is preferable that these supporting individuals be invited by local people, rather than externally-imposed or self-selected. Listening, promoting dialogue, negotiating consensus, and problem-solving from a holistic approach are key skills for the participating social scientist. Respect, trust, humility, adaptability, critical self- awareness are crucial characteristics. The social scientist's participation does not negate but rather reaffirms the analytical abilities of the local participants. 13 See also Cornwall & Jewkes 1995. 70 To aid in operationalizing this complex definition, Nichter lays out eight \"distinct but interactive\" stages comprising the formative research process. Because of the formative- reformative dynamic, stages often overlap, such that numbering them should not be interpreted as a strict chronological framework, but perhaps more of a checklist to guide and evaluate everything from the long-term overall concept to the quotidian minutia. (I add an initial stage.) Stage 0.5: Contextual factors converge, stimulating consciousness and awareness of the tip of an issue iceberg. Unfolding events and emerging information move some key individual(s) to take a closer look at what lies below the surface. In doing so, they become a catalyst, initiating Formative Research Stage 1. Stage 1: Become informed about what people do, say, and think about an issue with the goal of informing the problem solving process. This contextual analysis must attend to the various nested levels of the social ecology of elder health and care, from macro environments to local perceptions and practices. Members of the lay and target populations (such as ill individuals, care providers, policy makers, researchers, and other local people) with a stake in the research are identified and may then provide insightful discourse. Knowledge gained at Stage 1 may shape later research design, by way of identifying collaborators and assessing research instruments for their appropriateness (Nichter et al. 2004). The iterative character of formative research is apparent from the 71 outset of Stage 1, in which research may inform both research and intervention, qualitative research may inform quantitative research and vice versa. Stage 2: Identify and define problems to be addressed and related obstacles, from the perspectives of stakeholders in personal, household, community, and institutional contexts (Nichter et al. 2004). Stage 3: Generate a list of intervention options at multiple levels (personal, household, clinical, community) via discussion with local stakeholders invited to reflect on problems, practicalities, and background data collected during previous formative research stages as well as on intervention experiences in other settings (Nichter et al. 2004). Stage 4: Foster problem solving and critical assessment of a variety of possible intervention strategies among an inclusive group of stakeholders. Nichter contents that such discussion should address questions of feasibility (financial, temporal, organizational) as well as how the various stakeholders will react to each option, based on their varying needs, motivations, and positions of power. (Nichter et al. 2004). Stage 5: Investigate and determine how best to implement promising interventions identified in the previous stages. Specifically, Attention is directed toward identifying the best modality for conveying information, encouraging reflection, fostering problem solving, or changing 72 behavior. This includes consideration of what captures the interest of those for whom the intervention is being developed. This stage includes exploring supportive collaborations. What programs and which people work well together and which ones are likely to impede each others' effectiveness due to history, relations of power and identity, and issues of social stigma?\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1917) Stage 6: Introduce a process that monitors - in real time - ongoing responses to interventions in providers and beneficiaries and elicits corrective feedback enabling midcourse correction. Nichter specifies that, \"As part of this process, sources of resistance are documented and specific populations, including those not served by the intervention and people using the intervention for purposes other than those intended, are identified\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1917). Stage 7: Developing and conducting evaluative techniques that examine elder health and care intervention process and outcome from multiple perspectives taking into account multiple stakeholders. Relevant issues are, \"What are the intervention goals, and how do we know if they are being reached? It includes consideration of process as well as outcome evaluation, differences across intervention sites, and the impact of local and global secular trends...\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1917). Stage 8: Being aware of how knowledge about aging and health is produced and distributed. Effort is made, \"To initiate a process of critical assessment that considers how an intervention and its results are being presented to the public, scientific community, and policy makers; and investigates public understanding and the politics of representation\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1915). 73 The formative research stages help to operationalize participatory partnerships in order to obtain crucial information on context, discourse, and actions that lends itself to meeting local needs in ways that make cultural sense. The iterative spiral of informing/becoming informed, planning, acting, evaluating, reflecting, developing theory is its trademark. Participants constantly revisit the problem and, equipped with newly-acquired insight, reframe it and adjust responses. In this way, formative research allows for growing insight about people's needs and resources to continually enrich the cycle of research and intervention. Importantly, formative research spotlights often ignored hierarchies of power and authority influencing health and care as everyone involved is valued as an expert, and as stakeholders' roles, responsibilities, and relationships shift over the course of the project (Nichter et al. 2004). 74 C. Social capital 1. Conceptualizations of social capital The social capital perspective provided me with a means of interrogating the notions of \"community\" and \"participation\" in elder health and care as well as in research. While definitions and models of social capital abound14, I borrow from Wakefield & Poland (2005) to delineate three perspectives: communitarian, institutional, and critical. The communitarian approach to social capital, as exemplified by Putnam (1993, 1995), Kawachi (1997), and Fukuyama (2001), defines social capital as, \"features of social organization, such as trust, norms, and networks, that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated actions\" (Putnam 1993: 167). Its basic premise is that social capital (in the form of civic participation and trust) is a resource that facilitates community problem-solving and benefits entire communities. It is, therefore, the model most often embraced in the realm of public health (Moore et al. 2006). The communitarian approach has been critiqued as positing the social capital-health outcomes association as self-explanatory rather than requiring further interrogation. Critics also contend that this approach ignores the effects of intra-community variation in social capital and extra-community social connections on population health. A staunch critic of the concept, Ben Fine (2003), points out, 14 Indeed its multiple meanings have moved some, like Ben Fine (2003), to discard the concept's value altogether. 75 The result is to homogenize, like trust, across different societies and instances as if each of the multi-dimensional aspects of social capital (from friends and family to confidence in government and moral values) always had the same meaning and significance, even leaving aside the omission of other critical elements such as power, class and conflict. (Fine 2003: 598) Further, critics of the communitarian approach assert that it marginalizes network approaches to understanding access to resources, which reinforces a false dichotomy between psychosocial and material determinants of health, thus de-emphasizing the need to explore resource access and how this access is socially structured (Moore et al. 2006). In general, the communitarian conceptualization ignores negative impacts of social capital and power structures (Wakefield & Poland 2005). The institutional conceptualization of social capital, championed by Coleman (1990), Evans (1996), and Woolcock (2002) defines social capital as, ...a variety of entities having two characteristics in common: They all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are in the structure.... Unlike other forms of capital, social capital inheres in the structure of relations between persons and among persons. (Coleman 1990: 302) From this perspective, supportive institutions and social structures are vital to social capital, and state-civil society \"synergy\" is central to community development. According to Evans, \"social capital is formed by making some who are part of the state apparatus more thoroughly part of the communities in which they work\" (Evans 1996: 1121 in Wakefield & Poland 2005: 2821). This conceptualization has attracted the attention of major international organizations, like the World Bank and the Organization 76 for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The World Bank, for instance, lauds social capital as the \"glue\" that holds society together (Iisakka 2006). Critics, however, argue that the institutional approach pays insufficient attention to the negative impacts of synergy between states and communities. Some criticize the neoliberal use of this perspective for justifying state interference in local affairs without acknowledging and reversing economic inequities. They argue that this model paints society as multiple communities interacting in a horizontal fashion, while in reality, interaction is extremely hierarchical. Further, Fine argues that these theorists presume that, \"social capital is social, whereas other capital (physical, natural, human, environmental, financial or whatever) is not\" (Fine B. 2003: 597). Additionally, critics argue that the institutional model gives the illusion of positivity and calculability (and thus governability) of complex ethical and political concepts such as trust and civility (Fine 2003, Walters 2002 in Fine 2003). In the face of the institutional conceptualization of social capital, Fine asserts, \"However, and however much, social capital incorporates social relations and processes, it is thereby embedded... in matters of exclusion and inclusion, power, conflict, exploitation, oppression, hierarchy and conflict...\" (Fine 2003: 595). The critical conceptualization of social capital, put forth by Bourdieu (1979, 1986) and Portes (1998), and supported by Fine (2003), focuses on resources - capital - attached to power. It features social networks and ties (bonding, bridging, linking) between 77 individuals, groups, and communities. The critical approach highlights relational aspects of solidarity and illuminates the impact of social structure, power, and socially structured inequitable access to resources. Bourdieu defines social capital as, ...the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition - or in other words, to membership in a group - which provides each of its members with the backing of the collectively-owned capital, a 'credential' which entitles them to credit, in the various senses of the word. (Bourdieu 1986: 248-249) For Bourdieu, social, cultural, and economic capital form a tripartite system of capital, which structures the social world, filling it with inequity and conflict. Power, in this system, consists of the ability to transform capital from one form to another, i.e. \"fungibility\" (Bourdieu 1986). Bourdieu looks at structural social capital, and emphasizes how context and social structure mediate the possibilities for social capital returns from participation (Bourdieu 1986). From this perspective, poor health is not a lack of belongingness (as the communitarian proponents would contend), but rather the inability to access resources (Wakefield & Poland 2005). The critical perspective privileges how differently impeded and empowered individuals invest in and capture resources embedded in relationships to gain individual return, benefit, or profit. Individual actors, then, can reproduce inequities. Bourdieu also notes that this process also benefits the collective, because when individual members of the dominant class reinforce their personal capital holdings, they simultaneously maintain and reproduce the ruling class and other structures of domination (Bourdieu 1986). Analysis of social relationships and networks and how people access resources by 78 mobilizing these relationships illuminates the influence of upstream, macro-level frameworks of gender, race, class, and age in a broader political economy (Moore et al. 2006). In other words, \"social capital cannot be conceived in isolation from economic and political structures, since social connections are contingent on, and structured by, access to material resources\" (Wakefield & Poland 2005: 2819). From this perspective, it becomes clear that individuals and groups leverage social capital to achieve goals that do not necessarily benefit society. Negative social capital15 refers to situations in which strong networks produce positive short-term impacts on members, but long-term negative impacts on non-members and the community at large. Bourdieu (1986) asserts that social capital exchange relationships - whether between individuals, between groups, or between an individual and a group - are hierarchical. If clearly delineated membership in the group - i.e. social exclusivity - is necessary for social capital development, this exclusivity separates from others and impacts well-being (Wakefield & Poland 2005). Regarding inter-group hierarchy, strong internal bonds may create a gulf between members and outsiders, group affiliation can produce a radius of distrust when strong bonds within a group decrease trust and acceptance of outsiders, and can prevent the group from receiving beneficial influences from outside. Within groups, too, social capital transactions may take place through hierarchical relations, and can deliver resources and opportunities through exploitation, not just reciprocity. Coercive 15 For additional discussion of negative social capital, see: Berkman & Glass 2000, Frankenberger & Garrett 1998, Fukuyama 2001, Harriss 2002, Helliwell 2001, Kaufman 2002, Kawachi & Berkman 2000, Kunitz 2001, Pearce & Davey Smith 2003, Portes 1998, Portes & Landholt 1996, Snyder 2002, Streeten 2002, Woolcock 2002. 79 aspects of social capital are inherent in networks of obligations, forced conformity, obligatory voluntarism, inhibition of individual expression, constrained social mobility and downward leveling pressures. This said, the development of a group identity (even if exclusive) and the links established via community participation may be central to the ability of the disadvantaged and excluded groups to develop awareness of and active resistance to dominant groups and their exclusionary dynamics. But this social capital also threatens and polices vulnerable segments of marginalized communities, in that it silences dissent and concentrates group identity in the hands of a few spokespeople. In this way, \"certain actions may be constrained rather than supported by social 'ties'\" (Wakefield & Poland 2005: 2824). When, as a result, groups become segregated, this reinforces their relative positions within social hierarchies. Ironically, a potential weakness of the critical approach is that it often fails to consider the positive impacts of social capital, and plays down the potential for constructive social change (Wakefield & Poland 2005). Additionally, Fine critiques Bourdieu for having a very broad, flexible notion of social and other types of capital across time and place. However, Bourdieu does insist on specificity and context in practice (Fine 2003). 80 2. Proposed links between social capital and health/health promotion Analyzed from the communitarian and institutional perspectives, various associations between social capital and health have been suggested. These associations share an implicit faith in the notion that the more social capital, the better, such that increasing social capital improves health and facilitates health promotion (Iisakka 2006). For instance, researchers have suggested that social capital is associated with better perceived health (Kawachi et al. 1999), that involvement in cultural activities seems to be positively associated with longevity; and that low social participation and scarce social support are related to higher mortality (Iisakka 2006). Social capital has also been associated with health promotion. For example, it is believed that caring relations and community connections can facilitate health care. Social capital is also said to help maintain social cohesion in the face of rapid change, as the latter is often disruptive to health promotion. Further, social capital is believed to promote community self-help, helping communities work better together to address their collective health challenges (Wakefield & Poland 2005). Proponents of the communitarian and institutional perspectives see community involvement as a means of producing networks and behavioral norms that promote collective action for community benefit. From this perspective, public participation in community health initiatives is viewed as a way of promoting local ownership of projects and facilitating community empowerment (Wakefield & Poland 2005, McAllister et al. 2003). In other words, participatory community-based strategies are believed to bolster social capital, and, as a corollary, improve health and care. 81 In contrast to the facile embrace of social capital-boosting efforts among communitarian and institutional model proponents, those adopting a critical perspective highlight how social capital and efforts to increase social capital - especially via participatory strategies - may not necessarily improve health and facilitate health promotion. In fact, from a critical perspective, social capital is more of a lens through which to inform and critique than a direct remedy for problems. To use social capital as a framework for analysis, researchers commonly distinguish horizontal social capital, or egalitarian reciprocity between people from similar backgrounds, and vertical or hierarchical social capital, or solidarity between different groups from top to bottom (Whitehead 2001). An overlapping but slightly finer categorization distinguishes social capital as bonding, bridging, or linking. Bonding social capital is a characteristic of existing relations, or ties within one's group or between individuals of similar demographic characteristics. These are usually closely-knit groups of people who know each other and are very similar to one another. Bridging social capital facilitates new relationships with people outside of one's social circle. Linking social capital consists of connections that span differences in power, such as between people and local organizations (Green & Haines 2002, McLean et.al. 2002, Warren et.al. 2001). I draw on this categorization to illuminate inequities between and among women and men, elders and young adults, researchers and researched 82 3. Social capital illuminates risks of community participation Community involvement and public participation are often seen by communitarian and institutional social capital proponents as ways to produce networks, encourage behavioral norms, promote collective action for community benefit, increase local ownership of projects, and facilitate community empowerment (Wakefield & Poland 2005). In contrast, the critical social capital model encourages a critical look at CBPR. Critics question the representativeness of those who participate in \"community\" projects, and highlight the extensive skills and vocabularies needed to participate appropriately. As Bourdieu maintains, social capital is rooted in economic capital, so it accrues to those with existing economic and cultural capital (e.g. embodied culture, such as speech, body language, dress). This makes it hard to move between social groups, and requires investment (such as education), so that only those dominant individuals with surplus capital can do so. As Cornwall & Jewkes point out, \"often those who researchers want to work with are too busy securing the basic necessities of life\" (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995: 1673). Bridging capital often results from a dominated individual who develops a familiarity with dominant discourses and then engages with dominant individuals. This concentrates power in a few spokespeople, who may not be representative of the needs and wishes of marginalized groups (Wakefield & Poland 2005, Macaulay 1999, Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Ethical community participation must start with community consultation and consent, which requires representatives properly empowered to make such decisions. Additionally, community participation and consultation should not be 83 mistaken for community consent, and community consent does not eliminate the need for individual consent. The community has to decide whether or not to allow researchers to solicit participation from individual community embers. (Dickert & Sugarman 2005) Even participating in research exposes local people and groups to the risk of stigmatization and discrimination, as well as threats to their identity and social structure (Dickert & Sugarman 2005, Macaulay 1999, Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Some bonding relationships can have potentially harmful repercussions, such as the association with people who have stigmatized illnesses (e.g. tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS). Further, when empowered groups use their new capital to challenge established power structures; in hostile environments, the result may be harsh repression (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Access to social resources is inequitable, and groups can reinforce social distinctions and perpetuate social inequities rather than bridge them. For example, the spatial segregation of classes increases social distance between the classes. Further, horizontal ties, rather than linking excluded groups to the mainstream, may instead only tie the excluded to the excluded. The mechanisms of exclusion decrease the degree of shared understanding and norms between groups, limiting linkages (including bridging relationships). Thus domination dynamics between groups interact with domination dynamics within groups. (Wakefield & Poland 2005) 84 Advocates of the critical social capital perspective also fear the potential for participation to be used as a replacement for State investment, thus justifying State retrenchment (Wakefield & Poland 2005), which would then further marginalize groups. Community participation may mean exploitation of the poor by extraction of free labor, or the notion that social capital is the only input necessary for their well-being (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). While proponents of CBPR argue that participation empowers participants, from a critical social capital perspective, other types of capital must accompany the social capital in order to effect social transformation. Additionally, some CBPR advocates argue that, \"Insiders and outsiders work together as equals to solve problems\" (Marincowitz 2003: 596) and \"community and researcher [collaborate] in the research as equals\" (Macaulay 1999: 774). From a critical social capital perspective, however, there are bound to be power differentials between researchers and community members, making the process less one of facile accords and more one of negotiation and leveraging of capital between and among researchers and stakeholders. Researchers may not have the time to continue nurturing relationships with community members and groups, and may be swayed by professional and other commitments in what participants might perceive as abandoning them (Macaulay 1999). Negotiation of research goals, methods, terms of partnership, evaluation, disagreements, credit, responsibility, roles, etc. is a constant power-laden challenge, resting on researcher, participant, and community capital. Establishing and fortifying vertical links between community members and researchers, project administrators, and policy makers can be used to obtain funding, to co-opt community members into outside agendas, and to justify short-cut, top-down 85 research (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Further, the popularity and credibility of approaches aiming to create social capital and promote participation have grown precisely due to the fact that large, powerful, rich government and non-government institutions (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere [CARE] International) have espoused these methods (McAllister et al. 2003). As a result, relying in an uncritical way on \"community\" \"participation\" to effect changes in well-being can be risky (Wakefield & Poland 2005). Difficult questions must be addressed. What counts as a community? Who counts as a representative? What level of local involvement is needed? When can researchers override or dismiss group/individual concerns? What methods will successfully evoke public input and interaction? How will local input be incorporated into research and intervention? Further, sharing responsibility with local groups does not shift blame or remove responsibility from researchers and others behind the research, but rather places increased responsibility on researchers to be sensitive to and address complex and conflicting local concerns (Dickert & Sugarman 2005: 1126). 86 4. Facilitating transformative social engagement Recently, researchers have proposed means of addressing some of the questions and hazards discussed above. These useful recommendations are less about advocating a specific technique and more about assuming an attitude or orientation toward research, an orientation ultimately guided by respect and understanding for all participants (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Dickert & Sugarman (2005) propose that the following ethical goals orient community participation in research: \u0001 enhanced protection for individuals and communities via identifying hazards and risks as well as potential protections; \u0001 enhanced health for participants, the population, or the community in which the research is conducted; \u0001 conferral of ethical/political legitimacy via providing stakeholders an opportunity to express their views and concerns in time for these to be incorporated in the project; and \u0001 shared responsibility with the community for the moral aspects of the project, as well as for conducting the project. (Dickert & Sugarman 2005) Paulo Freire's work (e.g. Freire 1968 cited in Chambers 1994) in activist education is helpful in guiding participatory research, as the Freirean approach is directly concerned with power relations between researcher and participants. Those embracing Freire's perspective recognize and confront inequities in access to resources, including those based on class, race/ethnicity, age, and gender. By asserting that people's own knowledge and insight is valuable, such participatory approaches regard people as agents rather than objects and assert that they are capable of analyzing and addressing their own problems. The emphasis is on shifting the researcher's role from director to facilitator and catalyst by recognizing the power relations within the research context. Through co- learning and analysis throughout the research process, people assume ownership of their 87 own knowledge and are empowered to take action. The social ties between researcher and community members, then, shift from a highly vertical to more horizontal. Cornwall & Jewkes contend that, \"Unless a definite political commitment to working with the powerless is part of the process, those who are relatively inaccessible, unorganized and fragmented can easily be left out\" (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995: 1670-1673) Wakefield & Poland (2005) propose that, rather than focusing blindly on creating social capital via community participation, researchers should be sensitive to the risks posed by participation and consciously concerned with social justice and transformative social engagement. They champion engagement, empowerment, and collective action, aimed at reducing economic and other disparities in distribution of resources between groups and within groups. Efforts, they argue, must promote various types of capital, such as employment, social support, education, and health resources (medication, care), rather than just social capital, and must center on the redistribution of resources. Wakefield & Poland are aware that institutions and individuals are embedded in powerful social structures, but they also note that some state and dominant individuals are willing to support subordinate groups even at the risk to themselves. Thus, state institutions can choose to continue to marginalize, or alternatively to infuse other forms of capital into vulnerable areas. The task at hand, then, is to understand why such individuals and institutions are willing to support subordinate groups and how to facilitate this. (Wakefield & Poland 2005) A small groups approach to participation may facilitate such transformative social engagement. 88 One challenge of relying on community participation to effect change is that participating communities are \"made\" rather than \"born\" (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). As GA Fine & Harrington (2004) assert, Collective action is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. Neither shared interests nor the presence of resources are sufficient conditions to produce civic engagement. Self-interest, opportunism, and the diffusion of responsibility each create obstacles to collective action. (Fine & Harrington 2004: 347-348) Like Bourdieu, Fine & Harrington contend that, \"Civic engagement is rarely a forum in which citizens forge social bonds but rather is a place in which existing social ties are leveraged for collective action\" (Fine & Harrington 2004: 347, my emphasis). Further, while we presume the existence of a \"community,\" in reality groups are very heterogeneous, with variability in age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, religion, etc., and therefore power. Additionally, individuals participate in multiple, overlapping networks linked around different interests. It is difficult, then, to delineate a \"community\" (Cornwall & Jewkes 1995). Fine & Harrington observe that society is fast becoming an intersecting web of allegiances to small groups. This participation is possible, they assert, because small groups place people in a position in which they \"... have more to gain, or less to lose, by cooperating with the group effort than they do by acting as free agents\" (Fine & Harrington 2004: 348). In interaction, participants in small groups define certain social problems as worthy of a collective response, and they then mobilize people and resources into action, achieving social transformation. They do this via two dynamics. First, by framing, small groups 89 situate local frames of reference within a larger context, and align them with broader ideologies and initiatives. In doing so, they translate regional and national trends into local terms, as is common in popular epidemiology. Second, small groups mobilize, meaning that they bridge or align with other groups in order to amplify and extend the group. Small groups link the micro and macro levels. Because they are not restricted by the infrastructure and legal parameters of larger, more formal organizations, small groups acknowledge diversity and accommodate change. Additionally, \"Small groups create a social cartography of others - recognized placements of others within a social space. Each member is situated within a network of power, influence, and action\" (Fine & Harrington 2004: 349). In this dissertation, I argue that neither the state nor the family has adequately addressed elder health and care needs, moving me to work with small groups to promote transformative social engagement. While CBPR has been celebrated as key to improving health and facilitating health promotion, I draw on critical conceptualizations of social capital models (especially Bourdieu, Fine, and Wakefield & Poland) to warn that blind efforts to promote community participation and fortify social capital are insufficient and sometimes even counterproductive in initiatives to improve health and health care. I argue instead that good health and care is based on attention to power relationships and access to resources. Thus, rather than aiming to create or increase social capital, the task at hand is to redistribute capital in a way that redresses inequities both among elders and between elders and other stakeholders. From this perspective, social capital plays an important 90 role as a barometer of inequity in access to resources, whether between men and women, elders and young adults, researchers and researched. A critical conceptualization of social capital illuminates the impact of social structure, power, and inequitable access to resources in the elder health context and in the research realm. I propose that a sensitivity to this inequity, a conscious focus on ethics in local participation, and clear aim to effect transformative social engagement are the most appropriate strategies to promote health research and health care. 91 Reflections on Chapter 2 The combination of the feminist life-span perspective, the formative research model, and the social capital orientation guide this dissertation. These are not new concepts; development and neoliberal reform have long-drawn attention to issues of equity, community based research, and social capital dynamics. Insight gained from years of refinement of these methods and theories through their application to other issues allowed me to apply them successfully to a nascent dilemma: elder health and care. Step-by-step, I describe how I moved through the stages of formative research to understand and address elder health and care in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico. I detail my trajectory through finding out what was already known, what else needed to be explored, who could impart this knowledge, how to gain this understanding, and then how to engage local people in applying this insight to improve elder well-being in Comit\u00e1n. This trajectory took the form of the following activities, which are listed in chronological order: \u0001 CISC engaged in conversation and institutional backing secured \u0001 Inter-institutional elder health forum \u0001 Elder health and care survey \u0001 Interviews with elders, home-based caregivers, formal care providers \u0001 Elder healthcare planning meeting \u0001 Independent elder health working group \u0001 Recent projects, e.g. elder primary health care proposal and participatory GIS mapping of survey results My goal was as much about gathering data and refining theories as about initiating and facilitating a process. Remaining chapters detail both process and product. 92 CHAPTER 3. THE CONTEXT OF ELDER HEALTH AND CARE IN MEXICO Overview of Chapter 3 Insight gained at home, at work, and at the university moved me to question whether the Mexican state and families would weave a safety net sufficient to satisfy health care needs faced by Do\u00f1a Cristina and other Chiapanecos through later life. A literature review reaffirmed my concern, as I read assessments paralleling the following: In the past, it was very difficult to even reach old age. This possibility was considered a privilege and evidenced the strength and vigor of those who did reach old age. Old age was considered a life stage rich in experience and knowledge, such that elders were respected. In Mexico, elder care, a basic element in family cohesion, was a fundamental aspect of the family dynamic, as were social support networks, which guaranteed a better quality of life for elders. In modern society - now individualist and competitive - youth and physical conditions are valued more, which indirectly weakens social support networks for elders who slowly lose their protagonist place in the family. Elders have become a family, social, economic burden, after having dedicated the most productive years of their lives to building the same society that now rejects them. The evolution of health care service institutions is a very concrete example of the social response to elders, as it illustrates how society has invested in the health of the economically active population - with health services designed to care for workers and their families - without anticipating the care needs that would result from demographic transition, a product of the increase in life expectancy, the decrease in infant, maternal, and general mortality, the improvement in nutrition, and the decrease in fertility. (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998: 14)16 In this contextual overview, pieced together from my literature review, I describe contemporary state and family support. I discern particularities that distinguish aging, elder17 health, and elder care in Mexico from dynamics elsewhere in the world, 16 All translations from Spanish sources - verbal and written - were done by Namino Glantz. 17 While I use a flexible definition of \"elder,\" The Mexican National Institute of Older Adults (Instituto Nacional de las Personas Adultas Mayores) defines older adults as those aged 60 and up. 93 highlighting the urgent and challenging nature of addressing elder well-being in this nation. In doing so, I challenge common assumptions about what Mexican elders' health problems are and the institutions they can count on to satisfy their care needs. At least four overlapping circumstances are key: \u0001 Atypical epidemiological and demographic transitions in Mexico require a custom- designed elder health care response based on knowledge of local conditions and distinctions between and among population sub-groups. \u0001 The Mexican government's health care strategy does not adequately recognize and address context-dependent, gendered elder health care needs. \u0001 Entitlement among Mexican elders to informal care and caring resources within the household may be less pervasive and less predictable than hoped for. \u0001 Propitious engagement of Mexican civil society has opened a window of opportunity through which to explore and promote elder health via civic and state participation and collaboration. 94 A. Atypical epidemiological and demographic transitions and health disparities The demographic transition model (decreasing fertility and mortality rates) and the epidemiological transition model (decreasing infectious and acute illness, with increasing chronic-degenerative illness) have been widely used to interpret changes in mortality and morbidity and design public health policy (c.f. CONAPO 2001). In Mexico, mortality rates, especially among children, have declined since around 1910, and fertility rates have ebbed since the 1970s, as well. Death from contagious diseases has decreased, while the incidence of chronic-degenerative conditions has risen (Salgado & Wong 2003, WHO 2003, PAHO/WHO 2002, Reyes Fausto 2001, PAHO 2002). These shifts are expressions of Mexico's demographic and epidemiological transitions, phenomena often expected to echo consecutively-framed stages in the transition histories of developed countries (c.f. WHO 1999, CONAPO 2001). Over time, however, Mexico's epidemiological and demographic trajectory has distinguished itself from the textbook model in ways that dictate custom-designed responses (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003). These distinctions, detailed below, include: \u0001 Unusually accelerated aging of the Mexican population \u0001 Mexico's accelerated chronic disease burden, and how it is accentuated by the... \u0001 Perseverance of infectious disease in Mexico \u0001 Polarization of ill health and care resources between and within regions and populations \u0001 Disparities in Mexico's gender transition, especially in Chiapas 95 1. Unusually accelerated aging of the Mexican population Compared to epidemiological and demographic transitions in post-transition18 countries, aging of Mexico's population is occurring extremely rapidly. The life expectancy at birth rose from 40 years in 1943 to 75 in 2000, and the fertility rate fell from 6 children per woman in 1976 to 2.4 in 2000 (Frenk et al. 2004b, PAHO 2002). This high-speed aging trend is slated to continue, such that by 2050, 1 in 4 Mexicans will be 65 years or older, as shown in Figure 3.1 (CONAPO 2001). Chiapas contributes to this aging trend, as the state's elder population - its volume ranking it 8th of 32 states - is growing much more rapidly than the national average (Reyes Fausto 2001). Figure 3.1, Population pyramid for Mexico, 2000 & projected pyramid for 2050. (Men versus women) Frenk et al. 2004b: 24. 18 \"Post-transition countries\" are those with a much below-replacement fertility and increased life expectancy. 96 Despite the reality of rapid population aging, the slower \"standard\" tempo of population aging based on demographic trajectories elsewhere muffled the change, so that the Mexican shift is now described in hindsight as a \"silent population revolution\" that crept up and surprised policymakers (CONAPO 2001). The assumption that transition rates and dynamics would mimic those seen elsewhere also fostered a false sense of security in policymakers, who still occasionally speak as if there were time left to prevent and prepare for the growth of elder care needs (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003: 543-544). For example, the Program (Programa Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n, PNP) is about the \"construction of the demographic future\" via prevention and planning during a \"window of opportunity\" (CONAPO 2001). In this plan, Rodolfo Tuir\u00e1n, as head of the National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n, CONAPO), contended that, \"More than three quarters of the projected increase in the number of older adults between 2000 and 2050... will occur after the year 2020, allowing Mexico the time it requires to prepare institutional responses oriented to confront these tendencies\" (CONAPO 2001: 120). The fact is, however, that Mexico's population is already nearing 100 million, of whom over 13 million are aged 50 and up (INEGI 2000a). The illusion of an opportunity to engineer and prepare for population aging has left a legacy in contemporary Mexican population and health care policy (detailed below): a continuing focus on slowing demographic growth via family planning (c.f. CONAPO 2001) and faith in prevention as the optimal response to the epidemiological transition. While both initiatives are necessary in current Mexican policy, by prioritizing prevention 97 and spotlighting health of younger Mexicans, curative and care needs of the currently aged are de-emphasized, while the ranks of elders swell (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003). In the meantime, the health care system is taxed by elders. By 1999, older adults, who made up about 13% of the population, occupied 30% of general hospital beds and made 20% of outpatient visits. It has long been apparent, then, that elders' needs exceed the available capacities and resources of the Mexican health care system (Wagner et al. 1999). 2. Mexico's growing chronic, non-infectious disease burden Non-infectious or non-communicable disease (NCDs) is taking an increasing toll on Mexican elders. In fact, chronic NCDs, such as diabetes, heart and lung diseases, and hypertension, are the top killers among Mexicans aged 65 and up (see Table 3.1). Cardiovascular, digestive, urinary conditions, and diabetes are also the top reasons for hospital stays among Mexicans aged 65 and older (SINAIS 2005), as shown in Table 3.2. Mortality and morbidity from NCDs have increased substantially in Mexico between 1922 and 1995. In that period, the percentage of all deaths attributed to non- communicable diseases increased from 11.8% to 55% (Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1a et al. 2001). This trend continues. In fact, for every 10 deaths due to communicable diseases, in 1985, there were 15 due to NCDs; in 2000, there were 34; by 2015, it is predicted to be 70. NCDs drain the system, as their chronic, debilitating nature lowers people's productivity and ability to make a living, while increasing consumption of social and health services. 98 Additionally, co-morbidity (i.e. suffering from two or more conditions simultaneously)19 and uncontrolled NCDs despite treatment are common (Escobar et al. 2000).

Infectious intestinal diseases 1,599 28.4 0.6 1/ Rate per 100,000 people Adapted from SINAIS/CONAPO 2005. The gravity of the NCD problem is likely underestimated, as pervasive problems like dementias, malnutrition, and disabilities may not show up in hospital records (Lara- Rodriguez et al. 1996), especially among elders without institutional support in rural settings (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). There could be under-reporting of problems due to ignorance of symptoms, lack of access to services, absence of a support network, use of alternative providers. 19 For instance, in a study of poor, rural elders aged 60+ in three Mexican states, each elder had an average of 3.4 illnesses (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005) 99 Elder Mexican's biogenetic characteristics as well as the sociocultural environment in which they live make it increasingly likely that NCDs will continue to grow. WHO advisor and India expert K. Srinath Reddy contends that industrialization, urbanization, and globalization in developing regions leads to increased risk for disability and death from NCDs. Adoption of Western lifestyles has brought more sedentary behavior, higher stress, less healthy food, and increased consumption of alcohol and tobacco. NCDs are also influenced by biogenetic factors such as infection, malnutrition, and congenital conditions. For example, poor nutrition during pregnancy can lead to low birth-weight babies who are more prone to diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. Reddy argues, \"Let's not lose life we've saved earlier from infection [to preventable disease]\" (Reddy 2003). 3. Perseverance of infectious disease in Mexico A basic tenet of the epidemiological transition model is a significant decrease of contagious (infectious) disease followed by an increase in chronic-degenerative conditions. Indeed, in post-transition countries, infectious disease rates declined before chronic disease rates rose, thus mitigating the public health challenge. In Mexico, however, infectious diseases, while less frequently fatal, continue to exist. Table 3.2 details reasons for hospital visits among Mexicans aged 65 and up, evidence the perseverance of infectious disease in this country. 100 Table 3.2, Principal causes of hospital visits among Mexicans aged 65+, 2005. Infectious diseases are shaded. Rank Cause of hospital inpatient admissions Hospital inpatient admissions 1 Cardiovascular illnesses 108 855 2 Digestive illnesses 93 142 3 Genital and urinary system illnesses 73 655 4 Diabetes mellitus 50 597 5 Respiratory illnesses 40 741 6 Malignant tumors 37 400 7 Fractures 32 469 8 Respiratory infections 22 250 9 Muscular-skeletal illnesses 18 666 10 Sensory organ illnesses 16 492 11 Infectious and parasitic illnesses 16 457 12 Endocrine, metabolic, hematological, and immunological illnesses (except diabetes) 10 934 13 Mental conditions and nervous system illnesses 10 856 14 Other tumors 10 771 15 Skin illnesses 8 499 16 Trauma 7 667 17 Nutritional deficiencies 5 575 18 Complications, complications from medical & surgical care, effects of trauma & poisoning 5 445 19 Wounds 1 421 20 Dislocations, tears, lacerations, in specific or multiple body sites 1 370 Adapted from SINAIS/CONAPO 2005. As Table 3.2 illustrates, infectious disease coexists with non-infectious disease. Worse still, infectious disease exacerbates non-infectious disease. So, rather than evolving from infectious to non-infectious diseases, in Mexico, epidemiological \"transition\" refers to the addition of chronic, non-infectious illness to a lingering infectious disease burden. Mexican elders are caught at this convergence, due to aging immune systems, weakening support systems, and the particular historical moment in which they are aging. To use an example from Chiapas, while tuberculosis has been virtually eradicated in \"post-transitional\" societies, Mexico had nearly 34,000 tuberculosis cases in 2002, with 101 an estimated incidence rate of 33 cases per 100,000 people (WHO 2004). A study in Chiapas estimated a rate up to 8 times greater (S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez et al. 2001). In the case of tuberculosis, a study in southern Mexico revealed that tuberculosis rates increased 6.8- fold in patients with diabetes (Ponce-De-Leon, et al. 2003). Tuberculosis is just one of many infectious diseases plaguing Mexico; in fact, in Chiapas, infectious diseases represent 8 of the 10 principal causes of illness (SEDESOL Chiapas 2003 via SiPaz). Infectious disease rates are likely to remain high in Mexico20 due to long-standing problems (e.g. tuberculosis and intestinal diseases), emerging conditions (e.g. HIV/AIDS), the return of diseases thought to be eradicated (e.g. malaria) in an era of bacterial resistance and unaffordable medication, and the unsanitary, infrastructure-poor living conditions of much of the Mexican population (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003; PAHO 2002). Additionally, repercussions of past infectious disease may extend into the future. Global health life-course data suggest that infectious diseases (as well as malnutrition) experienced early in life predispose populations to chronic illness later in life (Nichter 2007). Compared to their Euro-American counterparts, Mexico's current elders were exposed to more childhood infectious diseases, and thus may face more chronic disease with accompanying functional limitation and disability (Salgado & Wong 2003, Palloni, Soldo, Wong 2002). So, Mexico has not - and may not soon - shed its infectious disease shackles. Mart\u00ednez & Leal dub this phenomenon \"pre-transitional illness in post- 20 Some have long-predicted that inroads against infectious disease will be reversed, due to economic crisis at a time when the country has \"adjusted its traditional lifestyle to incorporate technological improvements [such as water, electricity, sewage]\" (Simonelli (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003: 543-544). Further, many chronic illnesses now arise before old age due to conditions of poverty and limited access to medical care, i.e. \"post-transitional illness in pre-transitional circumstances\" (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003: 543-544). The compound burden of infectious and non-infectious illness exists alongside other causes of fatalities, some of which take novel, context-dependent forms, such as accidents and violent injuries. In Chiapas, for example, automobile- pedestrian accidents, confrontation due to (para)militarization, and pesticide poisoning pose distinctive and life-threatening challenges (PAHO 2002, Tinoco & Halperin 2000). In sum, Mexico - especially its elder population - faces multiple causes of morbidity and mortality beyond the non-infectious disease burden of which the epidemiological transition model warns (Frenk et al. 2004b). 4. Polarization of ill health and care resources A third anomaly in the progression of health transition in Mexico is polarization of mortality and morbidity levels and health/illness profiles across and within geographic regions and populations. While certain sectors of the Mexican population (states, rural- urban regions, communities, even households) experience \"post-transitional\" health and care circumstances, others continue to suffer from \"pre-transitional\" conditions, in essence living in distinct \"epidemiological worlds\" in shared physical space (Phillips 1991, c.f. Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998, Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). 103 Chiapas is a case in point. Using the XII General Population & Housing Census, conducted in 2000, the National Population Council (CONAPO) designated Chiapas as the most highly marginalized state in the country, with a marginalization index of 2.25, categorized as \"Very High.\" Compared to the rest of the country, Chiapas presents a dark epidemiological profile. For instance, in 1994, the risk of infectious disease was 2.9 times greater in Chiapas than in the northern states of Mexico (Lozano-Ascencio et al. 1996). Table 3.3 suggests other, more recent contrasts between demographic and epidemiological worlds co-existing in Mexico. Table 3.3, Demographic and epidemiological indicators, Mexico vs. Chiapas. Indicator Mexico Chiapas 2001 maternal mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 births) 51 117 2003 fertility rate (children per woman) 2.1 3.47 2003 infant mortality rate (deaths per 1000 live births) 28 35 2000 average life expectancy (years) \u00b1 75 72 2001 hospital beds per 100,000 inhabitants \u00a7 77 44 2001 physicians with direct patient contact per 100,000 inhabitants \u00a7 120 88 2001 nurses per 100,000 inhabitants \u00a7 190 119 2001 percent of population with health insurance \u00b1 40 18 Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL). Accessed Health Sistema Salud Servicios de Salud, PAHO. These nationwide averages incorporate Mexican states boasting much more favorable indicators. Likewise, state averages hide even more deplorable conditions in many contexts and subgroups within Chiapas, as geographically-isolated, economically- marginalized, female, indigenous, and elder subgroups present even more dire indicators (c.f. SEDESOL Chiapas 2003 via SiPaz). 104 Clearly, a focus on national averages to diagnose health needs and a generalized approach to national health care, then, are a disservice to the country's diverse population (Phillips 1991: viii). As Ham-Chande (1996) observes, \"National statistics lose their meaning when applied to regions and lack applicability for health and well-being policy. A local focus is necessary... in order for illness and death indicators to acquire significance and utility\" (Ham-Chande 1996: 414).21 5. Disparities in Mexico's gender transition A final incongruity in Mexico's transition trajectory is disparities in the country's gender transition. The gender transition model that has emerged within theories of demographic transition consists of three linear phases defined by changing patterns in female versus male survival, and the resulting sex ratios among the aged (Bonita 1998). In the first stage, the ratio between elder men and women is about the same, with women's premature death usually due to female infanticide, complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and repercussions of poorer health care and nutrition throughout life. In the second stage, maternal mortality and death among middle-aged women decrease, such that populations have higher proportions of older women than older men, a dynamic known as the feminization of aging (Bonita 1998). Many studies affirm that, when conditions and resources that determine quality of life are fairly equitably distributed and barring exceptionally high mortality due to crises (such as war or epidemics), women 21 Studies indicate that elders in rural areas are especially vulnerable due to inadequate income, low health service and insurance access, infrastructural poverty, and scarcity of retirement/pension programs (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). Further, more rural than urban elders work well into their later years due to the lack of an obligatory retirement age, the nature of rural work, and/or poverty (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998). 105 live, on average, longer than men (c.f. Due\u00f1as 2001). In other words, in socially stable conditions, a progressive decline in the male population with respect to the female population as age increases is expected. This decline is reflected demographically in the longer life expectancy at birth for women in most regions of the world. A third stage, occurring now in the most industrialized countries, is a slowing in increases in women's life expectancy and an improvement in men's life expectancy such that the male-female ratio among elders ends up approximately equal (Bonita 1998). In the gender transition model, it is taken for granted that elder women will number at least as many as elder men, if not outnumber men. In Mexico, national-level statistics indicate that the country is currently in the second stage of this gender transition, with a 2001 national life expectancy at age 65 of 77.6 years for women versus 73.1 years for men (PAHO 2002, see also Ham-Chande 1996). Based on population projections from the National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n, CONAPO) for 1999, the estimated Masculinity Index, i.e. the proportion of men to women, among older adults in Chiapas, Mexico for the years 2000 and 2005 favors men. In other words, instead of feminization of aging, Chiapas is characterized by the masculinization of aging. Further, census data suggest that elder women in Chiapas are at a disadvantage not only compared to their local male counterparts, but also to their national female cohort (CONAPO 1999). Thus, while aggregate Mexican statistics indicate that the country adheres to the standard gender transition trajectory, this is not the case for Chiapas. Preliminary research indicates that 106 this tendency, which contrasts with global and national trends, is not explained by deficiencies in data collection or by gendered migration, but instead by premature mortality among women aged 45 to 69 years arising from contextual gendered inequities, a phenomenon denoted by Amartya Sen (2002) as the \"missing women\" dynamic. The \"missing\" elder women represent a red flag warning of distinctive challenges of elder women's health and care in this state. Beyond contrasts in their life expectancy, research indicates that Mexican men and women experience aging, health problems, and care differently (c.f. Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005, Trevi\u00f1o-Siller et al. 2006, Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998). I return to gender disparities in Chapter 8. In sum, accelerated population aging, growing chronic, non-infectious disease compounded by perseverance of infectious disease, polarization of health problems and resources, and disparities in the country's gender transition demand a generation-, gender-, and context-sensitive response to elder health care needs. I argue in the next section, however, that the state has not adequately addressed these issues. 107 B. Inadequate government response to contextual, gendered elder care needs I argue below that the Mexican government does not provide adequate health care for all Mexicans elders, despite the facts that the state has developed an extensive health care network; declared guaranteed protection of health for all and respect for older adults as constitutional rights; and enacted a National Health Program aimed at the \"democratization of health\" via provision of health equity, quality, and financial protection for all (Frenk et.al. 2004a, Frenk et al. 2004b). 1. Mexican health system organization, history and current agenda a. Organization of the Mexican health system Figure 3.2 illustrates the Mexican healthcare system's organization around three components: 1) social security, 2) Ministry of Health, and 3) private services. 1) The mainstay of the country's health system is a mandatory social insurance program in which the primary provider institutions are the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and the Social Security Institute for Public Employees (ISSSTE). IMSS and ISSSTE together cover just over half of the population. IMSS, for private sector workers, includes about 46% of Mexicans, and ISSSTE, for public sector workers (including those employed by the national oil company and the armed forces), covers about 11% of Mexicans (Seguro Popular Informe 2oS 2005). This system includes ambulatory and hospital care, as well as medicines and lab analyses. Services are prepaid through contributions from formal sector employees, their employers, and the government (Flores 108 et al. 2001). The majority of beneficiaries are workers in industry, commerce, banks, and government, i.e. a population sub-group with a stable income. Figure 3.2, Overview of the Mexican healthcare system. Frenk et al. 2003: 1668. 2) The second component, funded through federal taxation, consists of the Secretary of Health (SSA, a.k.a. the Ministry of Health, MH) and to a small extent IMSS-Solidaridad (for designated rural sectors). These institutions offer health services to the rest of the population - about 48 million people, known as the \"open population\" (PAHO 2002). They only offer primary health care (medical assistance and immunizations, excluding 109 drugs) without pocket purchase, and hospitalization, for which patients must pay for all services. Although most primary health care services in SSA institutions are \"free of charge,\" patients have to pay certain fees that health care officers consider symbolic and that are meant to \"regulate the demand.\" These charges can be prohibitive for those in extreme poverty, such that the portion of Mexican population with the least economic resources must pay for most if not all of their health services, medication, and procedures (Flores et al. 2001). Elders tend to fall in this group. About 12% of those Mexicans not eligible for social insurance (many of whom are covered by IMSS-Solidaridad) have recently been enrolled in the nascent Popular Insurance Program (discussed below). 3) While largely undocumented on official health statistics, Mexicans also seek care in a third realm: private sector hospitals, pharmacies, and physicians' offices. The private sector is a fragmented entity providing little-supervised services - mostly curative in nature - with a broad range of quality and variable prices. An estimated 2% of the nation's population - a small, moneyed sub-group - holds private health insurance, either paid for by themselves or their employer, usually to cover major medical problems. NGOs play very little role in service provision (PAHO 2002). This fragmented architecture - dividing Mexicans into groups based on employment and ability to pay, and then further segmented among various providers within each group - 110 has haunted the Mexican health care system since its inception (Frenk et al. 2003, PAHO 2002). Further complicating the situation is cross-over between the components. Some individuals ensured through IMSS or ISSSTE seek care from the SSA, because they prefer the care offered or because they live far from the IMSS or ISSSTE clinic. A small segment of social insurance recipients also have private coverage for major medical expenses. Many Popular Insurance beneficiaries are also covered by IMSS-Solidaridad. (Seguro Popular Informe 2oS 2005, PAHO 2002). The bulk of cross-over, however, lies in the fact that nearly all Mexicans - insured and uninsured - use private providers, paying out-of-pocket (PAHO 2002). In fact, the National Health Survey II (ENSA-II, 1994) showed that 38% of insured elders (aged 60+) used private medical services (25% of IMSS elders, 45% of ISSSTE elders). Among those without insurance, 60% used a private doctor and just 40% used the SSA (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998). b. History of the Mexican health care system Instituted in 1943, the Mexican health system has undergone major overhauls with hopes of providing quality healthcare for all. Radical shifts in epidemiological profile between the 1940s and 1970s produced an overlap of unresolved existing problems and emerging diseases, later exacerbated by health spending cuts provoked by the 1980s debt crisis. As a result, the health care system deteriorated into an \"overly centralized, inefficient system that concentrated most of its resources on costly curative interventions\" (Frenk et al. 2003: 1668), especially among infants and children (Ham-Chande 1996). In response to the need to extend basic health care to poorly served rural and urban-poor sectors, in 111 1983, a constitutional amendment declared protection of health a legal right, health services for the uninsured were slowly decentralized to state governments, and a primary healthcare model was instituted to increase coverage. Global health reform in the early 1990s prompted another major Mexican health care shift. This time, the goal was to move away from vertical and differential delivery of care and toward horizontal integration of stewardship, financing and services, such that they extend across all social groups. (Frenk et al. 2003) c. Current agenda of the Mexican health care system The present National Health Program 2001-2006 (NHP 2001-2006), subtitled \"The Democratization of Health in Mexico: Toward a Universal System of Health,\" purports provision of equity, quality, and financial protection in health care. The state contends that it recognizes the diversity of health needs between states and social classes, and considers addressing the unresolved health problems as both a moral imperative and a democratic concern. The program explicitly aims to improve and extend access to basic health services for the poor, with special emphasis on maternal and child health. (Frenk et al. 2003, Frenk et al. 2004a). 112 The NHP 2001-2006 is strategy, consisting of: \u0001 A dozen \"low-cost/high impact\" interventions forming the Program for Extension of Coverage (Frenk et al. 2003, PAHO 2002: 2): basic household sanitary measures family planning antenatal, perinatal and post-natal care growth and nutrition surveillance immunization treatment of diarrhea at household level treatment of common parasitic diseases treatment of acute respiratory infections prevention and treatment of tuberculosis prevention/control of hypertension, diabetes prevention of accidents & initial treatment of injuries community training for health promotion The elder population is specifically targeted within the three sub-programs on tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Assessments indicated the high cost incurred by the Mexican health system to treat these diseases (for example, diabetes and hypertension treatments cost three to four times prenatal care and diarrhea treatment), thus the added emphasis on prevention in all three cases (Wagner et al. 1999). \u0001 The Program for Education, Health and Nutrition (PROGRESA), a welfare program initiated in 1997, offering cash subsidies to the poor in exchange for participation in education, health and nutritional interventions (Frenk et al. 2003, Coady et al. 2005). \u0001 The System of Social Protection (SPS) in Health, created to cover individuals typically excluded from the social security system, via the Popular Health Insurance program, which subsidizes family contributions in accordance with ability to pay (Frenk et al. 2003). \u0001 The National Crusade for the Quality of Health Services, established to increase effectiveness and responsiveness of health services (Frenk et al. 2003). 113 d. National focus on elder well-being With the exception of targeting diabetes, hypertension, and tuberculosis, the NHP 2001- 2006 does not distinguish aging or the elderly as a focused concern. Indeed, state education, research, and intervention initiatives to promote elder well-being have been slow to come to fruition. An initial spark, the PanAmerican Gerontology Conference in Mexico City in 1957, was not followed up until 1977, when the Mexican Geriatrics and Gerontology Society was formed. In 1979, by presidential decree, the Mexican National Senescence Institute (Instituto Nacional de la Senectud, INSEN) was created to protect and serve adults aged 60+, mostly via medical intervention. The first formal training program for physicians did not appear until 1986 within the ISSSTE, and in 1993 within the Medical School of the Autonomous National University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, UNAM). International attention was not fixed on aging in Mexico until 1995, when the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), French universities, and the geriatrics unit of the Mexican National Nutrition Institute met in Mexico City for the International Seminar for a Global Vision of the Problem of Aging in Mexico (Guti\u00e9rrez Robledo & Lozano Ascencio 1996). In 1999, the Fox government, through the SSA, created the National Committee for Aging Attention/Care (Comit\u00e9 Nacional de Atenci\u00f3n al Envejecimiento) and proposed state Aging Committees (Comit\u00e9s Estatales de Envejecimiento). These Committees are responsible for defining programs and policy oriented toward a culture of prevention and curing the most prevalent illnesses among adults aged 60 and up (Secretar\u00eda de Salud 1999). 114 It was not until 2002, however, that a Bill of Legal Rights of Older Adults was established, among which lie access to medical care. Also in 2002, INSEN was placed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Social Development (Secretar\u00eda de Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL) as part of a new National Institute of Older Adults (Instituto Nacional de las Personas Adultas Mayores, INAPAM). INAPAM was established to research and shape public policy regarding protection, care, help, and orientation for adults over 60 with a holistic human development focus (INAPAM website 2006). INAPAM promotes medical assistance, legal counseling, and occupational options, via discounts on goods and services; community cultural, sporting, and social activities; training to produce items for sale and pastime; elder health education; legal counseling; small grants for productive projects; job placement; and mobile units offering membership services, legal assistance, medical and dental care to those whose physical or residential situations limit access to services (INAPAM website 2006). While the state's focus on elder well-being seems - on paper - to be encouraging, I expose various shortcomings and gaps in this chapter and those that follow. 2. Shortcomings of the Mexican health system relevant to elder health care Despite a general consensus that it is the nation's moral duty to care for its members, especially those most vulnerable (Frenk et al. 2003), state intention and ability to provide adequate context- and gender-sensitive elder care is questionable. Closer inspection of the architecture, history, and current agenda of the Mexican health system indicate major shortcomings relevant to elder health care: non-universal health insurance coverage, little 115 attention to extra-clinical care, and low prioritization of health care needs specific to the aged, especially elder women. a. Non-universal health insurance coverage A major impediment to satisfying elder health care needs is that health insurance is not universal in Mexico. While the social insurance programs (IMSS, ISSSTE, etc.) may provide satisfactory care (and this is not always the case [PAHO 2002]) for those who are gainfully employed in the formal sector, this segment of the population is limited. Many Mexicans are self-employed, others are unemployed, still others work in the informal sector, and some have left the work force and therefore lack labor rights or social protection. In 2001, just 40% of the Mexican population was insured; in Chiapas, only about 18% had coverage (PAHO 2002; see also Frenk et al. 2004b, Seguro Popular website). Among Mexican elders, over half of adults aged 50 and over are uninsured. Lack of insurance is concentrated among the most marginalized groups, such as elders and women, among whom the ability to pay for services is limited (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003). High cost of treatment and insufficient resources force the uninsured to postpone care, go without treatment, and/or risk impoverishment due to the expense of catastrophic health services (Seguro Popular website). In fact, private, out-of-pocket spending represents more than half of all health expenditure. Impoverishing health expenditures are common: 85% of Mexican families spending over 30% of their disposable income on health are uninsured and more than half are low income (Frenk et al. 2003, Frenk et al. 2004b). In 2002, Chiapas had the highest rate (7.3%) in Mexico of households incurring 116 catastrophic health expenditures (defined as those with health expenditures over 30% of their ability to pay), nearly six times greater than in other states. Uninsured, poor, and rural households showed a higher risk of impoverishment. Being aged 60 and older increased the probability of catastrophic expenditures by 43% (Sesma-V\u00e1zquez et al. 2005). Thus, most aged Mexicans rely on out-of-pocket spending for their health care needs, of which consultation, medication, and ambulatory care figure prominently. The non-universal insurance system especially threatens aged adults with impoverishing health spending and unmet health care needs, as elders populate the ranks of the uninsured poor, and face escalating chronic-degenerative problems with age. The nascent Popular Health Insurance program has been touted by the government as a remedy for the insurance gap. Indeed, the program holds much promise of helping those in the lowest economic echelons, and includes coverage for some preventive and curative services targeting elders (e.g. flu shots, diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, menopause care, rehabilitation following fractures) (Seguro Popular website). However, the program is being introduced in stages, such that many qualifying elders will not be covered for years. In Chiapas, as of the first semester of 2005, just 8.7% of the state's uninsured population had received Popular Health coverage, and of those included, just 11% were aged 51 and up (Seguro Popular website). Individuals lucky enough to have coverage had access to a very restricted portion of the health network, as significantly fewer than half of the medical installations (hospitals, health centers, etc.) had been incorporated into the program. Popular Health Insurance administrators admit that 117 inclusion of intended beneficiaries and incorporation of network providers will not be complete until 2010 (Frenk et al. 2004b). Beyond the lengthy process of enrolling beneficiaries, the government confesses that participating institutions have traditionally failed to offer high-quality, user-oriented services: \"In the past, the public sector agencies operated basically as monopolies with little margin of choice for consumers, little response to their needs or concern regarding quality. In fact, neither public installations nor private ones were subject to any type of accreditation\" (Frenk et al. 2004b: 44). Due to this poor reputation, the government must promote trust in the system among a skeptical population: The population must begin to have confidence in public services to convince themselves of the utility of prepaying and re-affiliation, as the insurance against risks is not a priority in many families and diverse past failures in the health system have made the population doubtful of its ability to fulfill their needs. (Frenk et al. 2004b: 47) Even when convinced of the benefits of the system, elders then need to meet poverty criteria, await their turn in the implementation plan, comply with enrollment and documentation requirements, find a participating provider, seek care for an included service, and hope for quality services. It is revealing to compare Mexico to other countries. For instance, in Canada, 100% of medical and hospital services are covered universally and financed by the federal government, such that out-of-pocket health expenditure is minimal. In the United States, 96% of the elder population is covered by Medicare and 77% also pay for other 118 complementary insurance, subsidized by the state. In contrast, elder Mexicans must pay for practically all private services (except for the less than 2% covered by some private insurance). In sum, a great number of elders do not have insurance, are not economically active, and suffer from chronic diseases that require permanent and specialized vigilance and care. At the moment the health system in Mexico does not have the capacity to cover this demand; therefore elders seek private care, with repercussions in their income and life conditions. (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998, see also G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1005) b. Little attention to extra-clinical care Given their uninsured status, many Mexicans must seek other means (household, alternative/complementary, self-care) of meeting their health needs. People are creative in patching together services, products, information, and skills in response to acute illness episodes, as well as for everyday health maintenance and management of chronic disease, disability, depression, and suffering. Health production is embedded in non-institutional spaces and the routine investment of time, resources, and knowledge by extensive therapy management groups as critical health inputs alongside formal medical outlays and clinical care, as medical anthropologists have discerned across cultural contexts (Berman et.al. 1994, Browner 1989, Nichter 1995). This propels self-care in the community and household to the forefront. 119 Self-care is the primary response to illness in Mexico. Illustrative are results of the 1994 National Health Survey, which probed health care strategies among individuals who reported sickness within the two weeks prior to the survey: Sixty-one percent was self-attended [and only 39% used medical care]. Of those who perceived their illness as serious, 52% did not use medical services because they considered them too expensive or did not have the money to pay.... A greater frequency of self-care was observed among... [those] over 5 years old who lacked access to social security medical services, or system of private insurance, suffered a mild illness, and lived in poor, rural areas. In Mexico, self- care represents the most important response to illness. Socioeconomic conditions, regardless of the perception of seriousness of the symptoms, determine the higher frequency of self-care mainly among those people living in poverty. (Flores et al. 2000: 15) Self-care is often managed outside the clinic in conjunction with lay care provided by complementary and alternative practitioners (Flores et al. 2001). Mexicans also frequently use both home remedies and material obtained from local pharmacies. The ENSA-II revealed that among elders aged 60+ who had a health problem in the previous two weeks, 74% had taken some medication and 35.5% had taken some home remedies. Self-medication, over-prescription, non-optimal prescription, and excess consumption were common among elders (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998, see also Tapia- Conyer et al .1996).22 The national and international pharmaceutical industry in Mexico is very strong, and Mexicans often self-prescribe pharmacy-bought medicines, buy medicines that the health services do not have in stock (PAHO 2002), and consult pharmacy employees for medical advice. Self-care is also employed to treat chronic 22 Self-medication was over 60% among poor, rural elders aged 60+ surveyed in three Mexican states (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). Even prescription practices were suspect. A cross-sectional study conducted in1998 among elderly covered by the IMSS healthcare services in Mexico City, found that physicians prescribed more expensive, less clinically effective hypertensive drugs (Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1a et al., 2001). 120 diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, at times successfully, but often inadequately (Flores et al. 2001). Exploring informal health production and self-care is especially pertinent to elderly Mexicans in Chiapas, as elders in this state are prone to be uninsured, and medical consultation and health service utilization rates far below the national average, making the household the primary context of health production, and self-care a frequent strategy (Reyes Fausto 2001). The government all but ignores extra-clinical care and fails to propose strengthening of and collaboration with other potential elder support and care providers. The NHP 2001- 2006 makes no mention of complementary and alternative medicine, nor of pharmacy employees, which the Ministry of Health suspects is the primary source of care for a large portion of the population, including those with some social insurance coverage and access to SSA services (World Bank 2001). Further, there is no recognition of the key role of informal household care, nor any initiative to support in-home caregivers. c. Low prioritization of health care needs of the aged, especially women While the NHP 2001-2006 does attempt to reach economically precarious, geographically isolated (i.e. rural), and marginalized ethnic/racial populations, it pays little attention to two other key intersecting axes of inequality: generation (elders) and gender (women). There is just one reference to elders buried among the Program goals (design of an extra-domestic daytime care service model for chronically ill, handicapped, and elders) (SSA 2001). 121 Researchers, for example, advocate an intensive prevention campaign to assuage elders' need for complex, specialized, curative services. Prevention activities promising the largest impact and benefit among elders include: immunization against the flu and pneumonia, accident prevention, early detection and timely treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, breast and colorectal cancer, as well as detecting deficiencies in the sensory organs, incontinence, dental and podiatry problems, physical activity levels, nutrition, and functional limitations (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998, Guti\u00e9rrez & Bertozzi 2005). Prevention would also include screening and early diagnosis. The National Survey of Chronic Diseases (Mexico, 1993) in the 60 to 69 years old group found that 20% of the survey respondents did not know they were diabetic, and 28% of the survey respondents did not know they were hypertensive, probably due to little contact with health services, not having knowledge of the condition via a relative with it, being asymptomatic (Castro et al. 1996). Also noteworthy is the deplorable state of long-term care in Mexico, which is likely to impact women more than men, as women may suffer from more long-term disease and disability and are more likely to be poor and widowed. There are very few long-term care institutions (public or private) in the entire nation. The few that exist are concentrated in Mexico City, and have been found to be insufficient. Institutionalized elders are those who lack basic services or access to social security, do not have sufficient family support, and suffer from a chronic disease that requires continuous medical 122 treatment (usually specialized). They are socially isolated, have limited economic resources, multiple health problems, atypical or silent presentation of illnesses, rapid loss in illness, less capacity to deal with stressful situations, more vulnerability, higher frequency of complications and iatrogenia23 in the course of illness. It is commonplace to find highly dependent populations living in poorly staffed or inadequately equipped institutions and vice versa. The government has been slow to establish norms and enforce supervision of the functioning of such institutions. (Guti\u00e9rrez-Robledo et al. 1996) Even programs set up with elders in mind fall extremely short of need, especially in Chiapas. For instance, the National Institute of Older Adults (INAPAM) efforts are stronger in urban areas, and in general the health elements are quite restricted. The mobile health services are only offered in Mexico City and the state of Mexico. The National Older Adult Health Record (Cartilla Nacional de Salud para Adultos Mayores), conceptually similar to an immunization record, facilitates a thorough record of basic prevention and treatment of the most common illnesses of old age, but does not actually provide or pay for services for the bearer (INAPAM website 2006). Another Older Adult Program provides funds and nutrition education for elders over age 60 who face nutritional poverty, do not receive other food support programs, and who live in highly marginalized rural communities of fewer than 2,500 people. While surely serving some 23 Conditions due to the action of a physician or a therapy the doctor prescribed, usually caused inadvertently. 123 of the most marginalized elders, the majority are not included.24 For instance, only about 200 of the over 8000 adults aged 60 and up residing in the municipality of Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas are registered in this program (SEDESOL website 2006). Gendered elder health problems, care needs, and services (i.e. the confluence of gender and generation) are even further from the radar screen. Instead, the NHP 2001-2006 continues to prioritize maternal-infant health, via family planning and obstetric services, such as the Fair Start in Life (Arranque Parejo en la Vida) program, which has received much attention and resources. Prevention, screening, and treatment of elder health problems, especially those more prevalent in women, are back-burnered. A closer look at the NHP 2001-2006 primary interventions, PROGRESA, Popular Health Insurance, and the National Crusade for Quality of Health Services reveal that they are not designed with gendered elder health and care needs in mind. World Health Organization standards offer a useful basis for assessment. 24 Similarly, the DIF's National Program for Elder Adult Care (Programa Nacional de Atenci\u00f3n al Adulto Mayor) aspires to provide food baskets (dispensa), scholarships for elder education, and elder daycare centers for those elders deemed \"extremely vulnerable.\" Infrastructure and funding limitations mean that these well-intentioned services reach very few elders in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas (personal communication with the DIF Director). 124 Figure 3.3, Photo, Prevention & Family Planning, Comit\u00e1n General Hospital d. Principal interventions, gender and age The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a gender-sensitive review of elder health needs, focusing special attention on conditions which: \u0001 occur at higher rates among older women (e.g. osteoporosis and resulting hip fractures) \u0001 may not be fatal but affect older women's daily activities and independence (e.g. arthritis) \u0001 are treatable via women's self-care (e.g. malnutrition) \u0001 are exaggerated or under-valued because of frequency in women (e.g. depression) \u0001 arise from women's reproductive trajectory (e.g. incontinence from difficult births, female circumcision, untreated urinary tract infections, multiple births) (Bonita 1998). On the basis of this criteria, the WHO posits the following global elder women's health care priorities (Bonita 1998), many of which are not included in the principal interventions of the NHP 2001-2006: 125 \u0001 Addressing avoidable causes of morbidity and mortality: heart diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, cancer (lung, cervical, uterine, breast), and contagious disease in developing countries (trachoma, tuberculosis, tropical diseases) \u0001 Addressing main causes of chronic disability: osteomuscular problems, e.g. arthritis, osteoporosis, incontinence \u0001 Treating mental health problems: depression and dementia \u0001 Treating multiple afflictions, lesser afflictions, sensory loss e.g. cataracts, loss of hearing \u0001 Strengthening primary and secondary prevention and primary health care programs \u0001 Influencing factors that affect multiple afflictions (e.g. tobacco, nutrition, exercise) via prevention programs, education \u0001 Studying the risk of (unnecessary, inadequate, costly) over-medication in elder women Insufficient attention to mental health and medication deserves special mention. There is extensive evidence that mental disorders among elder Mexicans cause great suffering, severe disability, and high financial costs. Depression, one of the most common and debilitating yet overlooked illnesses among elders, can increase the risk for many other diseases and accidents, may aggravate functional impairment, and may delay disease recovery. Patients with depression tend to be high utilizers of medical services. Although treatable, depression is often not treated or treated inadequately, and suicide rates are high among depressed elders. Statistics indicate that women may suffer disproportionately from mental health disorders. For instance, the Mexican National Household Survey on Addictions (Segunda Encuesta Nacional de Adicciones, ENA93, 1993), found that, among adults aged 60 to 64 (the oldest respondents), there was a high rate of psychotherapeutic drug use (28% for women and 17% for men). (Wagner et al. 1999) The most frequently used drugs were central nervous system depressants (22% of women and 13% of men). The sex difference may be due to there being more elder women than men, women's higher use of medical services than men, and historically 126 gendered definitions of mental illness. The onset age of consumption was 60 years old and men started earlier than women. In addition to being costly, the consumption of multiple medications (and women use more than men) is a clinical risk that, combined with physiological changes related to age, increases the probability of adverse effects. Women can be more susceptible to adverse effects due to their smaller body size. (Tapia- Conyer et al. 1996) e. PROGRESA, gender and age A large portion of Program for Education, Health and Nutrition (PROGRESA) cash subsidies rests on being an actively childbearing woman and having children in school. Women receive cash transfers as well as nutritional supplements for young children, contingent on mothers and children accessing local schools and clinics. For example, (as of the end of 1999) beneficiaries received up to 305 pesos (about US$28) per month for each child with high attendance in grades 3-9 (Coady 2003). Because their children are grown, elderly women would not qualify for this subsidy. Further, people found it hard to understand and accept the legitimacy of the complex procedure employed to identify PROGRESA recipients. Delay in payment of benefits, limited number of and long distance to fund distribution points were also critiqued for introducing uncertainty and hardship to older, less mobile beneficiaries (Coady et al. 2005). 127 f. Popular Health Insurance, gender and age Lack of insurance is pronounced among elder women because of the higher likelihood that they are self-employed, unemployed, working in the informal sector, or have left the work force. Unfortunately, this is also the demographic group with the most limited ability to pay for services out-of-pocket (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003). g. National Crusade for Quality of Health Services, gender and age The WHO makes at least two specific recommendations to improve the quality of elder women's health services: \u0001 providing primary health care providers for elder women, and \u0001 employing elder women as primary health workers and advocates (Bonita 1998). Neither of these proposals is included in the NHP 2001-2006. In sum, the Mexican government does not provide universal health insurance coverage, does not support extra-clinical (informal household and community) or complementary and alternative care, and does not prioritize the specific needs of elders - especially women. Despite the constitutional right to health, a popular perception of universal health care (Mart\u00ednez & Leal 2003), and the existence of an extensive care network, the state's approach is not responsive to the needs of many elders, especially elder women (see Chapter 8). Part of this may be a result of the global health funding agenda. 128 The Mexican government's priorities and financing rest in part on global priorities and funding emphases. Global health attention and funding continues to be concentrated on infant and child survival, maternal health, and infectious disease (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria). These axes are reflected in the 2000 United Nations' Millennium Development Goals and the current Global Health Council priorities. It is on the basis of indicators such as maternal and infant mortality that Mexico is evaluated for funding. Health funding received by Mexico from the United States is also focused maternal and infant health and infectious disease25, as manifest in the U.S. Global Health Priorities26. Specifically related to the strategic bilateral U.S.-Mexico relationship, for instance, the Office of Global Health Affairs aims for health promotion and disease prevention to reduce preventable threats to health in the border states, for example via an early-warning infectious disease surveillance in the case of bioterrorism (OGHA website). In terms of funding for health initiatives, then, elder health is not on the radar screen, nor is health at the country's southern extreme (i.e. Chiapas). In general, ambiguity shrouds the question of to what extent the government is responsible for elder care. The 2002 Bill of Legal Rights of Older Adults specifies that both the state and the family should care for elders, but this is not operationalized or enforced. Fortunate elders enjoy a patchwork of family, state, and societal support, following government dictates that call for respect and health. In reality, however, the burden usually falls on one close family member and on the elder him/herself, resulting in major gaps and disparities for health care. 25 With the addition of tobacco control initiatives. 26 Office of Global Health Affairs, U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services. 129 C. Uncertain elder entitlement to household care and caring resources The government may derive some comfort from the pervasive notion that the family has traditionally been and will continue to be an important source of care in old age. Mexican elders are often represented as ensconced in broad and numerous family groups, both by necessity and by will (Bonita 1998, CONAPO 2002). Further, demographic transition is supposed to usher in longer lives, a significant postponement of widowhood, a decrease in parents' experience of death among their children, and greater potential for inter-generational family interaction (Tuir\u00e1n 2000). These may be romanticized images inspiring a false sense of security, given that the country's \"demographic revolution\" has also resulted in cultural transformation, changes in household structure and family organization (CONAPO 2001), including a potential decrease in the number of family members physically present in Mexican elders' households, and shifts in the values presumed to underlie Mexican elders' entitlement to informal care, with unpredictable repercussions. 1. Decrease in the number of members in Mexican elders' households Demographic changes provoke shifts in household composition, structure, and internal organization. Some have described a transition to a \"beanpole\" family structure, with many generations but fewer and fewer members in any one generation (Moen 1996). Often, this means \"down-sizing,\" such that there are fewer household members (spouse, children, grandchildren) upon whom elders might count for care. First, it may be less likely for elders to have a spouse as a caregiver. In Mexico, there are increasing numbers 130 of homes formed of people living alone, households headed by women, and single parent households. This is most pronounced in women, among whom more and more experience marital separation for voluntary causes, while it continues to be less likely for women than men to remarry. Second, there may be fewer adult children present to care for elders. One reason is migration. Today, around 8 million Mexican-born individuals reside in the U.S. and this is expected to double by 2020 (Tuir\u00e1n 2000). Between 30,000 and 50,000 Chiapanecos (of a total population of nearly 4 million) migrate to the United States every year. According to estimations, in less than a decade, some 300,000 Chiapanecos will have taken up residence in the U.S. (SiPaz website). Because of the selective migrant dynamic, these migrants tend to be the healthy young adults who might otherwise provide the day-to-day support for their aging parents (Soldo et al. 2002). Urbanization, too, can leave elders isolated in rural communities and even in poor suburban areas (Bonita 1998). There may even be fewer grandchildren to care for elders, given the steadily falling fertility rates. For instance, in a study of poor, rural elders aged 60+ in three Mexican states, despite having an average of 6 children, less than half lived with their partner or a relative, instead residing alone or with friends (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). In this way, the decline in fertility and extension of old age mean that adult children have to contend with more and more responsibility for caring for their parents in a longer and longer old age, and with fewer siblings with whom to share the responsibility. While CONAPO asserts that this is a situation that will be faced by \"tomorrow's adults\" (CONAPO 2002), this is already the case today. 131 2. Shifts in values presumed to underlie Mexican elders' entitlement to care In addition to the potential decrease in the number of potential caregivers present in elders' households, the values underlying informal elder care may be shifting. Values presumed to orient health resource allocation among Mexicans include familism, age hierarchy, gender roles, and reciprocity.27 In elaborating on how each might structure entitlement, and illuminating the politics of responsibility, sources of conflict, and change over time, the hegemony of these \"Mexican values\" is challenged, as is the predictability of their impact on elder health care. a. Familism It is in the context of predominantly home-based healthcare and extended household membership that the value of familism is often used to characterize Mexicans. Familism denotes a strong orientation to close emotional bonds within the family and an intense sense of obligation to provide economic and emotional support to family members throughout life. Where familism runs high, it is expected that family needs eclipse individual needs, and self-identity is intimately tied to family identification. The family circle is frequently augmented by others through residential proximity (e.g. trusted neighbors) and religious rituals (e.g. compadres). Familism is said to orient, empower, and assist Mexicans through a variety of life situations, including old age and caring for elders (Clark 1993, Du Bois et.al. 2001, Katz Olson 2001, L\u00f3pez 2002, Luna et.al. 1996, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). 27 Others include respect (respeto), sympathy (simpat\u00eda), and fatalism (fatalismo) (Du Bois 2001). 132 Theoretically, familial responsibility for eldercare may fall on the shoulders of children (- in-law), God-children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, neighbors, friends, and comadres/compadres. However, Mexican elders tend to turn to their children before seeking assistance from other relatives or health services. Aged Mexicans are more likely to live with an adult child than in the nearly non-existent care centers or retirement communities, and to keep primary caregiving within the family (Clark & Huttlinger 1998, Du Bois et.al. 2001, Luna et.al. 1996). Mexicans are also more likely to hold a family- centered model of medical decision-making, rather than the patient autonomy model favored by most African and European Americans. This view is influential in later life, as it affects disclosure of diagnosis, prognosis of terminal illness, and end-of-life choices (Blackhall et.al. 1995, Clark 1993). Familism is often cited as causing \"underutilization,\" or lower rates of formal health service use by and institutionalization of elderly Mexicans, despite potentially high needs for such services (Aguirre-Molina et.al. 2001, Dietz 2002, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). Indeed, some Mexican elders have expressed a preference for direct family care (Du Bois et.al. 2001). However, research indicates that structural factors, not cultural values, are the most likely reason that elders go without health services. Elders and caregivers may not be aware of care options, or may be deterred by the complexity of the long-term care system and its financing, or simply by nonexistence of needed services. People may also think that because care giving has not yet become a crisis, it is not appropriate to ask for 133 extra help. Additionally, caregivers may reject formal home services because they would feel obligated to clean the house prior to visits and would have to treat the service providers as guests, adding more work rather than providing respite (Henderson 1997). Recent studies suggest that households are not averse to using some formal care, and elect to do so when structural barriers (like cost) are reduced (Katz Olson 2001). Thus, while older Mexicans may hold expectations of family support, those expectations do not mean that formal services would not improve the status of the elders and their caregivers, or that in-home health care would be dropped if formal services were offered. On the contrary, formal services seem to complement rather than replace family-based efforts (Sokolovsky 1997b, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). In reference to Mexican eldercare responsibilities, then, \"familism\" may be a euphemism for filial obligations in the face of structural constraints. b. Age hierarchy Age hierarchy refers to the increasing status and respect associated with chronological age or age grades. In Mexican households organized around this ideal, elders enjoy high status, which presumably entitles them to health resources (Aguirre-Molina et.al. 2001, Du Bois et.al. 2001, Maldonado 1978). Some studies indicate that a strong sense of support and intergenerational reliance lending itself to elder care continues to operate in many households (Clark & Huttlinger 1998). In such contexts, failure to care for elderly relatives may be seen as deviant behavior, resulting in the low rates of institutionalization of aged Mexican. Others, however, assert that Mexican household structure and its 134 organizing values have shifted over time to fit rapidly changing economic, social, and cultural conditions, leaving the elderly increasingly isolated and alienated. With urbanization, modernization, and acculturation among younger Mexican Americans, the proportion of nuclear families is swelling, and extended family ties are deteriorating (Aguirre-Molina et.al. 2001, Becerra 1983, Maldonado 1978). As younger generations rise in social status, they become more mobile and live further away from kin, decreasing familial interdependence, and often leaving elders behind. Additionally, the socioeconomic gap between older and younger generations may widen, resulting in the elderly playing less prominent familial roles and holding less household authority, opening the possibility that wealthier families provide less support to the aged (Dietz 2002, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). As household structure changes, intra-personal and intergenerational conflict may arise. Some elders may be forced to move away from their natal communities and into urban areas, and end up feeling alone in an alien culture without the type of support they value and expect from younger caregivers. Elders' expectations about appropriate and adequate care, perhaps based on values such as familism, may not take into consideration caregivers' many complex daily responsibilities. In parent-child relationships, the elder's expectations may be derived from those based in smaller communities in earlier years. Because the younger caregiver's lifestyle and values may have been affected by \"modern\" life, his/her behavior may not conform to the elder's attitudes and judgments. For instance, for elders, the norm of children as solely responsible for their parents' well-135 being has been ingrained in them based on their own experiences with caring for elderly family members in the early and mid-1900s. Violating this norm may move elders to see caregivers as failing to fulfill expected roles (Becerra 1983, Clark & Huttlinger 1998, Dietz 2002). Granted, some elders recognize that it would be difficult for their adult children to support them and so attempt to become more independent, but conflict is the norm, and may mount as age brings increased disabilities and/or weaker informal support (Du Bois 2001, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). Another potential source of generational conflict is a tendency for elders to have a more holistic conceptualization of health than do their caregivers. From a holistic perspective, physical, psychological, and spiritual factors, separately or in conjunction, produce (ill-) health, calling for alternative care, such as folk healers, herbal remedies, and religious rituals (Trotter & Chavira 1997). Elders may perceive folk medicine as an integral component of their overall health-maintenance practice (Du Bois et.al. 2001, Sanchez Mayers 1989). At the same time, their caregivers, usually adult children acculturated into today's norms, may ignore, not notice, or misunderstand elders' perceived psychological and spiritual needs; may not bestow the same urgency and priority on these needs; and may not value alternative care strategies.28 Thus, even elders who have many children, may not necessarily grow old within a consistently extended and supportive network, nor 28 Elder care may also be hindered by cultural constructions among Mexicans of certain diseases as \"normal\" for the aged and by stigma associated with other conditions. For example, many Mexicans consider arthritis as part of normal aging, potentially resulting in little treatment aside from palliative care. Mexicans are also reticent to treatment for stigma-laden depression and mental illness (Du Bois et al. 2001). 136 does their age guarantee them entitlement to the health resources that they perceive necessary for their well-being (Dietz 2002). c. Gender roles Traditional gender roles ascribed to Mexican culture present men as dominant, distant, and authoritative in household decision-making, traits often subsumed under the terms machismo and patriarchy. Marianismo, machismo's counterpart, posits women as submissive, self-sacrificing, dependent, obedient to men, dedicated to motherhood and nurturing (Aguirre-Molina et al. 2001, Trotman Reid & Bing 2000). Impact of gender roles on allocation of health resources is complex. Focus on male leadership, denoting men as caring, responsible, and protective, would suggest equitable entitlements to elders. In contrast, self-maximization and violence toward women can also characterize an authoritative male household head. Additionally, both machismo and marianismo may move aged men and women and their care providers to \"suffer in silence\" (Sokolovsky 1997b, Henderson 1997). These idealized male and female roles shape the gendering of care work in Mexican households, in that the elder caregiving role is usually assumed by a female relative, preferably the wife or daughter(-in-law) (Clark 1993, Clark & Huttlinger 1998, Cravey 1997). Given this situation, \"elder caregivers\" refers, as in many populations, to women (Katz Olson 2001), most of whom are encouraged to seek jobs that allow them to engage in their child-, spousal-, and elder-caregiving responsibilities (Holstein 1999). Female 137 adult children may care for their elderly parents through extremes of self-sacrifice that intensifies dependence and disability of elderly kin, especially women (Sokolovsky 1997b). Furthermore, women suffer from the repercussions of their disproportionate eldercare burdens, enduring burnout, chronic fatigue, anger, depression, anxiety, severe financial strain, isolation, and deterioration of other family relationships (Clark & Huttlinger 1998). While women may bear the brunt of elder care giving, data on aging in Mexico suggest potential advantages of aging women over aging men in the realm of elder care. Older women experience more continuity in their roles than do men, which keeps them embedded in a support network of age peers and younger women. For men, in contrast, almost any decrease in vitality substantially decreases their participation in social networks (Sokolovsky 1997, 1997a). Additionally, women who have been socialized from early on to perceive themselves as dependents may more easily adjust to increasing dependency in old age. In contrast, men, having taken for granted their independence and dominance throughout life, may suffer more upon losing this authority with age. Gender roles may change as people age and confront illness and disability. A woman's role in decision-making is likely to increase as she ages, weakening the conception of the Mexican household as exclusively patriarchal. Often, adult Mexican women perceive their role as that of wife-mother, while their husbands deal with finances, driving, and employment. However, when their husbands become ill and can no longer carry out 138 these responsibilities, wives may assume these new duties on top of their continuing mother-wife tasks. In the process, traits frequently associated with women - being dependent, submissive, empathetic, and altruistic - shift to ones reflecting independence and assertiveness (Clark & Huttlinger 1998). Moreover, social change, acculturation, and mobility among young people and women may decrease adherence to traditional gender roles and make the role of the patriarch increasingly symbolic, as well (Aguirre-Molina et.al. 2001, Bruce 1989). d. Reciprocity Linked to familism is the assumed propensity among Mexicans to provide mutual aid through reciprocity based on familial and moral obligation to \"give back\" to parents and other relatives during an individual's lifetime. From this perspective, parents care for children and children then care for parents. From a very young age, children are instilled with a sense of debt and responsibility for members of their household (Aguirre-Molina et al. 2001, Clark 1993, Maldonado 1978). Adults may consciously invest in their grandchildren as a strategy to ensure that care is provided by their children and grandchildren during old age (Vesperi 1997). In spite of the fact that many elders claim not to want to be a burden, most elders believe they will be taken care of by their children and other relatives when they can no longer care for themselves. Reciprocity dictates that support provided by elders throughout life and into old age (such as sharing information, food, medicine, aid during illness, and childcare) merits entitlement to household health care and support. This aid entails physical support in activities of daily living (e.g. 139 dressing, getting outside, using the toilet, rides, meals, telephone use, health care, translation); financial assistance (gifts and loans in cash, money management); and emotional support. Research among Mexicans reveals that reciprocity also includes \"unconditional regard,\" or acceptance of elderly relatives in their present condition, while honoring them for what they were in the past as well (Clark 1993, Clark & Huttlinger 1998, Dietz 2002, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). Fulfilling the debt of reciprocity by caring for elders may be a long, hard challenge due to increases in acute illness calling for more everyday prevention, health maintenance, and management of persisting problems (Berman et al. 1994, Browner 1989, Wallace & Lew- Ting 1992). Given the prevalence of chronic conditions, high levels of functional difficulty and disability, earlier age of disease and disability onset, and low health self- assessment among elders, \"better\" mortality rates may not mean \"better\" health, but instead more years of living with chronic or disabling conditions (Aguirre-Molina et al. 2001, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). Dependence on informal care provided on the basis of reciprocity promises to persist as aged Mexican's access to formal health and long- term care services ebbs, due to rapid growth of the elderly population, their poor health and economic disadvantage, and public program cutbacks and restructuring. In sum, if familism, age hierarchy, male leadership, and reciprocity are indeed accurate characterizations of Mexican households, the question becomes how these values are prioritized and acted upon in specific situations, what ensues when one value conflicts 140 with another, and what happens when these same values prevent individuals from acting at all. For example, which values guide some to reject costly treatment for elders while encouraging equally expensive prenatal care for pregnant women? (Du Bois 2001) If, on the other hand, these portrayals of \"Mexican values\" represent romanticized ideals, what purposes do such depictions fulfill for the elderly, their therapy management groups, and others? For instance, regardless of whether the discourse on \"Mexican values\" is rhetoric or practice, policy makers may embrace notions like reciprocity and familism (often reborn as \"family values\") to legitimate their increasing need for women to provide in- home elder care in the absence of public support systems (Dietz 2002, Du Bois et.al. 2001, Holstein 1999, Sokolovsky 1997b, Wallace & Lew-Ting 1992). Alternatively, perhaps these values persist but are manifested in novel and unexpected ways. For example, familism may continue, but support provided may be increasingly affective rather than instrumental. Conceivably, adult children, restricted by their low socioeconomic position, may provide limited financial help but continue to offer emotional support or advice (Dietz 2002, Katz Olson 2001). Likewise, comadres and God-daughters (ahijadas) might become more crucial than mothers and daughters in the later life of today's aging women, who are increasingly living as single heads of household far from their blood relations (L\u00f3pez 2002). In terms of gender roles, women may continue in a nurturing role, but rather than assuming a more domestic shape as it has in the past, this role may entail more public caring, such as serving as liaisons between elders and service providers to facilitate access to government assistance. Reciprocity, too, may endure, but with elders giving more than they receive, and doing so 141 later in life rather than earlier (Dietz 2002). A strict age hierarchy may also persist, but with the poles reversed - the younger generation occupying the seat of power, even going so far as to exploit elders' contributions as shoppers, babysitters, and house cleaners (Treas & Mazumdar 2002). In short, \"Mexican values\" may continue to shape household production of health among elders, yet assume innovative forms and generate unanticipated results. The evolution of values in Chiapas is at least as unpredictable as elsewhere, as Chiapanecos are embracing many national and international discourses related to gender, family, and health, while simultaneously appealing to tradition (Salgado & Wong 2003, Collier 2005, De la Torre & Estrada 2001, Aguirre-Molina et al. 2001). This process prompts questions about current notions of elder care therapy management and entitlement. For example, while elder care is idealized as a family responsibility, state efforts to impose the Western small family ideal have lowered Chiapas' fertility rates from over 5.4 children per woman in 1970, to 2.75 in 2002 (SISESIM 2004), resulting in a shrinking pool of grown children to care for elders. One study in Chiapas indicated a drastic decrease in the desired number of children, yet persistence of a perceived need to have at least two or three children, in part to ensure care for parents in old age (Halperin et al. 1999). Of potential caregivers, increasing numbers opt to migrate for work, move to cities, or simply reject their traditional care giving role. Further, elder care challenges in Chiapas coexist with structural poverty, internationalization of local economies, state social service cutbacks, privatization, urbanization, migration, and changes in women's 142 roles and household structures (Salgado & Wong 2003, Palloni, Soldo, Wong 2002, Reyes Fausto 2001). It is unclear how these developments will affect family values and support systems and their impact on elder and chronic care, where needs are met by a combination of family, community, and health system support. The former director of the National Population Council, Rodolfo Tuir\u00e1n, reveals the schism between reality and what Mexican society might hope for in terms of the value of elders. He anticipates that the demographic trend - the burgeoning of the aged population - will bring about a social trend - a renaissance of elder culture and value: It is likely... that the numerous presence of older adults in Mexican society will contribute to driving a true cultural revolution directed at eradicating pitying and pejorative discourses on old age, to revalue the social image of this segment of the population, to strengthen inter-generational solidarity, and to procure that social death does not come before biological death. The depth of this change will determine whether, in the future, we are capable of configuring a new social ethic and a new moral economy of the life-cycle and of old age. (Tuir\u00e1n 2003: 1) Whether this will come to fruition remains to be seen. In the meantime, elders' lives and well-being are in the balance. 143 D. Potential for civil society engagement around elder health and care needs 1. Civil society involvement in health care in Mexico In Mexico, there is a sense that the government is responsible for providing universal health care, and there is discourse on the moral obligation to provide family-based care (Bonita 1998). However, there is also some recognition that family and state have not addressed - or have less frequently resolved - the distinctive health needs of many sectors of the population. While not necessarily absolving these two institutions of their responsibilities, civil society has stepped in to illuminate and address some of these issues. This community engagement, nurtured by the international women's health and human rights movements (Bonita 1998), yielded, in 2004, over 1000 civil associations conducting health-related activities registered with the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI 2004). Organizations and groups dedicated to protecting and promoting the health of older adults are now starting to appear, as well. The majority of these organizations prioritize active citizen participation in local health production, and seek partnerships with the government to provide financial sustainability while carrying out their social mission. They often have local experience and organizational capacity, as well as an ability to create and strengthen social capital (e.g. community networks of health service providers), tasks difficult for the state to replicate on a larger scale. (G\u00f3mez-Jauregui 2004) The need for government-NGO partnerships in health has grown, as the sustainability of both is threatened by the perception among many 144 international philanthropic organizations that Mexico is now more developed and no longer merits the aid that was the mainstay in previous decades.29 Official Mexican policy on collaboration with civil society organizations began to develop in 1995. The Institute of Social Development (Instituto de Desarrollo Social, INDESOL) was established in the same year to promote antipoverty programs by linking NGOs and the various government levels (G\u00f3mez-Jauregui 2004). President Vicente Fox's current administration supports government-civil society collaboration to enact social and health policy (c.f. National Plan for Development 2001-2006, Mexican Federal Government 2001). Julio Frenk, Mexico's current Minister of Health, has worked to involve civil society in health-related decision-making. In fact, the NHP 2001-2006 touts itself as the result of broad consultation with civil society conducted in the first half of 2001, in which the government received over 22,000 proposals and opinions via mailboxes in public places, Internet, and state and federal forums set up to tap into the experience of specialists, academics, politicians, and representatives of civil organizations (PAHO 2002). The Community Health Program, an initiative within the NHP 2001-2006, seeks the most successful experiences in community organization for health, and funds (from SSA coffers) promising NGO proposals for municipal-level health projects. The Community Health Program reinforces Municipal Health Committees, which are made of members of civil society and local government, and 29 In 2002, the UNDP calculated Mexico's human development index (HDI) at 0.79, and categorizing the country as falling in the mid-development range. This obscures the fact that the segment of the population in poverty actually grew to 40 million, 18 million of whom live in extreme poverty (PAHO 2002: 5). 145 promote local participation in health promotion and community organization for health (PAHO 2002). A third example of state attempts to involve civil society in health-related policy is the National Women's Health Consortium, in which NGOs were invited to submit project proposals for funding (G\u00f3mez-Jauregui 2004). In Mexico, there is recognition of the utility of civic-government synergy. Herrera (2000) outlines four collaborative dynamics in Mexico that have been taken up by NGOs: \u0001 NGOs bringing successful political pressure to bear on policy or programs which, although not collaboration in a strict sense, is a step in the process of dialogue. \u0001 The involvement of NGOs in government programs and initiatives, e.g. as consultants, doing training or evaluations, lobbying for policies or preparing proposals. (e.g. CISC has carried out workshops and training courses on gender, domestic violence, participatory education, reproductive health, youth rights, etc. to which they invite public health sector personnel) \u0001 Government support for activities that historically have been carried out by NGOs in the absence of relevant public policies and services (i.e. in under-served populations, rural or isolated areas, and in areas that the government has not addressed, such as care for victims of domestic violence, provision of emergency contraception, and legal abortion); and \u0001 Mutual collaboration where both parties establish a formal agreement to undertake joint activities, the nearest to the idea of partnership. This might be an option, for example, when the cost of providing services would be higher if the state did it than if an NGO were to step in and do so. (Herrera 2000) In general, the state has been receptive to NGOs working in health insofar as work: \u0001 strengthens state institutions via the creation of an environment of viable civic commitment to government initiatives; \u0001 increases health coverage by reaching those whom state programs have not been able to reach and attending to needs for which government intervention is limited or non- existent, (e.g. among under-served populations and in isolated geographic areas); \u0001 improves quality of health care; and/or \u0001 reduces the cost of health care provision. (G\u00f3mez-Jauregui 2004) 146 On one hand, that the government seeks civil collaboration implies that it recognizes its own limitations in health service provision and quality of care. On another, however, the state has realized that including all sectors of society in the pursuit of health can spread the burden, produce a stronger country, and support its campaign to portray its efforts to effect the \"democratization of health,\" to promote \"structured pluralism,\" and medicine.\" The following quotes exemplify: \u0001 \"Good health is a goal of development and indispensable for attaining true equality of opportunities.\" (Seguro Popular website) \u0001 Health, along with education, is a central component of human capital, the most important resource of individuals and of nations. Improving health...means strengthening the ability of the individual and society to make a living.\" (Seguro Popular website) \u0001 \"Given the its value and strategic potential, health must no longer be seen as a specific sector of public administration, but rather should be considered a social goal that all sectors can and should pursue; thus, health policy must be complemented by healthy policy.\" (Seguro Popular website) \u0001 \"Health protection is a value shared by all societies, all ideological systems and all political organizations. Good health is a value that will strengthen the bonds of our society.\" (Seguro Popular website) \u0001 \"[Mexican health system reform should] constitute an example of a virtuous circle that exists in the generation of information and evidence at the national and international level.\" (Frenk et al. 2004b: 11). In short, Mexican civil society is interested in improving health and the Mexican government seeks the participation of civil society in doing so. 2. Civil society involvement in health care in Chiapas Within this general context of increasing role of civil society in health, the state of Chiapas stands out as a hotbed of civic engagement inspired by its history of geographic, social, and economic marginalization. The region has been a long-term seat of distrust of government and civil dissent, receiving its widest recognition following the 1994 147 Zapatista uprising. This series of events drew international attention to issues of human rights - including health - in Chiapas, soon followed by an influx of funds and human resources to support civil organization.30 This is not to say that health issues were previously unrecognized and unaddressed via civil society organization; on the contrary, organizations had already showed commitment to promoting well-being among Guatemalan refugees, among the state's multiple indigenous communities, and among women. It is to this existing foundation of civil organization that the Zapatista conflict spurred a heightened awareness of health issues and needs, as well as a boost of exposure, encouragement, and economic support (albeit with an injection of paternalism, factionalism, and surveillance). In Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, civil societies have worked on domestic violence, alcoholism, HIV, maternal mortality, adolescent sexual and reproductive health, etc. In terms of elder well- being, however, the only local non-government elder care initiative that I heard of was the Coraz\u00f3n Sagrada retirement home. While this may be the sole elder health effort in Comit\u00e1n, the Home's board of directors hopes to ally their organization with national and international organizations touting parallel missions, such as the Iberamerican Older Adult Association Network (Association Red Iberoamericana de Asociaciones de Adultos Mayores, RIAAM). 30 For example, SiPaz (the International Service for Peace) was formed in 1995 to monitor the Zapatista conflict in Chiapas via international observation. Today, SiPaz aims to promote communication and exchange between peace-promoting organizations and networks at the local, national, regional, and international levels. 148 Reflections on Chapter 3 The literature regarding elder health and care in Mexico and in Chiapas forces a reassessment of common assumptions about elder health and care. It is often advocated that elder care focus on chronic, non-infectious disease, as there is a belief that infectious disease has been resolved. Yet, in Chiapas, infectious disease persists and reinforces non-infectious disease. The health care system therefore needs to address prevention and treatment of both. (Ham-Chande 1996. See also Dur\u00e1n-Arenas et al. 1996, Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005, Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998) Health policy makers often focus on medical intervention for the currently elderly. However, a host of non-medical factors cause, compound, and result from elders' ill- health burden. In reality, Health in old age is a reflection of intervening factors throughout life, from uncontrollable factors such as genetic inheritance, to socioeconomic conditions like opportunities for education and work, to personal participation in health habits and life style.... This pathological process results in conditions of chronic morbidity, disability, and death that commonly have arisen in early years and are not manifest until old age. (Ham-Chande 1996: 416) Attention to social factors throughout the life course is needed, as well. Gender relations are key. While the feminization of aging is accepted as a global reality, in Chiapas, men outlive women. Further, elder women in Chiapas seem to be at a disadvantage in terms of health status as well as longevity. 149 When thinking of solutions, the state and family come to mind. At first glance, it seems as though the Mexican government provides adequate health care for elders, yet closer scrutiny reveals that this is far from the case. In general, the Mexican health care system actually affords much less coverage and access than claimed, especially in rural areas and for indigenous people, but also for those who are not formally employed and those who have exceeded their child-bearing years. It is also assumed - or hoped - that Mexican elders can count on their families for sufficient home-based care, yet in reality this safety net is precarious. Given the limitations of the health systems, the majority of the burden and cost of disability and illness in old age may fall on the shoulders of the family. This includes both material costs, and also suffering and emotional burden of illness and socioeconomic disadvantages that influence the quality of life of elders and their family and social environment. Propitious engagement of Mexican civil society has opened a window of opportunity in which to promote civic and state engagement and collaboration focused on this nascent issue. With formative research, assumptions about the community and its participation in promoting elder well-being can be reevaluated and accurate insight applied to addressing the problem. The project I initiated in Comit\u00e1n, Chiapas, Mexico is a case in point. 150 CHAPTER 4. ENGAGING LOCAL PEOPLE VIA THE FIRST ENCUENTRO ON ELDER HEALTH AND CARE IN COMIT\u00c1N Overview of Chapter 4 How did this national health and care dynamic manifest itself locally - in Chiapas, in Do\u00f1a Cristina's world? Finding no answer in the library, I turned to another (re)source: accumulated research experience and personal insight among my colleagues at CISC. I engaged them in conversation and enlisted them in a review of the Center's research, which revealed a fruitful collection of issues relevant to understanding and addressing local elder health and care challenges. By bringing the topic to CISC's table, I aroused their interest and secured the Center's support for a more formal examination of elder well-being in Comit\u00e1n. In keeping with CISC's social mission, my training, and our shared commitment to participatory problem-solving, we aspired to both inform and become informed about local dialogue on elder health and care. I drew on CISC's operational support and institutional stamp of approval in organizing a First Encounter on Elder Health. Participants included elders residing in Comit\u00e1n, personnel from health and social institutions, local researchers, and representatives from the region's radio and print media. At this forum, or Encuentro, I fulfilled various goals. First, participants identified research issues that they deemed useful and urgent. Second, I inspired attendees to voice initiatives for subsequent action. Third, I solidified individual and institutional collaboration in ongoing research. Their recommendations included creating a directory of the disparate individuals and institutions involved in elder health care, forming an elder health working group, and conducting an initial assessment of elder 151 health and care in Comit\u00e1n. In this way, interaction at CISC and at the Encuentro engaged various groups of stakeholders - elders, service providers, government institutions, NGOs, researchers, and the media - in a shared exploration of local elder health and care. By evaluating and monitoring this process in real time, I hoped to enrich an understanding of stakeholders' responses to the research and interventions and elicit corrective feedback, enabling midcourse correction. Evaluation also entailed being aware of how knowledge about aging and health is produced, distributed, and represented among public, institutional, and political audiences. From the very start, I spent some time standing back and taking stock of activities in order to determine whether changes in the process would better forge long-lasting engagement and effect long-term change. I was particularly sensitive to anticipating where issues of power could hinder the process, so that I could encourage participation while avoiding its dangers. Sensitivity to these issues entailed my own self-critical awareness and commitment to amend dominant or disrespectful behavior. A crucial instance of this monitoring and mid-course correction arose just days after the Encuentro when I analyzed newspaper articles on the event. I describe this evaluation and mid-course correction process below. 152 A. Engaging CISC in a conversation on elder well-being Finding that national trends in state and family elder care dynamics did not bode well for Mexican elders, I wondered how these dynamics were played out in Chiapas. I turned first to a few colleagues at CISC, with whom I began a conversation that became instrumental in sparking reflection and awareness of elder well-being within CISC as a whole. I shared what I had gleaned about national tendencies and drew upon the aging and death of our grandparents, parents, neighbors, friends, patients, and coworkers. We had all shared the thought-provoking experience of the life, illness, and cancer-related death of CISC's co-founder and first director, David Halperin, and had vowed to continue his legacy of research. Figure 4.1, Photo, CISC personnel by D\u00eda de los Muertos altar. 153 My question for my colleagues was: what has happened to older adults right here around us as they age and face health problems? In addition to our personal stories, do we have any data about this? My colleagues began to think. It helped that CISC's 15-year anniversary prompted a thoughtful review of its efforts in the region in order to create an institutional fact sheet describing the Center's vision, mission, capacities, thematic expertise, and services. We were already conducting an informal inventory of projects, resources, and lessons to date. This exercise drew on our collective consciousness regarding insight accumulated over years of work among local populations. In response to my probing elder health and care, my coworkers also suggested reviewing CISC's previous research - transcriptions to published papers and everything in between - and the Center's library materials with elder well-being in mind. 1. Reviewing CISC's research and library resources to glean ideas While CISC's numerous achievements and thematic foci featured attention to vulnerable groups, definition of informant groups by age, and analysis of family relations and health care, elder well-being was at once an unaddressed and subtly pervasive theme. In reflecting on work aimed at other issues, we realized that we had heard, time and again, about health problems among older adults. We could even begin to categorize these comments as suggesting specific elder health and care issues. The following quotes, reconstructed from testimonies of older female CISC research participants, exemplify the types of elder health issues that came to mind. 154 The underlined issues are simply place-markers, referring to just one of the multiple layers of problems suggested in each quote. Chronic health problems \"It started years ago, this itchy, pussy [vaginal] dripping. It never stopped. Sometimes it runs down my legs. All I can do is bathe and bathe and scratch and scratch. I have tried everything, so many medicines. So many doctors. I lost hope in them a long time ago.\" (Informant from a reproductive health study) Repercussions of reproductive health practices \"When I was young, I didn't want to take those birth control pills. They pile up in your stomach. They make a big lump, and the lump turns into cancer. But then we have so many children that we get tired and our body ends up very weak.\" (Informant from a reproductive health study) Alcohol consumption, couple relations, and mental health \"My husband used to come home drunk. He would throw the food I served him and shout mean things. But my parents said it was my cross to bear. That's how I lived for many years. I have been tranquil since my husband died.\" (Informant from a domestic violence study) Occupational health \"The young men have stronger blood, but those pesticides poison us older people. I can't even be around when it's mixed. The smell sticks in my heart. I get a terrible headache and I get sick. Thank goodness we didn't use pesticides before. If we had, I would have died. We are all farmers, my father, my husband, my children. There would have been no way for me to get out of carrying it.\" (Informant from a pesticide study) Infrastructure limitations and economic context \"I've washed clothes all my life. Ever since I was a girl, I was sent to work for a lady in town. All my life, washing and washing. The water is cold and it gets to my bones. Now I have rheumatism.\" (Informant from a reproductive health study) 155 Family relations and support \"We got married and soon I had my son. We were so happy, yeah.... But I don't know what went wrong with me. I never had any more children. After a while my husband left me for another woman. So I only have my one son.\" (Informant from a reproductive health study) We all noticed that health problems mentioned by elders often stemmed from the cumulative toll of gendered power inequities as well as from the sociocultural environment, as much as they might be problems associated with \"old age.\" On my colleagues' advice, I searched CISC's library (Centro de Documentaci\u00f3n, CEDOC), which is stocked with about 5000 materials (articles, books, posters, CDs, videos, maps, brochures) relating to public health research and intervention, especially that conducted within Chiapas. Pertinent work ranged from documentation on large international studies by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), to work produced by the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Geograf\u00eda e Inform\u00e1tica, INEGI) and the National Population Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Poblaci\u00f3n, CONAPO), to materials authored by CISC and others in the vicinity. Inter-institutional accords with the College of the Southern Border (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, ECOSUR) allowed for consultation of the much more extensive ECOSUR archives, as well. 156 My bibliographical review rapidly highlighted two gaps in information. First, the scant literature about elder well-being in Chiapas (and non-existent references regarding Comit\u00e1n) revealed an absence of organized knowledge of the local elder population, their demographics, lives, health problems, and care resources. At the national level, however, the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) emerged as the key source of data regarding country-level trends and concerns (Palloni, Soldo, Wong 2002, Soldo, Wong, Palloni 2002). Supported by a bi-national coalition of the National Institutes of Health / National Institute on Aging and Mexico's INEGI, MHAS is a nationally representative, prospective study of Mexicans aged 50 and over. The collaborators generously post their instruments and findings on the Internet for public access. At the national level, then, lay doubly useful information: data on elder health and care in Mexico with which to contextualize and contrast local dynamics, as well as data collection instruments providing a starting point from which to shape a locally-relevant data collection technique. The few existing state-level publications hinted at a second gap: gendered disparities in local elder well-being. This \"ah-ha moment\" occurred while culling the census for demographic information on elders in Chiapas. The state's census figures indicated shorter life expectancy for women than men. This anomaly prompted a question: could women in Chiapas be dying earlier than men due to gendered inequities in well-being and care? 157 2. Securing CISC's support At CISC, we reflected on personal experiences, read testimonies from earlier research, and combed the library. In doing so I was able to convert latent interest into active concern about local elder well-being. Rolando Tinoco, CISC's Director, decided that the Center should look below the surface of what was appeared to be an iceberg of suffering and neglect; however, initiating this work posed three challenges to CISC. First, CISC had done no specific research on elder health and care. Researchers had spoken with elders somewhat randomly in the context of other projects, but the Center's efforts had concentrated on adolescents and adults in their childbearing years. There was little locally-based literature on elder well-being from which to gain knowledge, and no other organization or institution within Comit\u00e1n had conducted research on elder well-being. With no blueprint or protocol on which to draw, we would have to develop a line of research from scratch. Second, CISC had no funding for research or intervention on elder well-being. As an NGO, CISC must stay afloat financially, and an unfunded project can be a deadweight. CISC faced the challenge of finding an inexpensive way to look at elder well-being in the short-term, while looking for substantial long-term funding. Tinoco looked to me to address these three challenges, offering in return the Center's infrastructure, knowledge base, human resources, and institutional ties. In this way, my impetus incited CISC's support, and vice versa, and together, we would soon catalyze a larger process of research and action. 158 My task at this point was to jumpstart two interwoven processes. On one hand, information regarding elder health and care would have to be obtained, analyzed, and applied. On the other, local stakeholders would have to become actively engaged in the process. Exemplifying a key aspect of formative research, these two components are iterative: information is needed to recruit stakeholders, their participation is vital in obtaining data and using it to produce change. 159 B. Engaging other stakeholders via the First Encounter on Elder Health 1. Encuentro organization An early task in this formative research process was to identify relevant stakeholders - groups who cause, experience, or react to the problem. My experience at CISC allowed me to identify at least six initial groups of stakeholders, i.e. potential collaborator- beneficiaries. These groups were: 1) elders, 2) home-based elder caregivers, 3) formal elder care providers, 4) local policymakers, 5) local researchers, and 6) the media. Next, I had to engage these stakeholders in conversation to become informed about what people do, say, and think about elder well-being. CISC Director, Rolando Tinoco, proposed hosting a small meeting in which local organizations and independent guests would be offered an opportunity in which to reflect on this theme. To encourage dialogue and acknowledge CISC's novice status with the topic, I conceptualized the meeting as a first encounter, or \"encuentro,\" on elder health. Drawing on their knowledge of services provided and previous collaboration with CISC, my colleagues helped me to draw up a core list of institutions and individuals to invite. I would invite a few representatives from each group of stakeholders mentioned above. At this point, I ran into the first misunderstanding caused by this project's ambiguous status as an unfunded yet priority project at CISC. CISC had recently invested in a poster printer and Rolando Tinoco suggested that we take advantage of this printer to produce \"some\" posters for the upcoming Encuentro. He also spent hours of his non-existent free 160 time exercising his graphic design skills to create a few appropriate designs. We then selected content, color, images, and layout, and he readied the poster file for printing. Even as owners of the printer, however, ink and paper for each poster produced are expensive. Knowing that I had no funds for this projects, I asked him for just 3 or 4 copies to place on the walls in and around the meeting site on the day of the Encuentro. When I got to CISC the next day, there were a few dozen posters on my desk. I had not requested or authorized so many copies. How would I pay for them? Beyond clarifying that CISC as donating the posters, Rolando Tinoco expressed his offense at my question. Did I not like his design? Did I doubt CISC's support for the project? Did I not understand the value of visual means to publicize both the event and the issues? Did I not know enough recipients and spaces for the posters? In his questions, he reasserted the Center's commitment to exploring elder well-being and called attention to CISC's extensive experience in engaging local people in health research and intervention. Figure 4.2, Photo, Encuentro poster in a local clinic. 161 So, when I made personal visits to extend invitations, I brought each invitee a poster or two. These were soon on display in offices and hallways, waiting rooms and exterior windows. They remained on display until well after the Encuentro. Rolando Tinoco was right - our posters were a hit, and on display fulfilled the combined function of artwork and manifesto. The recipients of the posters and accompanying invitations were pleased. They responded with piqued interest, recommending others who should be included and a desire to do more than \"sit around and listen.\" With this effervescent enthusiasm, what I had envisioned as an intimate meeting grew into a larger conference, an event. However, to ensure a conversational format, I specified that only two people per institution should attend and I did not advertise the event to the general public. Beyond program directors, I encouraged participation by those responsible for implementing services - from nurses to social workers to physicians to administrators - as well as elders and home-based caregivers. To avoid distinguishing \"guest speakers\" or \"experts,\" each participant was offered a chance to speak. Rather than placing speakers in slots on a predetermined agenda, each chose his/her own topic. I opted to hold the Encuentro in a conference room in Comit\u00e1n's colonial Cultural Center (Casa de la Cultura), an institutionally-neutral yet central and valued community space. The long windows lining the exterior wall of the room looked down over the street to the main square, while the doors in the opposite wall opened onto a landscaped inner courtyard. By the time chairs were positioned in a semi-circle, projectors readied, coffee 162 brewed, and a welcome table set up with sign-in sheet and name tags, participants began to arrive. Figure 4.3, Photo, Namino Glanz welcoming Encuentro participants. More than 30 people took part in the event, including representatives of a dozen institutions (government and non-government) interested in health among older adults: \u0001 Federal Secretary of Social Development (SEDESOL Federal) Mexican Social Security Institute - Opportunities Program, Border Region (Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social [IMSS]-Oportunidades Regi\u00f3n (Hospital (Instituto de Desarrollo Humano, IDH) \u0001 Municipal Integral Family Development (DIF Municipal) 163 Also participating were representatives from three research organizations: \u0001 College of the Southern Border (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, ECOSUR) \u0001 Indigenous Studies Institute of the Autonomous University of Chiapas (Instituto de Estudios Ind\u00edgenas de la Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Chiapas, Salud de Comit\u00e1n, CISC) Elders, home-based caregivers, and radio and newspaper reporters made up the rest of the group. Figure 4.4, Photo, elder at Encuentro. Figure 4.5, Photo, elder at Encuentro. The Encuentro ran from 10am to 2pm on a weekday. Most attendees directed institutions or headed elder-related programs within them. Their time commitment speaks to their interest in elder care. Also present were elders from the local retirement home31, including Ms. Grandma Comit\u00e1n 2004, and a few people who wandered in after seeing 31 For want of a better descriptor. This facility is described in Chapter 9. 164 posters in the entrance. I had contacted local media prior to the event. A brief press release was broadcast on a local radio station that morning. Reporters from two local newspapers and two magazines stayed for the duration and published front-page stories in the days following. One reporter asked me on his way out why the event was not open to the public, asserting that had it been, \"the soccer stadium wouldn't be big enough to hold everyone!\" CISC's institutional endorsement truly facilitated assembling this insightful and powerful group. CISC also provided material support (posters, programs, etc.) and human resources (to welcome participants, run projectors, facilitate discussion, take notes, videotape, and photographs). On invitations, posters, and programs, the event was entitled, \"First encounter: Health and well-being among people of the third age.\" The stated goal was to establish a local space for dialogue, in which to initiate exchange of experiences and ideas to promote research and intervention for improving well-being among older adults in Comit\u00e1n. I asked that those who wanted to make a presentation submit the title of their brief (ten- minute) talks beforehand. This enabled me to order the talks and to develop an event program. The talks fell into three thematic blocks, consisting of four to seven presentations each: \u0001 regional contextualization of health and well-being among older adults, \u0001 experiences in promoting the health and social well-being of older adults in Comit\u00e1n, and \u0001 crucial aspects of health and well-being among older adults. 165 Figure 4.6, Photo, Encuentro presentation. Figure 4.7, Photo, Encuentro debate. Most arrived with PowerPoint presentations and/or photographs of their institutions, work, and beneficiaries. All were well organized, insightful, and articulate, and, unlike many Mexican conferences, no one read their paper verbatim. I asked attendees to moderate each of the three blocks. The moderators (from the retirement home, a government clinic, and the Department of Health, respectively) were charged with introducing the speakers, limiting speakers' time, and facilitating ensuing discussion. This dynamic may have helped to diffuse authority, such that no one institution (including CISC) was featured more prominently than another. It also motivated participants to introduce themselves. Despite common interests and beneficiary population, many had never met and even fewer had worked together. Through moderated sessions, follow-up discussion, and chatting over coffee, participants got to know each other. 166 Presentations were followed by discussion and brainstorming (described below). The Encuentro ended with distribution of certificates of participation and applause. More than a display of courtesy, this document symbolizes professional recognition, bolsters CVs, and legitimates absence from the office. Most participants would likely add this certificate to hundreds of others, yet it was important enough to inspire one participant to request a reprint due to a change in her professional title and another to request an additional certificate for himself, as he had attended in representation of his supervisor whose name appeared on the diploma. Figure 4.8, Photo, elders at Encuentro. Figure 4.9, Photo, elders at Encuentro. 2. Identifying useful and urgent research issues One of the objectives of the Encuentro was to identify and define - from multiple perspectives - problems to be solved and related obstacles in personal, household, community, and institutional contexts. By way of presentations, questions, comments, and suggestions, participants brought up issues they considered pressing, interesting, and 167 practical. They identified lack of up-to-date, systematized local knowledge as an urgent problem they wanted to address. They emphasized that no one could provide: \u0001 An overview of elders in this particular sociocultural context, including demographics, social relations, daily lives, work, support, and other characteristics shaping health \u0001 A comprehensive review of elder health status in the local population (especially the uninsured population), including common chronic disease, acute health problems, symptoms, risk factors, and functional difficulties \u0001 An inventory and characterization of local elder formal and home-based health care resources, strengths, and limitations \u0001 An account of local elder health trajectories and turning points, i.e. what people do when they become ill, who supports them, which moments are critical, where they seek help and why Participants wanted local information. Health providers, for instance, underscored that the health status of each context is unique. The physical therapist from the IDH observed, I was on commission for two months in San Crist\u00f3bal at the Highland Region IDH. More people show up there. In San Crist\u00f3bal there are other types of problems, more fractures, lumbagos, dislocations, muscular-skeletal troubles. In Comit\u00e1n, we see more facial paralysis and repercussions of high blood pressure. We need to know what is going on here. Further, the consensus was that, although there were many care-related issues to resolve, while these gaps in contextual knowledge remained unaddressed, any efforts to remedy problems would be ill-advised and insufficient. 3. Inspiring initiatives for subsequent action The Encuentro provided a momentary space for discussion outside institutional walls and in the company of a diverse group of people. In their brief presentations, participants offered a panorama of concrete local experiences in facing elder health problems and 168 seeking quality health care. At the same time, the discussion provided an outlet for frustrations. Everyone faced challenges of limited time, resources, knowledge, and support. For some, the Encuentro may have been the first sanctioned opportunity they had to vent their frustrations regarding elder health and care in a supportive environment. In a few instances, care providers confessed to institutional shortcomings, although they qualified these critiques by referencing the challenges of the work. Up to this point, I had initiated all the action, but at the Encuentro, local stakeholders began to propose action, evaluate options, and embrace initiatives. A \"shower of ideas,\" or lluvia de ideas, at the end of the Encuentro promoted organized reflection on possible next steps and potential collaborators. I facilitated the discussion, which began with observations about the Encuentro presentations, and then my question, \"So what?\" The unanimous answer took the form of a second question, \"What next?\" Everyone firmly rejected the possibility of walking out the door that afternoon and dropping the ball. Various participants likened the Encuentro to a spark and insisted that it should not die out but rather be taken advantage of. This was followed by some lively brainstorming regarding strategies ranging from \"baby steps\" to \"dreaming big.\" These included (in no particular order): \u0001 Get to know each other and each other's challenges, strengths, and resources. \u0001 Educate ourselves, in order to \"speak the same language\" and use the same concepts. \u0001 Assemble the papers presented at this first Encuentro on a CD, and provide each participant with a copy to support their future work. \u0001 Revive any previous proposals regarding elder well-being that never came to fruition due to lack of funds or interest. \u0001 Form a committee and share already-developed models, in order to develop a care model for the region and even the state. 169 \u0001 Open this forum to the local officials and to the general public, with the goal of sensitization in social and biomedical aspects. \u0001 Devise a plan of action involving individuals in government and private spaces. \u0001 Address the frequent problems of lack of resources and follow-up by promoting participation of city officials. \u0001 Share more findings of local research and promote research in each institution. \u0001 Form an inter-institutional group to promote elder well-being. \u0001 Meet again in two months, while thinking about proposals for the organizations and goals of such a group. \u0001 \u0001 Figure 4.10, Photo, Encuentro, CISC colleague posting emerging ideas. 4. Securing collaboration with individuals and institutions The Encuentro reinforced a consciousness of CISC's commitment to participatory, community-based initiatives. Participants clarified the extent of their interest in further participation in this project. I asked people to indicate whether they were willing to talk with me one-on-one about their experiences, whether they would be interested and able to meet again in a group setting, what types of commitments they might consider making regarding next steps. 170 The Encuentro also provided the opportunity for participants to forge and rekindle interpersonal and inter-institutional relationships along the focal point of elder health and care. Some participants had not met each other prior to the meeting. This was especially surprising among care providers who worked in this same small town. Notwithstanding their brief interaction, a few formed accords about future work. Some providers had already worked together on other topics, but had never joined forces on along this axis. This negotiation occurred publicly during the final discussion and in hushed voices by the coffee pot in the back of the room. In sum, the Encuentro was both a source of information and a means of engaging professionals and some of the lay public with the topic, the project, and each other. The meeting inspired a critical mass of shared momentum to promote future participation in education, research, and intervention efforts to advance elder well-being. Participants, in addition to their role in the research, were also Comit\u00e1n residents, informal leaders, and relatives of elders, some elders themselves. This helped locate the project within the local context. 171 Figure 4.11, Photo, Encuentro: \"What are the problems?\" Figure 4.13, Photo, Encuentro: \"what next?\" Among the concrete research-related achievements were the foundation of the research focus, aims, and initial method (survey); an awareness of contextual factors that might impede or promote research and intervention; as well as agreements with local partners regarding future participation. The Encuentro facilitated participation and vice versa because both depend on building trust and listening actively with the goal of understanding participants' perspectives. The dynamic allowed for the evolution of new questions and lines of questions based on continually emerging insight. So, we learned about stakeholders' priorities and how to be responsive to these needs. The Encuentro 172 followed CISC's traditions of focusing on strengths rather than deficits, drawing on local knowledge, emphasizing building partnerships, approaching problem-solving from a critical perspective, and facilitating collaboration with and among other local organizations. Starting with local collaboration from the outset of the project, even before the local methods were developed, helped inspire trust, ownership, and ensure that questions asked and methods used to answer them were congruent with local - not just my - interests, needs, and priorities. I sought to establish rapport early in the process, and the Encuentro - from planning to fruition - was an ideal means of expressing respect, patience, and interest in people's words and actions. 173 C. Monitoring & mid-course correction By evaluating and monitoring this process in real time, I hoped to enrich an understanding of stakeholders' responses to the research and interventions and elicit corrective feedback, enabling midcourse correction. Evaluation also entailed being aware of how knowledge about aging and health is produced, distributed, and represented among public, institutional, and political audiences. From the very start, I spent some time standing back and taking stock of activities in order to determine whether changes in the process would better forge long-lasting engagement and effect long-term change. I was particularly sensitive to anticipating where issues of power could hinder the process, so that I could encourage participation while avoiding its dangers. Sensitivity to these issues entailed my own self-critical awareness and commitment to amend dominant or disrespectful behavior. A crucial instance of this monitoring and mid-course correction arose just days after the Encuentro when I analyzed newspaper articles on the event, an exercise of critical reflection on my role and how people perceived it. Popular media influences how health issues are framed, the way people view these issues, and their response to issues in terms of implementing policies and changing behaviors. Media write-ups simultaneously provide stakeholders and the general public with information, evidence and encourage local buy-in. I reviewed the various newspaper and magazine articles published (some appear below) regarding the Encuentro to glean insight on how the event was framed and which facets of the issue were being embraced. For example, one report focused on elder women's health, linking the Encuentro with 174 International Women's Day (a link we had not featured prominently). This spurred later emphasis all elders, not just women, and underscoring contrasts between elder women and younger women. The newspapers featured the Encuentro as good news, for example contrasting it with surrounding articles and headlines about teachers on strike and poor security. Another paper located the article next to a piece maintaining that, \"health is a priority for the local government.\" Perhaps editors perceived the Encuentro as a critique of the government so that the paper felt the need to re-assert the state's good intentions. Two pieces highlighted CISC's role in facilitating the Encuentro far beyond contributions of other participating institutions. This prompted me to consider that future events might be hosted by another organization and that CISC's role could be much less prominent. To my horror, two newspapers featured photographs of me, producing an impression opposite to that I wished to encourage. One had also mistaken me as the CISC's director. I realized that my place in the project was portrayed much too prominently. My role would have to shift, and this would have to be evidenced publicly. My transition from dominating the headlines to nearly invisible facilitator is described in Chapter 10. 175 Figure 4.14, Newspaper. (Headline: \"CISC concerned about care for the third age\".) 176 Figure 4.15, Newspaper. (Headline: \"CISC and the celebration of International Women's Day.\" 177 Figure 4.16, Newspaper. (Red headline: \"Support for women of the third age.\") 178 Figure 4.17, Newspaper. (Headline: \"First encounter on health and well-being in people of the Third Age organized by the Comit\u00e1n Center for Health Research.\") 179 Reflections on Chapter 4 The activities I describe in this chapter exemplify various stages of the formative research model. The combination of informal conversations at CISC, review of testimonies from earlier health research, and dialogue at the Encuentro helped me to become informed about what people do, say, and think about elder health and care with the goal of informing the problem solving process (Stage 1). Further, I identified and defined problems to be addressed and related obstacles from the perspectives of various groups stakeholders, especially CISC and care providers (Stage 2). Participants mentioned challenges faced in the nested personal, household, community, and institutional contexts. In monitoring Encuentro media, I was also attentive to how these activities were presented to the public (Stage 8). This sensitivity allowed me to institute midcourse correction in the form of reframing responsibility and credit for the project. From this very early point in the project, I also found myself problematizing \"community,\" as Encuentro attendees included a few members of the lay public, but were primarily professional stakeholders involved in civil society and governmental health and social services. These stakeholders were from the middle and upper-middle professional class, many of whom came (or returned from university) to Chiapas from other parts of Mexico in the 80s and 90s (see Chapter 1). Although a plural group with a stake in public health in Comit\u00e1n, Encuentro participants were not representative of the Comit\u00e1n public at large, and so could not be equated with \"the community\" of Comit\u00e1n. My next step was to go out and talk with those stakeholders who did not participate in the 180 Encuentro, i.e. elders. Further impetus to do so came from practitioners' comments about the lack of baseline data on elder health problems and care. They wanted what they referred to as a \"diagnostic assessment.\" 181 CHAPTER 5. ELDERS AND CAREGIVERS TALK ABOUT ELDERS' LIVES Overview of Chapter 5 Encuentro participants designated as problematic the lack of baseline information on elders, elder health, and elder health care in Comit\u00e1n. Among providers' initial questions was, \"Who are these elders and what are their lives like that they come to us so late and in such poor health?\" Providers wanted a general description of the elder population in Comit\u00e1n as well as a \"diagnostic assessment\" of their problems and care. Practitioners and clinical directors asserted that such an evaluation would provide trusted evidence of the types and distribution of problems and care. This kind of data, they asserted, was required for legitimating the need for change and for negotiating the nature of such change with their superiors. For instance, one of the participants, a clinical director asserted, \"the results of this survey should provide the evidence needed to strengthen and validate calls for funding.\" CISC, too, contended that this background information would strengthen proposals for funding to do more in-depth work on elder well-being. Participating elders fervently supported getting to know them and their cohort, asserting, \"Yes! You don't know us! No one ever asks us!\" In response to the Encuentro's call for a baseline assessment of community-designated interest areas, I coordinated the design and application of a survey among adults aged 50 and older in Comit\u00e1n. With this instrument, CISC colleagues and I gathered demographic, health, and care data from a purposive sample of 300 elders. We sought basic information on the issues that Encuentro participants had identified as relevant and 182 applicable to their present challenges. We also included questions comparable to those posed in the nationally-representative Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), so that the local state of affairs could be juxtaposed with that of the country, evidencing the urgent need for contextually-appropriate action. This survey yielded quantifiable data allowing me to generate a detailed description of elder health problems and health care strategies in Comit\u00e1n, detailed in Chapters 6 and 7. Most of the problems faced by elders in Comit\u00e1n do not radically differ from those faced by elders elsewhere, the precariousness of local social capital, economic resources, and infrastructure made these ills especially burdensome to live with and challenging to address. Even before analyzing the data, my colleagues and I confronted the survey's shortcomings. Researchers, elders, caregivers, and providers alike agreed that interviews and more ethnographic strategies would compliment conventional measures, and allow elders more voice. I interviewed twenty elders and home-based caregivers (a spouse or close relative). The combination of methods yielded an overview of elders and their lives in Comit\u00e1n, forming the second part of this chapter. Further, I wove insight from interviews with background data from the surveys to reconstruct cases of individuals and couples who illustrate a range of scenarios lived by elders in this context. I inserted these cases in the overview of elders' lives, as well as in my subsequent description of health problems and care strategies. Despite variation between the scenarios, three fundamental threads run through all: 1) the gendered nature of elder health and care, 2) the inadequacy of local elder health care services, and 3) economic vulnerability.183 A. The elder health and care survey Four CISC colleagues joined me on a survey design team. We structured the Encuesta, or survey (see Appendix A), around the following themes: \u0001 Survey information (e.g. informed consent, date, length, participation of other individuals, etc.) \u0001 Demographics (sex, age, place of birth, urban/rural residence, languages, religion, education, marital status, living children, etc.) \u0001 Perceptions of health status (currently and compared to two years ago) \u0001 Spontaneous problem reporting, age of onset, perceived severity, clinical consult \u0001 Hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory illness, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, reproductive health, menopause (diagnosis, management, limitations, controlled or not) \u0001 Falls, vision, hearing, teeth, other symptoms \u0001 Occupational health \u0001 Mental health, autonomy \u0001 Physical activity, weight \u0001 Smoking, drinking \u0001 Health services (service/s sought in hypothetical circumstances and in reality) \u0001 Insurance \u0001 Reasons for not seeking clinical care \u0001 Payment for and decisions about care \u0001 Self-medication and self-care \u0001 Functional limitations and informal care received, by whom, frequency, circumstances \u0001 Informal care that the informant provides for others, to whom, frequency, circumstances \u0001 Help from relatives, friends, domestic servants \u0001 Living situation (number of people in the household, conditions of the home, etc.) \u0001 Economic situation (home and business ownership, paid and unpaid labor, pension, government assistance, bank account, transportation, will) \u0001 Other problems affecting health (family, work, money, etc.) \u0001 Expectations and impressions of entitlement to care and responsibility for their care \u0001 Willingness to continue participating in the research Local stakeholders wondered, in the words of an Encuentro participant, \"How bad are things in Chiapas? I mean compared to the rest of the country. It seems like things are always worse here, but we don't really have the proof, do we? We need to start there.\" In order to produce this \"proof,\" I opted to make some survey sections directly parallel 184 sections of the MHAS. At times, I repeated questions verbatim, to allow for exact comparison with informants' national cohort. For example, both instruments sought rates of certain health problems (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc.). Discussion with elders and providers during and after the Encuentro also motivated me to develop survey questions and sections that had no precedent in the MHAS study. As mentioned, providers requested local rates of morbidity, as they had access to national rates, but could only speculate about local patterns based their own patient loads. Providers were knowledgeable about their own clinical services, but many wondered about home health care for those who were not showing up at the clinics. While trained and equipped to diagnose and medicate for specific diseases, providers were quieter regarding functional limitations, yet elders at the Encuentro both discussed and displayed these physical challenges, requiring assistance to move around the room and requesting that speakers raise their voice. Elders also pointed out the help and care that they provide to others, another topic unexplored in the MHAS. Further, the CISC colleagues with whom I developed the survey were eager to probe specific areas of CISC's expertise and interests as manifest in the elder population. This was the motivation behind inclusion of questions on lingering reproductive health problems, alcohol consumption, and in-home insecticide use, among others. Finally, my own personal interests prompted me to add a few questions that my CISC colleagues, the Encuentro group, and MHAS did not see on their radar, such as assistance by domestic servants and menopausal symptoms and treatment. 185 Beyond choosing content, we refined the survey to make it coherent and acceptable to local elders, as well as a source of useful, reliable, and comparable data. Our debate regarding content, order, wording, and length was extensive and ongoing. The 5-person survey design team drew on piloting of multiple drafts and on insight gained from previous research (e.g. surveys on alcohol consumption and pregnancy), health service provision, bibliographic review, and long-term quotidian interaction with elders in Comit\u00e1n. The team was conscious of the danger of borrowing health evaluation items from instruments aimed at younger adults (until now, CISC's target population), as these items may be irrelevant for elders or acquire different meaning over the life course. For example, among young adults, relevant contraception issues may revolve around method selection and negotiating use; in contrast, elders may be more concerned about repercussions of earlier choices, such as more/fewer children and contraception-induced health problems. We also had to identify and incorporate issues pertinent to elders but not to young adults. Pilot interviews revealed dental health and transportation, for instance, as topics seldom probed among younger adults, but critical among elders because of their enormous impact on health and well-being. Likewise, the team understood that national MHAS questions would often require rewriting to coincide with local conditions and language. My CISC colleagues already knew a lot of the locally pertinent language for framing questions. In some cases, we had to replace words, such as azucar (sugar) for diabetes. In others, we had to add locally-relevant options, like combis (VW busses) as a means of public transport, water supply as a key local 186 infrastructure, and insecticides as a local health risk. We had to be sensitive to Comit\u00e1n's multi-ethnic population, which includes mestizas, Tojolabales, and Central Americans, all largely illiterate. We conducted surveys verbally because of high rates of illiteracy among elders in this context. Still, apparently straight-forward questions sparked heated debate and much revision, as in the following instance. CISC: \"'Have children'? What does that mean?\" One morning, I sat around a table at CISC with three colleagues, reviewing the demographic section of the survey. Each of us had a completed pilot survey in our hands, the details of the survey experience fresh in our mind, and notes scribbled in our notebooks. We had calendared an hour to complete this task and felt that was adequate. After all, these were straight-forward questions, requiring a yes or a no or a one-word response at the most. I read one of the initial questions: \"How many children do you have?\" We each shared the responses we had received: \"You mean living now? Because my oldest son, may he rest in peace, had an accident.\" \"I was pregnant 7 times, but I only had 5 babies.\" \"Including my God-children?\" \"Well, I have 4 of my own, and then I raised my grandson when my daughter had to work.\" We then discussed how, clearly, \"children\" had been interpreted in a number of ways. Our task, then, was to be specific about what we were counting, while respectful of elders' often difficult experiences with pregnancy, birth, and raising children. In a similar exercise of adapting questions to fit the local context, we redrew standards for urban and rural based on local perceptions of Comit\u00e1n as a city. The survey questions had to both \"make sense\" in the local context and be respectful. We attempted to make the survey less burdensome for elders, surveyors, and those conducting data entry in terms of time and topics addressed, while still insuring quality 187 data. For example, we sought flexibility in scheduling interviews, offering to conduct the survey over the course of two visits rather than one (an option few preferred), to meet anytime from early morning to late evening and on weekdays or weekends. We also made sure that elders were comfortable interrupting the survey in order to tend their business, care for children, answer the door, etc. Further, we designed the survey so that entire topics could easily be skipped if they were irrelevant to individuals (e.g. no questions about care for heart attack if they never had one), condensing questions and sections. The survey design team was also sensitive to elders' varying cognitive skills and memory. Nearly all questions were closed, most requesting a \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"I don't know.\" Respondents' abilities to remember events - and even the question- varied. They also had different speaking styles, some preferring monosyllabic answers; others, detailed monologues. The survey had to locate some middle ground, eliciting answers while respecting emerging topics of elder interest. Additionally, while surveys provide good \"snapshots,\" they shed less light on process. We included certain questions to compensate. For instance, we asked informants about health problems over the entire life course, not just at the moment of the survey, and for each illness episode mentioned, we asked informants when it started and whether it was currently under control. Finally, the length and content of the survey inspired initial skepticism. Would people discuss sensitive themes, such as \"private\" health concerns (e.g. urinary incontinence) 188 and personal finances (e.g. home ownership, bank account)? Would elders be reluctant or unable to sit and talk for the time required to complete the survey? Because the survey was developed by a team with multiple interests, the final survey was a hefty 26-pages, with 339 possible questions. This translated into a an average time of around 35 minutes. Piloting proved that people would respond, and do so in one sitting. Four circumstances made this possible. First, our design drew heavily on expertise of colleagues who had done local research on other sensitive topics, including domestic violence, alcoholism, sexually transmitted infections, and teen sexuality. Second, elders were extremely interested in discussing their health. Third, previous local research efforts conducted by CISC (e.g. maternal mortality surveys), INEGI (e.g. population censuses), and the Ministry of Health (e.g. registration campaigns for Popular Insurance) may have familiarized people with the survey dynamic. Finally, many people recognized CISC as a long-standing and trustworthy presence in Comit\u00e1n. My colleagues, upon introducing themselves as affiliated with CISC, were welcomed. Employing community- based staff was key. Their experience with research, the health care system, and community mores were helpful. With my seven-year residence in Comit\u00e1n, I was the newest arrival, yet this fact seemed to inspire in elders the desire and willingness to tell me about life in Comit\u00e1n, life as an elder, life as a Chiapaneco, life as a poor person. We piloted various drafts of the surveys. We began by applying it to each other, and then to colleagues, followed by elder acquaintances, and eventually, elders who we did not know. Piloting was important not only to gain quality data, but also for surveyors' self-189 confidence in our research roles. I spent a hefty chunk of time designing a user-friendly format in Microsoft Access for real-time data entry via portable laptop. Pilot surveys, however, revealed printed format as easier for the surveyor and more comfortable for informants. I worked with the other surveyors to establish accords regarding what we would say beyond reading questions. I prepared survey packets, each consisting of informed consent documents, survey, separate sheet of identifying information, and map. Pencils, clipboards, CISC brochures, referral information (in case of urgent medical problems, etc.), and CISC identification cards were readied as well. Finally, we developed procedures to contact potential informants and to obtain an optimal sample. To coincide with the MHAS study age cut-off, we sought a sample of adults aged fifty and over living within Comit\u00e1n, stratified by age cohort, gender, and neighborhood. The most recent census (2000) reported a total population in Comit\u00e1n of 105,210, of whom 12,570 were aged 50 and older, translating into a reliable sample size of 280 individuals. Recruitment was so successful that 300 elders were surveyed in all. The purposive survey sample (N=300) was designed such that 5-year sex-specific age cohorts (women aged 50-54, men aged 50-54, women aged 55-59, men aged 55-59, etc.) would be representative of municipal proportions as reported in the most recent population census. In all, 54% of the survey participants were women, 46% were men. The mean age was 64 years old. The oldest informant was a 104-year old man. In a few cases, elders were not aware of their exact age, and a collective effort ensued to triangulate estimations on the basis of their children's ages. Some people looked much 190 younger than their age, while the years had been harsher on others. As in any city, Comit\u00e1n has more and less affluent neighborhoods and streets. In response, we made an effort to include participants from 40 different neighborhoods forming urban Comit\u00e1n, drawing equal numbers from each of the four geographic quadrants of the city (NE, NW, SW, SE of the central park). Depending on neighborhood size, 6 to 10 elders were surveyed in each. In addition to surveying the historic center and long-established barrios, we also surveyed the vibrant and swelling urban perimeter. Participation was completely voluntary. Recruitment was conducted largely via door-to- door canvassing, except in the cases of people who suggested that we interview a relative, neighbor, or friend, and in those cases when people walked up and asked to participate, which happened more than I had anticipated. To contact informants, the surveyor approached the first building on the street, be this a residence and/or a business. If someone was present who qualified in terms of age and sex, and was willing to participate, the survey was conducted. The surveyor then repeated the process three buildings down the street. At times, it took knocking at 10 or 12 doors to find a qualifying participant, while on other occasions informants were identified one right after another. Very few who met the criteria turned down the invitation to participate; in these cases, work was the most frequently cited obstacle to participating. In some cases, informants opted to set up an appointment for at a later time or date, but the great majority were conducted on the spot. All were given the option of discontinuing the survey at any time and for any reason, and either continuing at a later time or ceasing to 191 participate entirely. Only one person elected to discontinue the survey once started. The man, plagued by health problems, explained that without the concrete promise of assistance, it was not to his advantage to participate. We opted against offering compensation to participants. For all, the chance to talk seemed to be more than sufficient, and we were often asked to \"visit\" again. Compensation would have altered the nature of the relationship, with participants paid for information rather than investing their experience in the hope of a better future for themselves and their relatives. Surveys were often conducted while standing in the entranceway; some sitting inside homes, patios, yards, or businesses; others sitting on the sidewalk. After describing the survey, we requested informed consent, and then initiated survey questions. (I also obtained consent to take photographs, with the understanding that they would be used in efforts to improve elder health and care in the region, and that subjects would receive a copy of each photo I took.) We completed surveys over the course of six weeks in 2005. I conducted over half of the surveys, while my colleagues from CISC pooled their efforts over the course of three concentrated weeks to complete the other half. We worked morning, noon, and night (7:30 am to 8:30 pm), seven days a week, rain or shine. I set up a data entry strategy, by which two people transferred the data (stripped of identifying information) from surveys into the Microsoft Access format. One read responses, while the other registered them in the computer. Data entry began soon after surveys initiated, so that inconsistencies and 192 misunderstandings could be promptly clarified, and adjustments made to the survey and/or database. After all 300 surveys had been entered, I worked with a colleague to verify every single value in the database against the penciled responses on the paper surveys. The resulting Access database, a more user-friendly program for data entry, was imported into SPSS, a superior statistical analysis program. Further, the data collected in the nationally representative Mexican Health and Aging Survey (MHAS) is available for public use via Internet in SPSS, so that data from our survey and the national survey could be analyzed side-by-side using the same formats, tools, and procedures. Figure 5.1, Photo, Namino surveying an elder. Figure 5.2, Photo, elder, granddaughter. The survey required independence and flexible functioning in the field and teamwork at the same time. We held research team meetings throughout the development, piloting, and conducting of the survey. These meetings served as ongoing training and sensitization regarding issues of concern among both researchers and the elders being 193 surveyed, also emotional support as we experienced very charged interactions with elders. Because of the elders' trust, they were more open about deeply distressing situations of isolation, poverty, and illness. The increased burden on us as researchers, community members, and fellow human beings nevertheless resulted in more rich data. At the start, I supervised a lot and reviewed surveyors' work to ensure quality, debriefing from fieldwork, strategizing for future visits. Sometimes we talked via cell phone from our respective neighborhoods, in a brief debriefing, just to vent. This produced high- quality data and engagement. We also discussed the survey in all wider CISC staff meetings, to keep everyone up-to-date and incorporate suggestions about research design and results. This dynamic also allowed for shared oversight of the process. The survey was posited as - and indeed became - a means of contacting potential elders and informal caretakers for later interviews. Additionally, the survey proved to be an apt tool for eliciting much more open-ended, free-form information. Many informants were eager to discuss their experiences, problems, achievements, predicaments, and doubts. Seemingly straight-forward survey questions prompted detailed responses. Take, for instance, the \"simple\" demographic questions. Asking, \"Where were you born?\" and \"Have you lived more in urban or rural areas?\" elicited discussion regarding places lived, reasons for moving, and memorable qualities of each residence. Likewise, \"Have you ever been married or lived with someone as if you were married?\" prompted chronological accounts of relationships to date. Among women, even a brief response to, \"How many living children do you have?\" tended to include total number of children, 194 number of living children, and sometimes an inventory of children, detailing sex, age, name, residence, occupation, and so on. This pattern continued with health and illness questions. For example, upon asking, \"Has anyone ever told you that you had diabetes?\" some people provided thorough accounts of their experiences. In this way, surveys yielded much more than numbers; informants offered mini-life histories, illness narratives, evaluations of health service quality, etc. Among informants who depended on an informal caretaker, that caretaker was often present for the survey, and actively contributed their own perspectives and insight. Given this willingness to converse, the limiting factor became surveyors' time, rather than informants'. I recorded this type of information from over 100 informants. I later expanded upon notes initially hand-written in survey margins in typed entries. These notes contextualize and are contextualized by accompanying survey responses. 195 B. Interviews with elders and their home-based caregivers Even before analysis of the survey data, my colleagues and I confronted shortcomings of the surveys. The closed questions forced choices between a limited number of options and were posing more questions than answers. It was hard to keep elders \"on track\" in terms of getting through the survey without straying into less structured conversation about what elders felt were key relevant details. We decided that we needed to delve deeper to access and record the experience behind the numbers, the details of elders' lives, work, and care both within clinical settings and at home. This moved us to consider semi-structured interviews and more open-ended dialogue with elders as a means to both gather additional information and to allow elders to voice their concerns. At the initial elder interviews, however, another group of stakeholders made themselves heard: home-based caregivers. By this point, however, my colleagues had begun fieldwork on another project and so could not be recruited to interview. This fell to me, and I interviewed twenty elders and home-based caregivers (a spouse or close relative). Interviews with elders and caregivers came about in three ways. First, during survey visits, some informants expressed their desire to meet again at a later date, such that I scheduled interview visits. Second, I made \"follow-up\" visits to those informants I identified as facing the most precarious situations. Finally, over the course fieldwork in the same and even distant neighborhoods, some hospitable informants and/or their caretakers requested that I return and agreed to be interviewed if I did. I registered 196 content of interviews with elders via hand-written field notes. I oriented these semi- structured interviews with a very loose guide consisting of questions designed to: \u0001 delve more deeply into people's specific health problems \u0001 explore informants' formal and informal health care \u0001 broach the topics of male-female and local-national distinctions in health and health care \u0001 probe people's hopes and expectations in terms of satisfying their health care needs \u0001 brainstorm about community elder health care needs and strategies Mostly, however, my visits were opportunities to let people share what they felt was important. This entailed listening and observing. Elders pulled prescriptions and pill bottles from cabinets and bags. Had I noticed the rash on their hands? Did I want to see their insurance card? The scar on their abdomen? They gestured to the material conditions of their home - the leaky roof, the muddy road, the empty water tank. They introduced me to their relatives, friends, and neighbors. Some joined the conversation, others made me promise to visit them next, still others retreated after a polite salutation. Frequently, we were also accompanied by generations of relatives staring out from photographs on the walls. Elders offered me water, coffee, soda, a chair, shade. Often, the most needy made the most effort to make me comfortable. All this hospitality came while they often continued their work, which I encouraged them to do, so that I would not interrupt their activities. Women washed clothes, cooked, embroidered, gardened, supervised children, tended their stores. Craftsmen continued sanding wood and sewing shoes. Other men helped customers, shoveled dirt, arranged building materials. Others saw my visit as a time to sit quietly and rest. This was a chance to discuss their health problems and detail the challenges of finding adequate, affordable care. I always 197 attempted to be relaxed rather than rushed, to listen rather than talk and ask, and to pay attention to the most quiet, reserved people as well as the dominating talkers. Some of the most quiet survey respondents became quite animated on my subsequent visits. Many informants were familiar with the population censuses and epidemiological studies, and I wanted to offset biases based on these earlier experiences as participants in - literally, objects of - research by treating them as my teachers, neighbors fellow-community members, and respected elders. In moving from surveys to interviews, we attempted to shift from our knowledge, categories and values to those of elders. Despite the fact that local people helped to develop, pilot, and assess the surveys, the survey is a conventional preset method, designed by us around our concerns and categories. We sought to elicit responses to fixed boxes. While convenient for statistical analysis, we essentially forced elders' realities to fit our familiar frame. In contrast, these semi-structured interviews were more open conversations. I had a mental checklist for reference, but not a preset sequence of questions. Our conversations were much more balanced, or unbalanced in favor of the elders. Additionally, the interviews helped shift from measuring to understanding. For the survey, we wanted to know how many and how much, but the interview was about why and how. This type of question can be less threatening than measuring, especially in terms of more private, sensitive topics, such as financial situation, marital relationships, fears, frustrations, and health problems. Elders truly enjoyed chatting about their family, 198 past, livelihood, and health, more than been subjected to a long survey. There was a shift in the nature of the interaction toward enjoyment, equity, and freedom of expression. Partnering in research with multiple community members and using various methods facilitated triangulation of findings from the start. The Encuentro, surveys, and interviews with elders and home-based caregivers allowed for cross-checking and ongoing learning, as well as comparing findings across methods, informants and groups of informants, disciplines, and researchers. We followed up on trends as well as exceptions, contradictions, and anomalies. Rather than pursuing rigor based on measurements, statistical tests, and replicability, we sought trustworthiness. While self- critical awareness was key, group activities (such as meetings and informal conversations) also helped, as individuals each added and amended details in order to develop a complete and accurate account. We began to share findings informally immediately through unplanned discussions and questions in meetings. Our more formal sharing of findings occurred as the research progressed. Sharing preliminary findings was easier with qualitative data, as it was analyzed on an ongoing basis, while final quantitative data analysis had to wait until all the surveys were done. Both informal and formal reporting of findings was important, as this always included an element of interpretation and discussion that I could monitor as an additional source of data. Reporting findings always provokes discussion and the \"so what?\" question, i.e. the implications for action and future research. 199 By weaving together insight from each interview visit with background data from the corresponding survey (both methods based on the Encuentro suggestions), I was able to reconstruct the cases of individuals and couples who illustrate a range of scenarios lived by elders in this context. I have inserted these cases in the following description of health problems and care strategies. As was the Encuentro, the survey and interviews were not only a means of data collection, but also a strategy by which to engage the community in the process. All asked, \"what can I do about my situation?\" Some inquired, \"what will you do to improve the situation?\" At times they referred to me, at times to CISC or the wider community. A few asked hopefully, \" how can I help?\" 200 C. Overview of elders' lives in Comit\u00e1n In this section, I weave insight drawn from the Encuentro, surveys, and interviews to form an overview of the lives of elders in Comit\u00e1n. While the surveys allow me to include statistics and a notion of general trends, narratives and photographs of individual elders provide personal stories. In the course of the overview, I highlight differences between men and women (elaborated on in Chapter 8), as well as contrasts between elders in Comit\u00e1n and their national counterparts. Table 5.1 quantifies some of the basic indicators. Note that the 300 survey participants span a very wide range of ages (from 50 to 105, mean=64, median=62). To better describe how characteristics and behaviors map out over this span of later years, I report the median age (denoted MA=##) of respondents when: a) calculations were possible, and b) the median age for the characteristic or behavior differed by 4 or more years from the median age among those who did not exhibit the trait or those who exhibited a contrasting trait. Because the sample was designed such that 5-year age cohorts would be representative of municipal proportions, the sample - and thus the median ages for sub-samples as well - are weighted toward younger elders. 201 Table 5.1, Basic indicators for survey respondents. % of survey sample Women 54 Men 46 Born in Comit\u00e1n 46 Speaking a Mayan language 8 Elementary school education or less 90 Illiterate 19 Catholic 83 No electricity in home 1 No indoor water faucet in home 18 No refrigerator in home 27 Cook with firewood/charcoal (vs. gas) 17 Television in home 92 Radio in home 88 Telephone in home 52 Ever married 97 Currently married 62 Widowed 22 Separated/divorced 13 2 or fewer living children 22 Living alone or with just one other person 28 Living in own home 74 Having small business or property (e.g. land) 35 Relying on public transportation 55 Owning a car (spouse or self) 12 Working at a steady job in the past year 51 Received pension in past year 11 Received public assistance in past year 24 1. Residence Nearly all the elder informants were born in state, over half of them within the municipality of Comit\u00e1n, with many others starting life in the neighboring townships of Las Margaritas and La Trinitaria (see map in Figure 5.3). Just a handful were born out of 202 state, including one man who fled to Chiapas from war-torn Guatemala in 1982. Almost all had lived in Comit\u00e1n for at least a decade, and many had spent their entire lives there. Only about a quarter had lived most of their lives in rural communities32 smaller than Comit\u00e1n (approximate population 80,000), most within a 20-mile radius of Comit\u00e1n. The majority of recent arrivals to Comit\u00e1n had moved in order to live with adult children after retiring. For example, aging peasant farmers no longer able to manage arduous ranch life in surrounding rural regions settled with an adult child or grandchild in town. In general, women tended to be a bit more sedentary than men, and were more likely than men to have been born and lived most of their lives in or very close to Comit\u00e1n. Figure 5.3, Maps, Mexico, state of Chiapas, Border Region of Chiapas. 32Chiapas has the second largest proportion of rural population in Mexico, with 54.5% of its population residing in localities of fewer than 2,500 inhabitants (INEGI 2000). 203 A handful of informants had lived out of state at one point in their lives. One woman, now 75 years-old (274)33, was born in Comit\u00e1n, went to first grade, and then was sent to work as a domestic servant in Mexico City, where she remained for 25 years. She was an exception, though, as most of those who had lived outside Chiapas were men. For instance, a 70 year-old man (300) had worked on oil rigs in Tabasco, Campeche, and Veracruz and had traveled widely around Mexico. At age 62, he returned to Comit\u00e1n to reside with his daughter. A few men had even ventured to the United States, returning with the trappings of migrant workers: weighty gold chains, large wrist watches, expanded musical taste, and enough money to build a small house in one fell swoop. While these elders returned to Comit\u00e1n for their senescence, I heard of others who had left Comit\u00e1n to live with adult children who could care for them. One man's (300) wife, for example, faced cervical cancer and moved to the state of Campeche so that a daughter could care for her. When elders needed company and care, it was far more common for them to move to a child's home, rather than children moving into the elder's home. In their later years, elders were less likely to travel to far off destinations, and more likely to take day trips and overnight visits to their natal communities and/or immediate family residence(s) in neighboring towns, such as Las Margaritas. In addition to social ties, a few traveled to consult a trusted doctor. Others did so to maintain their ties to the land. 33 References to specific informants specify sex, age, and three-digit identification number (in parenthesis). 204 Figure 5.4, Photo, Tojolabal woman preparing yarn for embroidery. 2. Ethnicity Most informants were mestizo34, with Spanish as their first language (MA=61)35. Speaking a Mayan language may serve as an indicator of ethnicity, with nearly 8% of both the Comit\u00e1n and the national samples doing so (translators facilitated 1% of the surveys in both contexts), with minimal distinction by sex. In Comit\u00e1n, the predominant non-Spanish language is Tojolabal (MA=64). Other languages spoken by informants were Tzeltal and Tzotzil (which are more common in the nearby Chiapas Highlands) and Kanjobal (predominant in Guatemala). Mayan language speaking elders clustered in the northeast quadrant of Comit\u00e1n, closest to the more rural Tojolabal settlement region. Tojolabales account for about 13% of the Border Region's population, and are the most proximal Mayan descent group to Comit\u00e1n, so that it is not surprising to have 34 Mestizo refers to a person of mixed Spanish-indigenous ancestry, also known as ladino, and commonly contrasted with indigena (indigenous), referring to, \"descendants of those who were conquered and subordinated by the Spanish during the period of colonial rule\" (Collier G. 2005: 8). 35 Median age. See note above. In this case, for example, \"(MA=61)\" indicates that the median age of those informants whose first language was Spanish was 61 years. 205 encountered nor inappropriate to have included Tojolabal elders. Some middle-aged Tojolabales still commuted between their homes in Comit\u00e1n and their natal communities in order to continue farming. Elder Tojolabales living in Comit\u00e1n usually stayed with an adult child or grandchild who served as cultural and linguistic go-between. 3. Schooling and literacy \"School?! How could I have gone to school?! There wasn't one! No, not way back then.\" This was a frequent response to probing formal education. Nearly 90% of all the elders we surveyed had not studied beyond elementary school. A full 30% of all informants had never been to school at all (MA=68). Of these, a third were illiterate (MA=67), while the rest had managed to pick up limited reading and writing skills (MA=68). Those who had attended some elementary school but no more tended to be younger (MA=59). A few people admitted that, despite having gone to school for a few years, they still could not read or write. Others learned, albeit late in life. A 79 year-old man (277) had never been to school, but thanks to some patient Jehovah's Witnesses, \"I learned to read the Bible and study God's words.\" A 74 year-old man (233) proudly announced that he finished elementary school at age 48, as his work as a state agricultural inspector required a diploma. Many informants labored to read and sign the study's informed consent form, but did so with pride and determination. In some cases, elders deferred to younger relatives to read the consent form. They often cited the non- existence of schools during their childhood as well as economic pressure to work as 206 obstacles to schooling. Women were frequently required to forgo school in order to care for their parents and to work. Although nearly the same proportion of men and women in Comit\u00e1n had attended primary school, in general, women's education levels were much lower than those of men, with women over-represented in the no education category (literate and illiterate), and men over-represented in all the categories from secondary school up through graduate school. The national sample follows a similar pattern, yet participants in the national sample had more formal education at nearly every level than did their counterparts in Comit\u00e1n. In both contexts, a handful of the informants spoke English; however, in Comit\u00e1n, English-speakers were all men. The case of don Miguel touches on ethnicity, language, schooling, and ties to the land. Don Miguel: \"My heart is still in the country\" Don Miguel (286), 64 years old, sat across his dining room table in his two-story home. I could hear the traffic on the PanAmerican highway a block away. His wife closed the door and handed me a glass bowl of trembling red Jello while he reminisced. Don Miguel was born on a local ranch, his boyhood spent carrying firewood, driving oxen, and cutting sugarcane. Although his first language was Tojolabal, he learned Spanish in school. \"I wasn't a very good student, but I guess I did alright. At least I learned Spanish, because when I got older, I got a job as a bilingual teacher, working at little schools out in the villages.\" Around age 40, don Miguel moved with his wife and children to Comit\u00e1n. He was soon promoted to school superintendent, a position he occupied until his recent retirement. At this point in our conversation, don Miguel paused, took a deep breath, slapped his right hand over his chest, \"But my heart is still in the country!\" He then qualified this with an account of how, whenever possible, he boarded a minibus for a 4-hour stop-and-go trip to his ranch. There, don Miguel supervised hired workers who cultivated myriad vegetables and tropical fruits - \"mango, papaya, coconut, pineapple, sugarcane - everything you can think of!\" He 207 asserted that one advantage of going down to \"hot country\"36 was that his back, kidney, and waist pain, nagging him for 35 years, subsided. He reflected, \"I don't know if it's the work or the climate, but I feel much better when I'm down there.\" 4. Religion Catholicism was the most widely cited religion among the sample, with 83% of elders self-identifying as Catholic (MA=61). The audience at Catholic mass in the numerous churches in Comit\u00e1n is often predominated by older women, many wearing grieving apparel. There is much Protestant proselytizing in and around Comit\u00e1n, and survey data suggests the gradual erosion of Catholicism in the region. Among those elders surveyed, 12% practiced non-Catholic religions, primarily Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses (MA=60). Meetings of these groups seem to draw in more men and youth than does Catholic mass. The remaining 5% maintained that they did not practice a religion (MA=66). There was little difference by sex in religious affiliation. (The national survey does not include information on religious adscription.) Figure 5.5, Photo, Cruz Grande Church. Figure 5.6, Photo, street corner altar. 36 Indeed, \"hot country\" is lower in altitude and much warmer than Comit\u00e1n's higher altitude temperate climate. 208 In Comit\u00e1n, non-Catholics tended to rate the importance of religion in their life as higher than did Catholics. Additionally, women rated religion as very important much more often than did men, a pattern echoed at the national level. It seems, however, that religion may be more important for men in the national sample than for men in Comit\u00e1n, while the high value of religion among women did not differ much between the two contexts. Informants appreciated organized religion as a social and spiritual activity. \"Are you ever happy?\" I asked a very poor 60 year-old woman (024) with no husband or children. She responded, \"I am happy when I go to church.\" Getting to church may be a physical boon, as well. Church is a common walking destination for elders, who sometimes opted to attend services not in neighborhood chapels, but instead larger churches, such as the Santo Domingo Cathedral in the center of town. Many elders also visited Comit\u00e1n's cemetery, which is also a fair hike from the center of town. For some, going to church was a social event, and the church community provided a form of social support. Occasionally, elder women can be seen walking to church together, and people greet each other before and after services. For some, in contrast, religious worship was a more private, individual activity. A few elders narrated how their life experiences shaped their religious inclinations. A 74-year old man (028), for example, described how he had been very active in the Catholic church until the Zapatista conflict, in which the church preached fighting for 209 justice, violence that he concluded had led to much death and suffering. He converted to the Pentecostal church, and reports, \"it changed my life.\" Likewise, religious affiliation influenced daily life. The most profound health-related impact of organized religion seems to be the propensity to curb or stop drinking among men when they shift from Catholicism to Protestantism. Displays of religious fervor in public and private spaces are common. Altars were prominent installations in the homes of some Catholic elders. These were set up in the living room, a bedroom, or even occupied their own room or building. They featured images and elegantly dressed effigies of saints, fresh and imitation flowers, and candles. Other altars are more public, set up along the road, in nooks formed by jutting building corners (spaces that may otherwise attract urination and garbage). Comit\u00e1n's calendar is full of yearly celebrations dedicated to the patron saints of each church. These ferias are week-long public events in which a combination of religious commitment, social life, and commercial venture take over a park and surrounding city blocks. During such events, elders attended mass, bought and sold pickled fruits, strolled around the park, watched grandchildren on the carousel. The Protestant sects also host weekend-long meetings, with live music and inspirational speeches booming from loud speakers over an audience of tambourine-jingling listeners. 210 5. Living conditions In most cases, the condition of homes (size, building material, structural soundness); access to utilities (electricity, piped water, residential fuel); and incidence of amenities (refrigerator, washing machine, telephone) did not vary by sex in Comit\u00e1n. However, the impact of these characteristics on daily living and on health differs immensely by sex due to pronounced gender-based occupational differentiation, a topic discussed in Chapter 8. Most informants lived in cement-block or brick homes. Fewer occupied simpler clapboard structures. Many had corrugated aluminum roofs, although the older homes in the historical neighborhoods had ceramic tile set over wood frame. Homes more recently built by the better-off had concrete roofs. While most could step out their doors onto uneven sidewalks flanking paved streets, some lived on dirt roads, and a few homes were accessible only by winding paths. Neither streets nor sidewalks in Comit\u00e1n are easy to maneuver. Even when not in disrepair, they are multilevel, uneven, and narrow. About a quarter of the elders surveyed lived in homes over one story high, which may be challenging for those who find it difficult to climb stairs. Beyond stair climbing, hill climbing is more relevant in Comit\u00e1n, a city built on an incline and inching its way up surrounding hills. My trip to don Reynaldo's home illustrates. 211 Figure 5.7, Photo, newer home, dirt road. Figure 5.8, Photo, simpler home, paved street. Don Reynaldo: King of the hill One morning, I walked up a paved road that winds around one of the many hills that frames the city. Nearing the top, I noticed a path disappearing through low vegetation down the hillside. I descended, sliding down the rocky path, distracted by a magnificent view of Comit\u00e1n. About 200 yards below my starting point, a small cement-block house was perched on the slope, and looked out over a cement patio that had been shaved out of the hill in rice paddy style. An 80 year- old man (282) sat in a wooden chair, overlooking the city. With a peaceful yet powerful posture, he was a king on a throne pondering his kingdom. A plastic garbage bag caped his shoulders, as his son-in-law cut his hair. Don Reynaldo held court, my questions framed by the snip of the scissors and the rustle of the wind in the trees and the plastic bag. A career farmer, this man had had knee problems - \"the nerves in my leg and knee have become stiff\" - which limited his ability to walk. He used a cane, but refused help from others. How he navigated this hillside eludes me still, but the trek seemed to be well-worth the effort. Home interiors were decorated with calendars, family photographs, posters, houseplants, and local artwork, such as wooden dishes engraved with poetry and dove-shaped clay pots. Even in the homes of the most poor, there was usually a bed, dining table, a few chairs, a television, and perhaps a sewing machine. Nearly everyone had a yard, often with a fruit (limes, pomegranate, avocado) tree or two and sometimes other edible plants growing in the yard or in buckets or planters, such as chilies, chayote, and cilantro. Most homes had a covered porch, serving as a place to sit, protect drying laundry from the rain, 212 and store goods. Some elders had animals they raised for eating and/or selling, including pigs, chickens, turkeys. Chickens were often allowed to roam around the yard and sometimes even wander into homes. For the most part, homes were fairly tidy - floor swept, beds made, dishes washed, clothes hung on the line, open doors allowing air out and sun in. There were exceptions, though. The house a 75 year-old woman (274) shared with her daughter and two young granddaughters was different. More like a burrow deep in the moist soil of a hillside, it was dark and musty. In the common room - serving as entryway, living room, dining room, kitchen - every surface area was piled high with papers, boxes, clothing, toys, dishes, schoolbooks, bags. There was barely enough space for the two of us to sit. I balanced my clipboard on my lap while slapping at mosquitoes that swarmed around my legs, and I could almost feel the mold growing on the windowpanes. Nearly all elders surveyed had electricity in their homes. Bathrooms with drainage (many in a separate outhouse-style building) were the rule; just a handful of informants had latrines. Tempering these amenities, however, is the fact that nearly one fifth (18%) drew their water from outdoor taps. Carrying water can be difficult, and poses an obstacle for washing clothing and dishes, cooking, bathing, and maintaining hygienic home conditions. Even those with washing machines usually have to fill them manually. Many have toilets and latrines that must be manually flushed with a bucket of water. Water shortage is especially a problem for those homes without cisterns or other bulk 213 water storage system, as the water only flows through the pipes now and then. This means transporting water, via any means, from buckets to tanker trucks. It also entails storing water in smaller, often uncovered containers, such as buckets, jugs, and pots. Figure 5.9, Photo, yard with water containers, laundry soap, clothesline, porch. In a way, the question of indoor vs. outdoor faucets is moot because Comit\u00e1n's water supply is eternally limited and often non-existent. The sporadic availability and high tariffs are probably due more to politics than to the water table. The story goes like this: the water company charges too much for water that is often not even supplied; when people do not pay their water bill, the water company cannot pay its electric bill; when the electric bill is not paid, the electric company shuts down the water company's pumps; with the pumps shut down, people do not have water; without water, people refuse to pay the bill; and so on. Other factors also come into play: I lived in one apartment for 4 214 years and rarely got a drop of water through the pipes. I then moved a block downhill from the mayor's house and had so much water that I gave it away. Some of the structures and land inhabited by elders were not very hygienic, safe, or protected. For instance, one 74 year-old woman (013) lived with 5 relatives in a small house built on what seemed to be an easement. An enormous utility pole with a web of electrical wires stood inside the yard. A ditch snaked from the street through the yard and straightened out behind neighboring lots. A few planks over this trench connected the back porch area with a plot where a clothesline was strung. This home was in the lower part of the city, such that the ditch filled with a city-full of runoff and garbage after even a short rain. Another woman and her husband lived in what looked to be a decent cement block and clapboard home, yet said that the yard and then the floor of the house flooded every time it rained. Because of the rainfall and temperate climate, mosquitoes can be a problem in Comit\u00e1n, and 68% of the elders surveyed fought back by using insecticide in their home; 15% used it at least once a week. Use of insecticide at home was much more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Some burned a coil of smoke- producing Raidolito\u00ae inside the house every night to repel mosquitoes. Others used spray. A few associated insecticide use with both economic well-being (e.g. used when you have money) and health problems (e.g. it can cause headache, so bed nets are better). In terms of residential fuel, the financially better-off used gas stoves while the less moneyed (nearly 1 in 5) cooked over firewood or charcoal. Firewood and charcoal are 215 cheaper, in the short run, yet pose transport challenges, while gas company employees heft the gas tanks between yard and supply trunk. Those who cooked with electric stoves tended to be younger (MA=54) than those who used gas stoves (MA=61) and those who cooked over wood or charcoal (MA=65). Nationally, use of gas for cooking is slightly more common, and wood/charcoal slightly less common, than in Comit\u00e1n. Informants made a direct connection between cooking fuel and day-to-day economic situation, making it a good proxy for wealth, explaining, \"When we have money, we buy gas; when we don't, we cook over the fire.\" A few maintained that the distinct flavor of food cooked over charcoal or wood was a motivation for using this more cumbersome method. A 55 year-old man (003) noted that his wife made tortillas daily over a fire, and used the gas stove for cooking other food. A 65-year-old woman (010) preferred to use gas, but said that when there was no money, she used wood, especially to slow-boil her beans, a dietary staple among the poor requiring hours of cooking, and therefore much fuel. Cooking with wood did seem to increase the danger of burns. Elder women (but no men) had been burned while cooking with wood on their knee-high hearths. For example, a 60 year-old woman (022) burned her lip with a log while tending to her aluminum bucket of bubbling black beans. Water heaters (for bathing) were also fueled by gas, wood, or charcoal. (Neither survey probed fuel used for water heaters.) About three quarters of the elders surveyed had a refrigerator. Those who did not have a refrigerator tended to be slightly older (MA=64) than those who did (MA=60). This is less than the rate at the national level. Having a refrigerator, like cooking fuel, may be a 216 reasonable indicator of wealth, while also playing a role in the preservation of food and medication. The climate in Comit\u00e1n is temperate, but does get hot during the spring, increasing chances of spoilage. Just under half of the informants had a washing machine; this is much less than at the national level, where 64% have a washing machine. Those without washers depended on hand washing clothing, a strenuous activity entailing bending over wash basins, outside in the elements, plunging hands into cold water. Additionally, in Comit\u00e1n, many women washed clothes for extra income, standing, backs bent over cement or jury-rigged wash basins in their yards or in employers' yards. Many associated health problems with years of hand-washing clothing. One appliance not included on the survey (in either context) is a sewing machine. Many elder women in Comit\u00e1n had a sewing machine, which they used for personal clothing and household needs as well as in money-making endeavors. Sewing machines were also vital to men who worked leather and upholstery. 6. Communication Radios and tape players are common in Comit\u00e1n, and were present in the homes of 88% of elders surveyed. They broadcast marimba, norte\u00f1os, pop music, and the national anthem twice a day. Even more elders had access to a television, by which even the poorest were exposed to national and international news, soccer games, and soap operas 217 (novellas). There is one local television station, but my impression is that it is not as widely watched as the national networks. Televisions occupied a prominent position in many elders' homes. Some were decorated with lace doilies, silk flowers, and photographs, giving them the aspect of an altar. Television may provide some sort of comfort for elders, ranging from soothing voices to entertainment to white noise. For instance, one 71 year-old woman (027) had 9 living children, had become widowed and had come to live with her son in Comit\u00e1n just 2 years ago. She spent her days alone in the house, which was simple but immaculately clean. When I arrived at the house, which was at the end of a street on the outskirts of town, the television was on (broadcasting a novela) and it remained on during the duration of my stay. Just over half of the informants had a telephone at home. Cellular phones have recently become very common. Some indicated a relative's mobile phone as their \"home\" telephone; obviously, this phone may not always be at their disposal. The rates of radio, television, and telephone at home did not differ significantly by sex. All radio, television, and phone rates in Comit\u00e1n were quite similar to those registered in the national sample. 7. Family and household composition In Comit\u00e1n, nearly all of the informants (men and women) had been married or had lived with someone as if married at some point in their life. However, just 62% were in such a relationship at the time of the study (MA=58). Another 22% were widow(ers) (MA=71) and 13% were separated or divorced (MA=63). There is a perception of many single elders in Comit\u00e1n. The Director of the Casa-Hogar asserted, \"There are so many single 218 people here in Comit\u00e1n, it is extreme, in men and women alike. In all the families there are people, 2 or 3 or a bunch of siblings who never married.\" These figures hide major differences by sex: a) many more men (83%) than women (45%) lived with a partner, b) significantly fewer men (6%) than women (36%) had been widowed, and c) fewer men (9%) than women (17%) were separated/divorced. (National patterns of civil status by sex are very similar to those in Comit\u00e1n; however, the incidence of separated, divorced, and widowed women is slightly higher in Comit\u00e1n than nationally.) These differences may be due to or compounded by the fact that, in most couples, the woman was younger than the man. The age gap was quite pronounced at times, some spouses over 15 years apart in age. Some of these were second marriages. Marital status statistics also obscure contrasts in elders' satisfaction with their status. The range of situations - never married, happily married, married and miserable, widowed or separated and depressed, grateful to be single, etc. - merits further description, and is addressed in Chapter 8. Among the elders surveyed in Comit\u00e1n, the current number of living children ranged from 0 to 12; the mean was 4.5. While over 30% had 6 or more living children, 22% had two children or less (including 4% who had none). These rates did not differ much by sex. At the national level, the mean number of live births was 6.1, surely an overestimate of currently living offspring. The only other bit of comparable information available is that it was more common among informants in Comit\u00e1n than nationally to have no living children. The gendered repercussions of having children are addressed in Chapter 8. 219 Few men had never had children. The sole woman, now 60 years-old, who had never had children also lost her husband due to her (presumed) infertility. A handful of elder women had raised grandchildren, nieces/nephews, or God-children as their own, but most of the God-children relationships did not extend to co-residence, daily interaction, or very regular support. An exception was an elderly woman who raised her grandson; he then translated for her, helped her carry groceries, and kept her company. Figure 5.10, Photo, elder and her grandson. Typical representation of Mexican elders presents them as ensconced in large, extended households. Indeed, over half of the elders surveyed in Comit\u00e1n lived with 2 to 5 other people and a good number lived with 6 or more other residents (see Table 5.2). On the other hand, over a quarter of elders lived alone (MA=50) or with just one other person (MA=65). The mean number of total residents (including the informant) is 2.6, with minimal difference by sex in the number of residents. (Comparable data for the national sample are not available.) Women may have been more prone to this smaller family 220 circle, as they were more likely than their national cohort, and twice as likely as local men, to be living without a partner, widowed, and separated or divorced. Table 5.2, Number of other residents at home. Number of other residents at home % of informants 6 + 16 2-5 55 1 22 0 (elder lives alone) 6 Household members included immediate relatives, extended family, and individuals who paid for room and board. In a few cases, elders were very close with one or two housemates. For instance, a 52 year-old woman (252) was married but lived with her younger sister, who made decisions for her, covered her medical expenses, and even answered survey questions for her. Their unity neared twin sister caliber. Less than 1 in 10 informants lived in residences in which a domestic servant is employed. Beyond helping to cook and clean, few maids assisted in specific elder care tasks, although mere employment of a servant is an indicator of wealth and, in the future, hired help may play an important role in elder care. It is a mistake to assume that living with others ensures elder care, company, and support. Household residents, including adult children, may not spend much time at home, mostly due to work and school. One 80-year old woman, for example, lived with two daughters, but they would get up and to go to work early in the morning and return after dark, leaving her alone at home to do their housework. In general, this data on marital status, living children, and number of residents at home among informants in Comit\u00e1n 221 challenges the notion of elder Mexicans living with large extended families; in fact, many elders are not in a long-term relationship and have few children or other residents around. Some elders made up for this lack of human company with pets. These included dogs, cats, and birds. Women were also overheard talking to their chickens. A 56 year-old woman (246) was chopping tortillas into fine pieces during the interview. When she was depressed (often the case), she fed the birds in her garden. The 104 year-old man (033) brought his dogs along when he made his daily trek to the market. A 98 year-old woman (261) kept a parrot for company, as she lived alone in a hut behind her son's house. 8. Economic situation a. Home In Comit\u00e1n, three quarters of elder informants lived in their own homes (MA=60), most of which were paid off. Homeowners who had not yet paid off tended to be slightly younger (MA=60) than those who had finished paying for their home (MA=60). Fewer people lived in their own homes in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Those who did not own a house either rented (MA=60) or occupied \"lent\" homes (MA=68), usually belonging to an adult child or sibling. Slightly more men than women lived in their own homes, while slightly more women than men rented, a contrast absent in the national sample. In Comit\u00e1n, those who rented generally paid less than $1000 pesos (approx. US$90) per month for rent, but men seemed to pay slightly more than women for rent, possibly indicating that men's rented spaces were nicer than women's. Surprisingly, renters in Comit\u00e1n spent more for their rental home than nationally. 222 A common living arrangement was that of elders living in a house belonging to one of their children. Sometimes the elders paid rent for the building, while in other cases the house was lent without exchange of money. People referred to this situation as, \"living in a borrowed home\" (una casa prestada). A few elders rotated through various children's' homes for lodging and care. One couple (031, 032), for example, was shuffled every few months between the homes of 3 different children around Comit\u00e1n. Often, elders' homes and quarters were not as modern, safe, or equipped with appliances and plumbing as those of their younger relatives. One of ten informants in Comit\u00e1n lived in an untitled house (i.e. property with irregular documents), with little distinction by sex, a phenomenon echoed at the national level. Of those who lived in their own home, men were more likely than women to be the sole owner of that home, while women were more likely than men to live in a home owned by their spouse. The point is that home ownership titles were most often in the name of the man. The only notable gendered differences between the two contexts in terms of home ownership are that women nationally were more likely to live in a house they owned than were women in Comit\u00e1n, and, in Comit\u00e1n, outstanding home debt was more common among women than men, while nationally there was no gender-based difference. 223 b. Business or property Aside from their home, most owned no other business or property. Just 35% owned (often with their spouse) a small business, property, or land. This was more common among men than women, a trend existing nationally, as well. Those elders who did have property tended to be younger (MA=58) than those who did not (MA=64). Property/business ownership was more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally, regardless of sex. Thus, business was more common among women in Comit\u00e1n than women nationally. In Comit\u00e1n, among informants with businesses/property, women were more likely than men to be the/an owner. Because many more women were widowed than men, ownership was also evaluated in couples, showing that married women were still more likely to be the owner than were men. Looking only at married women with business/property in both contexts, women in Comit\u00e1n were twice as likely as their national counterparts to be the owner. Of those informants who owned business/property, nearly 1 in 5 had business-related debt, making this more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. In Comit\u00e1n, women were twice as likely as men to have business/property debt, whereas nationally, there was no gendered distinction. Those who had such debt tended to be slightly older (MA=62) than those who did not (MA=58). A quarter of business/property owners in Comit\u00e1n, did not profit from this ownership last year. For example, a 52 year-old man (284) and his wife lived in a home owned by their children, and rented out their own house next door, yet renters often left without paying their debts. Women reported income from business/property more often than did men. 224 Nationally, overall profit-making rates were about the same as in Comit\u00e1n; however, the gendered distinction in profit present in Comit\u00e1n was not manifest nationally. c. Front room businesses The contrast between domestic and business spaces was often blurred, as many people operated businesses out of their homes. This is a common arrangement throughout southeastern Mexico. Men used their garage, front rooms, and yards for carpentry, auto mechanics, upholstery, and leatherworking workshops. Women prepared and sold food out of their homes, washed clothing by the dozen in their own wash stands, and did sewing/mending. Other micro-businesses operated in residential space included videogames, Internet, jewelry shops, repair shops, and public telephone (now somewhat obsolete due to cell phones). By far the most common business use of home space among elders was the front-room store. While this may be an artifact of data collection, the front-room store is most definitely a key fixture in Comit\u00e1n, and a means of income, space of responsibility and social interaction for those who run them, as well as a public source of nearby food, medication, and sometimes alcohol and cigarettes. The front-room store is, perhaps, one of the most context-based yet crucial fixtures in the lives of elders in Comit\u00e1n, both because many elders run them and because elders frequent them to purchase groceries. These stores are legal, although little regulated, and not necessarily very profitable. 225 Some front room stores were tiny, offering just a few products. Others were quite well- stocked and occupied the equivalent of a single car garage, shelves overflowing with goods and a constant stream of customers. Common products included: eggs, candy, chips, laundry soap, Tetrapac milk, noodles, soda, cookies, Alka Seltzer, and sometimes a bit of produce. Some front room stores even had a refrigerator, usually stocked with soda, but perhaps also hotdogs, ham, fresh cream, yogurt, and cheese. Figure 5.11, Photo, counter at a front-room store. Front-room stores were commonly women's enterprises, yet some elder men had their own stores or fell back on their wives' front-room store when they were un- or under- employed, such as mechanics who did not find enough work to make ends meet. These men often helped around the store. Some men had set up stores following retirement from other jobs, such as a 68-year-old man (242), who worked as a driver until about age 53, then started a store. A 54 year-old man (251) had a shop for his carpenter business, and also ran a store with his wife. A 62 year-old man (271), after working as a mechanic 226 for 25 years, now managed a store with his wife, where they sold much more fruit and vegetables than in other front-room stores. One 55 year-old man (003) who had been a farmer all his life retired from farming and opened such a store. Figure 5.12, Photo, front-room store. The front-room store was a prominent strategy for men and women who had to leave other, more physically-demanding professions behind, such as a 66 year-old woman who had been a bread baker. A man, now 60 years old, had been a traffic officer in Mexico City and then a local government official. When a stroke left him partially paralyzed, he set up a store in the front room of his home. While his wife had to help him dress and put on his shoes, he was able to sit on a stool and oversee the teenage girls who served clients in his store. 227 At times, adult children provided the room and/or the stock for these front-room stores, making the elder little more than an employee. In such cases, the child made the business decisions, controlling the store's site, what products would be stocked and when, prices, etc. A 57 year-old widow (035) who had not been to school and worked most of her life as a domestic servant used to have a front-room store in a bustling neighborhood. However, she moved in with her only daughter's home, located on an unpaved street on the outskirts of town. Foot traffic was sparse and vehicles rarely ventured down the muddy ruts. This, she said, was horrible for business. \"This store is a luxury,\" she said, meaning that it was actually costing her money to maintain. Yet her daughter was in favor of the arrangement because the woman could take care of her 2 year old grandson (who, on the day I visited her, had a fever and diarrhea). In the case of a 74 year-old man (028), he used to be a marimba player, but now stayed home with his wife and sold loose bananas from his son's fruit business. Being at home allowed them, too, to care for their great grandchildren, whose parents worked all day. Sometimes the flexibility this sort of business provides in terms of when to open and close is balanced out by the nagging truth that a closed door means no income; the result: elders working long hours to extend sales throughout the day and into the night. d. Decline in prosperity A few informants mentioned that they had once been more economically successful than at present, but that events had overcome their financial stability. A few had lost property and businesses over the course of the Zapatista uprising that came to a head in 1994. A 228 62-year old woman discussed how she had lived most of her life on a ranch in Las Margaritas that had belonged to her deceased husband. When \"the Zapatistas stole his ranch,\" she was forced to move to Comit\u00e1n and look for work. A 73 year-old man, who had worked as a logger and a carpenter all his life, also revealed that he lost much of his property when the Zapatista conflict occurred. He reflected, \"I worked so hard, all my life. I tried to prepare for old age. But now I realize I am in a critical moment.\" This insecurity drove him to keep working despite suffering from severe back pain, hypertension, arthritis, and various other chronic symptoms that made daily activities - let alone carpentry - a challenge for him. A 58 year-old man (248) mentioned owning two homes, but that both were mortgaged. When the value of the peso fell in 1992, he could no longer afford to make the skyrocketed mortgage payments. He simply stopped paying. He had yet to receive any notice regarding this situation. This man was a carpenter, with his own spacious workshop occupying the ground floor, while he lived with his small family on the second floor. His young wife (a second wife due to the death of his first wife) set up a store in a corner of the workshop. Despite his flourishing carpentry business, their store, and his two pieces of property, this aging man dreamed of doing migrant work in the United States because he feared that someday the government would take away his property. e. Irregularity in official documents Irregularity in titles and other official documents, like deeds and birth certificates, runs rampant, and may become a problem when resources are needed. In fact, informants 229 requested assistance in tending to bureaucratic matters. Just over 1 in 10 informants in Comit\u00e1n had a will, with little difference by sex (mimicking national rates). Elders who had wills tended to be slightly older (MA=66) than those who did not (MA=60). When elders pass away, if they do not have a will, this causes problems for the family and the partner, freezing assets and provoking feuds. This low number of wills was, in part, an indication of poverty, as many said they had nothing to leave behind. It may also speak to resistance to preparation for dying. Others expressed their intention to deal with these arrangements. A 53 year-old man (280) had paid into a government housing project (INFONAVIT) for 18 years, and lost the home due to a misspelling of his name on the documents. A 71 year-old man (234) lamented that, years ago, in his home state of Veracruz, his home was flooded and all of his personal documents were lost. Since then, he had struggled through life without a birth certificate. This predicament took precedence over his health problems (including diabetes) and serious poverty. Irregularity in official documents, then, could have a significant impact on elder mental and physical well-being. Do\u00f1a Ana: \"Mend, mend and mend until clothing can be mended no more.\" Do\u00f1a Ana (010) crossed the street to the tiny corner store where I stood chatting with the store-keeper, who continued to talk about her health while selling do\u00f1a Ana a bar of Jab\u00f3n Zote, soap for hand-washing clothes. Intrigued, do\u00f1a Ana inquired about \"the study\" and asked me to come visit her next, gesturing to a rickety wooden fence across the unpaved street. A half hour later, I knocked on her gate, which was opened by a giggling girl, who I followed into a small dirt yard. Do\u00f1a Ana introduced me to her daughter and two of her grandchildren (aged 7 and 11). The three were on their way out to run errands, but do\u00f1a Ana insisted that her daughter buy a soda for me first. Although I protested, I was soon politely sipping a glass of orange soda. We sat on do\u00f1a Ana's porch, which was not much more than her corrugated aluminum roof overhanging a cement slab in front of the simple, cement block home. Do\u00f1a Ana settled into an old 230 kitchen chair in front of her pedal-powered sewing machine, and I sunk into an old armchair facing her. Do\u00f1a Ana spoke cheerfully, smiling, even when she told me of how horrible her \"stinking, cheating ex-partner [they never married], may he rest in peace,\" had been. Years before, he left her one night. She shut him out of the house and never let him in again. He lived with one woman and then another, but ended up dying alone the previous December. Do\u00f1a Ana, true to her conscience, arranged for his funeral. Her dear friends and neighbors donated money and food to help her cover the expenses of the event. Since she separated, she had felt very independent and confident. In fact, she was laughing and glowing throughout our conversation, except when she told me about her son who died in an accident five years before and her daughters' current marital problems (which bore some resemblance to her own). These circumstances made her cry. Because do\u00f1a Ana had been a domestic servant all her life, she had no insurance- based health care coverage. She did, however, proudly show me her newly- acquired Popular Insurance ID card. Do\u00f1a Ana truly did need help with medical expenses. She suffered from asthma, which she blamed on washing clothing in cold water for so many years. To get decent care, she insisted that she had to go to Tuxtla for her pills and inhaler. She also had suffered a stroke, leaving her with slight facial paralysis, but some pills had helped with this and I noticed only that one eye seemed \"lazier\" than the other. She used glasses, but complained that even with them on, her vision was poor. Years ago, she had a hysterectomy in which they removed her entire uterus as well as a 2.5 kilo (5.5 lb.) tumor. She also believed she had high blood pressure, but had not had it checked in years. For a long time now, rather than going to the hospital or a doctor, she had opted to turn to a local pharmacy for advice and medication a few times a month. A toothache had forced her to see a dentist though. Do\u00f1a Ana had to watch her expenses because she no longer had any income, but lived on what her five living children (especially the one who lives with her) provided. She did all the housework for the six other residents, and did her best to make ends meet. While she preferred to cook on their old gas stove, short on cash, she was often forced to cook over wood or charcoal, especially for cooking beans, which she noted took a long, long time to boil. Do\u00f1a Ana caressed her sewing machine as she explained how she \"mended, and mended, and mended [the household's] clothing until it can be mended no more.\" She also helped friends, neighbors, and relatives. For instance, she babysat for her grandchildren and cared for women following childbirth. One of do\u00f1a Ana's concerns was that, although she had spent 30 years in her house, raising her 6 children there, she had never officially married her children's father, and the title to the land remained in her deceased partner's name. She was 231 aware that paperwork needed to be done to ensure her continued stay and to pass it down to her children, yet did not know how to accomplish this, nor where she would find the money to pay for the legal procedure. f. Bank accounts In Comit\u00e1n, 7% of the total sample had a bank account, slightly more frequent among men than women, mimicking national proportions. In Comit\u00e1n, of those married informants with a bank account, all (100%) married women with an account were the sole proprietor of that account, while 82% of married men were the sole proprietor of that account. This contrasts with the national figures, in which a much larger proportion of married men than women were the sole proprietor. In general, having a bank account is not very necessary for daily life in Comit\u00e1n. Nearly all purchases - including large purchases like land and vehicles - are still effected in cash; checks, debit and credit cards are rarely seen. Bank accounts do allow those employed in the formal sector to get their paychecks directly deposited. They also allow people to make money transfers to send/receive funds between relatives and for commercial purposes. While few elders need these services, having a bank account might be an indicator of wealth. g. Local transportation For local travel, just 1 in 10 used their own vehicle (MA=60), while over half relied on public transportation (MA=60) (see Table 5.3). Public transportation in Comit\u00e1n consists of minibuses and Volkswagen busses and requires walking to a bus stop and being able to get on and off. Women more than men relied on public transportation, while men more than women were likely to walk, to travel in their own vehicle, or to bike (in fact, only 232 men bike). Some cited citing poverty and work demands (e.g. street vendors) - not health - as the impetus walk or bike (MA=60), but were also aware of the health benefits of walking. Of those who relied on taxis (MA=77) (predominantly women), many were forced to do so given some medical condition that prohibited them from walking or boarding the bus. Taxis are five times more expensive than taking a bus. Using public transport can even cause health problems. For instance, a 66 year-old man damaged his knee as he got out of a Volkswagen bus. The only information provided in the national sample is that informants nationally were twice as likely as informants in Comit\u00e1n to own their own vehicle. Table 5.3, Means of local transportation. Means of transport (%) Men Women All Public transportation 47 61 55 Walk, ride bike 23 14 18 Ride in own vehicle 20 6 12 Taxi 4 12 8 Figure 5.13, Photo, walking, driving up Comit\u00e1n's hills. 233 h. Lifetime, past year, last week employment In Comit\u00e1n, most (85%) elders had worked for pay in their lifetime. Men were much more likely to have had a paying job (98%) than women (75%). Women accounted for all but one of those who had never had a paying job. Nearly half of the sample had been primarily self-employed, allowing them flexibility and independence on one hand, but insecurity and lack of benefits on the other. While the proportions of men who had worked for pay are about the same in the two contexts, working for pay among women in Comit\u00e1n was more common than among women nationally. Those who had never had a paying job tended to be slightly older (MA=65) than those who had been self-employed (MA=62) and those who had had a paying job (MA=60). In Comit\u00e1n, most had worked for pay for over 20 years, with large differences by sex, as 9 out of 10 men had done so for more than 20 years, compared to just 4 out of 10 women. National rates and sex distinctions on the time worked for pay are quite similar to rates in Comit\u00e1n. The most common occupations over informants' lifetime were markedly gendered, as detailed below (and the gendered impact is discussed in Chapter 8). During the year prior to the study, half of the sample had held a job, but this was much more common among men (63%) than women (41%). Nationally, much fewer (30%) had held a main job during the past year; the sex distinction still held. The difference between rates of women working in Comit\u00e1n (41%) and nationally (19%) is quite pronounced. Not surprisingly, those who held a job tended to be younger (MA=59) than those who had not held a job (MA=65). 234 In terms of activity during the week prior to the survey, in Comit\u00e1n, over half had worked, a quarter had done housework; the rest had done neither (in other words, were retired), but these numbers hide gender-differentiated dynamics. Work and retirement were more common among men than women, while ongoing housework was more common among women (48%) than men (3%). The numbers on the national level are very similar, except that women in Comit\u00e1n were more likely than women nationally to have worked over the past week. Again, those who worked during the past week tended to be much younger (MA=59) than those who were retired (MA=74). In Comit\u00e1n, nearly 1 in 3 elders still usually worked over 8 hours a day, and 1 in 10 over 12 hours a day (not very different from their national counterparts). In Comit\u00e1n, 17% had worked without pay at some point in their lives for relatives or acquaintances, informally lending a hand in a business or on a farm. This is about half as common than among the national sample. In both contexts, men were more likely to have done so than women. Those who had done such unpaid work tended to be slightly older (MA=65) than those who had not (MA=60). In contrast, women comprised more of the 18% of elders who had worked without pay in a home, doing cooking, cleaning, washing, and childcare. Considering both types of work (business/farm and domestic), 1 of 10 elders had worked without pay (in any context) for more than 5 years. (No comparable data on domestic work was included in the national survey.) 235 In all, elders in Comit\u00e1n were extremely involved in work through their later years. Compared to their local male counterparts, and to their national cohort, elder women in Comit\u00e1n had worked and continued to work a lot, regardless of whether the measure is years worked, worked last year or last week, or average number of hours per day among the presently working. i. Men's work Most elder men had worked in the blue collar sector, doing manual labor, among which farming (21%), masonry and building (17%), carpentry and wood-related jobs (12%) figured prominently. Farmers had either lived most of their lives in rural areas, or commuted, machete in hand, from their homes to the outskirts of the city and/or to outlying ranches. To a lesser extent, men had occupied white collar jobs in business and service, such as teachers, government employees, and drivers. For instance, a 74 year-old man (233) had worked as an appraiser and inspector for the Secretary of Agriculture. These government jobs are key sources of health insurance and employment stability. Others had been self-employed as electricians, leather workers, upholsterers, businessmen, and salesmen. These primary occupations did not contrast much with those of men in the national sample, with the potential exceptions of masons, builders, and craftsmen, which were slightly more common among men in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. A number of men had dedicated their lives to very typical Comiteco crafts and/or to handiwork centered on 236 repairing, recycling and reusing items. These crafts include leatherwork, woodwork, shoe repair, re-upholstering, tailoring, and bicycle repair. The lucrative potential of these occupations may be fading due to increased importation of goods, mechanization of labor, and propensity to buy new or disposable goods rather than fix the old and broken. Figure 5.14, Photo, farmer with machete. Figure 5.15, Photo, leatherwork. Rather than doing a variety of jobs over the years, most men had dedicated themselves to the same line of work for their entire life, even if this was grueling manual labor. Occupations among men were often initiated in childhood, like a 65 year-old man (253) who began working as a mason at age 8, and continued to do so until age 63; an upholsterer who began at age 19 and still did it at age 59 (264); a 54 year-old man (268) had done leatherwork since he was a child; and a 61 year-old (281) career mason. Sometimes men had worked their way up to a supervisory or an honorary position within 237 their line of work. For instance, a 59 year-old man (289) had pushed a hand cart in the market for more than 20 years, and was proud to have served as secretary of the local market's Hand Cart Union. More often than prestige and honor, their years of labor had come to a bitter end as the accumulated repercussions of work took a physical toll. A 52 year-old man (284) had worked for over 20 years digging and carrying dirt. However, his knee pain had prevented him from working for the past months. A 79 year-old man (277) had worked as an ice cream vendor for 36 years. He just retired two years ago because the constant exposure to cold was causing pain, cramps, and asthma. Reflecting on this common demise, a 55 year-old man (260) who had painted signs for 24 years was thankful for having a skill that he could continue into old age. In later years, being able to work was a gauge of health and well-being. Elders, especially men, feared aches and pains that might escalate and threaten their ability to continue working. Some men had already had to change professions due to occupational health problems that progressively limited them in later life. A 68-year old man (016) described how, when he could no longer drive a taxi, he began raising pigs. The propensity to remain in the same employment niche may be shifting, as some younger men complained of lack of work, and mentioned considering other paths - joining forces with their wife in what might once have been seen as \"woman's work\" and migrating toward jobs in the national and international arenas. In fact, a few men had 238 worked out of state, but had little praise for work far from home, and the experience did not necessarily translate into obvious advantage in later life. A 52 year-old man (270) had migrated to work in the U.S. He did not like it, returned, and now considered himself underemployed at his metalworking shop. A 70 year-old man (300) had worked on the oil rigs for 25 years in Tabasco, Campeche, and Veracruz and considered himself lucky to live to tell - many of his coworkers died in helicopters downed in storms. Eventually, he returned to live with a daughter in Comit\u00e1n at age 62 and eked out a living selling roast corn-on-the-cob. He would rise at 5 a.m. and walk to the market at 6 a.m. to buy corn. He then carried the mass of ears around in a sack and set up his charcoal grill on a street corner to sell roast corn-on-the-cob. He calculated that he walked about 9 kilometers a day. j. Women's work Women's work can be distinguished from men's work in that it tends to be either dedicated to domestic tasks (mostly cooking, cleaning, washing) or is performed in combination with domestic and caring tasks (e.g. at home, while caring for relatives). (Women's domestic, food-related, and caring work is discussed in Chapter 8.) Housework was the single most common primary lifetime occupation among elder women, with 18% doing so. Additionally, half the women (some who had previously worked in other professions) had devoted the week prior to the survey to housework. Many women had spent the bulk of their lives doing paid domestic work: 9% had washed and ironed other people's clothing; 6% had been domestic servants. After 239 domestic work, the next most common lifetime profession was food preparation and sales, activities performed during most of the lives of 14% of the women surveyed. Elder women had made careers of baking bread, pedaling fruit, cheese, and vegetables; and, most of all, local favorites, known as antojitos (literally, \"little snacks\"). They then sold these door-to-door, at stands in public places, or from a table set up in their front-room. Many women were surveyed at their place of business, or at home while they worked. For women, this was often operating a small front room store, or working as a seamstress from home. As with male-dominant handiwork, sewing may become an anachronism in this new age of ready-made clothing in an array of sizes and styles. Beyond, or more accurately, in addition to cleaning, cooking, and caring, another 14% of elder women had worked most of their lives in business places, while 7% had been farmers. A handful had been government employees. Extremely few women have had more structured careers for which they were entitled to health insurance, retirement pension, and disability insurance. These benefits did not necessarily have a noticeable impact on health. For instance, one 57 year-old woman (267) finished high school, worked as a teacher for 30 years, and retired a decade ago. Despite her access to resources and health care, she still had diabetes, menopausal problems, and poor eyesight. Only her full mouth of teeth distinguished her in any way from other, less fortunate women. 240 In both contexts - Comit\u00e1n and nationally - domestic service, agriculture, food preparation and sales, and micro-business were prominent female occupations. More unique occupations in Comit\u00e1n were those dedicated to religion, midwifery, and the production of traditional crafts and clothing. One woman was a spiritualist, another was paid to pray (rezadora). The wife of a 78 year-old blind man (044) made religious effigies and paintings of saints, which she peddled door-to-door to cover their food expenses. Local artwork, such as embroidered blouses, also offered elder women with a context-dependent source of income. These products are sold in Comit\u00e1n as well as in the more heavily-touristed San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas (about an hour away). As with men, few women made extreme job changes over their lifetime. An exception was a 51 year-old woman (278) who, at 5 years old, began working in a bakery, then taught sewing in remote villages, then was a domestic servant in Comit\u00e1n, and most recently, had opened a front-room store selling food, clothing, and school supplies. Most elder women had patched together a few pesos here and there while caring for children, and then grandchildren. In a handful of cases, women changed activities when they moved to Comit\u00e1n. For instance, a 64 year-old Tojolabal woman (019) had been a farmer all her life until she and her husband moved to Comit\u00e1n to be closer to their children. In the city, she began washing clothes to make money, but did not completely abandon her agricultural skills; she planted a small garden in their yard and sold herbs and vegetables to neighbors. 241 k. Pension Only 13% had ever paid into a retirement fund, and just 11% received some form of pension (mostly retirement, but a handful received survivorship and one woman received disability). Payment into and from this kind of fund was more common among men than women (14% vs. 7%), not surprising given that men more often hold the government jobs that entitle them to such benefits. Additionally, the men tended to receive benefits based on retirement, while the women received support based on retirement and widowhood. Rates of pension among the national sample follow the same sex-based trends, but in general were higher than those in Comit\u00e1n; for example, 21% of men nationally received retirement benefits, as compared to 13% of men in Comit\u00e1n. In Comit\u00e1n, just 8% expected to receive pension in the future (similar to national rates, except that rates were higher among men in the national sample than men in Comit\u00e1n); most were over five years away from receiving such funds. l. Public assistance & help in cash or kind from family and friends In Comit\u00e1n, 24% of the total sample had received (over the past year), some form of public assistance, with little distinction by sex (in some cases, informants reported assistance received by their partner). (Details on the various types of assistance are included in Chapter 3.) Those who had, received it from (in order) Progresa/Oportunidades (MA=59), elder support (MA=73), and Procampo (MA=56). A handful received more than one type of assistance. Progresa is a cash payment aimed at assisting women, while Procampo are funds usually dispersed to male farmers. Thus, it 242 is not surprising that more women than men received Progresa/Oportunidades, while more men than women received Procampo. Progresa consisted of around $300 pesos per month (approximately US$26). Elder support, received by 8% of the total sample with no sex difference, most often took the form of groceries distributed to qualifying elders by the Family Development Institute (DIF) every 2-3 months. Just a few others received support for elders from the National Institute of Older Adults (INAPAM, SEDESOL). Nationally, 9% of the sample were recipients of some form of public assistance over the past year, more common among men than women. It seems that informants in Comit\u00e1n may be more likely than their national counterparts to have received some form of public assistance; however, the frequency, quantity, and nature of this assistance was not compared. Many informants complained that the application and paperwork for such assistance was burdensome and confusing, that the dispersal amount and frequency were inconsistent, and that distribution dynamics were inequitable. People did not understand the criteria, requirements, or coverage dynamics. For example, a number of elder women contended that help was more readily available to - or accessed by - middle-class families whose need was not as pronounced as that perceived among unassisted lower-class families. Others claimed to have received some public assistance (e.g. Progresa payments or groceries from the DIF) just once or twice and not since, evidencing the poor continuity of the program. A 60 year-old woman (022) became ineligible for Progresa when she visited her children in Mexico City in order to get health care for a problem that was not 243 resolved in Comit\u00e1n. Another 60 year-old woman said, \"I lost my Progresa. I don't understand it. Those women who get it are richer, and they don't help out as much as I do. How can this happen?\" The daughter of a couple, both 72 years old (299), also wondered, \"My parents used to get groceries from the DIF, but not lately. I don't know what happened. Could it be because we signed them up for Popular Insurance? Is it because my sister got them on her [IMSS] insurance policy? The IMSS doesn't even have their medication in stock, so it doesn't really help.\" When such assistance was unstable in terms of continuity and inconsistent in terms of criteria for qualification, elders could not count on it, and therefore could not plan. Further, assistance programs purported to help with routine expenses; there was no form of public assistance for elders' emergencies, provoking catastrophic and impoverishing expenditures (see Chapter 3) for health and other emergencies. m. Informal support In Comit\u00e1n, about 1 in 4 informants claimed that they had received assistance in cash or kind from family or friends over the past year. This was more common among women than men. Adult children were the predominant providers. Elders who received help primarily from a spouse tended to be much younger (MA=55) than those who received aid primarily from a child (MA=68). Nearly twice as many women as men in Comit\u00e1n had received material assistance from a child. (The only comparable national finding is that just 1 in 10 had received assistance in cash or kinds from friends or relatives excluding children over the past year.) It was much less common to hear elders say that 244 they could count on friends and neighbors for support. An acute episode or pronounced medical emergency might inspire short-term shows of solidarity and support, but long- term, chronic problems did not enjoy prolonged assistance at this level. Sometimes, even with a lifetime of hard work, current public assistance, and support from relatives, elders still found themselves in financial straits. 245 Reflections on Chapter 5 Most elders in Comit\u00e1n had lived in the vicinity all their lives. They had little formal education, instead dedicating most of their lives to grueling manual labor - women in the home, and men outside. Scarcity had been a defining part of their lives, and for some it was still apparent in such facts as cooking with wood and charcoal, being visibly underweight and having to walk to the clinic. The majority were still trying to make ends meet, either by working for wages or pulling up the housework slack. Most lived in a house they owned, although the quality of the structure and the contents (furniture and energy-saving devices) were often lacking. Some received public assistance, but in general they were confused about the system. Many resided with a number of housemates, while others were lonely even among family, and some were literally living alone. Outside home, elders went to the market, attended church services, went to parties, visited relatives, sat in the park, etc. They enjoyed religious, neighborhood, family, and national holidays, perhaps even with a drink. Elders frequently greeted neighbors, friends, and acquaintances who walked by on the street. In the evenings they often sat or stood in the doorways that break up the continuous fa\u00e7ade of colored houses, and called out, \"Adi\u00f3s, compadre!\" \"Have a good evening, comadre!\" \"Good afternoon, do\u00f1a Rosita.\" Few, however, believed that they could count on these acquaintances for significant support. Most had little property to draw on for emergencies or to pass on to their children. It is in this context that elders in Comit\u00e1n had to address their health problems, detailed in the following chapter. 246 The survey and interviews with elders and home-based caregivers were strategic means of accomplishing Formative Research stage 1. These yielded baseline data on elders, highlighting their lives on the margins, including the basic economic challenges they faced. The data evidenced elders' vulnerability. For instance, compared to their national counterparts, elders in Comit\u00e1n had less formal education and were more likely to have worked (for pay and without pay), yet were less likely to receive pension. Elder Comitecos were also less likely to own their own home and vehicle, and they had fewer home amenities (including gas stove, refrigerator, washing machine). This vulnerability promises to continue and even increase given trends under structural adjustment, including migration, urbanization, and privatization. This description, steeped in reality rather than assumptions, would soon prompt local people to ask what they could do to remedy the situation, and the details would later form the basis of discussion of intervention needs and strategies. 247 CHAPTER 6. ELDERS AND CAREGIVERS TALK ABOUT ELDER HEALTH PROBLEMS Overview of Chapter 6 This chapter is an extension of the previous chapter, in that I weave insight from open- ended interviews and survey data together to form a detailed description of elder health problems and health care strategies in Comit\u00e1n. Case studies of individuals and couples complement the findings. When possible, I contrast the local dynamics with national trends reported by the MHAS. This comprehensive characterization of the health problems faced by elders in Comit\u00e1n evidences that elders - especially women - had good reason to perceive their health as poor. Before we even probed specific health problems, elders listed various troubles, many of which limited their ability to do basic household, work, and personal care tasks. They faced conditions spanning acute problems and chronic conditions, both infectious and non-infectious in nature. Chronic non-infectious diseases - especially diabetes and hypertension - were common, and in many cases they were uncontrolled and unsupervised by a physician, even when they limited elders' daily activities. But the most common health problem was not a big killer; it was dental trouble. Vision and hearing limitations were also widespread. Many elders suffered from persistent symptoms, like pain, cough, stomachache, and extreme fatigue. Occupational health problems were especially common in men, but also mentioned by women and related to what is supposed to be a \"safe\" activity: housework. While participants were beyond their childbearing years, women did complain of reproductive health problems and a many spoke of menopausal symptoms and medication. Conversing with elders was enough to learn of poor mental health, which elders 248 reaffirmed when asked directly. They also lamented many functional difficulties, such as difficulty bending, lifting, and carrying things like a small grocery bag. Questions of exercise, weight control, and diet were linked to occupation and financial situation, as poorer people did more hard manual labor and ate less, i.e. an involuntary exercise and diet regimen. Smoking and drinking were very common among men. Finally, I note that elders suffered from a variety of non-medical problems that impacted their health, including marital, occupational, and financial stresses. Elders addressed these challenges with a wide variety of strategies, detailed in Chapter 7. Gender inequity in elder well- being is again evident in this chapter, but I defer my discussion on this topic to Chapter 8. Building on the previous one, this chapter offers a collection of baseline data regarding problems as experienced and seen by elders. Elders in Comit\u00e1n did report higher rates of certain health conditions than did their national counterparts. In many cases, however, the problems Comiteco elders faced were the same as those challenging elders nationally and even globally. In this case, this data represents an important confirmation of similarities in types of problems and conditions faced in old age. More importantly, even if the types of morbidity are similar to those affecting elders in other places, elders in Comit\u00e1n experience this differently, as the precariousness of local social capital, economic resources, and infrastructure made these ills especially burdensome to live with and challenging to address. Together, Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 elucidate the unique nature of elders' experiences, needs, and resources in this context, data useful for clarifying misconceptions and assumptions, and then planning interventions. 249 A. General perceptions of health Three out of four elder informants in Comit\u00e1n deemed their health average or bad, rather than good, very good, or excellent. Perception of personal health status declined with age, as evident in the median ages for each of the categories: excellent (MA=54)37, very good (MA=57), good (MA=60), average (MA=61), and bad (MA=67). Of the few who initially rated their health positively, some later in the survey revealed bothersome symptoms and even chronic disease. Half considered their health worse than it was two years ago, while fewer considered it about the same, and fewer still contended it had improved. Those who saw recent improvements in their health ascribed the turn for the better to changes like drinking less alcohol and receiving effective treatment for a problem. Women had a slightly more negative perception of their health than did men, as 80% of women, compared to 70% of men, rated their current health as average or bad and 51% of women, versus 41% of men, said that their health was somewhat or much worse now than it was two years ago. The gendered pattern held at the national level; however, elders in Comit\u00e1n were more inclined than their national counterparts to consider themselves as unwell. The local/national difference in perception of health was especially marked between women of the two contexts. 37 Median age. See note in Chapter 5. In this case, for example, \"(MA=54)\" indicates that the median age of those informants who rated their health status as excellent was 54 years. 250 B. Health problems mentioned in initial unstructured query Before probing specific illnesses and conditions, we asked elders to list any health problems they had had in their lifetime that were serious enough to affect their daily activities for at least a month. (This question was not included in the national survey.) At this point, some claimed that they had never had any such troubles. Over the course of the conversation, however, many then responded affirmatively when questioned directly regarding specific problems and symptoms, and mentioned a plethora of discomforts. Common among elders' (especially women's) discourse in surveys and interviews were statements akin to, \"I have no health problems, only...\" followed immediately or eventually by a litany of symptoms (headache, dizziness, discomfort, etc.). This may reflect a perception of major diagnoses (diabetes, hypertension, cancer etc.) as \"legitimate\" health problems meritorious of mentioning, while the array of symptoms uncoupled from a specific disease diagnosis was seen as less valid, even when chronic and interfering with daily life. The majority did note at least one health problem, some many more. In fact, this initial inquiry and later more structured questions often yielded a list of multiple and sometimes quite disparate problems. For instance, a 74 year-old man (028) suffered simultaneously from hypertension, gout, gastritis, hemorrhoids, frequent and debilitating colds, very bad dental health, an infected foot that prevents him from working, and various functional difficulties. By far the most commonly mentioned health problem in response to the initial question was pain, predominantly head, leg, and knee pain. After pain, vision problems and gall 251 bladder conditions were the next most frequently cited. Many had had their gall bladder removed, which entailed hospitalization and a recovery period. A 74 year-old man (233) described how this procedure required him to spend 12 days in the hospital, then 30 days recuperating at home, and even after this, his abdomen was still sore and swollen. These three problems (pain, vision, gall bladder) were more frequently cited than were the prominent chronic diseases, which form a second group of conditions mentioned, primarily hypertension, diabetes, respiratory difficulties, stroke and facial paralysis. Sex- specific health problems were often brought to light, as well. Women cited cesareans, hysterectomies, uterine and ovary conditions, menopause, tubal ligation, menstruation, and breast and uterine tumors or cists. Men mentioned prostate conditions. Slightly less often cited by the entire group were digestive troubles (including gastritis and colitis); blood problems acid/gout, cholesterol/triglycerides); conditions (especially in feet); hearing impairment (nearly all men); bladder and urinary troubles, and what might be considered mental illness (including nervios and susto). A handful of informants cited alcoholism (mostly men), appendices, and arthritis. Conditions less mentioned in response to this opening question include convulsions, dental problems, hernias, obesity, osteoporosis, Parkinson's, and psoriasis. Many elders had suffered from infectious disease in adulthood (mostly commonly gastro- intestinal infections like diarrhea and typhoid), and a handful had faced measles, mumps, or polio during childhood. Illness in childhood was often described as nearly fatal. For example, a 64 year-old woman (256) recalled just barely living through measles and a 252 spell of bloody diarrhea when she was 7 years old. Some linked these bouts of infectious disease to later health problems. A 60 year-old woman (273), for instance, told me that typhoid fever had led to her hypertension. Some elders contended that their various health problems were rooted in the context of Comit\u00e1n. A 68 year-old man (016) claimed that his rheumatism was due to walking around on the cold, wet ground in Comit\u00e1n. Abrupt changes in weather were often cited as provoking colds, arthritis, and respiratory difficulties. Others pointed to the typical Comiteco diet as causing gastro-intestinal problems. They spoke of meat, chile, coffee, fried food, lard, breads, sweets, and soda as appealing yet hazardous foods. Many indicated the local inclination toward alcohol consumption as the source of liver conditions. Men tended to describe traumatic childhood accidents, bicycle and vehicular crashes, and violent crime. In terms of boyhood accidents, for example, a 62 year-old man (271) related in detail how, when he was 10 years old, he was pulling a burro when it became startled. His arm tangled in the rope that he had been using to coax it along, the burro dragged him a frightening distance. His lacerated flesh and fractured (if not broken - he never got x-rays) arms, ribs, and knees took a full year to heal, and the memory lasted a lifetime. Men had memories of childhood injuries that they associated with current health problems. For instance, one (006) had fallen from a tree when he was a boy, to which he ascribed a bad back, one leg longer than the other, and various aches and pains 253 still plaguing him at age 73. Another man (048) fell from a horse at age 16, provoking his current waist and back problems. Men also more frequently mentioned having been victims of car and bicycle accidents. A 53 year-old man (280) had broken his leg in a car accident as a young adult. A 54 year- old man (258) had had two bicycle accidents, knocking out all his front teeth in one, and breaking his clavicle in the other. A 79 year-old (277) ice cream peddler said he fell into a 4-hour coma after falling from his bike. Later in life, a VW van ran over him and his pushcart. Another man (029) was injured while changing a tire. Men (but not women) had suffered from violent crime, as well. Two men were victims of gunshot wounds (018), and one (033) had his head sliced open with a machete many years ago. Another (243) had been stabbed in Ciudad Juarez. Again, men sometimes posited subsequent health problems as repercussions of such traumatic events. A 59 year-old man (254) had been in a car accident over 20 years ago, and still felt \"air in his head\" from the impact. While some elders had very few health problems and a positive image of their health, 4 in 10 participants cited (in response to the initial open question) a condition that still limited their daily activities, and over half of all of the problems mentioned were deemed as limiting their everyday activities. Most of the problems that limited daily activity had begun after informants turned 40. Prominent limiting conditions were pain, vision impairment, hypertension, diabetes, and gastrointestinal troubles. Men were more likely than women to mention knee pain, hearing loss, prostate conditions, and alcoholism as 254 limiting. Women were more likely than men to cite hypertension, diabetes, gall bladder, dizziness, hysterectomy, and osteoporosis as limiting. When asked to identify the most serious or worrisome problem of those they had mentioned, informants mentioned these same limiting conditions with two exceptions. Gastrointestinal troubles were deemed limiting but not very worrisome. Gall bladder trouble, perceived as not limiting daily activity, was marked as serious. For most men, pain was the most worrisome problem, while hypertension was women's greatest concern. The case of do\u00f1a Yesenia exemplifies the wide range of health problems that can plague one person simultaneously, and the vicious cycle of life challenges-health problems-life challenges. Do\u00f1a Yesenia: \"I'm fine. It's just age 62, still worked full-time selling tamales, corn-on-the- cob, tacos, and other homemade snacks at the second class bus station on the Pan- American Highway. She divvied up the tasks (marketing, cooking, transport, selling) between herself, her children and their spouses, and her grandchildren, seven of whom lived with her. The morning I spoke with her, she insisted she had time to chat despite the whirlwind of pots, Tupperware, tortillas, charcoal, and hibachi flying into various crates and bags. The only person who remained still around us was her elderly mother. Do\u00f1a Yesenia was tearful as she informed me that her husband had died, as had five of their twelve children. The stress of her lifelong poverty, exposure to alcoholism (in her husband and now in her son), and sequential family losses had taken its toll on her mental and physical health. When she felt bad, she could not cook or sell food, with repercussions on her purse. For years she had suffered from depression and nervios, to which she ascribed her own heavy smoking and drinking, habits that she managed to kick eight years ago. Her physical health problems, in contrast, had mounted over recent years. Do\u00f1a Yesenia did not go to a doctor, but instead visited a nearby pharmacy as an ongoing strategy to stave off the functional repercussion of her chronic problems. Now she had detected a second wave of symptoms, such as stomachaches, that she ascribed to \"taking so 255 many pills.\" Her theory is logical given the litany of conditions for which she self-medicated: knee pain that would reach her head, headaches, burning in her stomach and gastritis, swelling and burning in her feet, high blood pressure, frequent falls, overweight, dizzy spells, persistent cough, dental problems, severe fatigue, incontinence, and burning while urinating. Do\u00f1a Yesenia prefaced this inventory by saying, \"I'm fine. It's just that....\" As mentioned earlier, because survey participants span a very wide range of ages (from 50 to 105, mean=64, median=62), when the age difference is pronounced and when calculations are possible, I include the median age (denoted MA=##) of respondents to provide a better impression of how the characteristics described here map out over later years of life. 256 C. Specifically-probed chronic diseases Seven chronic health problems were specifically probed in the national survey: hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease, heart disease, stroke, and arthritis. For comparison's sake we probed these seven problems in Comit\u00e1n. Regarding each problem, we asked elders if they: \u0001 had ever been told by anyone (physician, other practitioner, non-practitioner) that s/he had had the condition, (and if so, by whom) \u0001 was currently doing anything to control or treat the condition, if so what (e.g. medication, diet, therapy, exercise) \u0001 had consulted anyone (physician or other practitioner) in the past twelve months regarding the condition, if so whom \u0001 felt that the problem was under control \u0001 felt that the problem limited her/his normal activities (such as housework and paid work). In general, responses indicated that chronic diseases - especially hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes - were common among elders in Comit\u00e1n, and limited their daily activities. While formal health care and taking medication for hypertension and diabetes were common (probably due to the state emphasis on providing care for these two conditions), treatment and medical supervision for the other conditions were less so. Some elders were not treating their chronic disease at the time of the survey. This may indicate that their condition had since been resolved. However, their mention that daily activities had been limited by the condition suggest that some cases, while not currently being treated, may have remained unresolved. Additionally, diagnoses were not necessarily conclusive or accepted, and there were various ways of evading a diagnosis. For instance, a 74-year old woman (031) had been 257 told by a doctor that she had diabetes, \"But,\" she said, \"I don't believe it, and I don't have any money anyway.\" Likewise, a 58 year-old man (262) said, \"my glucose is high, but I don't think I have diabetes.\" A 70 year-old Tojolabal farmer said of cancer, \"we all have it, it is just hidden.\" Elders sometimes did seek to confirm or disprove less formal diagnoses. For instance, a 51 year-old woman suspected that she had diabetes, but tests (covered by her insurance) proved otherwise. On the flip-side, there is some local screening and detection of conditions which were not obviously apparent to elders. One 66 year-old man (011) said that he had no noticeable symptoms, but when he went to the IMSS complaining of knee pain, he was diagnosed with hypertension. Another man's wife had her cervical cancer diagnosed at the clinic. Regarding how disease diagnosis maps out over age, those elders who had been diagnosed with hypertension tended to be slightly older (MA=64) than those who had not (MA=60). A similar pattern of more advanced age among those diagnosed than among those not diagnosed occurred with respiratory disease (MA in diagnosed=67, MA in undiagnosed=60), heart attack (72, 62), stroke (65, 62), and arthritis (64, 61). In contrast, elders diagnosed with diabetes tended to be younger (MA=60) than those who had not (MA=62), as in the case of cancer (55, 62). If we look at the entire sample (See Table 6.1), of the seven specifically-probed chronic diseases, hypertension raises many red flags. It was the most commonly detected of the seven, the one for which most people were medicating at the time of the survey, had seen 258 a doctor in the previous year, and limited daily everyday housework or tasks at work. This is significant, as hypertension is especially tricky to address due to its asymptomatic nature. Arthritis, while extremely symptomatic, is of concern as it was the condition which most people considered not under control, and also the least treated of the issues probed. A full 10% of all elder informants had both hypertension and diabetes, and nearly half (48%) had one or the other. Table 6.1, Chronic disease rates and care (as % of all 300 informants). Highest rates are shaded. OF WHOLE SAMPLE Overall rate Dr. in last 12 months Currently medicating No current treatment Not under control Limits daily activities Hypertension 38 More \u0001 31 29 8 8 15 Arthritis 24 14 12 10 9 12 Diabetes 19 More \u0001 15 15 1 4 9 Resp. disease 9 5 5 3 3 3 Stroke 6 More than natl 2 3 3 1 3 Heart attack 4 1 1 3 2 1 Cancer 3 1 <1 2 1 1 On the other hand, looking only at elders who had been told that they had one of these conditions (see Table 6.2), another set of flags appears. Diabetes was the problem for which sufferers were most often being treated at the time of the survey and for which sufferers most often had sought medical care in the past year. Stroke was the problem for which the highest proportion of those diagnosed were limited their daily activities, although arthritis and diabetes were close behind. Heart attack was the problem least 259 treated (via medication, exercise, diet, etc.) at the time of the survey by those who had experienced one, and was the condition that sufferers most often deemed uncontrolled. Table 6.2. Treatment and care rates among elders with the particular condition. Highest rates are shaded. AMONG DIAGNOSED Dr. in last 12 months Currently medicating No current treatment Not under control Limits daily activities Hypertension 82 More \u0001 76 20 22 More \u0002 41 More \u0001 Arthritis 56 Less than natl 48 Less than natl 40 37 More \u0001 48 Diabetes 82 More \u0001 80 More \u0001 7 20 More \u0002 More than natl 48 More \u0001 Resp. disease 54 54 35 35 More \u0002 39 Stroke 39 More \u0002 44 More \u0002 50 17 More \u0001 50 Heart attack 36 More \u0002 27 Less than natl 73 46 27 More \u0002 Less than natl Cancer 22 More \u0001 Less than natl 11 Less than natl 56 22 33 Now, if we add another lens - gender - a distinct set of priorities appears. Of the conditions probed, women seemed more adversely affected by hypertension and diabetes than did men. Even before elders were directly asked about chronic disease, women were more likely than men to mention hypertension and diabetes as a health problem that had limited their daily activities for over a month. When asked about the health problem they considered the most worrisome, women named hypertension (while men cited pain). Upon direct questioning, the female-male difference was most pronounced in the case of hypertension, which was twice as common among women (48%) than among men (26%). 260 Women were not only more likely than men to have been told they had hypertension, but also to have consulted a doctor over the past year for their hypertension, and to be limited in their daily activities by hypertension. Women were also more likely than men to have been told they had diabetes, to have consulted a doctor over the past year for diabetes, to be medicating for diabetes at the time of the survey, and to be limited in their daily activities by diabetes. Additionally, women were more likely than men to have arthritis or a stroke they considered unresolved. On the other hand, men were more likely than women to feel that their hypertension, diabetes, and/or respiratory disease was not under control; to have been medicated for stroke at the time of the study; to have consulted a doctor regarding stroke and heart attack over the previous year; and to have been limited in their daily activities by heart conditions. Further, women's disease burden was heavier than men's in that women were nearly twice as likely as men to have experienced two or more of these diseases (36% of women did so, compared to only 19% of men). Comparing Comit\u00e1n to national data, contextual differences emerge, casting Comit\u00e1n in a negative light. Stroke seemed more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Among those elders with arthritis, heart attack, and cancer, a smaller proportion in Comit\u00e1n than nationally were treating it at the time of the survey. Of those with arthritis and cancer, elders in Comit\u00e1n were less likely to have seen a doctor for it during the previous year than elders nationally. Of heart attack victims, fewer in Comit\u00e1n than nationally felt their heart attack limited their daily activities. Finally, among diabetics, elders in Comit\u00e1n were less likely than their national counterparts to feel their diabetes was under control. 261 Figure 6.1, Photo, adult diapers, an expensive necessity for incontinence. In terms of causality, elders associated their chronic disease with a range of factors commonly noted in popular health culture. For example, they blamed hypertension on inheritance; arthritis on cold water and swift changes in weather; diabetes on sugar consumption. In the illness narratives, however, notions of etiology were eclipsed by discussion of their lived repercussions of chronic disease. For instance, a 75 year-old woman (274) complained, \"because of the diabetes, I have to use a towel,\" referring, literally, to a towel to soak up urine caused by her incontinence. A 50 year-old diabetic woman (235) also lamented her incontinence. A 71 year-old man (234) described how his vision \"darkened\" with diabetes; a 68 year-old man (242) said that he, too, had lost his eyesight due to diabetes. 262 D. Dental problems Eighty-six percent of the entire sample were missing teeth, making it the single most common health problem in this population. Many, many informants did not have a tooth of their own left in their mouth; speech and smiles revealed that only a fraction of the population with many missing teeth had false teeth. Even those otherwise healthy elders had serious dental problems. Some had lost their teeth very early, as had a 56 year-old woman (245) who was already totally toothless. The absence of teeth may be the result of dental care, as a common treatment is extraction. Women were slightly more prone than men (90% versus 83%, respectively) to be missing teeth. Women seemed to be more conscious of their own missing or unsightly teeth and at times covering their mouths when speaking and smiling. Beyond cosmetic dimensions, a few informants associated snoring and inability to chew with a toothless mouth, in doing so indicating the critical roles played by oral health in nutrition and breathing. One man (300), in contrast, proudly exhibited his sole remaining tooth. Ironically, this man pedaled roast corn-on-the-cob for a living, and he grinned from ear to ear while describing how he would gum his way through the leftover corn on slow days. The prevalence of toothless mouths may indicate that the cost of dentures is prohibitive for many elders in Comit\u00e1n. (The national survey did not include questions on teeth.) 263 E. Vision problems Just over half of the informants used eyeglasses or (to a much lesser extent) contact lenses (MA=62), making this more common among elders in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Even with glasses, 4 of 10 elders rated their vision as so-so or poor, and this was more frequent among women than men. Of the 300 elders surveyed, 5 were completely blind (MA=85). Many people who used glasses or had been operated on (e.g. for cataracts) still rated their vision as less than optimal. On the other hand, some who had very poor eyesight had never even gotten glasses. Others said their glasses hurt rather than helped. A 51 year-old woman (278), for instance, used glasses to read, but got dizzy upon raising her eyes. A 53 year-old man (280) had bifocals, but these gave him a headache. Aside from poor eyesight, elders also mentioned excessive tearing, burning and clouding. A 64 year-old man (286) described his eyes as \"meaty\" (carnosas), a thicker, cloudy layer covering his pupils. A 72 year-old man (299) also said that his blindness began when his eyes \"clouded over\" 25 years ago. Poor vision discouraged and even prevented some from leaving their homes and performing everyday tasks. It limited the ability to read, see at night, and work. A 78 year-old (043) rezadora (woman who made a living praying for others) strained to read the prayers. A 78 year-old man (044) had to give up his job as a truck driver due to his bad vision, and blindness later confined him to his home. A handful of elders cited lack of funds as a reason for not having vision tested, getting glasses, and updating prescriptions. Although the question was not asked, it is likely that elders used glasses they had obtained without a prescription and even from other people, and that they rarely had their vision checked to update prescriptions. 264 F. Hearing problems An 89 year-old man (250) was almost completely deaf. His son yelled into his ear during our interview. This is not rare, as 2 of 10 participants rated their hearing as so-so or poor, yet hardly any used a hearing aid. Those few elders who used a hearing aid tended to be much older (MA=78) than those who did not (MA=61). While responses to direct questions on hearing yielded similar rates for men and women, men were much more likely than women to mention hearing impairment in response to the initial probe regarding any serious health problems. Men were quite bothered by losing their hearing. Women, in turn, were annoyed by their husband's loss of hearing or seemingly selective hearing. The wife of a 60 year-old man (294) complained, \"He's deaf. We say things all the time, but he doesn't pay attention. He angers easily and yells all the time!\" 265 G. Falls, aches, and pains In the past two years, over a quarter of elders had fallen or bumped themselves so badly that they needed some sort of medical care. Those who had fallen tended to be slightly older (MA=64) than those who had not (MA=60). This kind of accident was much more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally, perhaps due to terrain, flooring materials, uneven sidewalks; need to walk a lot; high rate of arthritis and functional difficulties. Some falls had produced fractured and bruised bones, required bed rest, and resulted in chronic pain. A 75 year-old woman (274), for instance, had spent weeks in bed over the past year, recovering from a very hard fall that affected her face, shoulder, and side. Slightly more men had experienced a serious fall or bump (often employment-related) over the past two years than did women (32% versus 25%, respectively). Persistent pain was by far the most often spontaneously-mentioned health problem during the initial, unstructured query of health problems among men and women alike. Further, upon direct questioning, 63% of informants said they frequently suffered from pain, placing chronic pain in second place after dental problems. This was much higher than the national rate of 39%. Headache and knee pain were the most often cited. Many elders complained of pain in multiple areas of the body. For instance, a 52 year-old woman (252) lamented that pain in her arms, hands, legs, stomach, and head interfered with her fruit selling. Of those who suffered from frequent pain, 60% maintained that this pain regularly interfered with their daily activities; this is three times as high as the national level. 266 A full 70% of women had suffered from frequent pain, compared to 54% of men. While knee discomfort was mentioned by both men and women, women complained more of headaches than did men. Some women used the term dolor de cerebro, or \"brain aches\" to describe their malaise, perhaps stressing the psychological roots of their headaches. Further, women more often than men described their pain as severe or moderate rather than light. Women were also more likely than men to deem pain as interfering with their daily activities, as 41% of all women qualified their pain as limiting daily home and work activities, while 33% of all men indicated as much. The national statistics on chronic pain parallel the local gendered tendencies. Both untreated pain as well as treatment had dire consequences. Many elders ended up self-medicating; some could no longer work as much; others became depressed. For example, a 51 year-old man (287) had been a farmer for 35 years. Perhaps from a strained muscle while working, he experienced horrible pain in his back and his neck, prompting him to consult doctors and self-medicate with Naproxen (an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory) two or three times a week. His wife added that this pain prevented him from working, which then depressed him. This moved him to start drinking - up to a liter of aguardiente three or four days a week (until just six months prior), and he became overweight. His excess weight then strained his back, and the cycle continued. 267 H. Other persistent symptoms We probed a number of other physical symptoms, asking whether elders had experienced them persistently over the past two years. Roughly half the elders in the Comit\u00e1n sample complained of frequent coughing, shedding doubt on the considerably lower proportion reported having been diagnosed with respiratory disease. In fact, the Director of the DIF said that, while they do not see many debilitating cases of respiratory disease, they do encounter older women with a chronic cough. Why? Because almost all of the women come from farms or small communities where they cook with firewood and the smoke from the charcoal or wood causes a lot of respiratory problems, but these are very infrequently detected. They are rarely registered, and thus appear to have a low incidence. Stomachache, indigestion, and/or diarrhea were also experienced on a regular basis by about half of the survey respondents. About half said they suffered from persistent, extreme fatigue. A third or so had experienced frequent dizziness and/or fainting, swollen feet or ankles, and/or incontinence. A fifth admitted to burning or bleeding when urinating and/or defecating. With the exception of foot/ankle swelling, all of these symptoms were more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. In fact, elders in Comit\u00e1n were more than twice as likely than their national cohort to suffer from fatigue, cough, stomach discomfort, incontinence, and burning or bleeding when urinating or defecating. While the median age among those experiencing most of these symptoms did not differ much from the age of those who did not face them, those reporting incontinence tended to be slightly older (MA=64) than those who did not (MA=60). 268 Elder women in Comit\u00e1n endured many bothersome symptoms. For example, over half had experienced chronic fatigue over the past two years. Women's reported discomfort was disproportionate to that reported by men. Women were more likely than men to have frequently experienced foot/ankle swelling, fatigue, incontinence, dizziness and fainting, burning or bleeding while urinating or defecating. Further, they were at least as likely as men to have had a persistent cough and/or to have had stomachache, indigestion, and/or diarrhea. Table 6.3 shows how, for all the symptoms specifically-probed in the survey, the rates among women were at least as high as - and usually higher than - rates among men. Not only did women in Comit\u00e1n suffer from such discomfort more than their local male counterparts, but also more than their national female cohort. In fact, elder women in Comit\u00e1n were twice as likely as women in their national cohort to have suffered frequently from cough, stomach discomfort, incontinence, and burning or bleeding when going to the bathroom. Table 6.3, Percent of elders experiencing persistent symptoms, by sex. Persistent symptom Women Men More common in women Foot/ankle swelling Same rate Cough 49% 47% Stomachache, indigestion, diarrhea 49% 49% Some of these symptoms, although not life-threatening, limited elders' ability to get through daily life. One otherwise healthy 67 year-old woman, for example, was bed- ridden repeatedly over the previous year due to swollen feet. This prevented her from doing her housework, tending to her front-room store, and caring for her chickens. A 75 269 year-old woman (274) had a persistent cough, which was not under control, despite medication. She felt like she could not take in enough air. This made it difficult for her to walk, especially when she had to go up and down hills between her home and her granddaughters' school, where she had to drop them off and pick them up. 270 I. Occupational health problems A few elders recognized the health benefits of having jobs that kept them active - walking, lifting, moving. Far more mentioned health problems were provoked by their job. In fact, 3 of 10 elders had had some occupational health problem. Occupational health problems were nearly four times more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. For some, work was a risk due to the physical exigencies of the job. A 55 year-old man, for example, complained that lifting boxes at work hurt his arms, and a 59 year-old man (289) had ruined his knees in a lifetime of pushing a handcart at the market. A 52 year- old man (284) had worked for decades digging and carrying dirt; his knee pain had caught up with him and prevented him from working for the past months. A 68-year old man (016) who had been a taxi-driver for years had to give it up after spending so much time seated in the car provoked kidney problems. Another 68 year-old man (259) who used to carry building materials in a warehouse got a hernia and had to be operated on. For others, occupational risk arose from the environment in which they worked. Air quality was a concern. For example, one man, aged 51, worried about his hearing and vision loss provoked by the fine cement mix dust in which he spent most of his life submerged as a mason. A 51 year-old man (237) believed that smoke from welding had affected his kidneys, causing his excessive urination. The same man had throat problems he ascribed to selling petroleum gas when he was younger. A 54 year-old man (251) had developed allergies to the sawdust in his carpentry workshop. Accidents on the job were also noted. A 60 year-old man (294) was close to a gas tank explosion, which caused 271 permanent swelling in his nose, making his breath audible, and giving him asthma. A few elders were exposed to various dangers implicit in multiple jobs. For instance, a 79 year-old man (277) had worked as an itinerant ice cream vendor for 36 years. He just retired two years ago because the constant handling of ice and ice cream gave him cramps and asthma. Additionally, he had been run over while selling cones on a street corner. This same man, when younger, was a marimba player, and he reflected, \"I used to drink a lot because people would buy drinks for the band.\" A 53 year-old man (280) was a carpenter and often cut his fingers. Nearly all elders in Comit\u00e1n suffered from the cumulative risk of and effects from manual labor. A handful of participants lacked some extremity (usually fingers and toes), which was more common among men than women, and in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Sometimes, occupational risk came home, as the spaces for work and living overlapped. For example, during one conversation with a 51 year-old farmer, his elderly father interrupted to ask him in Tojolabal about a container that he could not read. The informant read him the label: Paraquat, a pesticide used in this region in agriculture, to kill critters at home, and at times even to commit suicide. In this case, not only was the toxic substance stored at home, but accessible to household members lacking the language skills to identify the content and procedure for use. Occupational health problems were more common among men than women. Women's work-related complaints focused primarily on problems caused by hand-washing clothes. 272 These included back pain, arthritis, and respiratory problems. A few instances of women's accidents on the job did come up. A 75 year-old woman (274), who worked as a domestic servant for 25 years, burned her legs with boiling water. The case of do\u00f1a Susana illustrates. Do\u00f1a Susana: \"I fell. It was the beginning of the end\" A painful, work-related fall left do\u00f1a Susana, a 56 year-old woman (246) in delicate shape. Working in a large supermarket in town, she slipped on a recently-mopped floor, hurting her leg. She was then diagnosed with osteoporosis, and later broke more bones. In fact, her right leg had screws in it from her pelvis to her foot. She had to move with much care and the doctors recommended that she use a cane. She resisted, not wanting to call attention to her impediment. This accident, along with the dissolution of her marriage, plunged do\u00f1a Susana into depression. She cried much of the time (including during the interview), and only felt energetic and pain-free (especially headache) when medicated, which she did (with little supervision) on a daily basis. She also smoked, drank alcohol, and medicinal teas. She received a pension through the IMSS because her accident was work-related. She lived with a son, daughter, and 8 year-old grandchild, for whom she cared, taking him to school, cooking him meals, etc. In do\u00f1a Susana's mind, however, slipping on that supermarket floor was \"the beginning of the end.\" 273 J. Reproductive health problems In our opening exploration of health problems, women spontaneously mentioned a range of reproductive health issues. Initially, the most common reproductive condition they cited was hysterectomy. Later in the survey, we asked women specifically about health problems severe enough to warrant treatment that they associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium. Of the women surveyed, all but 1 had had children, and 9% of the women said they had experienced such a problem. (No corresponding question was included in the national survey.) The median age among women who had been diagnosed with a reproductive health problem (MA=63) was very close to that of those who had not (MA=62). The most often-cited problem, named by 6% of all the women, was a \"fallen bladder\" (vejiga ca\u00edda), thought to be provoked by an especially difficult birth or troublesome puerperal recovery. To a lesser extent, women mentioned abdominal pain, uterine problems, hysterectomy, miscarriage, and inflammation. Various women had had a hysterectomy, some performed back in their 30s. One 65 (010) year-old woman claimed to have had a hysterectomy following detection of a 2.5 kilogram tumor in her uterus. A male informant (299) described how his wife had a hysterectomy after a pap at the IMSS clinic revealed her cervical-uterine cancer. Beyond repercussions of earlier reproductive events, menopause represented a large portion of women's complaints. A 56 year-old woman (269) ascribed various problems to menopause, including her nervios, hot flashes, \"brain aches\", and ovarian pain. A 60 year-old woman (273) blamed menopause for her 274 nervios and difficulty sleeping, for which she consulted a doctor and took medication. (Menopause is discussed further below.) Some had more than one problem they associated with reproduction. A 64 year-old woman (256) had \"non-cancerous cysts\" removed from her vagina years ago. She also said that her eight childbirths resulted in her bladder hanging very low, so that she could no longer lift heavy things. Another woman, aged 57 (267), suffered from hot flashes for which she regularly took medication until she hemorrhaged. She also had, at one point, a large lump in her breast, and got a mammogram done in the state capitol, which revealed that it was not cancerous. Most of these women were not currently doing anything to address these conditions. It could be that these problems had been experienced years - even decades - ago and were no longer relevant; however, 4% of all women said they had an unresolved problem, and 3% described the condition as limiting their normal activities. A few described the long- term medical, economic, marital, and social repercussions of such health problems. Two women, for example, discussed their unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant. One had one child and the other remained childless; both were abandoned by their husbands. In some cases, the physical repercussions of these reproductive health issues had been resolved years ago, while the emotional scars remained. A handful of women shared lucid memories of the events precipitating these conditions. One, for example, had 6 living children at age 62, yet still recalled with tears in her eyes how she had given birth to twins, both of whom died shortly after birth. Her physical and mental recovery from this birth were grueling and at least the emotional repercussions remained. Compared to 275 hypertension, for example, comparatively few women experience this type of problem, yet it may cause them a disproportionate amount of suffering. Diagnosis and treatment may not be so difficult, yet require that providers have such conditions on their radar screen as possible and pertinent among elder - not only younger - women. 276 K. Menopause When asked specifically about menopause, 30% of all the women surveyed (and the proportion is higher among younger women, e.g. aged 50-60) had been told they had a problem that they related to menopause. Women who had had a problem associated with menopause tended to be younger (MA=57) than women who had not (MA=64). Of those who had,10% complained of sweats and hot flashes, 4% of heavy menstrual flow, and 4% of nervios. Some women experienced various symptoms concurrently. One 56 year- old woman (246) responded to the question on menopause with a discussion of her serious case of osteoporosis. She had already fallen and broken many bones, and now had to move with much caution, preventing her from working. While some women recalled past menopausal discomfort, many others presented menopause as a current health issue. At least 1 in 10 elder women (MA=55) were taking medication for a condition they associated with menopause; 1 in 10 (MA=56) had consulted with a physician within the past year regarding these concerns; and 1 in 10 considered their menopausal problem unresolved (MA=56), and/or said that it limited their daily activities (MA=56). Of just those with current or past menopausal difficulties, about half had consulted a doctor. (The national survey did not probe menopause.) Younger women were more likely than older women to have experienced menopausal symptoms: of all women who had, the mean age was 60 and the median was 57. For instance, a 55 year-old woman (042) had a blood clot in her leg that threatened to travel to her heart or head; her doctor said that it was a result of menopause. A 56 year-old 277 woman (265) had suffered through 4 years of dizziness and extremely heavy, viscous menstrual flow that she described in the graphic terms of \"a placental-like discharge.\" In contrast, an 80-year old woman claimed, \"I didn't have menopause.\" The granddaughter of an 85 year-old woman (034) contended that only non-indigenous (\"those who speak Spanish\") women went through menopause. This is how she explained that her non- indigenous mother-in-law suffered from menopause, while her indigenous grandmother had not. 278 L. Men's health problems While we did not ask men about their reproductive health, many did mention having had prostate and urinary problems. For instance, a 52 year-old man (284) complained of always having to urinate but not being able to do so. Despite medication, the problem persisted and limited his activities. Some men had had surgical procedures for prostate conditions. Just one man mentioned sexual dysfunction. This 53 year-old (285) informant was a musician, had toured with a nationally-known group, and had even gone to Miami to record an album. With much pride, he showed me photographs and album covers gracing his living room wall. Still sporting long hair, he helped his wife with her front-room store. The two of them described fairly openly how, since his return from the United States, he has suffered from impotence. He was seeing a private, upscale doctor for this problem, and seemed to have his wife's support in resolving it. 279 M. Mental health We asked informants to reflect on the frequency over the previous seven days that they had felt depressed or sad, happy, run-down, energetic, etc. The responses were very mixed. At least half felt happy and independent (meaning that they could get through the day without help) most of the time. On the other hand, 1 in 10 said that they were never independent. A quarter contended that, most of the time, others did not allow them to make their own decisions; however, over half said that they maintained complete reign over their decisions. About 3 in 10 said they nearly always had a hard time sleeping well. Another 3 in 10 felt very run down. Just under 2 in 10 said that they felt lonely most of the time, which seems low, given that many lived alone or with just one other person, and given that they embraced the opportunity to talk with us. Loneliness was hard to predict, though. One 90 year-old woman (005) lived with 9 other people, including children and grandchildren, but still felt lonely and sad without her deceased husband. In contrast, a 55 year-old man (260) had never married and had no children, yet never felt lonely. Nearly 2 elders in 10 said that they had a hard time remembering things, but there was no mention of Alzheimer's. Many people reflected on when this memory difficulty had begun, making onset of memory loss a potential culturally-relevant sign of aging. A few elders did mention some locally-defined mental distress in the form of espanto and nervios. A 55 year-old man described how, when he was a teenager, a sudden and intense scare (espanto) caused his body to swell and he became deathly ill. In other cases, it was poor physical health that provoked poor mental health. For example, high blood pressure was ascribed to emotional difficulties (e.g. 245) and stress. The son of a 280 54 year-old woman (263) who had had a debilitating stroke, said that his mother \"was not all there,\" that her anger and frustration about her physical limitations made her crazy. Providers confirmed the preponderance of mental health problems. A practitioner from the Centro Adelante, for instance, asserted, \"The problem here in Comit\u00e1n is not so much physical but mental. Most people suffer in their emotional state. They don't have mental and physical equilibrium, and their health completely decays because of it.\" And, according to the ISSTECH Clinic Director, \"the majority of illnesses are emotional and these set off other physical sicknesses.\" She continued, \"If they don't like something, they don't have the self-esteem to speak up. They keep it inside, prefer to put up with it.\" With the exception of difficulty sleeping, which was common among both sexes, women were worse off than men on all of these fronts, reporting more frequently than men that they were depressed, unhappy, over-extended, lacking energy, lonely, having trouble remembering things, less independent, and not allowed to make their own decisions. A few women (but not men) mentioned they had been treated for depression (e.g. 273). Feeling - most of the time - depressed, run-down, lonely, and having difficulty sleeping were less common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. On the other hand, feeling happy and energetic most of the time were also less common than nationally. (Memory, sense of independence, and decision-making were not probed in the national survey.) As in Comit\u00e1n, in the national sample, women were generally more likely to report negative 281 indicators of mental well-being. Table 6.4 shows women's tendency toward poor mental health as compared to local men. Table 6.4, Frequency of mental states based on self-perceptions, by sex. Felt most of the time or 4-7 days/week Women Men More common in women Depressed 30% Everything is Forgetful 21% as among men Difficulty sleeping 29% 30% More common in men Happy 41% 54% Energetic 33% 41% Additionally, older informants were more likely to report negative indicators of mental well-being. The most pronounced age difference was that among elders who never felt independent (MA=68) versus those who felt independent nearly all the time (MA=60). 1. Mental health in women When women mentioned feeling sad, depressed, stressed, or nervous, this usually came up in two main contexts. First, as mentioned above, nervios was cited by many women as a symptom they experienced in menopause. Second, a difficult marital relationship was also seen as provoking mental illth. It is very hard to pinpoint any one cause of poor mental health, due to the complexity of women's lives and stressors. Do\u00f1a Marina: \"Sick from too much family\" I spoke with a 50 year-old woman (254) in her yard. She had been hand-washing clothes, and dried her wet hands on her apron (permanent apparel for many women) before motioning me to sit on the cement step. This was not as easy as she thought it might be; her dogs were not comfortable having me in the patio, nor was I pleased with their presence either. Even when they settled down, it was a hot, humid day, and the buzzing of flies was abrasive. She was very suspect when we began, but opened up a bit over the course of the conversation. Her daughter-282 in-law and various young grandchildren listened in. She was born and raised in a rural corner of Comit\u00e1n. She never went to school, but worked instead in her father's cornfields and after marrying, in her husband's fields. She came to Comit\u00e1n less than a decade ago, and worked selling dishes, which she spread on the ground in the open market. Her son and his young family lived in the clapboard house next to the washbasin. She and a daughter lived in a hut downhill from this house. She helped care for her many grandchildren, thus her current washing. She explained that her health was poor \"from having too much family\" - 11 children, of whom 9 were still living. This workload, she was convinced, had resulted in her having uric acid, and the resulting pain in her joints prevented her from walking on occasion. She also blamed her situation for her cholesterol, \"bad blood,\" painful bones, and all the symptoms specifically probed (stomachache, cough, urinary problems, weakness, swelling in her legs, etc.). She had Popular Insurance and needed to visit a doctor every few months. The family received a basket of basic food (dispensa) every month at the kids' school, and she obtained $320 pesos/month via Progresa. When we discussed her mental health, her son - who never showed his face - bellowed answers from the clapboard house. \"How often are you depressed?\" I asked. \"Always!\" he shouted. \"Sad?\" \"Always!\" the man answered again. She explained that her husband drank a lot, so they were nearly always fighting. \"Who makes the decisions?\" Again, her son's voice, \"You do, because my father no longer exists for you!\" 2. Mental health in men Nervios and depression were alive and present among men, too. Men mentioned poor mental health mostly in connection to alcoholism, loneliness, physical decline, and inability to work. Nervios was mentioned by single men. Thus a 68 year-old man (016) who lived by himself frequently felt lonely and suffered from nervios. Men also mentioned poor mental health in the context of heavy drinking. A 59 year-old man (264) said that he had been an alcoholic, but that this affected him physically and provoked nervios. Depression was also provoked by not being able to work or even the fear of not being able to work. For instance, a 65 year-old man (253) worked as a mason for over 50 years 283 and suffered from broken and dislocated bones. Eventually, he also developed psoriasis, which forced him to stop working, and prompted his depression, depressed, smoking, and drinking. A 55 year-old man (249), overweight, unshaven, unkempt, diabetic, ran an auto parts shop and a driving school, but this business did not generate any income. He and his family lived off his wife's pension payment and they lived in a home lent to them by a relative. His inability to earn money made him feel eternally depressed, unhappy, and alone. He smoked a pack a day and drank quite a bit, too. He took Naproxen once a week for his pain. A 52 year-old man (270) who had a metalworking shop, said there was little work and he had to support 8 children. When he was out of work, depression and insomnia would hit him. Likewise, a 71 year-old man (234) used an old foot-pedal sewing machine to sew leather pieces for saddles, etc. His business had gone under a few years ago, and it was a horrible cycle of not having money to buy materials, and then having no work to do, and obviously, no products to sell. He became depressed, a heavy smoker (to his credit, he had curbed a heavy drinking habit years earlier), and his sleep was troubled by his nervios. Looking to the future, another leatherworker, this man just 54 years old (037), married with 5 children, feared that his waning eyesight, and growing aches would eventually prevent him working, the mere possibility enough to spark frequent sadness and depression. 284 N. Functional difficulties We asked elders about difficulty in performing 17 common physical skills: bending/squatting, raising arms above shoulder-height, pushing/pulling large objects, carrying items weighing over five kilograms, picking up small items, walking a few blocks and across a room, climbing stairs, standing up from a sitting position, lying down and rising from bed, getting dressed, bathing, eating, cooking, using the bathroom, shopping/doing errands, and taking medication. Table 6.5 highlights the most frequent difficulties, use of equipment (e.g. cane or walker), and help received. The use of any kind of equipment (e.g. wheelchair, cane, walker, etc.), while rare in general, was most common for walking several blocks and for walking across a room. Some had canes; a few - stroke victims - had wheelchairs. A 75 year-old woman (274) used her umbrella as a cane when she hiked up the hill from the bus stop to her home. Another woman used a broom stick. Support from others was received most often for walking several blocks and doing errands/shopping, with nearly 1 in 10 elders receiving help to overcome these functional limitations. Except for dressing and cooking, in which a spouse often helped, it was generally the elder's son or daughter who helped. Elders receiving help were usually assisted on a daily basis; daily help was most common for dressing, cooking, and doing errands/shopping. Men received help from their partner and to a lesser extent children, while women received help from children and, to a lesser extent, other relatives. 285 Figure 6.2, Photo, elder woman, blind and confined to a wheelchair Of those difficulties probed, the most common functional difficulty was bending over/squatting, which plagued half of the informants. About 3 of 10 had trouble lifting/carrying items weighing over 5 kilograms (such as a heavy bag of groceries), pushing or pulling large objects (such as an armchair), climbing stairs without resting, and/or walking a few blocks. Carrying things is especially key in this context because most elders had to transport basics materials for everyday survival - food, water (for drinking, bathing, and washing), and firewood/charcoal. The challenge of carrying things was compounded by informants' difficulty walking. As mentioned, most relied on walking to get around town, and even those using public transportation had to walk to the bus stop and back. Difficulty climbing stairs may indicate limitation in terms of climbing hills. Comit\u00e1n is a hilly city and traveling between home, clinic, and market nearly 286 always entails walking on an incline. A 60 year-old man (247), for example, lived at the top of an extremely steep hill. The street had finally been \"paved\" with a patchwork of cement squares, each striated so that people would not slip. The sidewalk to one side of the street was actually a series of stairs and small landings in front of entrances to the homes balanced precariously on the hill. My quadriceps burned after hiking up this hill, and I feared slipping on the way back down. This man, a career painter, had developed back problems, for which he was operated on, but which still bothered him. One of his legs would often numb, making it difficult for him to walk and do errands, as this entailed navigating the hill. While less common, a few other functional difficulties merit note. Around 2 in 10 elders experienced difficulty raising their arms above shoulder-height, standing up from a sitting position, lying down and getting up from bed, and/or getting dressed (including putting on shoes and socks). Additionally, at least 1 in 10 said it was hard to do errands/shop, pick up a coin from a table, walk across a room, bathe, take medicine, and cook. Fewer had trouble using the bathroom (including sitting down on the toilet and then standing up) and eating (entailing cutting up food and chewing, hard for those with dental problems). A few elders complained that what made bathing difficult was pulling buckets of water out of the chest-high tank and carrying them. Some must manage buckets of water to make the toilet flush, as well. Taking medication was challenging, one woman said, because the pills were too large to swallow. The Comit\u00e1n informants were at least as 287 likely and often more likely than their national counterparts to report functional difficulty, with the exception of climbing stairs and standing from a sitting position. Those with functional impairment/s were always older than those without, sometimes by many years. In fact, elders who found it difficult to raise their arms, push/pull large objects, lift/carry bags, pick up small items, walk across a room, stand from sitting, bathe, eat, use the bathroom, do errands, take medication, and manage their money all tended to be at least 7 years older than those who did not have such functional impairments. Similarly, those elders who had trouble walking several blocks, climbing stairs, cooking a warm meal, rising from bed, and getting dressed tended to be at least 4 years older than elders who did not have difficulty with such tasks. Figure 6.3, Photo, a \"donut\" to cushion elders' while seated in chapel. 288 Table 6.5, Functional difficulties, use of equipment, assistance from others.

Many elders had multiple difficulties, but it was still more common for women than for men to have 4 or more. Of the 17 functional difficulties, women were about as likely as men to report difficulty in 10 of them, and more likely to do so in the other 7. Women were especially challenged by bending/crouching, lifting/carrying, pulling/pushing, climbing stairs, walking several blocks, raising arms, standing up, and doing errands/shopping. A quarter of the men said they simply did not cook, regardless of ability to do so. Table 6.6 shows how, for many the functional difficulties probed in the survey, the rates among women are much higher than rates among men. In public health, illness often overshadows such functional difficulties, so that interventions to address them are overlooked. In Comit\u00e1n, however, there is a clear need to confront them, especially among women. Table 6.6, Functional difficulties by sex. Functional difficulty Women Men Bending, crouching, kneeling, squatting 60% 42% Lifting/carrying a bag weighing over 5 kgs, such as groceries 48% 24% Pushing/pulling large objects, such as an armchair 42% 29% Climbing stairs 41% 24% Walking more than 3 short blocks 38% 22% 290 O. Days bedridden Over the past year, 3 of 10 elders - more common among women than men - had spent at least one day bedridden due to poor health. About 1 of 10 informants had to stay in bed for over ten days in the past year. Informants in Comit\u00e1n - especially women - were more likely to have been bedridden than their national counterparts. These days spent \"out of commission\" were due to acute illness episodes, chronic disease, recuperation after surgical procedures, and accidents. Some had more than one problem serious enough to confine them to bed. For instance, a 75 year-old woman (274) had spent 35 days over the past year in bed, first due to recovery from her cataract operations, and later due to a very hard fall that harmed her face, shoulder, and side. During the previous twelve months, 35% of women, versus 19% of men, had been bedridden for one day due to illness or injury. Women were much more prone than men (25% versus 8%, respectively) to have spent between 1 and 5 days in bed, while men tended either not to have been bedridden at all, or to have been in bed for 6 or more days over the past year. Among those who spent more than 10 days in bed, there was little difference by sex. Men's bed-rest prevents those who still work from doing so, impacting household finances. In contrast, given their key role in the daily functioning of the household, when women are bed-ridden, the basic activities (eating, bathing, wearing clean clothes) of multiple people, indeed entire households, are circumscribed. 291 P. Physical activity, weight control, diet In terms of weight, nearly 4 in 10 informants wanted to lose more than two kilograms in the past year. This was slightly more common among women than men. The more well- to-do elders recognized that their \"rich\" diet exacerbated their health problems. A 59- year old man (018), for instance, said that he had high levels of uric acid due to all the meat he ate, and said he could stand to lose 20 kilograms of weight, which would be great for his blood pressure. A 51 year-old woman (045) blamed her husband's health problems (gall bladder, prostate, emphysema, etc.) on his hard-headedness in terms of his diet of soda and meat, seasoned with cigarettes. On the other hand, 1 in 10 elders had wanted to gain weight in the past year. Those elders who wanted to gain weight tended to be older (MA=64) than those who wanted to lose weight (MA=58). The less well-off also blamed their health conditions on diet, but in this case, on not eating enough or not being able to afford vitamin-rich food, due to financial constraints. The most common foods consumed are tortillas, chile or salsa, and beans, and the poor have little to balance this out. The veteran of the informants, a 104 year-old man (033), was quite wan and hunched over, his 85 year-old wife (034) just as slight. He said that they never had enough food, \"2 or 3 tortillas, that's all.\" When I asked about wanting to gain weight, he said, \"sure, but what am I going to eat?!\" Additionally, he could not chew food like meat because he lacked all but a few teeth. Another 68 year-old woman (038) explained, \"We are humble, so if you look at what we 292 eat, it seems like we are on a diet.\" Likewise, a 72 year-old man (299) has \"lost weight without wanting to.\" Over 6 in 10 informants claimed to have done some heavy physical work or activity an average of 3 times a week or more during the past 2 years, which is nearly double the proportion at the national level. Those who had done such exercise tended to be slightly younger (MA=60) than those who had not (MA=65). The difference between women of the two contexts is impressive, with almost 7 of 10 women in Comit\u00e1n doing heavy physical work, compared to 4 of 10 women in the national sample. Most of the time, simply performing their daily activities entailed considerable physical exertion, for example walking more than five blocks at a time or hand washing clothes for a half hour or more. A 54 year-old woman (041), for instance, said that she got plenty of exercise in her work selling clothing door-to-door. For the most aged, deliberate exercise was easier said than done. A 65 year-old man (243) was slightly overweight and wanted to lose weight. He lived within a block of a recreational park, and said that despite his best intentions, he never got out to walk. A few younger informants did make a conscious effort to exercise. A 59 year-old man (264) said that he ran. Others said they walked. One 56 year-old woman (269) said she regularly walked all the way up \"to don Belisario,\" referring to a statue of the city's namesake perched atop the highest hill on the edge of town. A 51 year-old teacher (287) and his wife went walking every morning before work. He also played soccer, as did a few other younger elder men. This kind of deliberate exercise was rare, but potentially a growing trend among the youngest 293 informants. More common was involuntary exercise through physical exertion at work and diet limited by poverty. Of white-collar workers, a practitioner from the Centro Adelante asserted, \"It's the little physical exercise that people do here. Their work is very sedentary. And when they do go out to exercise, they go out to the Boulevard [the busy, 4-lane Pan-American Highway, cutting through town], where there are so many cars and they are absorbing all the toxins from the automobile fumes.\" 294 Q. Smoking Among elders in Comit\u00e1n, 82% of men and 19% of women had ever (even once) smoked a cigarette. At the time of the survey, 33% of men and 3% of women still smoked (even just now and then), representing a large decrease in the numbers of smokers. Smoking was slightly less common among women in Comit\u00e1n than women nationally, but was a bit more common among men in Comit\u00e1n than men nationally. A full 24% of all men and 3% of women (13% of the entire sample) had once smoked or currently smoked a pack or more of cigarettes a day (MA=62). While the median age of elders who had ever smoked (M=62) did not differ from those who had not (MA=60), elders who still smoked tended to be younger (M=68) than those who no longer smoked (MA=64). Two elders noted local, therapeutic functions of cigarettes. A 64 year-old woman (019) explained that she had smoked a bit when she was younger to ward off insects when she was farming in a more tropical region of the state. A 67 year-old man (257) said he smoked only for curative purposes. Cigarette smoke (not necessarily smoking) is a component of some local healing ceremonies, if only an in-kind payment for a healer's services. Smoking of cigars, marijuana, etc. was not mentioned. No one mentioned smoking as a form of self-medication for depression or nervios. Many men were addicted to cigarettes and smoked throughout the day. In fact, a 54 year- old man (037) and his buddy smoked cigarettes during the survey. Others who smoked a pack a day or more over a decade ago had stopped or at least decreased their smoking 295 (e.g. 240, 251, 262, 271). A 65 year-old man (243) said of quitting, \"I smoked 60 cigarettes on the last day. That was 18 years ago.\" An 89 year-old man (250) had smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day. Some were motivated to cut down or quit by health problems. A 60 year-old man (296) used to smoke a pack a day, but had cut back to 2 cigarettes per day following two heart attacks and hypertension, among other problems. Those who had decreased their smoking cited health reasons, not financial reasons. (A pack of cigarettes costs about $25 pesos, perhaps one third of a minimum daily wage.) Some men still smoked, despite diabetes, respiratory and vision problems, and doctors' warnings. This was likely compounded by poor air quality in the workplace, for example sawdust in carpenters' shops and powdered cement on construction sites, as well as smoke from cooking fires and insecticide at home. The syndemic with the most far reaching impact, however, was smoking and drinking. \"The only problem I have suffered from is hangovers,\" began a 58 year-old man (248), laughing, when I asked about his health. He said he had been an alcoholic and a pack-a-day smoker, but stopped smoking 20 years ago and had cut back on his drinking. 296 R. Alcohol consumption Nearly all men and three quarters of women in Comit\u00e1n had ever (even once) drunk an alcoholic beverage. Those who had ever consumed alcohol tended to be younger (MA=60) than those who had not (MA=65). Elders in Comit\u00e1n were more prone to have drunk alcohol than their national counterparts, a difference especially marked in women, as having done so was nearly twice as common among women in Comit\u00e1n than women nationally. Many in Comit\u00e1n had stopped drinking (MA=63), yet over 6 of 10 men and 5 of 10 women in Comit\u00e1n still drank at least once a month (MA=60). Again, current drinking was more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally, especially among women (three times as common as among women nationally). Drinking had often been frequent, as in Comit\u00e1n, 1 of 10 informants (2 of 10 men) drank or had once drunk alcohol 5 to 7 days a week (MA=59). Comit\u00e1n is the birthplace of a number of locally-produced alcoholic beverages. There is a Superior beer distribution plant on the outskirts of town. There is a factory right in town, producing Comiteco, like tequila, from agave plants. Ironically, an 89 year-old man (250) had worked in this liquor factory, a source of employment and intoxication at once. Many small towns outside the city have stills producing aguardiente (cane liquor), thus elders' references to trago de Tzimol, and trago de Amatenango. El Charrito is a cheap, popular cane liquor packaged in a plastic soda bottle. Social events, like weddings, confirmations, holiday parties, celebrations after soccer games, etc. often include alcohol. Drinks are sold in bars, alcohol is served in restaurants, bottles and cases 297 are available in markets and corner stores. Most of the most serious alcoholics, however, drink locally-produced aguardiente, which is sometimes even sold in a plastic bag with the opening tied around a straw. A half liter of Charrito (pictured below) costs $7 pesos (about US$.60). Figure 6.4, Photo, discarded bottle of Charrito, locally produced cane liquor. As with smoking, a few elders mentioned local notions regarding the curative qualities of alcoholic drinks. A 98 year-old woman (261) took no medication for her hypertension or arthritis, but drank a bit of aguardiente daily as an aperitif, to calm her stomach. A 70 year-old man (300) said that the signs of diabetes are frequent urination and loss of eyesight, and that the best cure was to drink a bottle of tequila little by little over the course of a week. A well-known adage is, \"For all that's bad, drink mescal; for all that's good, do the same\" (Para todo lo mal, mescal, para todo lo bien, tambi\u00e9n.) In general, men drank more frequently and in larger quantities than did women. Men tended to drink aguardiente or beer. Of all men, when they most drank/drink, 12% had 298 consumed alcohol (without specifying the type of alcohol or exact quantity) until losing it, getting good and drunk, losing count, etc. Another 27% of all the men, when they most drank/drink, would consume a full liter or a whole bottle of aguardiente or 10 or more beers. Men readily admitted to have gotten to the point of drinking a case of beer or polishing off a bottle of liquor. A 52 year-old man (270) said that he used to get drunk 3 or 4 times a week, \"I have no control.\" A 58 year-old man (262) described his drinking like this: \"I used to drink up to 6 liter-bottles (caguamas) of beer in one sitting. I still drink, but I haven't gotten drunk in 24 years.\" Women, in contrast, were more likely to drink just 1 to 3 beers or cubas (hard alcohol mixed with soda). With the exception of one woman, only men (a number of them) admitted to having been and/or being alcoholics. Women often identified their husbands as (ex-) alcoholics. Elders also mentioned how some men literally \"died of alcohol\" (025). (The national survey did not include comparable data.) The Director of the Municipal DIF observed that their elder female patients complain predominantly about osteoporosis and pain, while men suffer from their alcohol and tobacco addictions with their consequences, such as vitamin deficiency. He told me, Here the incidence of alcoholism is really high - even in young people! 17, 15, 19 years old, and they are already dragging along a really serious addiction problem. There's a 12 year-old boy, and you say, \"why do you drink?\" \"Because my family taught me to drink Charrito.\" Among men, that's what we see the most - alcoholism. On the other hand, elders also discussed strategies they had used to curb their alcohol consumption. Because Protestant and Jehova's Witnesses faiths ban consumption of alcohol, while the Catholic church condones drinking, it was somewhat common for 299 those men who had converted from Catholicism to other religions to stop drinking and smoking. In fact, 69% of Catholic men still drank, while just 22% of men professing other religions still drank. A 74 year-old man (028), for example, quit drinking and smoking when he converted from Catholicism to the Pentecostal Church. A 72 year-old man (299) used to drink up to a liter of aguardiente, but stopped decades ago and never started again due to his Presbyterian lifestyle. Men also mentioned Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)38 as having helped them stop drinking. For instance, a 59 year-old man (264) said that he had been an alcoholic, drinking up to a half liter of Charrito every day, until he went to AA and stopped drinking 8 years ago. Another man, now 53 years old (280), once drank half a liter of alcohol 3 or 4 times a week, but stopped 17 years ago and even went on to found an AA group. 38 Comit\u00e1n is home to many AA groups, nearly one per neighborhood. Most groups meet a few evenings a week in simple rented spaces. A curtain in the doorway allows anyone to enter, but protects the identity of those inside. News of AA success stories travels by word of mouth, and is eventually heard by elders. 300 S. Alcohol and health repercussions Alcohol was cited as both a cause of stress and depression and a strategy - a sort of self- medication - for confronting such feelings. As mentioned in the section on mental health, alcoholism was cited as provoking nervios in men. It was also recognized as the direct and indirect cause of a wide range of physical problems, ranging from hangovers and lacerations to alcohol poisoning and diabetes. For instance, a 68 year-old man (259) said he had been an alcoholic, drinking one half to a whole liter of hard alcohol 3 or 4 days a week. Once, while drunk, he banged up his feet and ended up with an infection. Since then, his feet burned, and he had to walk around in flip flops. He went to the health center and they gave him medicine, but it would only clear up the infection for a bit before returning in full force. A 62 year-old (279) underemployed mason lived with two adults and two children, but felt lonely almost all the time because he never married and never had children. He drank 6 cubas about twice a week, but admitted to having ended up in the General Hospital for alcohol poisoning. Alcohol consumption linked to health problems was also related to work limitations in a vicious cycle. A 64 year-old man (255) had worked as a mason and street paver. He used to drink half a liter of trago de Amatenango a day, until his alcoholism - in his opinion - caused him to suffer a stroke at age 55. He was bedridden for a year after his stroke, and eventually recovered, but was not ever able to return to work again. In a few cases, onset of illness prompted a reduction in drinking, for example a 54 year-old man (283) had often drunk a case a beer in a single sitting (accompanied by 2 packs of cigarettes a day) until he developed diabetes, which moved him to cut back. Alcoholism in men had torn households apart; 301 these social/familial repercussions are addressed in Chapter 8. The following narrative illustrates the vicious cycle of drinking and social problems. El Maestro Bolo: \"I'm nobody. I have no one.\" I sat on the tailgate of a pickup truck to interview a man (291) who had no home at which I could knock on the door. He said he was 54 years-old; from his face, I would have guessed 65. He slept wherever he could find a roof, because he was very poor and has been rejected by his family. The problem: his alcoholism. He began to cry with my first question - \"What is your name, Maestro?\" \"I'm nobody. I have no one.\" He still had four brothers and one sister, but other brothers had \"died like dogs.\" Like a little boy, he talked about missing his parents and his grandmother. \"I took care of my parents, but there was nothing for me, not even a bit of land, not a house. My siblings were unjust with me.\" He mentioned that he had reacted violently to the frustrations they provoked. He had been married at one point, and had fathered three children. They were long estranged. His new family was a cohort of drunk men around the neighborhood. I had seen him more often drunk than sober, yet he was always respectful. Local residents knew him and some trusted him, such that he had earned himself the name, el Maestro Bolo, literally, \"The Master Drunk.\" He was a jack-of-all- trades, efficient at masonry, carpentry, gardening, plumbing. He would do odd jobs for enough coins to buy a bottle of hard liquor. \"I cannot sleep without my Charrito.\" His eyes were bloodshot, and his hearing was poor. His health problems were numerous: high blood pressure (\"my heart tweaks\"); pain in the head, back, and stomach; gastritis, cirrhosis. \"I confess that I vomit blood.\" His liquid diet left no padding, just bones and muscle. He did walk a lot. His teeth had been knocked out, and his arms were scarred. I asked if he ever went to the doctor. He said he enjoyed the favor of a local hospital doctor who also ran a pharmacy strategically positioned in front of the emergency room. When he last cut his arm on a piece of wood, this doctor cleaned up the wound and gave him pain killers. Now, Jehovah's Witnesses were attempting to save him. He attempted to go to their meetings. Try as he could, he was unable to keep phrases like, \"by God\" from drifting into his speech. In anticipation of going to the next \"meeting\" after talking with me, he had recently bathed and put on clean clothes, but a bittersweet alcohol smell mingled with the scent of the recent rain. 302 T. Non-health problems that impact health Most elders said that they suffered from social problems that negatively impacted their health. Financial problems were the most often lamented, although family difficulties were also frequently mentioned. To a lesser extent, marital and employment issues were cited. In general, women were more apt to concede that they had problems. Economic straits were mentioned by men and women alike. Nearly 1 in 10 informants admitted that they had a hard time managing their finances, i.e. stretching meager income over increasing expenses, which is more than among the national sample. About half of these received help from others to manage their money. Most able-bodied informants joked that they either had trouble managing money, or that this was not a problem - because they had no money! Women were much more likely than men to mention family and marital problems, while men discussed work issues. Men mentioned unemployment or underemployment as problems that greatly depressed them, for example manual laborers who could not find jobs. (The national survey did not probe such problems.) 303 Reflections on Chapter 6 Elders in Comit\u00e1n faced formidable health problems. In general, elders experienced both infectious disease (especially gastrointestinal infections) and non-infectious disease. They had to address the resulting acute illness episodes as well as chronic conditions. Hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes were common chronic diseases, which in some cases limited daily activities while going untreated and unsupervised by a physician. These chronic conditions required ongoing vigilance and care, yet health services had a high rate of attrition. Many elders had physically-limiting conditions, making it hard for them to accomplish everyday activities (such as tying their shoes and walking around the house), much less to get themselves to health care services. Some common problems, like falls, were very hard to predict, yet required immediate medical attention. Elders also faced conditions that might have been avoided with prevention, such as repercussions of smoking and drinking. Additionally, elders suffered from problems for which minimal care could greatly increase the quality of life, such as dental troubles, poor vision, and hearing loss. Challenges also arose from occupational hazards. Many experienced conditions that were not a focus of the local health services, such as pain, stomachache, and persistent cough, which were widespread, limiting, and often self- medicated. Mental health problems, also little emphasized in health care services, were frequent, with most elders suffering from insomnia, fatigue, loneliness, and memory loss. Reproductive health problems, a prominent focus in services for younger adults, were common in this older group, and some went untreated despite limiting daily activities. Menopausal symptoms and medication were common among women. Many men 304 complained of prostate and urinary problems. Non-health problems that impacted elder health included family and marital problems, work-related stress, and financial straits. Elders addressed these challenges with a wide variety of strategies, detailed in Chapter 7. Building on the previous one, this chapter offers a collection of baseline data regarding problems as experienced and seen by elders. Elders in Comit\u00e1n did report higher rates of certain health conditions than did their national counterparts, as outlined in Table 6.7. In many cases, however, the problems Comiteco elders faced were the same as those challenging elders nationally and even globally. In this case, this data represents an important confirmation of similarities in types of problems and conditions faced in old age. More importantly, even if the types of morbidity are similar to those affecting elders in other places, elders in Comit\u00e1n experience this differently, as the precariousness of local social capital, economic resources, and infrastructure made these ills especially burdensome to live with and challenging to address. Many contrasts are caused by their marginal living conditions, described in Chapter 5. Another realm of contrasts emerged from particularly circumscribed health care options, described in Chapters 7 and 9. 305 Table 6.7, Comit\u00e1n elders vs. national elders: contrasting problems & lifestyles. Compared to national counterparts, elders in Comit\u00e1n were more likely to experience: \u0001 poor perception of health \u0001 stroke \u0001 uncontrolled diabetes \u0001 arthritis with no current treatment and/or no recent physician supervision \u0001 cancer with no current treatment and/or no recent physician supervision \u0001 falls or bumps meriting medical care \u0001 persistent pain, fatigue, cough, stomach discomfort, urinary disorders \u0001 occupational health problems \u0001 unhappiness \u0001 lack of energy \u0001 functionally impairment \u0001 health problems requiring bed rest \u0001 alcohol consumption 306 CHAPTER 7. ELDERS AND CAREGIVERS TALK ABOUT ELDER HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES Overview of Chapter 7 Most of the maladies plaguing elders in Comit\u00e1n (see Chapter 6) did not differ greatly from those faced by elders in the United States and elsewhere; the context was the distinguishing factor. In Comit\u00e1n, elders confronted ill health with very limited social, economic, and structural resources, including extremely circumscribed health care strategies, detailed in this chapter. This situation not only made it difficult to avoid and address problems, but exacerbated them, as well. Many elders did not have - or never had - a stable, sufficient income. At the same time, most continued to work, despite the fact that this compounded health problems. Without money, even the simplest remedies or palliatives were beyond reach. Many elders had stopped taking necessary medication due to the cost. Beyond medication, the cost of items like diapers and eyeglasses was often prohibitive, forcing jury-rigged solutions (if any). Care, too, was out of the financial reach of many elders. Even when they sought care, the results were so uneven that they often bypassed medical consults. This made preventive and diagnostic health care very difficult, such that elders' conditions were often discovered at a very advanced stage, making treatment more difficult. Elders noted the vast gap between their needs and institutional responses to their social, economic, and health needs, a gap that widened as poverty increased. 307 In Comit\u00e1n, structural insufficiencies were numerous, while assistance from the government in the form of health services, groceries, and shelter was elusive if existent at all. Elders had to use precious economic resources to cover items and services that are provided, covered, or subsidized in other places. Without economic and structural resources, the basic requirements for health were hard to satisfy. Procuring safe drinking water meant buying it bottled or boiling it. Water supply, a necessity for cleaning, bathing, and washing clothes, was inconsistent and sometimes non-existent. Some elders spoke of their meager diets and malnutrition, and many did not have a refrigerator in which to maintain foods and medication cool. With precarious health and tenuous resources, elders might be fine until a catastrophic event - a fall, a stroke, a bad stomach bug - forced them to scrape up resources to pay for treatment, at the same time that their sudden inability to work prevented any income. Chronic health problems - mental and physical - also dried up resources, especially when these were drawn out over adulthood and into old age. Functional limitations encumbered some, while others were hindered by pain and weakness, a few were bed- ridden. In other words, health expenses could be unexpected, significant, and long-term, yet many elders were in a position of having to worry about their next meal, rather than how they might pay for an acute episode or long-term illness. Elders endured economic dependence on top of functional dependence, looking to their grown children, spouse, and siblings to cover expenses, and therefore subject to others' decisions about care. 308 However, elders' social support networks were also growing threadbare, a situation I discuss further in Chapter 12. In the face of these challenges, elders pieced together a m\u00e9lange of care, generally ordered in a clear strategic sequence from home remedies and self-medication, through pharmacies, and then to doctors as a last resort. Initially, elders tried home remedies, including herbal teas, infusions, salves as well as changes in behavior around diet, bathing, and movement. In terms of prevention, some took vitamins and supplements to make them \"stronger.\" If this did not work, they would then go to a pharmacy and pay out-of-pocket for medication that came with some advice from the person behind the counter. Given that elders believed that medicine would cure them, and that pharmacists gave advice and medication directly, unlike doctors who charged for the visit and still required elders to then find and buy medicine, it is little wonder that elders patronized pharmacists before consulting doctors. Both self-medication and pharmacy visits have no medical supervision. Barring improvement of health status at home via the measures mentioned, uninsured (and some insured) elders turned to urgent care at the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital or a private doctor's office. Even those with insurance critiqued the coverage and some voted with their feet, preferring private physicians. Despite obvious faith in biomedical care, many elders did not \"comply\" with doctors' orders, opting to self-regulate for a number a reasons including lack of money and perceptions that doctor's orders were not appropriate for their conditions. For major problems, the majority would go to the General Hospital, an institution that does not purport to be 309 equipped for such a large chunk of the population. If they needed assistance at home, elder men turned to their wife, while elder women turned to other elder women, often a sister. The Casa-Hogar (see Chapter 9) was a last resort for elders in their final years. Some elders resigned themselves to \"divine will,\" leaving their health in God's hands, as their own hands were empty. In the following chapter (8), I note how women not only suffered disproportionately from health problems, but how they faced more pronounced disadvantages in terms of economic and structural resources, as well. This chapter, combined with the previous two (5 and 6), presents the products of formative research stages 1 and 2, in terms of identifying and defining problems to be addressed. These chapters elucidate the unique nature of elders' experiences, needs, and resources in this context. This data is essential for clarifying frequent misconceptions upon which care has been based in the past, and necessary to inform the next stages of formative research, in which stakeholders would generate and critically assess intervention options, a process I describe in Chapters 10 and 11. Figure 7.1, Photo, holding hands. 310 A. Elder care strategies in Comit\u00e1n 1. Health insurance In Comit\u00e1n, 64% of elder informants were covered by health insurance. As explained in Chapter 3, there are various types of insurance. IMSS covered the 18% of elders (MA=63)39 who were insured as private sector employees/retirees or immediate relatives of one. So, for example, a man who had been employed for years as a gas station attendant and a woman who had worked in a supermarket were covered by IMSS. ISSSTE, available to federal government employees/retirees and immediate family, covered 16% of elders (MA=63); while ISSTECH, for state government employees/retirees/family, covered 5% (MA=64). ISSSTE and ISSTECH were available, for instance, to public school teachers and their elder parents. Many IMSS, ISSSTE, and ISSTECH beneficiaries were insured not through their own employment, but via their working children. Private medical insurance was less common (11%) (MA=60). Another 11% were otherwise insured (MA=59), most of them having recently signed up for the new Popular Insurance program, a government initiative to reduce select medical expenses among the uninsured population. One informant had military medical coverage through her son, a soldier. Over a third of the informants (36%) had no medical insurance, and so had to rely on the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital, the local Health Center, the DIF, or private practitioners for care. 39 Median age. See note in Chapter 5. In this case, for example, \"(MA=63)\" indicates that the median age of those informants who were insured by IMSS was 63 years. 311 In terms of gendered trends in insurance coverage, the only noticeable distinction was that it was slightly more common for women than men to hold a private insurance policy. Distinguishing the two contexts, insurance through IMSS was over twice as prevalent among the national sample as in Comit\u00e1n, while private insurance was more common in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Those without insurance sadly shook their heads from side to side as they heard the list of possible providers; some pursed their lips while others interjected that they wished they had some coverage. Even among insured elders, however, there was discontent, and often elders chose to forgo insurance-based services in favor of other care options. Popular Insurance, the nascent government effort to cover those still uninsured, was already critiqued by its guinea pig enrollees. A common complaint among elders in Comit\u00e1n was that Popular Insurance did not cover, or only partially covered, medication they considered both indispensable and expensive. For instance, a 53 year-old woman (275) with Popular Insurance complained that it did not cover her diabetes medication nor her eye drops. Similarly, a 65 year-old man (253) had enrolled in the Popular Insurance program with the hope that it would cover his medication and visits to the health center and hospital for his hypertension and psoriasis. He lamented that he still had to pay $20 pesos per visit and $480 pesos for a tube of psoriasis cream. Other elders were unhappy with the quality of care to which they had access. For instance, a 92 year- old woman (231) said that she no longer went for her hypertension check-ups because she was unconvinced of the services at the Health Center, where her Popular Insurance would 312 subsidize her expenses. Further, she shirked institutional support in general because, \"it's a lot of back and forth and I don't like the meetings\" (referring to mandatory orientation meetings required of enrollees in some assistance programs). Those covered by other government services had similar complaints. Faced with diabetes, persistent cough, arthritis, and abdominal pain, a 75 year-old woman (274) with access to the IMSS clinic (via her daughter's employment) chose instead to go to the Health Center. Another woman, aged 56 (269), held ISSSTE coverage, but said that they did not always have her hypertension medication in stock, forcing her to buy it out of pocket. The 50 year-old woman (235) who had access to the military health care through her son chose instead to see a private physician for her diabetes. Some elders combined their insurance benefits with care from non-insurance-based providers. A few elders were covered by more than one insurance policy, and could choose between them. Health service providers were also aware of the multiple strategies used by elders to access services. For instance, the ISSTECH staff mentioned that some of their beneficiaries were also covered by ISSSTE or IMSS, yet opt to attend the ISSTECH. On the other hand, they also noted that some elders who were slightly better off financially would consult private physicians when they did not feel well-served in a particular institution or when their appointments seemed to them too far apart. In sum, elders in Comit\u00e1n compare, contrast, opt for, combine, or eschew insurance and non- insurance options, and then vote with their feet. 313 2. Care in case of health problems We asked elders where they would go for care if they had a minor health problem (e.g. a cold [gripa]), as well as if a major health problem (e.g. a heart attack) arose. In both cases, informants mentioned more than one possible type of care. Elders consistently opted for biomedical practitioners and other sources of medication over alternative medical practitioners, such as herbalists, bone-setters, and healers. Most informants could talk about care for minor health problems from their recent experience (see Table 7.1). In such cases, 5 of 10 informants self-medicated, while another 1 of 10 went to a nearby pharmacy to inquire about and purchase recommended medication. About 2 of 10 visited the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital or the Health Center. Fewer visited private physicians or an insurance-based clinic (IMSS, ISSSTE, ISSSTECH). Some said they would not seek care at all. Those who opted to go to a pharmacy (MA=57) or self-medicate (MA=59) tended to be younger than those who sought any of the insurance-based services (MA>64). For minor health problems, men were more likely than women to self-medicate, while women were more likely than men to go to the General Hospital or to a private practitioner. The most marked difference between the two contexts in terms of care seeking for minor health problems was the much greater tendency to seek care from IMSS among the national sample, not surprising given the higher proportion of national informants who had access to IMSS. 314 In contrast to minor health problems, major health problems, like a heart attack or other emergency, were less frequent, requiring many informants to speculate about potential care, rather than recount strategies in actual emergencies. Some mentioned more than one potential destination. Unlike minor troubles, major health problems prompted negligible intention to self-medicate. Instead, 6 of 10 informants asserted that they might go or be brought to the General Hospital, including some elders who had access to the insurance-based clinics. Nearly 3 of 10 might end up at insurance-based clinics (IMSS, ISSSTE, ISSTECH), while about 2 of 10 thought they would seek private medical care. Table 7.1, Care in case of minor and major health problem. Highest rates are shaded. Care for minor problem % Care for major problem % Self-medicate 53 2 Pharmacy 9 <1 General Hospital/Health Center (SSA) 19 61 Private physician 13 22 IMSS 7 12 ISSSTE 5 12 ISSSTECh 3 4 Alternative practitioner 1 1 Would not do anything 5 1 Does not know what care s/he'd seek 0 2 Note: Some informants mentioned >1 type of care; thus, the sum of the %s > 100. A few elders did talk about actual past experiences. Some began their acute episodes in the hands of a private doctor, but then transferred to the Hospital due to financial constraints. For example, a 57 year-old woman had a health emergency and went to see a private doctor, who diagnosed a near heart attack. She was hospitalized in his clinic, but 315 later had to move to the General Hospital when the bills piled up. Just a handful mentioned the Red Cross, which is located in an area of the city lacking any other major general medical clinic. Geographic proximity may have played a role in the case of a 52 year-old man (284), who, years ago, had an allergic reaction to ground squash seeds (pepita) including severe stomachache, for which his family rushed him to the Red Cross. Finally, while very few, a handful of participants gave a startling response: \"I have no idea where I would go,\" revealing a total lack of contingency plan for acute medical emergencies and severe health problems. Compared to their national counterparts, informants in Comit\u00e1n were less likely to believe they would go to the IMSS or private health services for a major health problem. Probable destinations in case of major health problems were not particularly gendered. 3. Recent physician consults Elders were asked how frequently they had consulted health care providers in the twelve months prior to the survey. Sixty-five percent had seen a physician at least once, including 12% who had done so more than 10 times in the previous year. Many had consulted a physician at a government-run clinic or hospital (SSA, IMSS, ISSSTE, ISSSTECH). Others had sought a private practitioner. Over the course of the study, participants mentioned at least a half dozen \"preferred\" local physicians, all men. About half of these doctors worked in a government clinic and had a private practice on the side. Some private physicians charged patients on a sliding scale, gave out free medication (often samples left by drug reps), and/or were flexible regarding payment form and timeline with those short on cash. 316 For instance, an 80 year-old woman (001) swore by her long-time physician in Las Margaritas, who, suspecting her empty purse, did not charge her at all. Having visited a doctor over the previous year was more common among women than men. The proportions of elder men and women in Comit\u00e1n who had recently consulted a doctor are comparable to those among the national sample. 4. Curative vs. preventive care and diagnostic screening Elders visited doctors (public and private) for anything from a medication prescription for a lingering cold to chronic disease (e.g. hypertension) monitoring, to acute illness episodes (e.g. a serious injury or suspected heart attack). The great majority of visits were aimed at curative, rather than preventive care; however, elders had gotten some diagnostic screening done. Of note are statistics on breast, cervical-uterine, and prostate screening. In Comit\u00e1n, 16% of elder women had ever had a mammogram or an x-ray of their breasts, not much less than their national cohort. Those women who had done so tended to be slightly younger (MA=57) than those women who had not (MA=63). However, 27% of elder women in Comit\u00e1n had examined their breasts for lumps monthly in the previous year, which is less than the 37% of the national sample that had done so. Again, those women who had examined their breasts seemed to be younger (MA=58) than those who had not (MA=62). In terms of detection of cervical uterine cancer, 46% of women in Comit\u00e1n had a Pap done in the past two years, compared to 62% of women nationally who had ever had this done. Women who had a Pap done tended to be much younger (MA=58) than those who had not (MA=65). 317 In contrast to women in Comit\u00e1n, who seem to be worse off compared to their national counterparts in terms of these preventive measures, 23% of men in Comit\u00e1n had had a manual exam or a blood test to detect prostate cancer in the previous two years, which was actually slightly more than the 16% of their national cohort that had done so. Further, while older women had lower rates of cancer screening than did younger women, men who had been screened for prostate cancer tended to be older (MA=67) than men who had not (MA=59). 5. Dental care Another common area of health care seeking was dental care, as 36% of elders had seen a dentist (MA=59), which was higher than nationally. Some people who had not seen a doctor had seen a dentist. In fact, 11% had not seen a doctor, but had seen a dentist over the past year. A full 86% of elders were missing teeth, evidencing of both poor dental hygiene and the common strategy of extraction in cases of dental problems. 6. Recent hospitalization About 10% of the elders in Comit\u00e1n had been hospitalized in the previous year. Of these, 6 in 10 had spent between 1 and 3 nights there; 2 in 10 had spent 4 to 10 nights; and 2 in 10 had spent 11 or more nights (MA=68). Of those hospitalized, about 5 of 10 had been inpatients in the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital, while 2 of 10 were in ISSSTE/ISSSTECH clinics, 1 of 10 in the IMSS clinic, and 1 of 10 in a private hospital. Hospitalization in 318 the IMSS and ISSSTE was more common among men than women. A handful of elders had been transferred from a secondary care facility in Comit\u00e1n to tertiary care facilities in Tuxtla (the state capitol, about 2.5 hours away) or Mexico City (about 14 hours away). Informants in Comit\u00e1n had been hospitalized in a Ministry of Health (SSA) institution (i.e. the General Hospital) much more than their national cohort, and were much less likely to have been hospitalized at IMSS and private hospitals. The rate of hospitalization over the previous year was nearly double in women (14%) than men (7%). 7. \"Non-compliance\" or self-regulation Having consulted a physician or even having been hospitalized did not ensure that elders \"complied\" with physicians' recommendations and prescriptions. In fact, despite lack of a pointed question about this topic on the survey, many elders volunteered that they had not followed doctor's orders. For example, a 92 year-old woman (231) who had bad headaches was diagnosed with hypertension at the Health Center, and was given medication to control her blood pressure. When she found that the pills upset her stomach and failed to alleviate her headaches, she stopped taking them. Others also cited ill effect on the stomach as the motivation to forego medication. Further disincentives were high cost and low perceptions of need, as in the case of a 60 year-old man (294) with asthma, who put aside his medication due to its expense and the feeling that he had had his breathing under control. Likewise, a 64 year-old man (286), who contracted rheumatic fever did not finish his treatment due to lack of money. A few elders were convinced that medication was noxious for the body. Others admitted that there was not 319 really any reason to stop medicating; they just did. For instance, a 51 year-old woman (278) with hypertension consulted a doctor at the IMSS clinic, yet stated, \"I just stopped taking it.\" These unfinished courses of treatment may lead to recurrence, and in the case of antibiotics, to resistance. Finally, some - even with chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes - simply did not take any medication, do any exercise, or adhere to any diet. Those who were asymptomatic swore that doing nothing in response to their illness was the best strategy. 8. Complaints about health services In many cases, elders were unhappy with health care services. They cast a wide net of critiques: low quality of care, excessive bureaucracy, unreasonably long waiting times, poor interpersonal skills among providers, lack of medication, absence of providers, and differences in perspective regarding treatment. While some elders were not amenable to taking medication because they thought it toxic to the body, the majority expected to receive medicine or a prescription as an output of their doctor's visit. In fact, many stated that the goal of the trip to a clinic was to obtain medication. Some medication was conceptualized as controlling existing conditions, such as hypertension, while other medication was perceived as risk-reducing. For instance, elder women often visited the ISSSTE clinic on a monthly basis to obtain calcium pills, their perceived defense against osteoporosis, an ailment they had heard of and feared. 320 Given this reliance on pharmaceuticals, it is not surprising that lack of medication was among the most common complaints regarding health care services. This complaint was voiced by both the uninsured population who relied on the Health Center, as well as by insured elders who had access to the IMMS/ISSSTE/ISSTECH clinics. A 64 year-old woman (019), for example, had visited the Health Center but received no medication there. She concluded, \"there is nowhere to go for care.\" When medication was not stocked at their clinic or hospital, elders were forced to look elsewhere, and then to pay the full out-of-pocket price. Also distraught over the lack of medicine at the Health Center, another woman, aged 53 (030), was moved to go to a private physician or straight to a pharmacy, where she obtained the pills that she took daily. Of ISSSTE, too, a 56 year-old woman (269) noted that her hypertension medication was not always available, forcing her to buy it out of pocket. Even when the clinic's own pharmacy did stock medication, some doubted its quality and preferred to buy it for full price from a private pharmacy. While some elders lamented lack of medication, others were irked by absence of service providers. At times, providers were on staff, but were not available when elders needed them. For instance, a 72 year-old woman (299) complained that the IMSS often did not carry necessary medication, and lacked some essential services in Comit\u00e1n. In order to access radiation treatment and specialists for her uterine cancer, she had to travel to Tapachula and Tuxtla (both hours away), respectively. She added that she once broke her 321 femur in the month of December, and had to seek a private physician to operate on her because the IMSS staff had already left for Christmas vacation (which usually extends from December 15 into early January, especially for physicians' well-off families). In general, this woman said, \"I'm just very tired of having to wait so long, many minutes and many days.\" Others were similarly put-off by the personnel shortages in the General Hospital, such as a 53 year-old woman (275) who had recently been released from an 8- day diabetes-related hospital stay and missed a scheduled consult because the staff had been on strike. Another 66 year-old man (011) was frustrated by the non-existence of a traumatologist on the IMSS staff and went to Guatemala seeking treatment for his bad knee. Even when providers were in-house, a few informants registered complaints (sometimes officially) about the low quality of care and unsatisfactory interaction with staff. For instance, a 62 year-old woman (238) complained about the ISSSTE clinic, saying that the care was poor, there was a lot of paper shuffling and back-and-forth (vueltas), long waits for appointments, and that the physicians working there did not get along, which negatively impacted the patients. She had registered official complaints with the clinical director, as had at least one other informant, a 72 year-old man (240). Beyond the (non-)availability of medication and personnel, a few questioned of the purpose of treatment. For instance, the daughter of an elderly couple (299) observed that the medication that doctors had prescribed for her parents' various health problems, \"only 322 treats the pain, not the underlying condition.\" She called for \"special medicine,\" hoping for curative, not palliative results. Others were wary of health care, sometimes seeing it as iatrogenic. A 74 year-old woman, for example, was convinced that her eyesight had deteriorated after she donated blood to a relative years ago. Likewise, a 53 year-old man (280) was operated on for angina and blamed this procedure for his subsequent hearing loss. In some cases, the negative association between health care and subsequent health problems was enough to discourage further care seeking. For instance, following a Pap smear, a 64 year-old woman (256) developed pain around her waist, associated this with the procedure, and had decided to avoid such testing in the future. Given these doubts and inconformities, it is not surprising that many elders - 35% - had not seen a physician at all over the past year. Further, when asked to consider the previous 5 years, about 20% of informants had suspected a serious health problem but did not consult a doctor (MA=60), behavior which was over twice the rate found among their national cohort. Lack of money was the primary reason for foregoing a visit to the doctor. A 74-year old woman (031), for instance, had been told by a doctor that she had diabetes, \"but,\" she said, \"I don't believe it, and I don't have any money anyway.\" The other most common justifications for opting not to visit a physician were (in descending order of frequency): excessive travel or wait time, the conviction that it would not help, fear of diagnosis, resistance to bothering anyone to bring him/her, and embarrassment about being seen by practitioners or about other people learning of one's problems. In a few cases, other people (usually adult children) stepped in and decided that the elder should not seek care. While the 323 median age did not differ among those who did and did not balk at seeking care for most of the reasons cited above, those who avoided care because they thought it would not help tended to be older (MA=66) than those who did not cite this reason (MA=58). Likewise, elders who did not seek care because someone else decided that they should not do so tended to be older (MA=66) than those who did not cite this reason (MA=59). Women were more likely than men to avoid consulting a physician despite suspecting a serious problem because they were ashamed of being seen by practitioners, worried that others would learn of their health problems, and scared of what the doctor might find. For instance, a 57 year-old woman (035) feared her shoulder pain was due to heart problems, and preferred not to find out. In contrast, men were more likely than women to avoid consulting a physician due to the time commitment and to not wanting to bother anyone to bring them. Indeed, transport to and from health services was mentioned as a problem for some, only rarely resolved by home visits. Unable to walk due to fractures, dislocations, swelling, and itching in his legs, an 88 year-old man (244) had to be seen by a private physician who would make the trek to his home, located in a hilly part of town with unpaved streets. Nationally, financial limitation was also the most often cited reason for not consulting a doctor. However, belief that the consult would not help, fear of the diagnosis, and not wanting to bother anyone to take them were more frequent in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. For instance, the tendency for women to believe that the consult would not help was twice as high in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. 324 B. Alternative care Seeking physicians' services and complying with doctors' orders were just two options among a range of possible care strategies. Some elders opted for alternative care, including alternative practitioners (e.g. healers and herbalists). Others sought care and medication outside Comit\u00e1n, out-of-state, and even internationally. Most chose home remedies, self- medication, and pharmacy visits. 1. Alternative practitioners Comit\u00e1n is home to a number of alternative health care providers, known locally as traditional medical practitioners (m\u00e9dicos tradicionales), including healers (curanderos), bone-setters (hueseros), and midwives (parteras). While local elders were more prone than elders from their national cohort to have consulted them over the past year, the proportions were quite low compared to those who had opted for physician and dental visits, self-medication, and pharmacy consults. Specifically, of elders in Comit\u00e1n, 14% had been to a healer, 11% to a bone-setter, 7% to an herbalist, and 2% to a traditional birth attendant in the past year. Those who went to healers went repeatedly, perhaps a function of the healers' mode of operation, which may entail repeated treatment, or treatment that is spread over the course of multiple visits. For example, an 80 year-old man (282) had been to a healer 10 times in the past year for knee problems. Some elders who had access to IMSS/ISSSTE/ISSTECH still went to healers, such as a 56 year-old woman (269) who got her legs and waist massaged a few times a year. Generally, those 325 who had consulted an alternative practitioner, and especially those who had done so repeatedly, over the past year, tended to be older than those who had not. Alternative practitioners draw on a number of approaches and tools. For instance, a 51 year-old woman (045) had suffered from arthritis and was \"prone to diabetes,\" but four years ago, she joined a group called \"Health, Faith, and Hope,\" operating out of a local Catholic parish. The group practiced alternative medicine under the direction of a 90 year-old physician from the distant state of Cuernavaca, who saw patients and prescribed herbs, massages, exercise, and urine therapy. Her health problems had subsided, and she lauded the treatment for her recent mentally tranquility, as well. In a few cases, treatment regimes and material seemed exotic, for example, in the case of a 51 year-old man (237) who drank bull's blood from Guatemala to try to heal a bum foot. More often, however, elders narrated the failure of biomedicine and an eventual miracle cure - effective and affordable - via an alternative practitioner. For instance, a 60 year-old woman (022) whose face became swollen went to doctors in Comit\u00e1n and then in Mexico City. They all told her that there was nothing wrong with her. Finally, a woman gave her \"some leaves\" which cured her. Likewise, a 74 year-old man (028), when younger, had burning pain in his head and blotches on his face. His physical and emotional suffering nearly pushed him to suicide. He traveled to Mexico City for care, where he went to four different hospitals, until finally a \"special\" private doctor prescribed a $25 peso herbal medicine that cured him. 326 2. Care-seeking outside Comit\u00e1n As mentioned a few times, a few elders sought care and cures outside Comit\u00e1n. Some preferred practitioners in neighboring towns, such as the 80 year-old woman (001) who left the city limits to consult her long-time physician in Las Margaritas (about 20 minutes away), and, when he was not available, the familiar faces at the Health Center in Las Margaritas. A 65 year-old woman (010) with asthma contended that the medication in Comit\u00e1n did not work, and so she traveled to Tuxtla (3 hour trip) to see a doctor who prescribed pills and an inhaler \"that really worked.\" Others - 5% - had traveled outside the state for medical treatment in the previous twelve months. One common destination was Guatemala. (Comit\u00e1n is just a few hours from the Guatemalan border, and crossing for the day is easy with proof of Mexican citizenship). These elders and their families must absorb the cost of the trip and all medical expenses accrued in Guatemala. Another frequent destination for medical care was Mexico City. Government clinics referred elders to specialists at the tertiary level in Mexico City, and transport and care were sometimes even covered by insurance. However, more common than formal referral was elders' disillusion with local health care, provoking the decision to travel to the nation's capitol on one's own wallet to seek help. Some elders who could not travel (and some who could) sought medication from out-of- state anyway. In fact, 8% had bought or sent for medicine or some remedy outside Chiapas in the past year. For instance, a 53 year-old man (280) who had access to IMSS 327 had chosen not to see a doctor, but rather went to the pharmacy once a month and regularly took Naproxen (an anti-inflammatory). When this failed to calm his headaches, he had someone buy him Sucrol (actually an antidiabetic [generic name Aspartame]) in Guatemala. Seeking services and medication out-of-state was slightly more common among men than among women. (No national data was collected on these strategies.) 3. Home remedies, self-medication, and pharmacy visits While perhaps reluctant to visit a physician or other practitioner, even when they were quite worried about their health, elders still sought relief. Elders in Comit\u00e1n used self- care, self-medication, and pharmacy consults (either in conjunction with or instead of formal medical care) as both a first course of action in response to an illness or injury episode and as an ongoing strategy for managing chronic health problems. At home, elders worked on controlling their diet, for instance cutting down on salt for hypertension, curbing their coffee and chili pepper intake for gastrointestinal and liver troubles, and foregoing soda for obesity and diabetes. Some preferred herbal remedies (whether eaten whole, brewed into tea, forming a pumice, dried and burned, rubbed over or applied directly to the body) over pharmaceuticals, even in cases of chronic disease. Others lauded the healing properties of lime juice, honey, tequila, and other common household edibles. One 80-year old woman (001) plagued by headaches and dizziness said that when she felt this coming on, she would take a lukewarm shower, and tie fresh, cool leaves to her head using a bandana. For her arthritis, she would drink mint or fennel tea. 328 Self-care refers to home remedies, including not only consumption or avoidance of substances believed to have medicinal value, but also modification (promotion or limitation of) of various behaviors including work; exercise and mobility; rest and sleep; diet; prayer; interaction with other people; wrapping, bandaging, and massaging affected body parts; contact with heat, cold, and water (bathing, washing clothing), and so on. Elder women, especially, were well-versed in home remedies, and could recommend a tea or a salve for just about any physical complaint. Self-medication (operationally defined as to consumption of pharmaceutical products without a prescription or medical supervision) was widespread. In the case of a minor health problem (like a cold), 62% of men and 45% of women opted to self-medicate over consulting any type of health care provider. With little distinction between men and women, 37% of elders in Comit\u00e1n self-medicated at least once a week, including 10% of the entire sample who did so 4 or more times a week over the previous month. (No comparable national data is available). Regardless of whether or not they were taking anything else, some elders took vitamins regularly as a risk-reduction strategy. Others decided to \"de-parasite\" themselves once in a while. Most pharmaceutical intake, however, was aimed at alleviating pain, cold symptoms, and gastro-intestinal discomfort. While the majority of quests for medical material were limited to the local environs, 11% of elder men and 5% of elder women had bought or sent for some medication or natural remedy from outside of the state of Chiapas. 329 Common self-administered pharmaceuticals included: Desenfriol (a multi-symptom cold medicine) for Prodolina and Neo- Melubrina (dipyrone, an anti-inflammatory and pain relief medication banned in the U.S.), and aspirin for pain; Alka Seltzer and Picot (antacids) for gastritis; and Terramicina (an anti-bacterial [oxytetracycline]) for stomach troubles. Many people took these multiple times per week, usually without any doctor supervision or consult. In fact, many elders combined their regular prescription medication with their self-prescribed substances. For instance, a 60 year-old man (296) said he took something like Terramicina, Picot, or Desenfriol daily, along with his hypertension and diabetes medication. Chronic pain, especially, pushed men and women alike to take pain relief medication on a daily basis. For example, a 54 year-old woman (041) fell about a year ago, slicing open her forehead. She suffered from headaches ever since. She went to Mexico City for studies, but the doctor there said that the pain was psychological. Her pain was severe and she took pills for it nearly every day. A 58 year-old man (262) also took aspirin nearly daily for his headaches. Elders also take vitamins and supplements, sold in pharmacies and by door-to-door venders. Self-medication was abetted by visits to pharmacies. Pharmacy consults were extremely common among elders Comit\u00e1n. In the case of a minor health problem, 9% of informants opted to consult someone in a pharmacy over a provider. Over the previous year, 34% had consulted a pharmacist or, much more likely, a pharmacy employee. 330 Nearly 10% of all the elders had done so more than 10 times in the past year. Informants in Comit\u00e1n were three times as likely as their national cohort to have consulted a pharmacy. Men had consulted pharmacies more than women (43% versus 28%). In addition to buying medication and medical supplies (easily available with or without a prescription), and sometimes even having an employee apply the medication (e.g. some gave shots), individuals asked pharmacy employees (few of whom hold any medical or professional degree) about what to take. Once obtained from a pharmacy, information, medicine, and medical material then became part of the household arsenal for combating illness in any household member. People saved unused medication, shared medication, took it for subsequent episodes of the same and other symptoms. Written physician prescriptions circulated like bank notes, serving as proof of diagnosis, a memory device, a paper trail. A practitioner from the Centro Adelante asserted, ...Here the pharmacies.... People of this age mainly are the ones who self- medicate, the elders. For example, the other day, we went to a pharmacy. In just a little bit, 3 or 4 people had come in. \"I want something for headache.\" And the pharmacist goes, and not only does he give them something for headache, but something else for fever. And still another bottle for nervios. Before they know it, the bill is $300-400 pesos when $300-400 pesos seems too expensive to consult a doctor. And many keep their prescription for 6-8 years. Elders (and younger adults) often built trusting relationships with pharmacy owners and employees, as they might with a physician. Some justified this trust on the basis of actual medical training received by the pharmacy owner, an employee, or even a relative of one 331 of these individuals. Although the insurance-based clinics had their own pharmacies, elders noted that their medication was often out-of-stock, so that they were forced to buy from private pharmacies anyway. Recently, generic products sold at \"Similar Pharmacies\" have been gaining support. A 51 year-old woman (276) said, \"I go to the pharmacy... The Similar Pharmacies, because it's cheaper.\" Some elders took quite a cocktail of pharmacy-prescribed medication. One 62 year-old woman (025), for example, claimed that her stomach burned from taking so many pills. She never went to the doctor, but instead went to the pharmacy at least once a week to buy medication. A few elders noted that the quality of medication varied from the clinic pharmacies to private pharmacies. As mentioned above, even when a clinic pharmacy did stock medication, some paid out-of-pocket for medication that they perceived as higher quality sold in private pharmacies. Importantly, pharmacies are nearby and accessible, do not require appointments or waiting time, are tended to by individuals who are happy to make recommendations, and always have medication in stock, all features absent in government services that elders intensely critiqued. Crystal clear is that pharmacies play crucial - yet so far unrecognized, little supervised, and rarely supported - roles among all elders - men and women - in Comit\u00e1n. Don Ruben's case illustrates the complex web of multiple health problems, risky lifestyle behavior, and choices regarding medication. Don Ruben: \"I've got a bad head, a bad heart\" At his wife's coaxing, don Ruben (296) agreed to sit and talk with me. He described his 40 years as a mason, carpenter, and electrician, a sort of jack-of-all- trades. He was very proud of having built their home. He \"retired\" eight years ago. He admitted he often drank bottles of booze in a day, but asserted that he cut his pack-a-day smoking habit down to two cigarettes a day since he began feeling unwell. \"My health is as low as the ground,\" asserted don Ruben. Three months 332 ago, he developed hypertension, \"a bad heart\" and \"a bad head.\" He had an electrocardiogram done in the General Hospital just two weeks prior. They prescribed medication, \"but I'm going to throw it out because I don't feel any better.\" When he walked, he became short of breath. While all this began three months ago, he later mentioned that he had had two heart attacks in the last two years. In one case, he passed out, hitting his head as he fell. His family revived him with rubbing alcohol and took him to see a private physician, who told him that, \"a vein in your heart is not pumping anymore,\" and prescribed him medication. He also had \"sugar [diabetes] - a little, not much.\" He continued to take medication for this, but felt it was not controlled. Additionally, he took five pills a day for knee pain. His stomach bothered him, too. He calculated that he had lost 16 kilos in the past year. \"I can't sleep. I see things that aren't there. I can't remember anything.\" His wife added, \"he loses his keys all the time.\" Everyday, he took over-the-counter pills from the pharmacy (Terramicina, Desenfriol, Picot, etc.), in addition to prescribed medication. Because he no longer worked, his wife and children paid for his medical expenses. 333 C. M\u00e9lange of care An accurate description of elders' strategies is a m\u00e9lange of care, whereby individuals pieced together practitioners and medication at home and beyond. To illustrate, a 74 year-old man (028) maintained that pills hurt the body, yet he took his hypertension medicine faithfully, as well as over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, such as Voltaren, which his granddaughter, a nurse, recommended for him. Additionally, he self-medicated his gastritis with \"natural pills\" that he obtained from out-of-state through friends. He had also been to a bone-setter and had had priests pray for his health. Another man, aged 68 (016), suffered from rheumatism, kidney problems, and loneliness. Over less than a year, he had consulted a doctor, a healer, and pharmacy employees, and had self-medicated. Likewise, a 65 year-old man (243) had been to a chiropractor for back pain and a Texas hospital for surgery after being stabbed in Ciudad Juarez. For heart trouble, he had been to the ISSSTE hospital in Mexico City, as well as to healers and then a compadre who prescribed orange blossom tea, which helped him within four days. Every day, he also took 14 capsules of Herbox, a natural medicine, for his gout. A final example is a 73 year-old man (006), a carpenter who suffered from a variety of problems, including hypertension, back pain, and chronic respiratory symptoms, who had also pieced together care strategies. He took medication and did exercise for his hypertension, stopped smoking and took steam (temascal) baths when his respiratory symptoms acted up, dieted to control his arthritis, cut down his alcohol consumption in response to his \"critical economic situation,\" and consulted his local pharmacist a few times a month. The only constant was his avoidance of physicians, whom he said, \"are no good for anything.\" 334 D. Decision-making about health Who ultimately makes the decisions regarding an elder's health care? While it seems fairly straightforward that elders, as adults, should make the decisions about their own health and care, only 58% did so on their own (MA=62). Instead, 14% said that s/he and her/his partner had equal influence (MA=58), and 9% said that his/her partner made all the decisions (MA=59). A full 16% said that a son or daughter had the most sway in his/her health-related decisions (MA=66). Those whose adult children had the most influence over their decisions tended to be older than those who made decisions on their own or in concert with their spouse. (Granted, it is not clear that these younger adults' decisions would differ drastically from those made by the elders themselves.) Surveys and interviews made it clear that elders' children and spouses were aware of elders' health problems and ready to discuss them. These tendencies were more pronounced among married informants. Those few elder men whose health-related decisions were made by their wives and children tended to be in a precarious state of health, while women's decisions were made by others even when they were relatively well. For example, a 54 year-old widow (041) who sold clothing door-to-door, lived with 2 of her 4 grown children. Her children took care of her, supervised her activities, and made all decisions for her. Her son even chose which blouses she should wear. In other cases, the weight in decision-making had shifted. For instance, a 51 year-old woman (045) used to suffer from nervios because her husband bossed her around, but they took a couple relationship course together and she \"was freed\" from this dynamic, and asserted, \"now I call the shots!\" 335 E. Out-of-pocket medical expenses Decision-making about health was often related to who covers health-related expenses. Out-of-pocket medical expenses can be prohibitive, especially for more economically- and socially-marginalized elders. In fact, many elders said they did not have enough money to consult a physician, and 37% had stopped taking a necessary medicine during the previous year due to its high cost, nearly three times the 13% of the national sample that had done so. In Comit\u00e1n, foregoing medication was slightly more common among women than men. Hypertension medication is an apt example. A 60 year-old woman (024) said that her hypertension was under control while she took her medicine, but that when she did not have any money (which was frequently), she could not afford to buy her medication. Some could not even afford to take medication sporadically, like a 68 year- old man (242) with IMSS coverage, who had completely stopped taking his hypertension medication due to the cost. Others spent a great deal of their income on medication. For instance, a 60 year-old man (007) who had had a partially paralyzing stroke, hypertension, and diabetes was covered by ISSSTE, but spent $900 pesos a month out of his own pocket on medication for his blood pressure because there was insufficient stock of this medication at the ISSSTE pharmacy. Finally, prohibitive costs forced some to face difficult decisions, as in the case of another ISSSTE beneficiary, a 56 year-old woman (269), who asserted that her hypertension medication was not always available, forcing her to buy it out of pocket. Already taking an expensive medication for colitis, this forced her to choose between eliminating either the blood pressure medication or her colitis medication. She chose to go without the colitis medication, but struggled with the 336 choice between treating her hypertension, which she considered more serious but less symptomatic, versus her colitis, which she viewed as less serious, but quite painful. The cost of care and medication likely produces what providers view as \"non-compliance.\" In terms of payment for the majority of medical expenses in the previous year, 42% of the informants covered all of their own costs (MA=60), while 13% received contributions from his/her partner (MA=55). Another 18% said that his/her son covered these expenses (MA=67), while 9% said that his/her daughter did so (MA=65). Reliance on children was higher in Comit\u00e1n than nationally. Sometimes help from relatives to cover medical expenses had strings attached. For instance, a 75 year-old woman (274) with many health problems (including diabetes, chronic cough, abdominal pain, arthritis, vision problems, and a myriad of symptoms) said explicitly that her daughter paid for her medical care, in exchange for the care this elder woman provided for her granddaughters. Very few people successfully avoided out-of-pocket medical expenses and dependence on others to help cover these costs. In fact, just 13% said that they had had no medical expenses in the past year, because they never needed care/medication, or never sought care/medication, or were covered completely by insurance. Men were twice as likely as women to have covered their own expenses, while women were more likely than men to rely on their children or spouse, a pattern that echoing national trends. 337 F. Care and support outside the clinic Health-related support for elders surpasses participation in decisions and help covering expenses. As mentioned, many elders faced physical limitations that made everyday living difficult, and for which some were aided by other people. For elders with the functional limitations probed in the survey, support from others was received most often for walking several blocks and doing errands, with 9% of informants receiving help to overcome each of these two difficulties. Assistance ranged from running an occasional errand to round-the-clock comprehensive support. Some elders needed logistical support, such as translation, money management, and guidance through health care (e.g. to complete insurance paperwork, translate at doctor's appointments, keep track of medication regimens). Some, like don Vicente, needed a combination of help, including mental health care, palliative treatment, and help with functional impairments. Don Vicente: \"His life is to sleep.\" Don Vicente (232), 92 years old, had never gone to school. He had spent most of his life farming outside of Comit\u00e1n with a brief stint as a night guard for offices in Comit\u00e1n. His health was fine until he suddenly became sick with diarrhea at age 89. He lost all his strength and had been bedridden since. He could not walk, suffered from body ache and leg pain, had asthma, poor memory, and no energy. His physical state plunged him into depression. Don Vicente's young (aged 50) wife dedicated herself to his care, as their four children did not support them at all. She had him hospitalized in the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital, but when she saw no results and they had run through all of their money, she defied doctor's orders and brought him home. At home, \"his life is to sleep.\" She occasionally got him out to sit in the yard, but moving him was difficult, and to be seen by a doctor, she had to pay for a private physician to make a house calls. An herbalist had been able to get him to eat and move around a little more, but his services cost, too. The couple had become progressively poorer. At one point, they received a monthly basket of groceries (dispensa) from the DIF, but this support mysteriously ceased. His wife applied for other aid programs, but had seen no results and was very frustrated with the health care system. Their income was 338 down to the $500 pesos a month she earned by babysitting for two young toddlers whose mother worked. Essentially, this woman had to provide fulltime care for her invalid husband while supporting them economically, with sporadic and insufficient public assistance. She was tired and depressed by the situation. Except for dressing and cooking, in which a spouse often helped, it was the elder's son or daughter who provided the bulk of elders' support. Very few mentioned support from siblings. Frequency of assistance for anyone actually receiving help was usually daily, and daily help was most common for dressing, cooking, and doing errands/shopping. While most caretakers had no formal medical training, many elders did have a remote relative or an acquaintance with some healthcare related experience. A 52 year-old man (270), for example, felt comfortable consulting a son who was studying to be a dentist. Others had a nurse in their extended family. A small number (4%) of informants in Comit\u00e1n were helped in their daily activities (walking, bathing, cooking, running errands) by a domestic servant. Domestic servant assistance, when it existed at all, tended to be available at least 5 days a week for over 3 hours per day, but was usually focused on food preparation, clothes washing, and cleaning, rather than more personal care and mobility. (No comparable national data exist on domestic service and eldercare.) Some home-based caregivers helped more than one elder, as in the case of a young woman who aided both her 98 year-old grandmother (261) and her 50ish year-old mother. Caregivers mentioned how tiring elder care could become. For instance, the daughter of a couple, both 72 years old (299), was the only remaining unmarried daughter, and was therefore expected to live at home and care for her aged parents. This task was getting harder and harder, as her father had multiple health problems (nearly deaf, blind in one eye, with 339 hypertension and arthritis) as did her mother (cervical-uterine cancer and difficulty walking). Her mother already required help going to the bathroom and bathing. Her father helped a bit. This daughter requested participating in the study as she was frustrated, worn out, and concerned by her parents' health. She appreciated the opportunity to vent her feelings, as well as to have her voice, and her parents' voices heard. In other cases, elder care was an extended family project, as in the case of a 54 year-old woman (263) who had a stroke, was wheelchair-bound, used diapers all the time, and who \"was not all there.\" She needed help for all functional difficulties, plus changing her diaper and moving her. The only ways this woman could help in her own care was to hold on with her good hand when lifted, and turn slightly to her side when her diaper was changed. Her needs were so extensive that her care was split among her five children, daughters-in-law, and even her daughter-in-law's mother. In terms of an extra-domestic support network, three quarters (8 of 10 women and 7 of 10 men) had relatives, friends, and/or neighbors who lived in Comit\u00e1n from whom they thought they might receive occasional light help, such as picking up something from the store or bringing food in the case of illness. The majority of those who might provide this type of assistance were relatives. It was slightly more common for women than men to count on relatives, while it was slightly more common for men than women to count on non-relatives. (There is no directly comparable national indicator.) Support with health-related needs was predominantly provided at home by relatives. Beyond home and clinics, elders mentioned few other institutions that had truly 340 influenced their physical health for the better. Religious groups were one source of support in times of illness. A 51 year-old woman (276), for instance, had found a little consolation from a support group out of a local Catholic parish. Except for the role of (non-Catholic) faiths in reducing alcohol consumption, organized religion seemed to play a bigger role in women's well-being than men's. Perhaps the equivalent health support network for men is Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). AA is very strong in Comit\u00e1n, with \"chapters\" in nearly every barrio holding meetings multiple nights per week. A few elder men mentioned that not only had they successfully overcome their drinking problem with the group's support, but that their health had improved with their sobriety, and that they were even able to go on to help other alcoholics. The third non-domestic, non-clinical public space that has helped many elders (although only one man was included in the survey) was the Casa Hogar Sagrado Corazon, the only retirement home in Comit\u00e1n (described in detail in Chapter 9). The Casa Hogar, truly the last hope for everyday care and housing for abandoned elders, aided its aged residents to function within an environment in which residents and staff formed the only family these elders knew. This was the case for don Tom\u00e1s. Don Tom\u00e1s: \"Finishing a second lifetime\" Don Tom\u00e1s, 98 years-old (295), was originally from the neighboring state of Tabasco, and had come to Comit\u00e1n as a teenager. He sold bananas for a few years and then went into the navy. At one point, he married a beautiful and rich woman who left him. He had no children with her or anyone else, and as an adult, 341 his only brother was killed. These events turned him to drink, and he became an alcoholic. Eventually, he died. His body lay in the street, and the Red Cross was summoned to pick up the cadaver. Somehow, between his resting place on the street and the morgue, bouncing in the back of a pick-up truck, he came back to life. The Red Cross contacted the nuns who (at the time) ran the Casa Hogar. The nuns picked him up and brought him back to the Casa Hogar. That marked his first day of a new life as a sober, middle-aged man. He then worked as the home's gardener, carpenter, and fix-it-man. He lived very independently until he turned 90, when his health problems set in: prostate problems, difficulty breathing, poor vision, nearly deaf, no teeth, pain, a stroke, and then depression. A volunteer doctor visited him once a month in the Casa Hogar, which paid his medical and other expenses. He was confined to a wheelchair and was extremely thin. Sometimes a friend or a God-child visited him, but essentially the staff and residents of the Casa Hogar had become his family. 342 G. Support elders provided to others 1. Type of support, recipient, frequency While many elders received support in their daily activities, many provided support to others who faced functional difficulties. (See Table 7.2.) A handful helped their spouse. For example, the oldest informant, a 104 year-old man (033), took care of his nearly blind 85 year-old wife (034), who had a number of health problems and functional difficulties. To do their shopping, he claimed to walk a mile and a half uphill to the market, which I did not believe until I saw him striding back home one day. He held a walking stick in one hand, had a woven Tojolabal satchel over his shoulder, and two dogs on his heels. Elders who assisted others were most likely to have helped a relative other than their spouse. Some took care of their elderly parents. For instance, a 62 year-old woman (238) helped her sister (who lived just a few houses away) to care for their 86 year-old mother (239), who no longer walked, was almost blind and nearly deaf, extremely depressed and angry, and used a diaper. Another woman, aged 55 (036), told of how her mother's stroke had forced her family - her father, siblings, everyone - to re-structure their lives in order to care for her. Some informants had already spent years - decades - caring for others, and probably had decades to go before they were released from this charge. For instance, a 65 year-old man (243) had been caring for his wife for 17 years, due to her stroke. 343 Table 7.2, Support provided by elders to others. Support provided % helping in the previous month Age of person helped % who helped daily Walk/move at home 19 elder or child 10 Shop/do errands 18 elder or adult 7 Bathe 17, more \u0001 child 6 Walk outside 16, more \u0002 elder <1 Lay down/rise from bed 15, more \u0001 elder or adult 8 Eat, cut up food 15 child 6 Dress, shoes/socks on 14, more \u0001 elder 8 Cook 13, more \u0001 elder or adult 8 Use the bathroom 13, more \u0001 elder, adult, or child 7 Take medicine 13 elder 5 Manage money 6 elder or adult 2 Child under 3 years of age. Other elders (rather than infants, children, or adults) were the most common recipients of elder assistance. The activities for which elders most often provided assistance were walking/moving at home, shopping/doing errands, and bathing. In general, those elders who provided such support tended to be younger than those who did not. Men were much more prone to have helped someone walk outside. Women were more likely than men to have helped someone bathe, lay down/rise from bed, get dressed (including putting shoes and socks on), cook, and use the bathroom. There was little distinction by sex in helping to walk inside, shop/do errands, eat, take medicine, and manage money. (Informal support that elders provided to others was not probed in the national survey.) Of the entire sample, 19% were happy with the amount of informal support they provided; 10% wanted to help more; 8% wanted to cut down on the support they provided (the others said that they had not assisted with these tasks in the previous month). Informants used the 344 survey as an opportunity to vent their frustrations. A 59 year-old man (289) pleaded for some remedy for his wife's diabetes \"because she is always tired and in a bad mood.\" Likewise, the daughter of an 86 year-old woman (239) with incontinence lamented the endless cycle of buying and changing her mother's diaper, sighing, \"she pees too much.\" Women were slightly more prone than men to say that they would rather not have to help so much. Men, on the other hand, were slightly more likely than women to say that they wanted to help more. For instance, a 56 year-old woman (269) left in charge of her infant grandson, said that she was \"tired\" of this dynamic. This may have to do with the gendered tasks performed by men versus women (discussed in more detail in Chapter 8). Another gender distinction in terms of care provided by elders to others was that women tended to help their daughters (in-law) after birth. 2. Health problems limit ability to help others, helping aggravates health Half of those who provided such functional assistance to others (representing a full 19% of all informants), without much difference by sex, felt that their ability to provide assistance to others had been limited by their own health problems. For instance, a 53 year-old woman (275) with debilitating and acute diabetes herself, pooled her efforts with her 4 siblings to care for her diabetic mother, who had just had a leg amputated. She also had to care for 3 grandchildren while her daughter worked. She could barely take care of herself, and felt her diabetes worsening with this load of responsibility. In other cases, providing elder care actually prompted or aggravated health problems in elders, as in the following case. 345 Do\u00f1a Delia: \"I can't keep this up, but I can't stop either.\" The fatigue of one 50 year-old woman (008) was evident from the look on her face. She had worked in her front-room store for over 20 years, but recently this income had become vital, while tending the store had become more difficult. Her 62 year-old husband had suffered a stroke the previous year so that she found herself having to help him, aiding him in all of the activities mentioned above and more, while trying to keep her store open 14 hours a day to make ends meet. She wished she could cut back on the support she provided because it was taking its toll on her health, which then limited her ability to care for her husband. She had high blood pressure and constant headaches. She used glasses but her vision was still bad. She had had a hysterectomy, but suffered from hot flashes, leg pain, and body aches that she ascribed to menopause. Doctor's visits and medication had not helped with any of these problems. The one daughter - of 4 children - who lived close by was unable to help much either. This woman was in the first year of caring for her husband and already nearing the end of her physical, emotional, and financial rope. She sighed, \"I can't keep this up, but I can't stop either.\" 346 H. Expected ills in challenging circumstances prompt strategic care sequence Most of the maladies plaguing elders in Comit\u00e1n did not differ greatly from those faced by elders in the United States and elsewhere; the context was the distinguishing factor. Contrasts in care seeking between elders in Comit\u00e1n and their national cohort are listed in Table 7.3. In Comit\u00e1n, elders confronted ill health with very limited social, economic, and structural resources. This situation not only made it difficult to avoid and address problems, but exacerbated them, as well.40 Table 7.3, Comit\u00e1n elders vs. national elders: contrasts in health care seeking. Compared to their national counterparts, elders in Comit\u00e1n were more likely to have: \u0001 Been uninsured in the past year \u0001 Opted to seek care at SSA rather than private services for an acute health problem \u0001 Sought dental care in the past year \u0001 Been hospitalized at SSA institution (i.e. General Hospital) rather than private/IMSS \u0001 Suspected a serious health problem but not consult a doctor \u0001 Avoided medical consult based on the belief that the consult would not help, fear of the diagnosis, and not wanting to bother anyone to take them \u0001 Stopped taking a necessary medicine during the previous year due to its high cost \u0001 Relied on their children to cover medical expenses in the previous year Many elders did not have - or never had - a stable, sufficient income, be it from salary and/or pension. At the same time, most elders continued to work, despite the fact that this compounded some health problems and lengthened recovery time. Without money, even the simplest remedies or palliatives were beyond reach. Many elders had stopped taking necessary medication due to the cost. Beyond medication, the cost of items like diapers and eyeglasses was often prohibitive, forcing jury-rigged solutions (if any). For 40 Trevi\u00f1o-Siller et al. (2006) and Salgado de Snyder et al. (2005) came to similar conclusions based on studies in other regions of Mexico. 347 instance, an elder might obtain a pair of eyeglasses from someone else and then use these for decades without an exam or an update. Care, too, was out of the financial reach of many elders. Even when they sought care, the results were so uneven that they often bypassed medical consults. This made preventive and diagnostic health care very difficult, such that elders' conditions were often discovered at a very advanced stage, making treatment more difficult. Elders noted the vast gap between their needs and institutional responses to their social, economic, and health needs, a gap that widened as poverty increased.41 In Comit\u00e1n, structural insufficiencies were numerous, while assistance from the government in the form of health services, groceries, and shelter was elusive (if existent at all). Elders had to use precious economic resources to cover items and services that are provided, covered, or subsidized in other places. Without economic and structural resources, the basic requirements for health were hard to satisfy. Procuring safe drinking water meant buying it bottled or boiling it. Water supply, a necessity for basic hygiene, bathing, and washing clothes, was inconsistent and sometimes non-existent. Some elders spoke of their meager diets and malnutrition, and many did not have a refrigerator in which to maintain foods and medication cool. 41 Elders with the lowest income are those who have the least opportunity to participate in support programs, self-help, and institutional recreation. This exclusion weakens their social networks. (Trevi\u00f1o- Siller et al. 2006) 348 With precarious health and tenuous resources, elders might be fine until a catastrophic event - a fall, a stroke, a bad stomach bug - forced them to scrape up resources to pay for treatment, at the same time that their sudden inability to work prevented any income. Chronic health problems - mental and physical - also dried up resources, especially when these were drawn out over adulthood and into old age. Functional limitations encumbered some, while others were hindered by pain and weakness, a few were bed- ridden. In other words, health expenses could be unexpected, significant, and long-term, yet many elders were in a position of having to worry about their next meal, rather than how they might pay for an acute episode or long-term illness. Elders endured economic dependence on top of functional dependence, looking to their grown children, spouse, and siblings to cover expenses, and therefore subject to others' decisions about care. However, elders' social support networks were also growing threadbare, a situation I discuss in depth in Chapter 12. In the face of these challenges, elders pieced together a m\u00e9lange of care, obtaining a bit of assistance here and a bit of support there. For the more than a third who were uninsured, this was a necessity. In general, care-seeking was ordered in a clear strategic sequence.42 Initially, elders tried home remedies, including herbal teas, infusions, salves as well as changes in behavior around diet, bathing, and movement. In terms of prevention, some took vitamins and supplements to make them \"stronger.\" If this did not work, they would then go to a pharmacy and pay out-of-pocket for medication that came 42 George Collier found that this care seeking sequence parallels that common among marginalized indigenous residents of the Central Highlands of Chiapas (Collier, G., personal communication, 2007). 349 with some advice from the person behind the counter. Given that elders believed that medicine would cure them, and that pharmacists gave advice and medication directly, unlike doctors who charged for the visit and still required elders to then find and buy medicine, it is little wonder that elders patronized pharmacists before consulting doctors. Both self-medication and pharmacy visits have no medical supervision. Barring improvement of health status at home via the measures mentioned, uninsured (and some insured) elders turned to urgent care at the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital or a private doctor's office. Even those with insurance critiqued the coverage and some voted with their feet, preferring private physicians. Despite obvious faith in biomedical care, many elders did not \"comply\" with doctors' orders, for a number a reasons including lack of money to perceptions that indications were not appropriate for their conditions. For major problems, the majority would go to the General Hospital, an institution that does not purport to be equipped for such a large chunk of the population. If they needed assistance at home, elder men turned to their wife, while elder women turned to other elder women, often a sister. The Casa-Hogar (see Chapter 9) was a last resort for elders in their final years. Some elders resigned themselves to \"divine will,\" leaving their health in God's hands, as their own hands were empty. In the following chapter, I note how women not only suffered disproportionately from health problems, but how they faced more pronounced disadvantages in terms of economic and structural resources, as well. 350 Reflections on Chapter 7 This chapter, combined with the previous two (5 and 6), represent the products of Formative Research stages 1 and 2, in terms of identifying and defining problems to be addressed. These chapters elucidate the unique nature of elders' experiences, needs, and resources in this context. This data is essential for clarifying frequent misconceptions upon which care has been based in the past. Table 7.4 outlines 20 commonly-held assumptions about elder well-being and care, and how the formative research illuminated these misconceptions. Correction of these misconceptions is necessary to inform the next stages of Formative Research, in which stakeholders would generate and critically assess intervention options, a process I describe in Chapters 10 and 11. 351 Table 7.4, Assumptions versus reality evidenced via formative research. ASSUMPTIONS REALITY EVIDENCED VIA FORMATIVE RESEARCH Elders had their basic survival needs covered. No the case, even water supply was inconsistent. Some suffered from meager diets and malnutrition. Having worked all their lives, elders were financially prepared for their later years and no longer needed to work. The majority were still trying to make ends meet, the men in farming, construction, and carpentry; the women doing domestic and caring work. Many operated small shops out of their homes. Scarcity was a defining facet of life, and many had seen a decline in prosperity over time. Most lived in a modest cement-block, often belonging to their children. Many cooked with firewood or charcoal, had no indoor water faucet, refrigerator, or washing machine. Few had property to draw on for emergencies, long-term care, or even to pass on to their children. Poor elders could count on government assistance. Only one quarter had received public assistance in the past year. The gap between elders' needs and institutional responses widened with poverty. Elders were ensconced in large, caring households. Over a quarter lived alone or with just one other person. Over a third were widowed, divorced, or single. Nearly a quarter had two or fewer living kids. Many were lonely; a few were outright abused and even abandoned. Elders could count on extensive extra-domestic support networks. While many had relatives, friends, neighbors who might provide occasional light help, few believed that they could count on these acquaintances for significant support. Support for psychological and physical health needs was provided in clinic by physicians. The little support elders got was predominantly provided at home by close relatives. Beyond home and clinics, a few elders mentioned other institutions that had truly influenced their health for the better: religious (especially Protestant) groups and Alcoholics Anonymous. Elders could count on health insurance to cover their health expenses. Over a third were uninsured. Even those with insurance found coverage confusing and insufficient, with medication not covered, too expensive, or out of stock. Even when insured, tenuous resources meant that elders might be fine until a catastrophic event - a fall, a stroke, a bad stomach bug - forced them to scrape up resources for treatment, while preventing them from working. Chronic health problems - mental and physical - dried up resources, too, especially when drawn out over adulthood. Health services targeted and addressed elders' most common and limiting health problems. Services targeted diabetes and hypertension, yet the most common problems were dental troubles, mental health issues, and chronic symptoms, like pain, cough, stomachache, and fatigue. Even diabetes and hypertension often went uncontrolled and unsupervised by a physician, even when they limited elders' daily activities. Infectious disease was no longer a concern for the elderly. Elders faced conditions spanning acute and chronic conditions, both infectious and non-infectious in nature. Infectious diseases - especially those affecting the respiratory and digestive systems - plagued elders, predisposed them to later chronic disease and exacerbated chronic disease. Elders relied on alternative health care. Elders rarely sought alternative care (herbalists, bone-setters, and healers) outside the home. 352 Table 7.4, continued, Assumptions versus reality evidenced via formative research. Because there were clinics available in the city, access to and quality of care was not a problem. Elders were unhappy with health care services due to: low quality of care, excessive bureaucracy, long waiting times, poor rapport with providers, lack of medication, staff shortages, and differences in perspective regarding treatment. In the past year, over a third had not seen a physician at all and one fifth had suspected a serious health problem but did not consult a doctor, citing lack of money as the primary reason. Over a third had stopped taking necessary medication due to its high cost. Elders were non- compliant as they avoided consults and instead self-prescribed and self-medicated. Given limited resources and poor quality health services, elders used self-care, self-medication, and pharmacy consults as both a first course of action for an illness or injury episode, and as an ongoing strategy for managing chronic health problems. Over a third self- medicated at least once a week, including one tenth who did so 4 or more times a week. Nearly one tenth consulted a pharmacy employee (rarely trained) over 10 times in the past year. There was no home-pharmacy-physician communication or coordination. So, rather than elders being non-compliant, they were self-regulating in a context of scarcity. Health care satisfied preventive needs. Most elder health consults were aimed at curative and palliative care, rather than preventive care. This meant that elders' conditions were often discovered at a very advanced stage, complicating treatment. Elders were free from occupational health problems because they no longer worked. Elders still worked and suffered from past and present occupational health problems, especially common in men; but also in women, related to a \"safe\" activity: housework. The burden on poorer elders was higher, as they did more hard manual labor and ate less. Reproductive health was no longer an issue among elders. While participants were beyond their childbearing years, women did complain of lingering reproductive health problems and many spoke of menopausal symptoms and medication. Age was the primary factor in elders' health problems. Elders suffered from many non-medical, age-independent problems that impacted health, e.g. marital, occupational, and financial stresses. Elders had healthy lifestyles. Smoking and drinking, very common among men, impacted both men and women greatly. A fifth of men drank or had once drunk alcohol 5 to 7 days a week. A quarter of men had once smoked or currently smoked a pack or more of cigarettes a day. Elders were independent, economically and in terms of making decisions about their own health care. Elders endured economic dependence, looking to grown children, spouse, and siblings to cover expenses. Two fifths were subject to others' decisions about their own health and care. For medical expenses in the past year, less than half covered all of their own costs. Elders only received assistance. Many elders provided support to others. Some even wished to cut down on the support they provided. The health and care of elder men and women did not differ radically. Elder women were at a disadvantage in terms of health status, health care, and life conditions. 353 CHAPTER 8. GENDERED FACETS OF ELDER HEALTH AND CARE Overview of Chapter 8 A prominent theme suggested in the surveys, interviews, and case narratives was the gendered nature of elder health and care. Indeed, my initial review of census data had revealed a potential anomaly regarding elder well-being in Chiapas: statistics on life expectancy that suggested that elder men were outliving elder women. This trend, if substantiated, contrasts with global and national feminization of aging in which women outlive men. I approached Georgina S\u00e1nchez, a local demographer with training in gender and health from the College of the Southern Border (El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, ECOSUR) and a previous CISC employee, and enlisted her to evaluate this possibility. I then invited her to share her preliminary thoughts on the matter at the Encuentro. Feedback from Encuentro participants inspired her to conduct a detailed review of the data and evaluate various hypotheses for explaining the unexpected and unsettling trend. She enlisted the assistance of another colleague, and with my help, the three of us drafted a paper in which we contend that the statistics regarding women's shorter longevity are probably not an artifact of flawed data collection, nor of gendered out-migration, but manifest repercussions of real gendered inequity in health and care among elders in Chiapas. I detail our reasoning below. S\u00e1nchez then threw the ball back into the Comit\u00e1n court, challenging us to explore the possibility of elder gender inequity. The gendered mortality difference, rather than the dynamic I set out to explain, served as 354 a trigger for more detailed research. Mortality figures were a red flag belying an iceberg of morbidity, care seeking challenges, and limited resources. I scoured the survey data, interview insight, and Encuentro content for contrasts between men and women. This review allowed me to develop a detailed description of gendered differences in health problems faced by elder men and women and variation in care they sought and received. In this chapter, I describe how elder women not only suffered from some health problems distinct from those plaguing men, but also how elder women faced a disproportionate ill health burden compared to their local male counterparts, and often to their national female cohort. I outline problems that burdened women more than men, including chronic disease, persistent pain, and other unremitting symptoms; dental, vision, and hearing problems; functional difficulties; reproductive health troubles and menopausal symptoms; poor mental health; multiple health problems; and non-health problems that impact health. I then discuss the gendered inequities in health care and care seeking which placed women at a disadvantage. These include women's resistance to health consults even with suspected health problems, limited access to insurance-based services, low rates of preventive services and diagnostic testing, high rates of problems not prioritized by local services, limited influence over health-related decisions, high dependence on others to cover their health care expenses, and their propensity to simply endure their health problems. I then draw on insight gained about their lives to spotlight fundamental gendered contrasts in life experiences that might contribute to the documented health and care inequities. These revolved around the opportunity costs of 355 marriage and children, the repercussions of life work, and the burden of lack of infrastructure. These gendered inequities contrasted with health care services that seemed to assume that elder men and women confronted similar ill health burdens with a similar store of resources. 356 A. \"Missing women\" in Chiapas? After our first conversation on the topic, Georgina S\u00e1nchez took a look at the statistics from which I had spotted the unanticipated contrast in the proportion of elder men to elder women in Chiapas. She confirmed that the census data did indeed suggest that, in Chiapas, men were outliving women. S\u00e1nchez calculated the estimated Masculinity Index (MI) (the proportion of men to women) among older adults in Chiapas for the years 2000 and 2005 and found an MI favoring men rather than women (see Table 8.1).43 Specifically, in 2000, starting at age 50, she identified an increase in the proportion of men to women that continued through the 65-69 year cohort. In 2005, this difference in favor of men started at age 55, and continued through the 70-74 year old-cohort. Table 8.1, Masculinity Index by 5-year cohort, Mexico & Chiapas, 2000, 2005. 5-year age cohort National MI 2000 National MI 2005 Chiapas MI 2000 Chiapas MI 2005 CONAPO 2000a, 1999a. I invited S\u00e1nchez to present this data at the Encuentro. When she did, she found participants' interest piqued, and asked them for suggestions as to why the numbers were so. Feedback from Encuentro participants inspired her to conduct a detailed review of 43 On the basis of studies of three Mexican states (not including Chiapas), Salgado de Snyder et al. (2005) observes that in general, there are more elder women than men, but in rural areas, there are more elder men than women, and that the more rural, the more men. In other words, she proposes that the Masculinity Index is inversely proportional to size of community (Salgado de Snyder et al. 2005). 357 the data and evaluate hypotheses for explaining the unexpected and unsettling trend. Enlisting the assistance of another colleague, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Santana-Echeagaray, S\u00e1nchez assessed possible explanations: poor quality population-based data counts, Gendered migration (elder male immigration or elder female emigration), and premature female mortality due to contextual gendered inequities. One potential explanation for Chiapas' atypical MI was deficient quality of data for this state in contrast to that of other states and Mexico as a whole. To evaluate the validity of the MI, S\u00e1nchez would have to evaluate the quality of the population-based data upon which MI was based, i.e. counts of residents by sex and age. She realized that, in Chiapas, ethnic, religious, government, and other conflicts frequently hindered conducting censuses and official surveys, to the extreme of preventing any data from being collected in certain zones. In this case, however, she found that calculations were based on projected population data developed by the National Population Commission (CONAPO) via delicate mathematical and statistical means to make them very reliable (CONAPO 2000a). Although reliance on the quality of the basic census data requires deeper evaluation, S\u00e1nchez doubted the hypothesis that the unexpected statistics were an artifact of poor data collection. 358 S\u00e1nchez identified migration44 as a second potential explanation for the \"male-heavy\" MI in Chiapas. She reasoned that this theory would be plausible if men who had migrated out of Chiapas returned to Chiapas starting at age 50. However, she found that Chiapas has been a state of population equilibrium until just a decade ago, when it began to lose residents to other states and international destinations (INEGI/Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres [INMUJER] 2003). Thus, return immigration among older men may be a conceivable future explanation for an MI favoring men, but did not explain the contemporary situation. S\u00e1nchez also explored the possibility of the MI resulting from elder female emigration (i.e. a critical mass of women aged 50+ leaving to reside in other states and countries), but found it unlikely, as well. Authors such as Sennott-Miller (1993) contend that as they age, women become less likely to find salaried employment, i.e. a disincentive for emigration. The difficulty of finding work is exacerbated by low educational status, pronounced among Chiapanecan women. It is therefore unlikely that many elder women were leaving Chiapas. Additionally, recent data indicate that the age- sex pyramid of Mexico's emigrant population has long been weighted toward men, and narrows starting at age 40, especially among women (INEGI/INMUJER 2003).45 In short, neither female emigration nor male immigration seemed to be a likely explanation for the MI favoring men in Chiapas. 44 Movement from rural to urban areas and influx after the 1994 Zapatista rebellion may be influential, but were not evaluated. 45 While CONAPO (2004) data indicate an increase in the volume of older (40 to 64 years old) international emigrants, growing from 23.8% in 1994 to 29.1% in 2002, this group continues to be comprised predominantly by men. Further, a CONAPO (2000b) press release states that the average age at which women emigrate outside the country is just 28 years old. Research in the southern border region of Mexico indicates that the average age of female international emigrants in the Socunusco of Chiapas is 31 years (\u00c1ngeles & Rojas 2000). Another study conducted among the indigenous Mam population in the Sierra Madre region of Chiapas suggests that female migration decreases starting at age 44 (Pi\u00f1a et al. 2000). 359 On the basis of this preliminary research, S\u00e1nchez and Santana doubted the likelihood that this tendency is explained by deficiencies in data collection or by gendered migration. Instead, they hypothesized that contextual gendered inequities result in premature mortality among women aged 45 to 69 years for 2002 (and a slightly older range for 2005). Amartya Sen (2002) designates this phenomenon the \"missing women\" dynamic. At this point, S\u00e1nchez and Santana tossed this hot potato back to us in Comit\u00e1n, \"The next step is to go out and explore inequities among elder men and women in terms of their health and their care. It sounds like you all in Comit\u00e1n are set up to do this.\" Having a similar suspicion, we had already started. 360 B. Introduction to gendered elder health and care in Comit\u00e1n Do\u00f1a Laura was one of the elder study participants who defied Chiapas' gendered mortality odds and outlived her husband, yet her situation suggests challenges that may plague - and overcome - other women in her cohort. Do\u00f1a Laura: \"Things became more tranquil.\" At 80 years old, do\u00f1a Laura (001) considered her health as \"regular, neither good nor bad.\" She worked most of her life as a domestic servant and raised five children. She recalled that when her husband died, \"life went on about the same... well, actually, things became more tranquil.\" Now a widow living in her daughter's simple yet tidy rented home, she was left on her own to tend to the household's cleaning, cooking, and hand-washing clothes, as well as to her health needs. Without access to insurance-based care, do\u00f1a Laura addressed her health problems with a m\u00e9lange of strategies and care providers. When she felt one of her intermittent headaches and spells of dizziness coming on, her first defense was to bathe with lukewarm water. In an effort to prevent these head maladies, upon recommendation from a healer, she regularly enveloped her head in large cool green leaves, wrapping them in place with a bandana. (Both times that I visited her, the leaves were limp under her red bandana.) For her arthritis and very painful knees, an obstacle in her daily activities, she drank fennel or mint tea and took a pill once a week. For her hypertension, she took medication when she could afford it. She obtained this sporadically from the Health Center or her preferred private doctor in Las Margaritas, her birthplace and residence until a few years ago. A half-hour bus ride away, she often traveled to Las Margaritas with her daughters to visit relatives and see the doctor. Knowing she was poor, the doctor did not charge her for the consultation. Do\u00f1a Laura looked to her daughter to cover any other medical expenses, such as pain killers from the pharmacy down the street. As for her aching eyes, nagging cough, and chronically fatigued body, do\u00f1a Laura had simply become used to them. She contended that going to church helped and, she added, her animals calmed her. The dog sleeping on her doorstep warned her of anything out of the ordinary. A kitten provided mischievous company and brought a nearly toothless smile to do\u00f1a Laura's face while she waited for her two unmarried daughters to return from work and eat the meal she had prepared: beans, scrambled eggs with cilantro, and tortillas. Do\u00f1a Laura started out as Survey Respondent 001, the very first elder who opened her home to me. Two hundred ninety-nine surveys, many interviews, and weeks of thinking 361 later, I saw clearly that, while a unique lady, do\u00f1a Laura was, in various ways, representative of many elder women in Comit\u00e1n. Like numerous others, she dedicated her life to domestic chores and raising children, but found herself a widow and alone in her daughter's house much of the time. She suffered from a standard set of elder women's health problems - chronic disease, ever-present pain, and nagging symptoms - yet did not qualify for insurance-based health care. Instead, she pieced together a multiple care strategies, tempered by her daughter's good will, which in turn rested on an unspoken agreement that do\u00f1a Laura perform the household's chores. In this remainder of this chapter, I document three facets of gender and health among elders in Comit\u00e1n. First, I highlight the gendered inequities in health problems experienced by elders in Comit\u00e1n, revealing the greater ill health burden among elder women compared to elder men. Then, I underline the gendered differences in health care and health care seeking that may place and/or maintain elder women at a disadvantage compared to elder men in Comit\u00e1n. Finally, I detail context-based gendered life conditions influencing elder women's health and health care. A note on statistics is in order. I used the Pearson Chi-square two-tail test to determine the significance of the differences in statistics between men and women. In footnotes, I report the p-values for those differences statistically significant (at the standard minimal criterion of p<0.05). On one hand, as neither men nor women are doing well, the statistical significance of the difference between them is, in a way, moot. On the other 362 hand, I use these numbers to engage two groups of stakeholders. In the public health world, policymakers draw on statistics such as these to legitimate allocation of resources to populations at risk, in this case, elder women. Among health care practitioners, in contrast, the hard survey data and numbers, even if not statistically significant, represented a warning sign that women were underserved, striking a nerve in providers who did not need p-values to become engaged in the research.

Gendered inequities in health status reveal elder women's poorer health This first section summarizes the major gendered distinctions in health status among elders in Comit\u00e1n, drawn from the generalized description of health status in Chapter 6. 1. Non-communicable chronic disease: Stroke, respiratory and heart disease were at least as common among women as among their local male counterparts. Hypertension46, diabetes, cancer, and arthritis were more common among women than men. Compared to men, women were particularly adversely affected by hypertension and diabetes, and these two conditions limited many more women than men in their everyday activities. When asked about the health problem they considered the most worrisome, women named hypertension, which was nearly twice as common among women (48%) than among men (26%). Additionally, women, more commonly than men, had arthritis or a stroke they considered unresolved. Further, women were nearly twice as likely as men to have faced two or more chronic diseases. 2. Chronic pain: Elder women were more likely than men to experience chronic pain. A full 70% of women had suffered from frequent pain, compared to 54% of men (and 45% of women nationally). Women complained more of headaches than did men. Some women used the term dolor de cerebro, or \"brain aches\" to describe their malaise, perhaps stressing the psychological roots of their headaches. Further, women more often than men described their pain as severe or moderate rather than light, to deem pain as 46 Women were more likely than men to have been ever told they had hypertension or high blood pressure. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). 364 interfering with daily activities, to experience headaches, and to suffer from pain in multiple body parts. A full 41% of all women suffered from pain that limited their daily home and work activities. Untreated pain had dire consequences for elder women. Many ended up self-medicating; some could no longer work as much; others became depressed. 3. Chronic symptoms: Elder women in Comit\u00e1n were more likely than their local male counterparts - and their national female cohort - to have frequently experienced (over the past two years) foot/ankle swelling, fatigue, incontinence, dizziness and fainting, and burning or bleeding while urinating or defecating. Women were also at least as likely as men to have had a persistent cough and/or to have had stomach problems. Over half of women were chronically fatigued.47 Some of these symptoms, although not life- threatening, limited elders' ability to get through daily life. 4. Dental problems: A full 90% of women were missing teeth, slightly more than among men (83%). Women seemed to be more conscious of their own missing or unsightly teeth and at times covering their mouths when speaking and smiling. Beyond cosmetic dimensions, a few informants associated snoring and inability to chew with a toothless mouth, in doing so indicating the critical roles played by oral health in nutrition and breathing. 47 Women were more likely than men to have experienced chronic fatigue over the two years prior to the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.006). 365 5. Vision problems: Difficulty with sight was more pronounced among women, with 43% of women rating their vision as just so-so, bad, or blind, as compared to 33% of men. While not painful, impaired vision was said to limit daily life. Poor vision discouraged and even prevented some women from leaving their homes and from performing everyday tasks at home. It restricted their ability to read, see at night, and work. 6. Hearing loss: While men were more likely to mention hearing loss as a problem that had limited their daily activities for over a month, rates of perceived hearing loss among women were just as high as among men. Women expressed annoyance with their husband's hearing loss. 7. Functional difficulties: Of the functional limitations probed, women were just as likely as men to report difficulty in ten of them, and more likely to do so in the other seven. Women were especially challenged by bending/crouching48, lifting/carrying, pulling/pushing, climbing stairs, raising arms, walking several blocks49, standing up, and doing errands. More women than men faced four or more of such functional limitations. 8. Concern about weight: Women more frequently than men expressed concern about their weight. While most women who worried about their weight wanted to lose weight, 48 Women were more likely than men to have had difficulty bending over or crouching down due to health problems. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.001). 49 Women were more likely than men to have had difficulty walking several blocks due to health problems. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.001). 366 the poor health status and malnutrition due to poverty prompted some women to want to gain weight, as well.50 9. Reproductive health problems and menopausal symptoms: Without prompting, elder women mentioned having suffered from hysterectomies, uterine and ovary conditions, menopause, breast and uterine tumors or cists. Upon direct questioning, nearly 1 in 10 women had experienced health problem(s) they associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, especially hysterectomy and bladder problems. Some were deemed unresolved, limiting daily activities, and with long-term medical, economic, marital, and social repercussions. About 3 in 10 women had been told they had a health problem that they related to menopause, mostly sweats and hot flashes. At least 1 in 10 elder women were taking medication for menopausal conditions, had consulted with a physician within the past year regarding these concerns, considered their menopausal problem unresolved, and/or said it limited daily activities. 10. Folk illnesses: Women suffered more often from nervios, while men faced susto and espanto. Women ascribed mental unrest to menopause and/or marital problems; men cited alcoholism, loneliness, physical decline, and inability to work. 11. Poor mental health: Women were worse off than men on all but one of the mental health indicators, reporting more frequently than men that they were depressed, unhappy, 50 Women were more likely than men to have wanted to gain or lose more than two kilograms of weight over the twelve months prior to the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.033). 367 over-extended, lacking energy, lonely, having trouble remembering things, less independent, and not allowed to make their own decisions. Women were more inclined to ascribe their poor mental health to menopause and to unsatisfactory couple relations, while men mentioned poor mental health mostly in connection to alcoholism, loneliness, physical decline, and inability to work. 12. Multiple health problems: Elder women were more likely than men to recite a longer, more varied list of health problems. 13. Days bedridden & nights hospitalized: Over the past year, 35% of women versus 19% of men had spent at least one day bedridden due to illness or injury, surpassing their national female counterparts. Women were much more prone than men (25% versus 8%, respectively) to have spent 1 to 5 days in bed, while men tended either not to have been bedridden at all, or to have been in bed for 6+ days over the past year. The rate of hospitalization over the previous year was nearly double among women (14%) as among men (7%).51 Men's bed-rest prevents those who still work from doing so, impacting household finances. In contrast, given their key role in the daily functioning of the household, when women are bed-ridden, the basic activities (eating, bathing, wearing clean clothes) of multiple people, indeed entire households, are circumscribed. Additionally, because women are less often insured, their hospitalization may cost the family more than men's hospitalization. 51 Women were more likely than men to have been hospitalized in the twelve months prior to the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.055). 368 14. Perceptions of health status: Women had a slightly more negative perception of their health than did men, as 80% of women, compared to 70% of men, rated their current health as regular or bad and 51% of women, versus 41% of men, said that their health was somewhat or much worse now than it was two years ago. Elders in Comit\u00e1n were more inclined than their national counterparts to consider themselves as unwell, a difference especially marked between women of the two contexts. 15. Non-health problems that impact health: Women were more likely than men to concede that they suffered from family and marital problems that they felt negatively impacted their health. 16. Men's disadvantages: The aforementioned contrasts are the ones in which women are at an obvious disadvantage compared to men. There are, however, four instances in which men's well-being seems to be more tenuous than women's. These are: \u0001 Men had more childhood injuries, car/bike accidents and violent injuries, usually occurring during adolescence or early adulthood, and on which they blamed later health problems. \u0001 Occupational health problems52 and serious falls/bumps were more common among men. \u0001 Men faced prostate problems; women obviously did not. \u0001 Men smoked and drank much more than did women53 (although, as detailed in Chapter 6, women seemed to suffer the brunt of the consequences anyway). 52 Women were less likely than men to have ever had occupational health problem(s). This difference was statistically significant (p=0.030). 53 Women were less likely than men to have ever smoked a cigarette. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). Women were less likely than men to currently smoke. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.025). Women were less likely than men to have ever consumed alcohol. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). 369 17. Women's disproportionate ill health burden It is apparent that, in Comit\u00e1n, women aged 50 and up not only faced some different health problems than those plaguing men, but also that elder women did indeed face a disproportionate ill health burden compared to their local male counterparts, and often to their national female cohort, as well. A few health care providers mentioned some of these contrasts in male versus female ailments. For instance, the Director of the Municipal DIF observed that the clinic's elder female patients complained predominantly of osteoporosis and pain, while men suffered from their alcohol and tobacco addictions (and consequences, such as vitamin deficiency). The gendered contrasts are there, but the burning question is, why? I propose a two-fold answer. On one hand, gendered inequities in health care and care seeking place elder women in Comit\u00e1n at a disadvantage. On the other, gendered life conditions often negatively impact women's health and care. Drawing extensively on narratives and testimonies from elders in Comit\u00e1n, the remainder of this chapter elucidates these broad claims. 370 D. Gendered inequities in health care and care-seeking disadvantage women At first glance, women in Comit\u00e1n do not seem to be disadvantaged relative to men in terms of formal health care sought and obtained. There was little male-female distinction in eligibility to government-sponsored insurance-based health care services (IMSS, ISSSTE, ISSSTECH), and a higher proportion of women than men had consulted a doctor over the past year.54 Providers in various places (including the DIF Municipal, Centro Adelante, ISSSTE, ISSTECH) noted that women made up the bulk of the patients at clinics and hospitals. There was some debate regarding the reason for female- prevalent care-seeking trend: was it that men are simply more lax in terms of their attendance and punctuality to appointments? Or that women's needs are greater? The data lends weight to the latter premise, as the information detailed in the previous section indicate that women's general need for health care is higher than that of men, such that even equal rates of care sought/received by men and women may indicate unmet need among women. And delving deeper, some unsettling gendered distinctions in health care seeking and provision emerge, indicating that elder women in Comit\u00e1n may not seek and receive medical attention to the extent that they need it. This section outlines the following distinctions: \u0001 Many women had suspected a serious health problem but, for apparently gendered reasons, did not go to the doctor. \u0001 Access to insurance-based health services may be more limited among women in Comit\u00e1n than among their local male counterparts and their national female cohort. \u0001 Rates of preventive services and diagnostic testing among women in Comit\u00e1n were low compared to local male and national female levels. 54 Women were more likely than men to have consulted a doctor over the twelve months prior to the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.026). 371 \u0001 Women often experienced health problems not prioritized by local health care services. \u0001 Women were less likely than men to self-medicate and seek a solution at the pharmacy. \u0001 Elder women had less influence than did men over decisions related to their own health. \u0001 Compared to men, elder women depended more on others to cover their health care expenses. \u0001 Women were more likely than men to say that they simply put up with their health problems. 1. Women avoid consult Many elder women in Comit\u00e1n had suspected a serious health problem but did not go to the doctor. Elder women in Comit\u00e1n did face serious health problems, as evidenced by the fact that 14% had been hospitalized over the previous 12 months (compared to just 7% of men). Despite this reality, nearly 3 of 10 elder women had not seen a physician at all over the past year. Further, when asked to consider the previous 5 years, 2 of 10 elder women had suspected a serious health problem but did not consult a doctor, behavior which was over twice the rate found among their national cohort. The rate for local men was approximately the same as for women, and informants generally cited as obstacles financial constraints and that it would take too long to get there or to actually see a provider. Upon disaggregating the data by sex, however, women's reasons for not going to the doctor were distinct from men's. Women, more than men, refrained from consulting a physician due to being ashamed to be seen by a provider, and because others would find out about their health problems. Part of women's discomfort may be related to the fact that nearly all local physicians are men. Women, too, were more likely than men to forgo a doctor's visit because of apprehension regarding what the physician might 372 find. For instance, a 57 year-old woman (035) feared her shoulder pain was due to heart problems, and preferred \"not to find out.\" In contrast, men more often than women avoided consulting a physician due to more logistical reasons: the time commitment and to not wanting to bother anyone to bring them. Further, women in Comit\u00e1n were far likelier than local men and national women to forego a doctor visit because the benefits were questionable. Women in Comit\u00e1n, more often than men and their national cohort, were likely to feel that a doctor's visit would not help them enough to be worth the financial, emotional, and time investment. While men hesitated due to logistical snags in getting to the doctor, women cited more social disincentives as well as fears regarding their health. 2. Women less likely to be insured Elder women in Comit\u00e1n were less likely to receive care from insurance-based health services than among their local male counterparts and their national female cohort. In Comit\u00e1n, proportions of men and women eligible for coverage by IMSS/ISSSTE/ISSTECH did not vary. However, a look at insurance rates in the two contexts (Comit\u00e1n vs. national) and care-seeking tendencies among men and women in Comit\u00e1n suggest that elder women in Comit\u00e1n were less likely to receive care from insurance-based health services than their counterparts. First, in terms of coverage by insurance-based services, a smaller proportion of women in Comit\u00e1n than nationally was insured through one of these agencies. For example, insurance through IMSS was over twice as prevalent among women nationally as women in Comit\u00e1n. Second, in terms of 373 probable services sought in the case of minor health problems, women said they would seek care at the General Hospital or from a private practitioner, rather than an insurance- based service. For major health problems, women in Comit\u00e1n were also less likely than women nationally to contend that they would seek insurance-based care. Third, among elders hospitalized in Comit\u00e1n, women were less likely than men to have been inpatients at the IMSS and ISSSTE, a contrast sharpened by the fact that women were slightly more likely than men to have been hospitalized to begin with. In sum, it seems that elder women in Comit\u00e1n may be less likely to be covered by, seek, and receive insurance- based health care than were their male counterparts and their national female cohort. 3. Women's low rates of preventive services and diagnostic testing Rates of preventive services and diagnostic testing among women in Comit\u00e1n were low compared to local male and national female levels. Fewer elder women in Comit\u00e1n than nationally had examined their breasts for lumps monthly during the past year, had ever had a mammogram, and had gotten a Papanicolaou in the past two years. While men do not form an appropriate comparison group for these three procedures, men's propensity to have gotten a somewhat comparable exam done is illuminating: a higher proportion of elder men in Comit\u00e1n than men in the national sample had had a manual exam or a blood test to detect prostate cancer in the previous two years. In sum, compared to men, women may not be subject to appropriate preventive and diagnostic testing. Unfavorable past experiences may be a potential reason to avoid testing. For instance, following a Pap 374 smear, a 64 year-old woman (256) developed pain around her waist, associated this with the procedure, and had decided that she would avoid the test in the future. 4. Women's health problems not prioritized by services Women often experienced health problems not prioritized by local health care services. Many problems faced disproportionately by women did not seem to correspond with the extent of health services provided. While clinics devoted merited resources to a few problems that adversely affect many women, such as hypertension and diabetes, women also suffered from a variety of health problems that were not given the same priority in providers' agendas, and thus may be areas of unmet need. The likely result is that women endure discomfort that could be assuaged. They probably self-medicate in inappropriate ways and with potentially harmful repercussions. Women likely concentrate on easing flare-ups rather than preventing or eliminating the cause. Chronic pain among women seems to be an iceberg, with providers guiding management in just a tip of cases. Headache and arthritic pain are especially widespread among elder women in Comit\u00e1n. Other chronic symptoms, including persistent fatigue, incontinence, recurrent dizziness, and burning or bleeding while urinating or defecating, were experienced disproportionately among women in Comit\u00e1n (as compared to their local male counterparts and their national female cohort), and may not be adequately probed and addressed by providers unless women take the initiative to call their symptoms to physicians' attention. Dental health, too, appears to be an area of unmet need, as 36% of 375 women had consulted a dentist over the past year, yet this rate is far lower than the proportion of women who were missing (usually multiple) teeth (90%).55 Physical therapy to help overcome functional difficulties, which are generally experienced more often among women than men in Comit\u00e1n, is hard to come by for the great number of women who do not have access to insurance-based therapy. In public health, illness often overshadows such functional difficulties, so that interventions to address them are overlooked. In Comit\u00e1n, however, there is a clear need to confront functional difficulties, especially among women. Problems lingering from earlier pregnancy and childbirth did continue to plague women beyond age 50. Reproductive health care is a priority among health care services in Comit\u00e1n; however, women who are no longer in their child-bearing years may no longer fall into the target age group to be considered for such care. A few women described the long-term medical, economic, marital, and social repercussions of such health problems that had initiated years, even decades, ago. Two women, for example, discussed their unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant. One had one child and the other remained childless; both were abandoned by their husbands. In some cases, the physical repercussions of these reproductive health issues had been resolved years ago, while the emotional scars remained. Nearly a third of all elder women had experienced health problems they associated with menopause, yet of these women, a third still considered their problem unresolved, and two thirds had not consulted a doctor regarding these 55 The absence of teeth may be the result of dental care, as a common treatment is extraction. 376 symptoms in the past year. Clearly, resolving conditions associated with menopause - sweats, hot flashes, bladder problems, etc. - should be (but is not yet) a prominent focus of local elder health care. Mental health support is often back-burnered by physical treatment, yet elder women in Comit\u00e1n expressed disproportionate experience of feeling depressed, unhappy, over- extended, low energy, lonely, forgetful, dependent, and not allowed to make their own decisions. While multiple chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous cater to mitigating alcohol- related challenges among men, women have an extreme need for support in facing the mental health sequelae of alcoholism in men. Women would also benefit from family and marital counseling to ease stress that women perceive as impacting their physical health. An additional physical-emotional syndemic is caregiver burnout, likely more prominent among women due to their more intense involvement in care giving than among men. Providers, too, pointed out women's low self-esteem and depression. For instance, the Casa Hogar Director noted that in general, the men attempted to be more independent: Yes, generally, the men continue being independent until the day they die. They try. For example, they do not consent to diapers for anything in the world. They try to go to the bathroom until they definitely cannot any longer. [...] The women, it's like they give up easier, sooner. I already have two of them who decided that they couldn't walk, and they wouldn't walk. Of course they could walk. They have no injury, no problem, but they decided that they couldn't anymore. Depression is stronger in the women. [...] For example, one told me, \"Ay, I can't.\" \"You can, you can do it by yourself.\" Yesterday it happened again, \"I can't eat the meat.\" \"No, grab it with a tortilla and eat it any way you can.\" If we're not this way, we help them belittle themselves. 377 Likewise, the ISSTECH psychologist observed, Women think there's nothing they can do. \"What do you do with your time?\" I ask. They say, 'Why should I do anything if I'm just going to die anyway?' They've lost their self-esteem. They don't value the stage of life they're living now, which could be the best part. Why? Because they no longer have so many commitments. But they don't see it that way. 5. Women less likely to self-medicate Women were less likely than men to self-medicate and seek a solution at the pharmacy. Given limited or non-existent formal health care options and/or avoidance of existing services, elders in Comit\u00e1n used self-care, self-medication, and pharmacy consults (either in conjunction with or instead of formal medical care) as both a first course of action in response to an illness or injury episode and as an ongoing strategy for managing chronic health problems. However, women were also less likely than men to self-medicate and seek care from a pharmacy. Self-medication was operationally defined as taking any medication that had not been prescribed by a doctor. In the case of a minor health problem (like a cold), 62% of men and 45% of women opted to self-medicate over consulting any type of health care provider. Self-medication was abetted by visits to pharmacies, where elders consult with the employees, obtain medication, and sometimes even have an employee apply the medication (e.g. some pharmacy employees will give shots). Men had visited a pharmacy for their own health needs over the previous year more than women (43% versus 28%, respectively). While the majority of quests for medical material were limited to the local environs, some elders had bought or sent for some medication or 378 natural remedy from outside of the state of Chiapas. Again, this was more common among men (11%) than women (5%). Elder women, in contrast, were well-versed in home remedies, and could recommend a tea or a salve for just about any physical complaint. These remedies were less expensive than medication. 6. Women wielded less influence over health decisions In Comit\u00e1n, elder women had less influence than men over decisions related to their own health. While 58% of the informants (regardless of sex) said they held most sway over their own health-related decisions, and 9% said their spouse did so, decision-making dynamics among the remaining 33% were clearly gendered, with men making decisions jointly with their wife while women yielded to the influence of their children. In fact, five times as many women than men said that their son/daughter had the most sway in his/her health-related decisions. These trends were especially pronounced among married informants, among whom men more than women made their own health-related decisions, and women more than men deferred to their husband or children. For instance, one 51 year-old woman was very clear that her husband made a lot of decisions about her own health. She had pain in her joints that limited her daily activities, and a friend of hers told her that she might have arthritis, yet she had not consulted anyone about this problem, hinging on her husband's belittling of the problem, and discouragement from seeking care. Those few elder men whose health-related decisions were made by their wives and children tended to be in a precarious state of health, while women's decisions were made by others even when they were in relatively good health. Women's power to 379 make decisions about when and where to seek care may have delayed or prevented them from obtaining necessary health care in a timely manner. A doctor/administrator from Health Jurisdiction III described a common decision-making dynamic: The woman's health is conditioned by the man. For example, in childbirth, the men don't want their wives to be cared for by a male doctor or nurse. The husband or the eldest son decides for the woman, and even is the one who answers the doctor's questions. Plus, the woman has to endure a lot before they even take her to health care services. 7. Women depended more on others to cover their health care expenses Compared to their male counterparts, elder women depended more on others to cover their health care expenses. While 59% of men paid for their own health care expenses, only 27% of women did so. Instead, women had to turn to their husband or a child to pay for doctor visits, medication, and other medical material. While the gendered dynamic repeats itself at the national level, women in Comit\u00e1n were much more likely than women nationally (36% vs. 20%, respectively) to rely on their children to take care of their medical expenses. The propensity of others to cover women's health-related expenses may go hand-in-hand with their role in making their health-related decisions. Women may be limited by those holding the wallet and may curb their requests for resources. Additionally, women's receipt of assistance with health care expenses may oblige them to reciprocate with resources in one form or another, such as housework and babysitting, which may be emotionally and physically stressful to them. Decision-making about health was often related to who covers health-related expenses. Out-of-pocket medical expenses can be prohibitive, especially for more economically- 380 and socially-marginalized elders. In fact, many elders said they did not have enough money to consult a physician, and 37% had stopped taking a necessary medicine during the previous year due to its high cost, nearly three times the 13% of the national sample that had done so. In Comit\u00e1n, foregoing medication was slightly more common among women than men. Hypertension medication is an apt example. A 60 year-old woman (024) said that her hypertension was under control while she took her medicine, but that when she did not have any money (which was frequently), she could not afford to buy her medication. Sometimes help from relatives to cover medical expenses had strings attached. For instance, a 75 year-old woman (274) with many health problems (including diabetes, chronic cough, abdominal pain, arthritis, vision problems, and a myriad of symptoms) said explicitly that her daughter paid for her medical care, in exchange for the care this elder woman provided for her granddaughters. 8. Women put up with their health problems Women were more likely to [say that they] simply put up with their health problems. Many elder women seemed to accept their sub-optimal health status as normal and expected. Many women considered their health to be good, despite all the chronic symptoms they experienced. Women often prefaced any mention of problems with a phrase such as, \"I'm fine, it's just that....\" Perhaps they see, hear about, and experience so many health problems that these are eventually perceived as \"normal\" in aging women like themselves. Once normalized, they may not seek preventive, curative, or palliative care. Instead, they put up with it, endure. Much more than among men, women's 381 dialogue is sprinkled with the terms aguantar (to put up with) and sufrir (to suffer), denoting a sort of hardened resignation, tinged with self-respect, a sense of accomplishment, an attitude of, \"I made it. I'm tough. I prevailed.\" These are women's discursive tools. This perspective - and vocabulary - flourishes among women beyond the sphere of health problems. Life in general is hard, and while suffering for men seems to begin at old age, elder women seem to have spent their entire lifetime suffering as a result of their status as daughters, wives, and parents. Women may use their suffering to make claims on others for themselves. Do\u00f1a Yesenia: \"All my life, I've suffered.\" When I asked about depression and sadness, Do\u00f1a Yesenia (025) nearly began to cry. She divided her life into three phases of suffering. She suffered with her parents, as they all did back-breaking work farming corn. She was not allowed to go to school. Then, she suffered at her husband's side. He drank so much that he eventually \"died of alcohol.\" She also got to the point of drinking regularly, but fortunately left the bottle about a decade ago. Now, she was plagued by alcoholism and marital problems among her children - the five of twelve that had survived to adulthood. Various contexts of suffering are explored in the following section. 382 E. Gendered life conditions influence women's health and care In keeping with the feminist life-course perspective, I suggest how social location, sociohistorical period, and personal biography may coalesce in elder women's life-course to influence their experiences of aging and health in later life.56 The gendered life conditions that may influence women's health and care in this context are fourfold, and revolve around marriage, children, life work, and infrastructure. 1. Gendered impact of marital status on elder well-being A prevailing notion in the literature is that elders with a spouse fare better than those without (c.f. Moen 1996). In Comit\u00e1n, however, elder women faced a trade-off in terms of marital status and well-being. On one hand, marriage may allow women satisfying relationships as well as access to health-promoting economic and insurance benefits. On the other, marriage in this context often entailed enduring men's alcoholism and physical, psychological, and economic violence, such that being single (i.e. never married, separated, divorced, or widowed) may afford elder women more independence and tranquility. In Comit\u00e1n, elder women (45%) were much less likely than men (83%) to live with a partner, as significantly more women (36%) than men (6%) had been widowed, and more 56 One study of aging and gender in rural areas of Mexico found that aging experiences differ by gender, resulting in a more positive experience for women (Trevi\u00f1o-Siller et al 2006). 383 women (17%) than men (9%) were separated or divorced.57 Separation did not necessarily occur in early adulthood and becoming widowed did not always happen in late adulthood, as exemplified by a 50 year-old woman (235) who was widowed at age 24, and a 92 year-old woman (231) who had just separated from her husband at age 87. In Chiapas, when many of these elder women married, patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence were very common, and early marriage (by age 14) to an older man, usually \"arranged\" by the family, was frequent. The age difference at marriage is most likely one factor in the preponderance of widowers compared to widows. The politics of partnership spanned elders' lifetime, and elder women - but not men - discussed marriage as a mixed blessing. Some informants enjoyed satisfying and caring marital relationships. Current couples voiced endearing terms and admiration, expressing gratefulness for the company and support over the years. For instance, an 88 year-old man (244), also living alone with his wife, spoke with pride of her strength and ability to withstand hardship, from their younger days as peasant farmers to the current challenge of his near immobility due to problems with his legs. \"She is a trooper!\" (Es aguantadora!). Younger men, too, praised their wives for being hard-working and expressed their love via caregiving. 57 Women were less likely than men to be married or living with a partner as if married at the time of the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). Women were more likely than men to widowed at the time of the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). 384 Beyond accompaniment, when married, a woman could often count on a husband to hand over part or all of his income for her to cover household expenses. Additionally, marriage represents a potential link to health insurance benefits. Men more often than women held jobs that entitled them and their immediate relatives to IMSS/ISSSTE/ISSTECH health insurance. It is not surprising, then, that insurance rates were slightly higher in married than unmarried women. This said, marriage was no guarantee of well-being for elder women. For instance, marriage did not ensure women's property rights. Even among married elders, women were more likely than men to live in a rented home, and, when living in their own home, to have had home-related debt. Women were also less likely than men to own other property, such as land, and less commonly possessed property-endowing documents, like titles and wills. In terms of everyday living, elder women with partners may continue a lifelong pattern of going without certain resources because their husband demands more. For instance, in Chiapas, levels of malnutrition are higher among women than among men (Freyermuth 1998). While this is in part due to the physical effort women expend in agricultural and domestic labor, it is also a result of widespread gendered norms, values, and customs among indigenous and farming communities of Chiapas. For instance, when food is scarce, women are expected to serve men generously while limiting their own portions. Men were expected to want \"good food,\" i.e. something more than beans and tortillas, while women were expected to make do with whatever was available. 385 Further, marriage did not ensure life-long company, as some women had married twice but arrived at old age alone anyway (e.g. 005, 146). And most evidently, marriage did not always usher in tranquility and security; for many elder women, it brought just the opposite. Yet some elder women endured unhappy marriage due to economic dependence and the stigma associated with not having a spouse. Women were much more likely than men to suffer from family and marital troubles, to which they ascribed health problems. The most prominent marital stresses were men's abuse and alcoholism, often coexisting in a syndemic. Some women had endured unhealthy living conditions, very difficult relationships, little decision-making power and, at times, outright physical violence at the hands of their husband. In elder women's lifetimes, violence was often treated as a private affair, an accepted strategy of \"training\" women to be submissive. In this region, women often justify male violence because they are convinced that \"they deserve it\" (when they fail to keep up with domestic responsibilities) or because when a man is drunk, \"he doesn't know what he is doing.\" Younger elders seemed to be less acquiescent in the face of men's behavior. For instance, a 53 year-old woman (030) told me, \"I was married, but my husband was an idiot. He went off with someone else - my comadre! So I got divorced pretty quickly.\" She now supports their 7 children, all under age 18, on her wages as a domestic servant and whatever she can eek out of her sewing machine. Unfortunately, she cannot wash clothes much anymore because one of her hands is frequently swollen and painful since when, \"my damn old man hit me.\" She asserts that 386 her current solitary struggle is preferable to his company. Another, aged 65 (010), had also been a domestic servant all of her life, while raising 6 children. When I asked if she felt independent, she smiled, \"Since I separated from my husband! He was a womanizer, so I left him a long time ago.\" Still, emotions and roles ran deep: last year when her long-estranged husband died, she felt sorry for him, and organized his funeral. Usually, abuse and alcoholism were mentioned in the same breath. As detailed in Chapter 6, in Comit\u00e1n, men consumed much more alcohol than women and their national male cohort. A fifth of the men currently drank or had gotten to the point of drinking 5 to 7 days a week, and half of the men drank or had gotten to the point of drinking the equivalent of a liter of hard alcohol on any average day. A number of men admitted to having been and/or being alcoholics, and women often identified their husbands as (ex-) alcoholics.58 Women linked this alcoholism to domestic violence, and contended that it provoked and exacerbated their own poor physical and mental health. Some men recognized their alcohol problem and its negative effect on their families, although men may attempt to hide it. This behavior is apparent to health care providers. A psychologist from the ISSTECH clinic observed, The women have been in a completely submissive environment. Here, these women from Comit\u00e1n, they're like, \"Whatever my husband says.\" There's a high incidence of alcoholism among the men, many were very violent with their partner. [...] Very few [talk about it]; a few may tell you, \"well, yes, I used to drink a lot but not anymore.\" But in some you can tell that they still drink. Maybe not as much as before, but they still do. 58 Further, drinking often went hand-in-hand with smoking, and 24% of men currently smoked or had gotten to smoke at least a pack a day (compared to 3% of women), exposing co-habiting women to second- hand smoke. 387 Alcoholism in men had torn households apart. Men alluded to this, but women - daughters and wives - were crystal clear about it. The daughter of a couple I interviewed (031, 032) asserted that her mother, a nearly deaf 74 year-old woman, suffered from hearing problems caused by her father's (78 year-old) drinking. His drinking had provoked not only sporadic separation, but also this physical problem and a deep sadness in her mother. Her father, she said, was very good about helping her mother, but when he drank, he abandoned her, and his drinking had increased over time. Another daughter described how her 54 year-old (268) father was an alcoholic, leaving each morning at around 5 a.m. and returning at about 11 a.m., drunk, to sleep. He did this 5 days a week. He no longer worked (he had been a leatherworker), and depended on his wife and daughters for support. They had set up an Internet caf\u00e9 in their garage, but he came home drunk and said rude things to his family and their customers, all bad for business. His daughter was on the verge of selling the computer equipment and moving out of town, leaving her mother to deal with him on her own. Two longer narratives further illustrate the impact of drinking on marriage, family, and well-being. Don Pablo: \"Alcoholism has ruined everything.\" I sat with don Pablo, a well-dressed 59 year-old man (029), in folding wooden chairs next to a 6' x 6' altar situated a few feet from the wash basin in his large garage. Before we began the survey, he stepped out to answer a knock at the door. His wife, who was washing clothes, began to talk to me, \"My husband's alcoholism has ruined everything. He drinks a lot, and now our son is even in a special clinic for alcoholics.\" When don Pablo came back, he embraced his young grandchildren and sat tranquilly with me and his wife. He nodded when his wife announced that he had just finished a 12-day drinking streak. He was open about being an alcoholic and admitted to \"doing things to people that they don't deserve.\" His wife had resorted to raising chickens and running a front-388 room store in order to make ends meet, as don Pablo's drinking bills exceeded his farming income. Do\u00f1a Gabi: \"My father drank, and worse, I married my husband, who drinks a lot.\" Do\u00f1a Gabi, a 64 year-old woman (256) related, \"my father drank, and worse, I married my husband, who drinks a lot.\" Her husband made all the decisions, hit her and had even done so in public. He had only calmed slightly now that he was aging and facing health problems. She began making hats as a teenager, and continued to work until she had the fourth of their eight children, when she began doing full-time housework. Her husband drove a taxi and farmed on the side, and I saw him leave with his machete as I approached their dilapidated home in an old part of town. Do\u00f1a Gabi began getting headaches before she married. After marrying, they persisted and became worse when she lived in with her in-laws. In desperation, she smoked cigarettes. Around age 50, she began to have abdominal pain, and eventually had some benign cysts removed. She had hypertension, for which she went to the Health Center to get her medication. When they had money, she would buy her medicine and her problems remained in check; when her husband started drinking, the money would run out, and she could not afford her pills, her health worsening. In addition to hypertension and headaches, she had trouble seeing and some functional limitations. Her \"fallen bladder\" - a result of her eight births - prevented her from lifting heavy items. Aside from raising her children and tending to her husband, she had also cared for her parents, parents-in-laws, and brothers/sisters-in-law before they died. Her husband's drinking, then, directly affected her ability to follow her own treatment regimen, and this had a cascade affect on her care for others. Men who were single, separated, divorced, or widowed spoke of being lonely, not sleeping well, and suffering from nervios. One said that, in the lapse between his two marriages (men more often remarry than women), he suffered from neurosis, constipation, and high blood pressure. An 89 year-old man (250) whose wife had passed away nearly a decade ago felt very lonely, in spite of living with and receiving visits from his 6 children and his grandchildren. A 79 year-old man (277) had been married three times. His first wife, with whom he had 7 children, passed away. He had no children with his second wife. He had one child with his third wife, but she left him. \"My women left me, with no good reason.\" He was very depressed. Becoming widowed may have 389 more negative emotional impact on men because they seem to gain more social and emotional support from marriage than do women. Widowed men who did not live with their children had an especially hard time because they were not used to doing basic domestic tasks like cleaning, washing clothes, and cooking, and their social networks seemed to be less developed than those of women. Similarly, while married men could generally count on their wife for support, single men were often usually less fortunate, as they either never had children or lost their children's sympathy in the course of separation or divorce. In contrast, few separated or widowed women expressed such despair at being partnerless. Most openly asserted that they were quite relieved to be separated, divorced, or widowed, that their lives as single older women were more agreeable. To many elder women, widowhood and separation/divorce meant independence and tranquility. So, one woman (046) explained that her first husband \"was good for nothing,\" and while her second husband was a good man, he died 18 years ago and she is happy to be alone, \"because there is no one to bother me, no one making me feel uncomfortable.\" A 60 year-old woman whose husband passed away 5 years ago, asserted, \"I am alone, so I am independent!\" A 75 year-old woman (274), whose husband died 20 years ago expressed the same jubilation. Another 62 year-old woman (025) was \"sad but relieved\" when her husband \"died of alcohol.\" A practitioner at the Centro Adelante ascribed elder women's poor health to men's abuse and alcoholism, and touched on the relief some women feel at becoming widowed: 390 But what's happening? The husbands are the ones who drink, and the women have to find a way to make ends meet, they sacrifice, they go without sleep, they ignore many of their own needs so that their children can eat, and even then, not adequately. On top of this, the physical abuse that they take from the husband. [...] So by the time a woman reaches this age, she's got osteoporosis, depression, blindness, and often they end up ill. It's because of the emotional burden they carry. Talking with elder women like this, I've asked, \"And your husband?\" \"No, thank God, he died.\" For them, it is a rest. Companionship, then, was a double-edged sword. Of informants who had never been in a long-term relationship, women seemed to be happier. An 80 year-old woman (039) who never married lived with her sister, and tended to her sister's health (she had diabetes), her sister's children, and her sister's store. She seemed content with her sister- centered life. In contrast, a 62 year-old underemployed mason (279) lived with two adults and two children, but felt lonely most of the time because he never married and never had children. He sought solace in rum and Coke a few times a week, and once ended up in the hospital for alcohol poisoning. In general, men without partners expressed their loneliness and suffered from nervios, while women indicated they were actually better off, more tranquil and independent. Granted, the adjustment period shortly after losing a partner entailed some challenges. A 51 year-old woman (278) had 5 children with her husband, a construction supply warehouse employee. He recently left her for another woman. In the process, she lost her insurance coverage, business space (front room store at her in-laws' home), and much self-esteem. She optimistically reflected, however, that she planned on starting a new life in Mexico City with her college-age children. Women whose husbands had curbed their alcohol consumption went on to have significantly healthier marriages and outlooks on 391 life. One man (144), for example, had often gone on week-long drinking stints but recognized that family life was \"much more tranquil\" now that he did not drink. This data regarding marriage challenges assumptions that women are so dependent on men and more accepting of bad marriages. It also highlights the fact that, for women, the health implications of having a partner rest on the husband's presence, employment, insurance, alcohol consumption, and (non-)aggressive nature. 2. Gendered impact on elders of inter/dependence with/on children Elder women tended to be more dependent than elder men on grown children for general support59 and health care, yet these relationships were threatened by the contemporary dwindling numbers of adult children (total and close by). Dependence on children was also strained by the expectation that elder women would reciprocate with housework, front-room store-tending, and childcare, an expectation not generally imposed on men. It is often assumed that elders in Mexico have many children, and that these grown children take care of them in their old age. Over 30% of those surveyed did indeed have 6 or more living children. Surprising, however, is that nearly a quarter (22%) of elders in Comit\u00e1n had just two or fewer living children, including 4% who had none. Why? First, some elders had simply had fewer children to begin with. Second, others had children who died in infancy or passed away in adulthood. Third, these smaller pools of grown children are bombarded with impetus to leave their aging parents' side (e.g. education, 59 Women were more likely than men to have received assistance in cash or kind from family or friends (mostly their grown children) in the past year. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.012). 392 migration for work) as well as increased demands on their time and energy (e.g. more extra-domestic work among women). Ongoing government efforts to lower fertility rates promise to shrink the future elder care corps even further. From this perspective, lower fertility rates - posited by the state as the key to development, modernity, and well-being - may backfire as elders are left with fewer children to care for them in their senescence. Take, for example, do\u00f1a Melinda, who married twice and had a half dozen children, but whose care-giving network had dwindled to the wife of a grandson. Do\u00f1a Melinda: \"I ended up alone anyway.\" Do\u00f1a Melinda (005), who stood in her bare calloused feet in a disheveled Tojolabal embroidered blouse and a ribbon-laced skirt, did not know her exact age. Based on her children's ages and the propensity for girls of her day to marry around age 15, she must have been about 90. Twice married, she found herself widowed, or in her words, had \"ended up alone anyway.\" Four of her six children died in adulthood, followed by the death of her second husband. The convergence of these deaths left do\u00f1a Melinda in the hands of a grandson, whose residence in Comit\u00e1n forced her to move from her natal town to Comit\u00e1n in her mid-80s. His wife tended to her rheumatism, incontinence, falls, and pain. She had weathered her physical changes well, such that people asserted that her daughter - the one her grandson's wife felt should be caring for Do\u00f1a Melinda, but who was too exhausted to do so - looked older than she. Do\u00f1a Melinda now shared a house with nine others. Even in such peopled quarters, she felt alone and sad without her husband. Her grandson's wife translated between Spanish and Tojolabal as Do\u00f1a Melinda reminisced about how she was born in nearby Tojolabal town, married, raised children, and farmed until she was over 80. \"I am going back to my community,\" the elder woman quipped, while her granddaughter-in-law's expression indicated the impossibility of this happening. Do\u00f1a Elena and do\u00f1a Lina, distant cousins, questioned the net benefits of marriage and children. Do\u00f1a Elena and do\u00f1a Lina: \"Alone in the world, and very poor.\" Do\u00f1a Elena (022) touched a scab on her lip, explaining that, while cooking beans - the mainstay of her simple diet - over the fire on her hearth, she had burned her face. Do\u00f1a Elena was born in a nearby Tojolabal community and farmed throughout her youth. She married another farmer, had children, and eventually 393 grandchildren. Now 60, her husband passed away 5 years ago, and since then, she has enjoyed her independence. However, her children live far away and do not help her at all. In fact, last year, her face became quite swollen and she went to Mexico City to seek care. She stayed with her daughter, who she claimed did not even feed her, let alone help with her medical expenses. The trip was fruitless, as the doctor told her there was nothing wrong with her. Adding insult to injury, her extended out-of-state stay rendered her ineligible to continue to receive Progresa support. Do\u00f1a Elena lived with - and was nearly always accompanied by - her 10-year old grandson, for whom she cared since he was a baby. She also \"rented\" a room out to her cousin, Do\u00f1a Lina (024), who was from the same region, but spoke less Spanish. Do\u00f1a Lina, also about 60 years old, had lived a sad life. Do\u00f1a Lina did marry, but when she failed to become pregnant, her husband left her for another woman. She never married again, and never had any children. Except for Do\u00f1a Elena, Do\u00f1a Lina was, \"alone in the world, and very poor.\" The two women and 10 year-old boy formed a small financially-strapped but caring circle, occupying a plywood structure with a corrugated aluminum roof with a separate cooking shed. Neither woman had a partner or children to support her, yet both women insisted that the other was worse off. Do\u00f1a Elena maintained that it was better to have married than not, while Do\u00f1a Lina questioned the value of her cousin's marriage as she gained no long-term support from her husband or her children. Figure 8.3, Photo, elder and her grandson. 394 The number of living children did not differ much between elder men and women; however, the impact of children on health and well-being may be greater among women than among men. Women bore the physical brunt of having children, and some elder women spoke of health problems precipitated by difficult births that still plagued them beyond their reproductive years. Timing and number of children, determined early in elder women's lives, also had repercussions in many family relationships later in life, including the impact of mortality among adult children, divorce/separation, and number of grandchildren. Elder women - but rarely men - reflected on the trials and tribulations, the emotional burden of raising children, and mourned the loss of children, whether in infancy due to contagious disease or in adulthood due to accidents and illness. Many had lost multiple children. Some women cried as they recalled untimely deaths and difficult circumstances - such as violent marriages - through which their children had passed. One woman, aged 65 (010), claimed to have very high self-esteem, and was jolly and glowing while she discussed her challenges, all but two: the death of a son in a car accident a few years ago, which brought tears to her eyes, and her daughters' marital problems, which \"make the heart hurt.\" While elder women's role as mothers provided a strong sense of self-worth, the emotional toll wreaked by children was also great. Given such physical and emotional connections, it is not surprising that, compared to men, women seemed to be engaged in stronger relationships of interdependence with their children. Further, nearly twice as many women as men had received support in cash or kind from their children over the past year. 395 Elder-child (inter)dependence was most evident among elders who lived on a grown child's property. Some elders lived in the same house with their child(ren). Another frequent setup was that of an elder/s' home on the same plot of land as their adult child's home. Living \"with\" a child, however, did not imply sharing the same standard of living or amenities. Often, the elder's residence was of simpler construction and with fewer labor-saving devices. Further, cohabitation with children did not ensure company or help, as in the case of do\u00f1a 98 year-old woman (261), was born in a rural corner of the municipality of Comit\u00e1n and had been a farmer all her life. Her husband died 6 years ago, and she lived on the $320 pesos a month that she received from Progresa. Just one of her four children remained living. Do\u00f1a Nanci lived alone in a two-room clapboard hut behind her son's brick home, which was equipped with a gas stove and indoor plumbing. Her floors were dirt and she cooked with wood over a hearth in the corner of her shack. She was nearly deaf, hypertensive, and arthritic. About four years ago, her feet started swelling and itching, which made it hard for her to walk, although she still did so with a cane. She slept in a chair most of the day, but still swept, cooked her food, washed her own dishes and clothing at an outside washbasin. She used the bathroom in her son's house. Often physically isolated from her relatives living in the front house, a small parrot accompanied Do\u00f1a Nanci. In addition to providing housing, some children took care of their parents, this assistance ranging from occasional accompaniment to the doctor to constant care and companionship (changing diapers, feeding, bathing). Except for dressing and cooking, in which a spouse often helped, it was the informant's son or daughter who provided the bulk of elders' support with functional difficulties. While men were more likely to receive help from their partner than from their children, women depended more on assistance from children. Additionally, elders might also receive health insurance via 396 working children through IMSS, ISSSTE, ISSTECH. Because women were less likely to hold jobs that entitle them to health insurance, they depended more than did men on their children for access health insurance. Some elders received no help at all from their children. Usually, however, there was some sort of implicit reciprocity. This dynamic most often entailed elder women assuming housework responsibilities and caring for grandchildren while their grown children (usually daughters) worked. In fact, a common household unit consisted of a single (separated, divorced, or widowed) elder woman, her separated/divorced adult daughter, and infant/school-aged grandchildren. The elder woman would take care of the children, cook, wash, clean, and shop, while the adult woman worked. For instance, a 75 year-old woman (274) dropped off and picked up her two young granddaughters from school while her separated daughter worked. Few adult children were openly thankful for this assistance. An exception was a 53 year-old carpenter (280) who said of living with his 92 year-old mother (231), who still cared for his toddler all day, \"This is a gift.\" While some elders and their adult children shared relationships of mutual support, some elder women alluded to slipping into what might be considered inequitable dynamics of dependence. This occurred primarily when elder women were unhappy with the support they were expected to provide with meager returns in terms of their own companionship and care. One 80-year old woman, for example, lived with two daughters, but they would get up and to go to work early in the morning and return after dark, leaving her alone at home to do their housework. Many elder women seem fatigued - and some 397 nearly overwhelmed - by the responsibility and obligation derived from the presence of others at home. In many cases, women were expected to do housework and cooking for their adult children, as well as take care of grandchildren. Grandchild care underlines how women's reproductive labor, far from ending with the birth of one's youngest child, may be life-long, and threaten older women's financial and physical well-being. For instance, I found a 62 year-old woman hand-washing the family's clothes while her adult children and grandchildren lounged on the sofa, watching television. She did all the housework, cared for her young grandchildren, and had a part-time job. Women tired of this arrangement, yet felt guilty and torn about seeking to alter the dynamic. For instance, a 56 year-old woman (269), left in charge of her infant grandson, said that she was tired of this routine and would prefer to reduce her role in his care. In contrast, men tended to be a little more happy about caring for their grandchildren. When I asked a 73- year old man him how often he felt happy, he replied, \"when I hug my grandchildren.\" It seems, however, that men did more low impact, voluntary care (i.e. when they felt like it), such as walking with young children, while women did more regular, on-all-the-time tasks like bathing, changing, and feeding them. Even health care providers identified the problem of strings attached to cohabitation and elder support. An alternative care provider, from the Centro Adelante, noted, The funny thing is that people of the Third Age are the ones who say, \"I don't have time.\" [...] There's a problem growing in all the cities, and it even seems to be creeping into the small towns: people of the third age taking care of grandchildren. This affects them physically, emotionally, because they no longer have the same capacity, the strength, the patience to raise a child, a grandchild. Not anymore. Nevertheless, they force themselves to have this patience and that's 398 what keeps them from sleeping well, from doing exercise.... They go to bed late and get up early and don't exercise and don't get enough sun. Plants need sun and we do, too, for the vitamins. People of the third age really need this time for their well-being, but they are not getting it because they have to take care of the kids, and they aren't left with any time to go out, to take a walk. They're always shut up at home. It's very bad. Why can't they do it? Because they have to take care of the grandchildren. And why? Because they depend on the children. This affects them emotionally. It's great that the grandchildren are around the house, but what most worries us is that people of the third age don't have the time to treat themselves as they should when it's their moment to retire. They have got to take some time for themselves. This provider alluded to the clout that grown children had over decision-making regarding elder health issues, yet beyond generational conflict, this dynamic seems to be gendered. In general, women more often than men deemed themselves less independent and less frequently allowed to make their own decisions. When it came to decisions related specifically to their health, decisions were made by elder's children more often among women than among men. Additionally, women often relied on their children to cover their medical expenses. A psychologist summed up the problem faced by elder women in asserting of the ISSTECH clinic's predominantly female patient-population, They become more and more burdened and need to talk it over with someone because generally at home they can't find anyone to talk with. There, no one listens to them, and if elders do say something, they get scolded, \"you and your complaints, that's not true!\" The elders themselves say that a lot of things start weighing them down and when they get over-burdened, that's when they come talk, rather than thinking, \"I really need psychological help.\" It's like they don't value it enough. [...] Something that they all have in common is depression. The women are scared of ending up alone, of being rejected, and therefore they accept things that they don't like. They say 'yes' to everything in order to avoid losing the love of a child. For example, in economic terms, many depend on their children so the children start treating them like little girls, controlling them, telling them, 'Okay, you can go out, but only if I take you.' The elders have to take care of the grandchildren, be responsible for dropping them off and picking them up [from school], cooking. In other words, the elders leave their independence aside in order to live according to what their kids dictate. 399 In general, this data on marital status and living children among elders in Comit\u00e1n challenges the notion of elder Mexican women living harmoniously with their spouse and caring children. While some elders lived alone, others resided with a number of family members, but felt alone and unsupported anyway. A few elders were adequately socially enmeshed to receive sufficient care from their relatives and friends. Looking beyond the immediate family, very few elders professed to receive significant care from friends and neighbors. While perhaps they could ask a neighbor to pick up some groceries or stop by for tortillas once in a while, these outsiders did not provide ongoing care for elders within the household. Some women were able to fortify their social support network when their husband passed through transitions such as religious conversion and ceasing to drink. However, support for elder health and care was an ongoing process, changing from day to day. Thus care for acute episodes might have been more forthcoming than ongoing support for chronic lower-grade or less obvious health problems. Additionally, there was a fine line between generous support and imposed control. Among those elders with children or partners involved in their care, decision-making about elder health often rested not in elders' own hands, but rather in the hands of these others, a dynamic more common among women than men. Compounding elders' lack of control over care, many elders had to turn to partners and children to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses, which then tipped the decision-making balance of power away from elders and toward others. Limited or nonexistent personal cash flow due to gendered work, discussed below, compounded elder women's lack of control over care, and reliance on their adult children. 400 3. Gendered impact of life work/activity and financial issues on well-being60 A major determinant of well-being in elders' later years of life was their financial situation, which tended to contrast by gender. In Comit\u00e1n, elder women seemed to be poorer than elder men, not because they instantly became impoverished at age 50 or 60, but because they entered later life with fewer resources and comparatively lower financial entitlement during old age than men, due in a large part to the gendered nature of work. For instance, women were less likely than were men to own property, such as a business, land, or farm animals.61 Compared to elder men, elder women's work tended to be more life-long and day-long than men's, yet to have afforded them less health-boosting benefits, such as a steady salary, health insurance, and retirement pension. The etiology of this situation is multifaceted. A key sociohistorical element that eroded the economic security of nearly all elder women as they aged is a deeply embedded ethic idealizing and naturalizing women's role as nurturers. This had locked elder women into subordinate economic roles at home and rationalized their exploitation at work. Its repercussions were evident in women's assigned roles (e.g. mothers and caregivers), societal expectations (e.g. self-sacrifice for family), and inequities in pay and other benefits (e.g. retirement pension). Briefly, most elder women in Comit\u00e1n had spent their lives doing domestic work and/or food 60 Women's work in Comit\u00e1n parallels the unpaid domestic work of women in the developed world. 61 Women were less likely than men to own property such as a business, land, or farm animals (or to have a partner owning property) at the time of the survey. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.042). 401 preparation/sales, which are low-paying or unpaid, piecemeal, and physically draining. Further, unlike elder men, elder women had to patch together money-making activities with unpaid housework and informal care-giving, and were not offered the option of retirement. Elder women in Comit\u00e1n had dedicated their lives predominantly to domestic work in their own homes and in the homes of others. This housework ranged from cooking and serving meals, washing dishes and clothing, sweeping inside and out, tending to chickens, gardens and potted plants. Housework also entailed regular tasks beyond the front door, including food shopping, buying fresh tortillas, and, at the ringing of the garbage truck bell, rushing out with the accumulated trash and handing it up to the men perched atop the garbage-laden flatbed truck. Housework was the single most common primary lifetime occupation among elder women, with 18% doing so. Further, nearly 48% of the women (vs. 3% of men) had devoted the week prior to the survey to housework. Even the oldest women - aged 80 years and up - still did housework. In addition to their own housework, many women had spent the bulk of their lives doing paid domestic service: 9% had washed and ironed other people's clothing; 6% had been domestic servants (maids). Additionally, 22% of women (vs. 14% of men) had done unpaid domestic service in a home other than their own. 402 Figure 8.4, Photo, sweets for sale After domestic work, the most common lifetime profession was food preparation and sales, activities performed during most of the lives of 14% of the women surveyed. Elder women had made careers of preparing and selling bread, fruit, dairy products, vegetables, and, most of all, local snacks, such as tacos, empanadas, and sweets. Many pedaled their products door-to-door, at stands in public places, or from a table set up in their front door. For example, a 62 year-old woman (025) collaborated with her children, grandchildren and daughters-in-law to prepare tamales, corn-on-the-cob, Jello, tacos, which they then carried in large pots to the second-class bus station, where she would sell it over the course of the day. Doorway food sales were strongest evenings and weekends, keeping women home while men were out on the town. In much of Chiapas, a red light bulb glowing outside a home on a weekend night means that women there sell tamales and atole (a viscous corn-based drink). 403 Women often combined housework and food work with caring work throughout life, which also contributed to well-being (or lack thereof) in later years. The patriarchal character of Mexican society structures caregiving as a gendered division of labor, such that the onus of caring work falls on women, who are the main providers of care at all ages. Women's unpaid caregiving work, often experienced as a labor of love, can also be considered a form of exploitation exercised by the state (which is looking to control costs of care) as well as by loved ones.62 Women bent over backwards to nurture frail partners; daughters(-in-law) were expected to tend to ailing elders; grandmothers were entrusted with childcare; sisters were obliged to look out for disabled or mentally ill siblings. Overall, however, elder women's lives were especially likely to be contingent on their husband's need for care, with older wives likely to care for ailing husbands at some point, though I saw some cases of husbands taking on the caregiving role in the face of their wives' disability. If the \"sandwich generation\" refers to women who have to care for their parents and their children, then much of this cohort of women might be referred to as the \"club sandwich generation,\" as they cared for their elderly parents, husbands, children, and grandchildren. Despite the fact that women experienced more functional difficulties than did men, women provided more assistance to others (especially infants) who were functionally challenged than did men. Men did help more with walking and errands, but 62 See also Fiore 1999, Holstein 1999, Katz Olson 2001. 404 women were much more likely to help others to rise, dress, eat, take medication, manage money, bathe, and use the bathroom. Satisfaction with care-giving dynamics was gendered: men were happier than women with the level of support they provided, and wanted to help more, while women were slightly more prone than men to prefer to help less. This may have to do with the gendered tasks performed by men versus women. For example, men did things like occasionally helping their parents to walk and grandchildren to learn to walk, while women dealt with changing their dirty diapers and bathing them on a daily basis. In general, wives helped husbands more than husbands helped wives, for example assisting them to put their socks and shoes on. Because men tended to marry women younger than themselves (a particularly strong tradition in the elder generation), many elder women found themselves caring for a much older spouse. Characteristics of the current sociohistorical period - such as the rising number of older and very old adults, family restructuring (e.g. more single families, fewer children), increasing number of women in the paid work force, and inadequate government support for caregiving - foreshadow continuing pressure on women of all ages to pull up the caregiving slack in the absence of a comprehensive national care system. Ironically, caring for others throughout life may have reduced elder women's ability to ensure their own personal health and financial well-being during later years of life. Caregiving - paid or not - entailed exposure to physical exhaustion, mental fatigue, psychological stress, depression, isolation, and violence.63 Whether experienced as an 63 See also Clark & Huttlinger 1998, Katz Olson 2001. 405 obligation or a pleasure, caregiving was also financially risky for women because, as mentioned, it meant spending time out of the workforce, decreasing earnings in early life and pension benefits in later life. For many women, informal caregiving may be continuous, starting with sibling care in childhood, followed by childcare in early adulthood, then care for aging parents at mid-life, and finally care for frail partners in later life. Women who complied with a family and work ethic that emphasized caregiving (especially by staying home and having children) counted on the social promise of care in their later years, a hope that seemed more ephemeral every day. Because women's identity and social relationships were especially bound to the ability to care for and help others (especially their spouse, children, and grandchildren), those women who were no longer able help care for others found themselves in a slightly worse position than those whose health prevented them from doing so. Further, elder women's health problems limited their ability to care for others, and the attempt to help others often aggravated their own health problems. Elder women had worked in such capacities all their lives: as girls, as young wives, as mothers, and as elders.64 As girls in this particular generation, elder women were more likely than men to have forgone schooling in order to take on domestic/food/caring tasks, such that women's education levels were much lower than those of men (and than their national female counterparts) (see Chapter 5). Their lack of formal education later 64 Elder women in Comit\u00e1n work more and longer than women nationally. Compared to their local male counterparts, and to their national cohort, elder women in Comit\u00e1n have worked and continue to work a lot, regardless of whether the measure is years worked, worked last year or last week, or average number of hours presently working. 406 slimmed their opportunities for salaried employment. Women, then, were less likely than men to have ever held a paying job (75% vs. 98%, respectively), and were less likely to have held a paying job during the year prior to the study (41% vs. 63%). Even when paid, women's domestic/food/caring jobs were hardly lucrative. For instance, a 56 year- old woman (265) had done domestic work, washing, and ironing since she was 16. She lamented that sometimes the transport to and from the jobsite was about as much as the eventual payment for her toil. Yet she continued and eventually even drew her 15 year- old daughter away from school to work alongside her, repeating the cycle that she herself had lived. Further, payment for this type of work was often very low and/or left up to the employer. Washing and ironing was done on a piecework basis. Food sales was the same way: women invested in gardens and ingredients, then sold their limes or tacos one at a time, for just cents a piece, hoping that the net balance was in their favor. Do\u00f1a Julieta's situation illustrates. Do\u00f1a Julieta: \"I began washing when I got married. I just kept doing it.\" Do\u00f1a Julieta was 51 (276) and I stood under a piece of corrugated aluminum that covered her wash basin. Any relief the shade provided was offset by the heat it absorbed from the sun. She was washing blankets. Blankets, when soaked, become unwieldy deadweights that overflow the washbasin, and are so thick that they cannot be wrung out with human hands. \"I began washing when I got married. I just kept doing it. I had kids - 6! And then my husband passed away. It was 2 years ago just this past month. I'm sorry, I'm a mess. It just happened.\" She was crying, wiping her tears with the back of her wet hands. \"And then I felt worse and worse. I worried so much about money. My blood pressure shot through the roof. Rheumatism. And now menopause.\" She added that her headaches are frequent and severe, and that she is always depressed. Do\u00f1a Julieta leaned over the waist-high tank flanking the wash basin. Her upper body nearly disappeared as she scooped it up from about knee-high in the tank. She was acutely aware of the dangerously low level of water, the primary tool of her trade. \"I see the doctors, I take medication, I diet, I go to the pharmacy.\" This week she also had a cold and a sore throat. Last week, her arm was bothering her so much 407 that she couldn't wash, so she went to see a bone setter. She lived with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, and did as much as she could for her children and grandchildren. A daughter supported her and do\u00f1a Julieta contributed whatever she could with her washing. This daughter also helped her make health-related decisions. The cumulative effects of domestic service, food work, and caring work on women's financial insecurity in old age are evident when we compare formal financial entitlements for aged women versus aged men. In addition to reaping little (if any) pay, domestic/food/caring activities did not entitle women to other benefits of formal salaried work. Women dedicated to these activities could not bank on much job security, as food sales could drop drastically if the weather turned rainy, while washing clothing depended on sporadic water supply. Further, these activities did not entitle women to health insurance programs and services, forcing them to pay for health care expenses out-of- pocket. Of course, domestic work, cooking, and caring do not carry disability insurance. Elder women received fewer retirement benefits because they had spent less time in the paid, eligible labor force and made less money while they were working. Not surprisingly, payment into and from a pension fund was more common among men than women (14% vs. 7%), as men more often than women held the government jobs entitling them to such benefits.65 Caregiving responsibilities resulted in men spending virtually no time out of the work force, while women missed years for caregiving. Financial situation was also affected by personal biographic characteristics such as marital status. Women who never married or were divorced did not qualify for marriage-based pension benefits. 65 Women were less likely than men to have ever paid into a retirement fund. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.000). Women were less likely than men to have received pension funds for retirement or disability. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.047). 408 Entitlement to pension benefits, while lower for women in general, was especially low among less educated and indigenous elder women. Employment in adulthood also affected access to health insurance. Even when elder women worked, their part-time status, work in small businesses, and job interruptions often resulted in women having no employment-based health care coverage. Further, those insured through their husband could lose coverage through divorce, separation, or widowhood. For all but a few rich middle-aged and older women, it was not financially feasible to buy private health insurance. Instead, they had to rely on health insurance through working dependents (IMSS or ISSSTE) or through the SSA and Popular Insurance. This translated into inconsistent, fragmented, non-preventive health care in early adulthood, leading to higher risk of morbidity in later life. Moreover, as mentioned above, women tended to suffer from higher rates of chronic disease than men. Their need for personal and respite care, then, was greater than men's, while the health insurance system did not compensate for this difference, exacerbating the challenge presented by limited financial resources. Additionally, the devaluing of women's work may have impeded them from participating in the distribution of the household resources, including food and care. Most women had to combine housework, care giving, and money-making strategies. Options for doing so included front-room stores (see Chapter 5) and urban gardens, from which they sold cilantro, squash, and other vegetables for nickels and dimes. Being at 409 home also allowed them to care for their (great) grandchildren and parents. Sometimes the flexibility this sort of business provided was balanced out by the nagging truth that a closed business meant no income, prompting elders to work long hours to extend sales throughout the day. Women did not stop working - housework, food work, and caregiving started early in the morning, continued into the evening, and it started early in life and continued through old age. Additionally, women's long hours expended in physical labor and scarce time for leisure throughout life impacted their well-being in later years. Throughout their lives, these women were expected to fulfill household chores on top of any other work, at times while men slept or rested. These women frequently had 18 to 20 hour workdays for years and years of their lives, moving them to lament, \"A woman never rests.\" Despite lack of benefits, women worked, and did so many hours a day, and did so well into their later years. One out of every three elders - women and men - currently worked over 8 hours a day, and 1 in 10 worked over 12 hours a day. It was much more common for men than women to consider themselves \"retired\" (27% vs. 9%), and to have been encouraged to retire66, as in the case of a 59- year old (018 elementary schoolteacher, whose wife and children tried to persuade him to \"rest.\" In contrast, most women never retired, nor were they encouraged to do so. While 66 On the other hand, retiring from economically-active life may imply a drastic change for men, modifying rhythm of life, decreasing physical and intellectual activity, income, contact with friends or workmates, loss of self-identity derived from their profession; all of which can lead to depression and repercussions on their perception of their health (Borges-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez & G\u00f3mez-Dant\u00e9s 1998) Men, as figures of authority, strength, and power as providers and heads of households, had a more negative, sad, frustrating experience with aging because, unlike women, they could not continue fulfilling their social and culturally-assigned roles. Interestingly, women who were heads of households experienced frustration and fear similar to that experienced by men. (Trevi\u00f1o-Siller et al 2006) Gender roles dictate that men should be physically and mentally strong, maintaining authority and power in the family, and maintaining the household. Men need more family support when they age because their social networks are usually based on work. Men suffered from nervios due to their inability to fulfill their role as providers, and they manifested this in alcohol consumption. (Salgado de Snyder et al 2005) 410 men, who were more likely to work in a government job with retirement benefits, may retreat from their work once eligible to receive their pension funds, women, who were less likely to be civil servants and thus to anticipate a retirement pension, may never feel there is a time when they could retreat from their work. Many elder women also felt pressure to continue working because of their precarious economic situation. They knew that they were within poverty's reach, such that any change, including separation or widowhood, leaving even a marginal job, illness, income drop, loss of health insurance, could be catastrophic. Women's work had repercussions on their physical and mental health. Women complained about hand-washing clothes as inciting back pain, arthritis, poor circulation, swelling, and respiratory problems. Women were burned while cooking. A 75 year-old woman (274), who worked as a domestic servant for 25 years, burned her legs with boiling water. Half of the women who cared for others with functional difficulties felt that their ability to help had been limited by their own health problems, and that helping others could aggravate their own health problems. Such is the case with chronic fatigue due to caregiving. For example, of a 50-year old woman (008) who single-handedly cared for her 62-year old husband since his massive stroke a year ago, while tending to a front-room store 14 hours a day in order to sustain the household financially. The result was chronic fatigue and mismanagement and neglect of her own hypertension. The 411 lifelong toll67 of caring work can arise from early expectations that prioritize female dedication to caring for others over their own social life. Specifically, as girls and young women were encouraged or expected to take care of their parents, their chances for marriage slimmed and some even ended up with no spouse and no children. The case of do\u00f1a Inez exemplifies women's simultaneous dedication to housework, food sales, and club-sandwich care-giving - endeavors that backburner their ill mental and physical health. Do\u00f1a Inez: \"Afraid of following in my [diabetic] mother's footsteps\" As if it would shatter, do\u00f1a Inez eased her thin body down to sit on steps leading from the street into a side door of her house. A few men, including her husband, were adding a layer of cement to the outside walls of the building. The air was humid and filled with fine cement dust, making it hard to breathe. At just 53 years old, do\u00f1a Inez (275) was one of the youngest informants, yet was the most withered person I met over the course of the study. Originally from Comit\u00e1n, she studied through fourth grade, then spent over 25 years selling cheese, and recently set up a small store in her front room, where she serves customers through a propped-up window. With respect to the other participants, she was comparatively educated, young, married, business-savvy, with four grown children. Yet do\u00f1a Inez was extremely unhealthy. For the past 22 years, she had battled diabetes. She took medication and stuck to a diet, but recently, her blood sugar dropped drastically and she began to vomit. She spent 8 days in the General Hospital, and had been brought home just two weeks prior to our meeting. In addition to such acute events, she associated her diabetes with her aching joints, sharp pain in her feet, and failing vision. Do\u00f1a Inez was also menopausal, on which she blamed fluctuations in her blood pressure. She had consulted a doctor for this, but was not currently treating it. Her daily activities have been limited by her multiple symptoms, and she had spent most of the past month in bed. She had Popular Insurance, but complained that they rarely had her diabetes pills and eye drops in stock. Her husband and children covered her medical expenses and make 67 Although not mentioned, domestic service often implies subordination by women (as well as men), and thus may hinder mental health, as well as physical well-being. 412 decisions regarding her care. While facing her own debilitating health, she struggled to care for three grandchildren while her daughter works, and she teamed up with a few siblings to care for her mother, who recently had a leg amputated due to diabetes. Do\u00f1a Inez feared she faced the same fate. Linking dependence on grown children to women's life work as unpaid care-givers, the ISSTECH psychologist identified a source of elder women's low self-esteem: little to show for years of toil: Many women feel that they are little old ladies.... Many were very hard-working women, they raised their children, and now they feel like economically they don't have anything, they feel powerless, like they're not worth anything, and many women lose their self-worth. I've seen them and heard their comments, and they often cry because they are scared that if they don't do everything like they're supposed to, they'll end up completely alone. They lose their courage. They don't think that caring for themselves is enough, so they suffer.... In sum, domestic service, food work, and caring work placed women at a disadvantage in a number of ways, including that these types of work offered little pay, reaped a physical and emotional toll, did not include health insurance or retirement benefits, discouraged women from resting, and provoked or exacerbated women's physical and mental health problems. 4. Gendered impact of poor city infrastructure, lack of household amenities Deficiencies in city infrastructure and lack of household amenities had a greater impact on elder women than on men because prominent women's activities - housework, food preparation, and care giving - rested on water supply, cooking fuel, availability of a refrigerators and washing machines. Elder women were also more limited than men by transportation obstacles. 413 Nearly all elders in Comit\u00e1n lived in homes with electricity, a television, and a radio, yet many lived without indoor plumbing, cooked with firewood or charcoal, and lacked a refrigerator and washing machine. Rates do not vary by sex; however, the impact differed immensely by sex, due to the extreme differentiation in occupation by sex. Women were more affected, given that 3 of 10 women had spent a lifetime providing domestic service, hand-washing clothes, preparing or selling food (many still did so), and half currently devoted themselves to their own housework and care-giving. Washing, cleaning, cooking, and care-giving were everyday challenges for women, yet were much less experienced by men, so women who lacked amenities faced a disproportionate risk of fatigue, strain, and illness. Nearly one fifth (18%) of all elders drew their water from outdoor taps (similar to national rates). Carrying water added an extra - if not difficult - step when washing clothing and dishes, cooking, bathing, and maintaining hygienic home conditions. Even women with washing machines usually had to fill them manually. Many had toilets and latrines that must be manually flushed with a bucket of water. In Comit\u00e1n, water availability is sporadic and someone - usually a woman - must make a conscious effort to fill tanks and buckets when there is water flowing through the pipes, to clean water receptacles, and to obtain water elsewhere when reserves run dry. Women were more likely than men to have to tend to water-related tasks, and therefore must endure water shortages and the challenges of obtaining and transporting water. 414 I cannot resist commenting on my tenure as the woman in charge of water supply for my household, a first-hand, decade-long experience. One aspect of the job is to first obtain (buy, find, borrow, construct) drums and tanks. Then, obviously, you want to keep them. I confess that, once, our huge water drum was empty in anticipation of water flow, and after about a week, it disappeared, hoisted over the wall of the yard one night, and carted off, never to be seen again. With receptacles available, the next task is to obtain water. There is no rhyme or reason to piped water flow in Comit\u00e1n, the day and time cannot be predicted, so there is a continuous hope and stress about whether \"water is coming\" or not. When it does, you have to be present to fill all the tanks. When it does not come and supplies are exhausted, you have to figure out where to get some more - transported in drums in the back of a pickup truck? Via hose from up the street? Bucket by bucket from a neighbor? Paying for part or all of a tanker truck full? And then, there is the stress of keeping water. Floaters in toilet tanks and drums are not reliable and become easily maladjusted with the pressured air bubbles that flow through the pipes in strong bursts; thus a floater might be stuck in the full position when the tank is really empty; alternatively, it can be stuck in the empty position while water overflows the tank. Water can be stored, but for how long? The water is far from potable, often visibly muddied, and includes sediment, leaves, insect larvae, micro- and not-so-micro-organisms. This makes water receptacles, out in the sun, nurturing flora and fauna. So, at some point, you have to risk dumping the old water and waiting for the new. Scrubbing the tank can entail a broom, getting into the tank, and soap. Clorox is a common additive to water tanks - and therefore is ingested and present in water used to bathe, wash dishes and 415 clothing. Water is so precious that it prompts questions about when to give it away, charge for it, pay for it. Before I moved out of a house with a large cistern, I invited all the neighbors to take as much water as they wished. It was as if I were giving out cash. In terms of residential fuel, 17% of informants - the most economically-marginalized - cooked with firewood or charcoal rather than gas. Elder women (but no men) had been burned while cooking with wood on their knee-high hearths. Smoke from cooking fires also influenced women's health. The Municipal DIF Director pointed out that many elder women in Comit\u00e1n were from farms and villages in which women were the designated cooks, and they cooked over wood or charcoal, so that eventually they suffered from respiratory symptoms, such as a chronic cough. Water heaters (for bathing) were also fueled by gas, wood, or charcoal. Women bathed others (spouse, grandchildren, parents, women postpartum), so had to carry water and face exposure to danger of burns more than did men, who very rarely had to bathe anyone else. Figure 8.5, Photo, a 98 year-old woman by her hearth 416 In Comit\u00e1n, 73% had refrigerators, which play a role in the preservation of food and medication. The climate in Comit\u00e1n is temperate, but does get hot during the spring, increasing chances of spoilage. Women who did not have a refrigerator had to buy smaller quantities of food, requiring them to shop more often and pay higher prices than if they were able to shop in bulk and refrigerate extra portions. Just under half (45%) of elders had a washing machine, while the rest depended on hand washing clothing, a strenuous activity. This was much less than at the national level, where 64% have a washing machine. Many women washed clothes for extra income, standing, backs bent over cement wash basins outside their homes or the homes of their employers. Depending on the season, washing clothes outside can mean hours in the hot, high altitude sun, or in cold air with hands plunged into numbing water. The water running from the tap into the wash basins (again, when there is water running) was never heated. Further, some washing machines were really little more than agitators, so that the tanks need to be filled buck-by-buck for each wash/rinse cycle, and clothing wrung out by hand. Many women associated their health problems with years of hand-washing clothing. Given elder women's responsibilities, which included getting to and from markets, jobs, schools (to drop off/pick up grandchildren), clinics, and churches, difficulty and cost of transportation was a concern. For local travel, most elders in Comit\u00e1n relied on public transportation (usually VW vans or minibuses), yet more women did so than did men 417 (61% vs. 47%). A number of elders were forced to travel by car due to distance or to some medical condition prohibiting them from walking or boarding a van. However, women were also much less likely (6%) than men (20%) to move about regularly in their own vehicle. In contrast, more women (12%) than men (4%) relied on taxis for regular transportation. Taxis are five times more expensive than a bus. While men rarely devoted themselves to housework (either in at home or at work), to washing clothes, to preparing and selling food, or to bathing relatives, a large percentage of women spent their days - indeed their lives - engaged in these activities. For many older women, then, having to wash clothing by hand (rather than with a washing machine), cart water from an outside spigot (assuming there is actually water running), cook over a fire without getting burned, minimize food spoilage without a refrigerator, and move about the city were daily challenges that men confronted much less regularly than did women. Thus, lack of infrastructure and amenities increased risk of fatigue, strain, accidents, and illness in women more than men because of the distinctively gendered nature of occupations. 418 Reflections on Chapter 8 The gendered mortality difference identified early on in the research process served as a trigger for more detailed research. Mortality figures were a red flag belying an iceberg of morbidity, care seeking challenges, and limited resources. The resulting review of the data allowed me to develop a detailed description of gendered differences in health problems faced by elder men and women and variation in care they sought and received. Inn Comit\u00e1n, elder women suffered disproportionately from health problems. On one hand, their poor health status may be rooted in and exacerbated by the fact that they may not receive the health care that they needed and desired. On the other (or another) hand, elder women's health was also a function of gendered life conditions, primarily the accumulated effects of marriage, children, work, and infrastructure. In addition to noting key contrasts between elder men and women, these same factors permit contrasting among women. Elder women were not a homogenous group, and the \"differences that make a difference\" between women included whether they were in supportive marriages (with a husband who did not drink, was not abusive, was employed, insured, etc.); the nature of their relationship with their children; their working conditions; and whether they had access to household amenities and quality infrastructure. 419 To reiterate, integrating a life-span perspective enriches understanding of \"local biologies\"68 of aging by calling attention to how earlier life experiences converge to shape well-being in later life. Assuming a feminist perspective highlights the effect of social difference and marginalization in this process. The examples here illuminate the combined effects of: \u0001 social location (e.g. gender, class), \u0001 sociohistorical period (e.g. patriarchy, structural adjustment), and \u0001 personal biography (e.g. marital status, employment, children, place of residence). Especially apparent was how women's well-being in later life is a product of the distribution of power between men and women, which shapes experiences and access to resources throughout life. A feminist life-span perspective underlines the need for political and social change not only to improve the lives of those women who are already in their later years, but also to better the lives of the future cohort of older women. Women's cumulative gendered experiences throughout their lives meant that women frequently confronted illness in old age with less social, emotional, and economic capital than did men. Of note here is the delicate nature of negotiating women's narratives about their difficulties, suffering, and sacrifice. What women say about gender relations are not necessarily simple truths about who they are or what they believe, but rather a means of talking about or representing the self, a discourse aimed at an intended audience. On one 68 I refer here to Lock's (1993a) contention that, \"cultural beliefs influence the construction, experience, and interpretation of aging and other biological processes [and] that biological difference... molds and contains the subjective experience of individuals and the creation of cultural interpretations\" (Lock1993a: 39). 420 hand, women may provide accurate descriptions of their experiences. On the other hand, women, especially older Latin American women, justify making demands on others - including their husband and children - by claiming to have suffered and sacrificed for them (\"marianismo\"). Presenting women's narratives also poses the danger of contributing to negative gender stereotypes of Latin Americans, such as the machismo/marianismo and the active/passive dichotomies, at once so prevalent among Anglo social scientists, and now reviled by Latin Americans. In taking women's complaints at face value and portraying them as real, it is not my intention to repeat the derogatory stereotypes of Latin American men as drunken abusers and women as passive victims of male violence. Usually, women are both more powerful that they make themselves out to be, and men are more caring than they have to pretend to be. For instance, many separated/divorced elder women justified (to themselves, to others, and to me) their partner-less existence, a lifestyle that clashes with longstanding gendered stereotypes predominant in the Catholic church. I do not doubt that many men did not fulfill their responsibility of being faithful, hard-working providers; yet in characterizing men as malicious, women justified their freedom and independence from men (see also Collier J. 2005: 223). Of the power of discourse and gender stereotypes, Collier (2005) observes, Gender stereotypes provide a powerful language for justifying one's own actions and for condemning the actions of others. Gender stereotypes are powerful, not because they are singular and monolithic, but because they are multiple and riddled with contradictions. Different interpretations of gender stereotypes, however, offer different resources to their articulators and can lead to different outcomes. (Collier J. 2005: 218) 421 She concludes that the question is, \"who uses which gender stereotypes when, for what purposes, and with what consequences\" (Collier J. 2005: 219). Women's discourse about gender stereotypes is a form of capital, which if manipulated skillfully, they may convert into other forms of capital relevant to their health and care. 422 CHAPTER 9. CARE PROVIDERS DESCRIBE LOCAL ELDER CARE SERVICES Overview of Chapter 9 As mentioned the Mexican government has made great efforts to provide health care for much of its population (see Chapters 1 and 3). The state has achieved considerable advances over the past few decades, especially in the areas of maternal, infant, and child health (c.f. Sep\u00falveda 2006). That said, the data presented in the previous chapters indicate that attention and resources dedicated to addressing elder well-being has been insufficient. This is not to say that there is no general awareness of the problem of elder health; on the contrary, the federal government has published some health service norms, declared elder health care rights, and enacted some elder care programs. In this chapter, I explore specific health care services accessed by elders in Comit\u00e1n, from the perspectives of those who provide this care: health care practitioners69. At the Encuentro, mere mention of elder well-being seemed to hit a nerve, and practitioners were poised to share their experiences; however, I was wary of asking them to do so in a group setting, and wanted to avoid putting them on the defensive. In this culture in which \"dirty laundry is washed at home,\" merely suggesting that practitioners and institutions were not doing an adequate job was risky. Beyond endangering their legitimacy and thus their employment, clinical directors might be provoked to put up barriers to future research in their institutions, and individual practitioners might hide 69 Hereafter referred to as \"providers\" or \"practitioners\" to distinguish them from people who care for elders outside the clinical setting, referred to as \"home-based caregivers\" or \"caregivers.\" 423 flaws and shortcomings. I approached this delicate situation with interviews. The ten practitioners I interviewed spanned the clinical echelons to include social workers, nurses, psychologists, physicians, administrators, and clinical directors. Over about an hour, we conversed in the place of their choice: their office, a caf\u00e9, or a sitting room at home. With prior informed consent, I tape-recorded each interview, and later transcribed these. Some service providers also offered brochures and even CDs detailing programs and services. I used a three-pronged interview strategy. First, to break the ice, I referenced general topics mentioned in the Encuentro as well as preliminary findings from the surveys and interviews with elders and caregivers. Second, I asked practitioners to describe - officially - the services provided by their institution or practice. This elicited flowery descriptions of what would seem to be an adequate array of support for elders in Comit\u00e1n. Third, I asked them to share with me the challenges they faced in attempting to provide these services and their dreams for the future of elder care in Comit\u00e1n. At this point, their official rhetoric rapidly shifted to an unofficial characterization in which they admitted that elder care did indeed fall short of expectations and needs. This exercise allowed me to generate an image of various local elder health care services, idealized as if they functioned as intended, and generating an illusion of a well-thought-out, well- functioning, comprehensive elder care system. I contrast this view with practitioners' assessment of the problems, shortcomings, and gaps. Their testimony evidences that the rights, programs, and facilities championed by the state may be little more than an empty 424 shell. Additionally, providers argued that: a) elders did not take care of themselves at home, b) elders did not take advantage of available health services, c) elders self- prescribed and over-medicated, d) families did not take care of elders, and e) providers lacked the resources and institutional support to offer quality elder care. In addition to the contrast between providers' official version and their unofficial assessment, providers' perspectives differed greatly from elders' experiences. Practitioners seemed to blame elders, their families, and institutional higher-ups for poor health and care. From elders' standpoint, in contrast, the state and its employees were to blame. The provider-elder schism was due, in part, to the fact that health practitioners and institutional directors were from the old elite families and the new professional class, with corresponding values, vested interests, and perspectives, as well as the power to voice these and operationalize them in the health care system. Elders, in contrast, tended to be of the more marginalized social echelons, and had little cultural, social, and material capital. This situation persisted because the providers spent their days in clinic, and did no home care delivery. Given this lack of interaction, and despite their concern and good intentions, providers had a distorted view of elders' situations. On the other hand, practitioners were ideally positioned to identify inter-institutional challenges and the underlying misallocation of state resources and misguided priorities among state policy makers above them. My next task, described in Chapter 10, would be to create a space in which to initiate a discussion of these contrasting perspectives and then engage stakeholders in using this insight to shape \"the politics of the possible.\" 425 A. Elder health care services in Comit\u00e1n: providers' \"official\" version As outlined in Chapters 1 and 3, the Mexican government has made great efforts to provide health care for much of its population. The state has achieved considerable advances over the past few decades, especially in the areas of maternal, infant, and child health (c.f. Sep\u00falveda). That said, the data presented in the previous chapters indicate that attention and resources dedicated to addressing elder well-being has been insufficient. This is not to say that there is no awareness of the problem of elder health; on the contrary, the government has published some health service norms, declared elder health care rights, and enacted some elder care programs. In this chapter, I draw on providers' perspectives to describe specific health care services accessed by elders in Comit\u00e1n. Specifically, I describe the Cl\u00ednica Hospital C ISSSTE, Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH, the Centro de and Hospital General (under the umbrella of Jurisdicci\u00f3n Sanitaria III), Instituto de Desarrollo moves roughly along a continuum from national, insurance-based programs through state and municipal services, to private initiatives. Descriptions of each institution include information such as location, beneficiaries, major services offered, common elder health problems seen, and general vision of elder care. I assembled these description from providers' responses to my request that they describe 426 their official services. While not exhaustive70, the services I introduce here represent a range of local public and private institutions commonly accessed by insured and uninsured elders in Comit\u00e1n. This section culminates with a narrative about the Casa- Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n, unique in Comit\u00e1n as it was devoted solely to elder care, offered residence to elders, and was privately-funded. Presented in the words of the home's administrator, this description highlights the historical precedents of this local elder care initiative, elucidates the nature of on-the-ground elder care, and illuminates some of the local politics in which elder care exists. 1. Cl\u00ednica Hospital C ISSSTE The Institute of Security and Social Services for State Workers (Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, ISSSTE) provided insurance-based health services for federal government employees/retirees and their immediate relatives. ISSSTE's Cl\u00ednica Hospital C in Comit\u00e1n served 3555 beneficiaries over the age of 60, which accounted for about 16% of the regional population aged 60 and up. In 2004, this added up to a total of 8,523 medical consults, or 710 consults per month. In general, consults with adults over age 55 constituted about 25% of the total visits, yet this age group occupied around 60% of ISSSTE hospital beds. The Clinical Director observed that the health problems among elders tend to be of long duration, costly, and requiring special services. Among the elder patients seen at the ISSSTE, the proportions of men 70 This section would benefit from similar descriptions of the IMSS clinic, the Red Cross, private pharmacies, preferred (among elder informants) private physicians, and additional complementary/alternative/traditional healers. 427 and women were about the same. Patients were drawn primarily from Comit\u00e1n, the neighboring municipalities of Comalapa and Las Margaritas, and to a lesser extent from a few other bordering municipalities. The clinic was located in the southwest perimeter of the city, in an area relatively recently settled and home to a few grade schools. Figure 9.1, Photo, Cl\u00ednica Hospital C, ISSSTE. The most common health problems among elders attending the Cl\u00ednica Hospital C were (in descending order of frequency): chronic-degenerative diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, prostate conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, urinary tract infections, and cataracts. Elders also sought care for the sequelae of these conditions, such as loss of vision among diabetics. Following national protocol, the ISSSTE had begun to institute a two-pronged \"Successful Aging Program.\" The Geroprofilaxis component refers to bolstering preventive medicine among adults via assessing individual risk factors, providing continuity of case management, and using curative action to avoid later health 428 complications and to limit cost of treatment. The Elder Health Action component refers to providing specialized care in order to intervene and minimize harm, safeguard independence, and guarantee quality of life. Care is to be monitored in part via an official record of family background, lifestyle and habits, specific problems, initial assessment, treatment, and periodic recommendations. Further, each patient is to receive a Cartilla PIBE, an \"individualized health plan for successful aging,\" which includes clinical history; pharmacological history; body measurements; breast, pelvic, and rectal exams; tobacco and alcohol use; psychosocial and mental problems, including depression and memory loss; falls and instability; hearing and vision status. Other details, such as dental care, podiatry, osteoporosis, (in)continence, lab tests, and vaccinations (e.g. flu), are supposedly noted as well. ISSSTE practitioners visit some large government installations (e.g. schools) a few times a year to administer blood pressure and blood sugar tests to enrollees. In addition to clinical care for elders, in 2004, the Cl\u00ednica Hospital C set up a \"mutual support group\" for patients aged 40 and up who were diabetic and/or hypertensive. The group met in the cafeteria once every two weeks for informative talks about health care. Attendance varied between 6 and 24 elders, but usually hovered around a dozen. Most patients arrived alone, but occasionally brought a family member, which social workers encouraged. Participants usually fasted that morning so that they could get their glucose tested upon arrival, before eating a sack lunch in the group's company and listening to the day's discussion. The talks focused, for example, on what diabetes is, causes, 429 complications, and treatment. One of the two social workers who lead the group explained, [We have to know how to clarify all this] because sometimes, well, most of the time, the doctor is so busy that he says, \"Well, you're a diabetic. You can't eat sugar, you shouldn't eat tortillas, you shouldn't eat this, you shouldn't eat!\" So then the patient freaks out and starts to think, \"And what can I eat?\" And, well, it is so, so difficult to stay on a diet of steamed vegetables. No one, no one could put up with that for more than a few days, let alone months, or a lifetime. These social workers were trained to answer the most common questions and provide relevant pamphlets. Additionally, they invited other highly-trained providers to talk. For instance, the clinic's internist and the ophthalmologist had detailed some of the physical complications, while a psychologist discussed emotional issues. A nutritionist talked to the group about their diet and eating habits. A geriatrician was scheduled to help elders address death and dying. The group coordinators also planned seasonal events, for example a healthy Father's Day breakfast. The social workers viewed the group as a success, pointing to the fact that not one of the participants had been hospitalized and many had decreased their medication doses. The ISSSTE's Clinical Director asserted that he would like to re-structure services and train staff to provide \"preferential care for people of the third age.\" One focus of this re- orientation would be to resolve transport issues for elder patients. He has probed a dynamic by which those elders who cannot travel to the Cl\u00ednica Hospital C, due to lack of transportation and/or mobility limitations, can call and request transport by ambulance. So far, just a handful of patients had done so. In extremely special cases (just one at the time of the interview), the medical coordinator may make a house call. A second 430 component to this \"preferential care\" initiative consists of training personnel to treat elders well, both in the examining room and out. The Director explained, One of the problems we have is the - [he stops]. Well, we are conducting a campaign to sensitize our doctors to issues of care for patients of the third age so that they get preferential treatment. They shouldn't have to wait in lines, they shouldn't have to wait so long to be seen. This type of patient needs another type of care. It's not only about telling them to come in and sit down, it's about real quality care. The fact that they are older should entitle them to certain preferential treatment and moreover, it should stimulate a little more respect on behalf of public servants toward our ill patients. The Director hoped that elements of this project might coincide with his desire to carry out such re-prioritization and relevant sensitization.71 2. Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH The Social Security Institute for State Workers in Chiapas (Instituto de Seguridad Social de los Trabajadores del Estado de Chiapas, ISSTECH) is the insurance-based health care provider for state government employees/retirees/family. For elder beneficiaries in Comit\u00e1n, the Geri\u00e1trica (Geriatric Home-Clinic). The Geri\u00e1trica was located in what was a large, two-story residence on a steep street within a few blocks of the central park. The Casa-Clinica served a population of 689 beneficiaries, who were as young as 46 years old (at this age, some people are eligible to retire with such insurance benefits, and others receive pension 71 The Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, IMSS), the nationwide insurance-based service for private-sector workers/retirees and their immediate family, offers elder health care services similar to those offered by ISSSTE. For example, much like ISSSTE's Successful Aging Program with its Cartilla PIBE, the IMSS instituted (in 2002) an Integrated Programs of Health (PREVENIMSS), a series of age-differentiated packages of preventive care and accompanying education documented via individual updateable cards (cartillas). PREVENIMSS includes a specific program for adults over age 60. As the ISSSTE, IMSS aspirations include providing mobile units to transport between home and hospital, and offering integral care for diabetic and hypertensive elders. 431 through relatives). The clinic was frequented by more women than men, and most were between 46 and 55 years old; the eldest beneficiary at that time of the interview was an 84-year old woman. The majority (women) were widows who lived with their children, although a few lived alone. Some had just lost their husband, while others experienced this change a decade or more ago. Most had always lived in Comit\u00e1n. Some of the beneficiaries were also covered by ISSSTE or IMSS, yet opted to attend the ISSTECH. The Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH services were divided into four areas: rehabilitation, psychomotor/exercise, psychology, arts and crafts. The clinic usually employed one physician, a few nurses, and some course instructors. Of the four service areas, beneficiaries most often sought medical consultation and rehabilitation. It was usually very convenient because patients could see a doctor and participate in other activities all in the same visit. Unfortunately, at the time of the interview, there was no doctor on staff, but the Director had just negotiated for one to start. The most common health problems elders present at the Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH were diabetes, hypertension, other degenerative diseases, and depression. According to the Director, \"the majority of illnesses are emotional and these set off other physical sicknesses.\" The clinic's psychologist detailed, \"Something that they all have in common is depression. They are scared of ending up alone, of being rejected, and therefore they accept things that they don't like. [...] Principally, what we want to make them understand is that they shouldn't lose their self-worth just because they are old.\" 432 Given this perspective and the temporary absence of a physician, the Casa-Cl\u00ednica emphasized reviewing patients' psychological states to identify how best to help them combat their physical symptoms, as well as reduce consumption of medication. The psychologist say around 40-42 patients for individual consults a month. Figure 9.2, Photo, activity calendar, Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH. Additionally, the Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH offered regularly-scheduled workshops focused on memory, relaxation, and interaction. The Director reflected on the workshops: The memory workshop, well, we're all losing it, really [hearty laugh]. So we have them do lots of exercises. I think that all of us forget things once in a while, right? We need to exercise our memory and we won't do it on our own. So here in a group setting, it gets interesting. They have a good time together and work their memory all at once. The relaxation workshop, well, older adults are extremely tense, so they need to relax a lot. The interaction workshops are held in a group or individually, depending on what the psychologist decides is best; sometimes they start one-on-one and then meet as a group. These are really nice group therapies in which elders learn to live, to share, to help, too. Relaxation therapy was the most popular among the patients. Courses were usually attended by 8 or 9 people, and lasted about 2 hours. Casa-Cl\u00ednica Geri\u00e1trica ISSTECH staff tried to respond to beneficiaries' concerns and requests - insofar as the personnel is 433 available - for example offering a cooking class and organizing a special talk on depression. There were monthly field trips to nearby places like the theater and a caf\u00e9 on the edge of the central park, but they strived to bring most of the action to the clinic. \"Why? Because that's why the clinic was established, so they would come to us.\" 3. Jurisdicci\u00f3n Sanitaria III: Hospital General & Centro The Health Jurisdiction III (Jurisdicci\u00f3n Sanitaria III, JSIII) was the regional arm of the Mexican Secretary of Health (Secretar\u00eda de Salud, SSA), which theoretically provides health care to all Mexicans not insured through ISSSTE or IMSS. The Health Jurisdiction III served a region of over 450,000 inhabitants, spread over 9 municipalities, the largest being Comit\u00e1n, Las Margaritas, and La Trinitaria. Jurisdicci\u00f3n Sanitaria III was supposed to cover just 49% of the local population, but one administrator estimated that, in reality, it served about 70%, because the demand was high even among those who were covered by insurance. In Comit\u00e1n, all elders may receive primary health care at the Health Center (Centro de Salud) and secondary care at the General Hospital (Hospital General K), both falling within the Jurisdicci\u00f3n Sanitaria III. The Centro de Salud and the Hospital General, situated within 3 blocks of each other, were located 8-10 blocks south (and downhill) from Comit\u00e1n's central park. As in the ISSSTE and IMSS, the SSA had instituted a system of age-appropriate medical services, with distinct pamphlets especially designed to track health and care (cartillas) among individuals of each cohort. The SSA's \"Aging Care Action Program\" oriented 434 care for adults aged 60 and up. The cartilla for elders indicated priorities in SSA institutions in that, aside from space in which to register personal information, it was designed to document vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, tuberculosis, prostate conditions, osteoporosis, and others; steps aimed at prevention of complications from diabetes and hypertension; Papanicolaou and breast exams; weight; dental health; mental health; and eyesight. Figure 9.3, Photo, Hospital General K. Figure 9.4, Photo, Centro de Salud. In the SSA facilities, patients were charged a \"recovery fee,\" calculated on a sliding scale according to their financial situation. Because they tended to be low income, most elder patients seeking care through the SSA received services free of charge. For primary health care, elders had to enter the system through the Health Center. Notably, the Health Center offered some dental care. Patients needing more specialized care were referred to the Hospital, a 90-bed regional hospital in charge of providing secondary health care and emergency attention to the uninsured population.72 Most of the Hospital's work was 72 The Comit\u00e1n General Hospital enjoyed a favorable reputation until the death of 34 neonates in the month of December 2002 catapulted it to the center of national attention, and renewed surveillance, investment, 435 dedicated to obstetrics. Services for elders were focused on non-infectious diseases, primarily diabetes and hypertension, and on vaccination campaigns for influenza and pneumonia. Specialists saw patients with acute vision problems and pain, but not for routine screening or management. Neither the Health Center nor the Hospital offered mental health services, although social workers in the Hospital facilitated patient stays. The Hospital housed its own laboratory. It also operated a very busy emergency room and four ambulances. Most elders requiring emergency care arrived for heart attacks and strokes. Elders made up approximately 20 to 25% of outpatient consults. The Hospital, grants just 12 appointments to elders per day (usually for follow-up after hospitalization), amounting to around 300 elders per month. Recall that the Hospital's official patient base consists of over 450,000 people, the majority of them economically marginalized. 4. Instituto de Desarrollo Humano (IDH) The Human Development Institute (Instituto de Desarrollo Humano, IDH) was situated a few blocks uphill from the General Hospital (see above) and in the same compound as the DIF (see below). This state institution focused its efforts on vulnerable and socially- marginalized groups, including older adults (as well as victims of domestic violence, legally unprotected populations, at-risk teens, among others). Statewide goals for older adults were to promote health and prevent illness in the home and community via encouraging physical rehabilitation, exercise, nutrition, tobacco and alcohol cessation, safe sex, accident prevention, hygiene, and recreation. and debate surrounding the quality of maternal-infant care in Chiapas. It is in this context that official efforts for improving maternal-infant health continue to be prioritized over that of older adults. 436 Figure 9.5, National Health Card for older adults, used by SSA institutions. 437 In Comit\u00e1n, the IDH service benefiting most elders was its physical therapy clinic, where older adults were treated for discomfort and limitations in movement related to their joints, muscles, bones, and complications of hypertension and other chronic-degenerative diseases. IDH therapy was considered second- or third- level health care, and the majority of elder patients were referred by private physicians and specialists who had already deemed IDH services necessary and appropriate. In terms of patient load, about 120 elders per month received initial assessments for potential rehabilitation. Another 130 elders a month received physical therapy. Three providers - an occupational therapist, a physician, and a physical therapist - saw patients, each for 30-45 minutes, 8 hours a day. Most elder patients seeking IDH therapy occupied lower socioeconomic echelons, and the majority of elders were men over age 75. Elders usually visited the clinic accompanied by a son or daughter, niece or nephew, or alone. Patients were charged a very small fee according to a sliding scale based on their income. Those who were handicapped or extremely poor paid nothing. The most common problems seen among elders in the IDH Rehabilitation Area were consequences of hypertension, followed by stroke, osteoporosis, and depression. 5. Desarrollo Integral Familiar (DIF) The Municipal Integral Family Development center (Desarrollo Integral Familiar, DIF), in the nationwide tradition, was run by the wife of the highest ranking local politician, in this case, the mayor. The DIF offered social services and health care to people of all ages. Among elders, medical care was the service most solicited at the Municipal DIF. 438 The patient base was about 255 individuals, of whom 65-70% are elders. The great majority were women between the ages of 65 and 80 years old, while the men who sought services were usually younger (45-50 years old). For elders, personnel attempted to provide in-house care whenever possible, referring to other providers only when absolutely necessary, in order to cut expenses and provide patients with continuity of care. The most common health problems elder DIF patients presented were: osteoporosis, degenerative joint diseases (especially affecting the knees and back), diabetes, and hypertension (in descending order of frequency). The Clinical Director pointed out that alcoholism and tobacco addiction, with their consequences, such as vitamin deficiency, were the most common problems they saw among elder men. In addition to medical care, elders may benefit from a few other DIF programs. Specifically for adults over age 50, the Elder Council (Consejo de Ancianos) provided social welfare assistance to approximately 120 people in the municipality of Comit\u00e1n. Elders were taught manual skills aimed at providing them with a means of subsistence. They were also given funds for buying food and free medical care with medication. Qualifying low-income adults may receive a once-a-month dispensa - a basket of basic food items, such as tuna fish, rice, and beans. This assistance was available to elders who, while they did not necessarily have to be dirt-poor, must live alone (or with just a spouse) without family on which they could depend, i.e. be self-sufficient. 439 6. Centro de Vida Sana Adelante Sana Adelante or Centro Adelante) provided alternative health care, offered by a young couple in the front room of their home. They saw walk-in patients, who paid meager fees out-of-pocket on a per- visit basis. The practitioners were adamant, however, about the fact that they accepted any and all patients who came to them seeking care, \"health care among people of the third age should be equally available to all. For example, the ISSTECH is only for those with insurance, and some of them don't even take advantage of it. Then there are elders who have no resources to visit a geriatrician.\" The Centro de Vida practitioners' vision was to change the behavior they saw as the source of elders' (and others') health problems, via first altering attitudes and then using the forces of nature as a fundamental preventive and curative tool. A practitioner explained, In terms of the third age, it's important to observe how elders have advanced in their culture, their way of living.... There will always be ill elders. Our services aim to eradicate the problems, but the difference here is that we utilize natural forces: the sun, the air, the spiritual environment. The problem here in Comit\u00e1n is not so much physical as mental. Their standard mode of service was to first review the diagnosis that patients had received from a physician, clinic, or laboratory. Their elder patients most frequently came to them with stomach and intestinal problems. This prompted practitioners to initiate a detoxification period, asking that the patient put pharmaceuticals aside for a few days, as these are viewed as toxic and poisonous. Subsequently, they would advocate a 440 regimen of water consumption to flush out toxins, rehydrate the body and soften muscles. The detoxification and hydration often lasted over 10 days, so that patients frequently called this kind of control a \"diet.\"' Practitioners gave massages, attempted minor muscular-skeletal adjustments, and applied relaxation techniques. At the same time that they strove to relax tight muscles, practitioners began to loosen elders' psychological states, which had also become tense and rigid. Elders were asked what was bothering them - mentally and physically - so that practitioners may use detoxification, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, including over 40 different types of treatment. They asserted that these treatments were so simple that they might be called \"home remedies,\" yet must be administered under strict control. These practitioners advocated 23-, 28-, or 36-day \"treatment packages,\" depending on the patient's condition. They then taught healthy life style habits, such as health care, anatomy, vegetarian cooking and improved eating habits. Mostly we work on eating, rehabilitation, physiotherapy, and education. It is as if they are children taking their first steps. We teach them the origin of their problem and where it may lead. We give them hope that they can be cured. When they leave, they leave completely healthy, but soon afterward, another problem may start, so after 2 to 3 weeks, some fall sick again. What happens is that they feel healthy then they leave, but they fall again. This is the truth - when they leave, they're well, but then they fall back into their old habits again. [...] So the first thing we do is to teach, and then we treat. None of the institutions described thus far was exclusively dedicated to elders, nor offered residence nor hospice care, and none was a non-government or not-for-profit. The Sacred Heart Home, described in detail below, diverges from this dynamic. 441 7. Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n The Sacred Heart Home (Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n) was a residential facility. The home admitted adults aged 65 and up, who were free of contagious and psychological disease (e.g. Alzheimer's), and of \"vices that might upset the tranquility of the other residents.\"73 Founded 35 years ago, nuns ran the place for years before it was set up as a civil association with a non-sectarian governing board. Years ago, the nuns actively sought out homeless elders, while now people come to the Casa-Hogar, and go through a strict screening process. Figure 9.6, Photo, chapel, Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n. Elders usually initiated their residence at the Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n around ages 85 or 90, \"when it gets harder to take care of them. Well, that's if they have any family at all. Those without family are referred to us by the DIF or people in the community who, realizing that an elder has been abandoned, get together and come ask us to take 73 Those who do not meet these criteria may be referred to the DIF for placement in an \"asylum\" located about 30 minutes from Comit\u00e1n that is, theoretically, more adequately staffed and structured. 442 them in.\" Residents lived out the remainder of their lives at the Casa-Hogar. The average number of residents was 25, but this fluctuates quite a bit with deaths and new admissions. The great majority - in fact, all but 3 - of the residents were women. Most were from Comit\u00e1n, but a handful came from out of state. Their socioeconomic status was generally quite low, although there was a range between destitute and abandoned to those whose relatives cannot take care of them due to other constraints (such as work), but who do contribute a bit to covering costs and try to help out in kind. While the majority of the residents are Catholic, all religions were respected. There is, however, one characteristic that nearly all of the residents do share: they never married. The Administrator reflected, The most generalized problem I see is in the affective sense. I don't know what happened over the course of their upbringing, but almost all of them are single. All of them are single. For some reason, they didn't want to marry, or their parents didn't let them marry when the time was right because they had to take care of their parents. [...] I've observed so, so many single people in Comit\u00e1n, it's really exaggerated, men and women. It's out of control, in every family there are people, 2 or 3 or a bunch of siblings who never married. [...] So their worst ill is what we might call bitterness in their hearts. ... They are unable to receive and give affection. They're hardened. Figure 9.7, Photo, residents, Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n. 443 All residents lived on-site; there were no day-only services. They were served by a staff of (currently) women who assisted them with their daily needs: eating, using the bathroom, bathing, dressing, and socializing. Additionally, personnel attempt to foster an environment of interaction, communication, and cooperation. The Administrator explained, \"We try to make it so if one person can walk, s/he pushes another's wheelchair.\" Individual activities were replaced by group dynamics, and the environment was livened up with group craft activities, morning exercises, marimba music at mealtime and relaxing music at bedtime. This type of emotional work continues until residents' last breaths, as staff helped them face fears about death. The Administrator explains, We even help them to die. When they're at that point, we get close to them and say, \"Rest, tranquil, don't be afraid. Everything is going to be okay. We're right here with you.\" We don't want them to feel alone. They don't want to die because they feel alone. And who is going to help them? Well, we have to. In the following narrative, the Administrator underscored the some of the challenges that the Casa-Hogar faced, elucidated the nature of 24/7 elder care, and alluded to the local politics in which elder care existed. About four years ago, the nuns who were running this place fled a financial scandal. They hadn't managed the money right, and were trying to put the property in the name of one of them, rather than the organization's name. One night at 3 a.m., they filled up a truck with whatever they could snag from the Casa and took off. They abandoned the elders in their beds, and left the Casa in shambles. The Board of Trustees had to solve this problem immediately, start all over again. It was a tremendous mess. There were marches in town supporting the nuns, while others who knew the truth protested against them. When I came on the scene, things were in shambles. The personnel had been extremely negligent. We began trying to hire nurses who really understood the goals of this work, and who would truly dedicate themselves to it. But because 444 the Board was so disorganized and everyone intervened in everything, the personnel didn't last. So, little by little, the entire staff changed, in the midst of a mountain of problems. The house was falling down. Seventeen water leaks, a plague of cockroaches, an infestation of mice. We had to burn mattresses full of mouse nests. We had 300 mice run out of one mattress! In just five minutes, we killed two dozen rats that came streaming out of a closet. I mean a serious, serious problem. The elders were full of fungus, dirt and wax in their ears, in their bellybuttons, ugh! All of them were diuretic, anemic, over-medicated. They ate whenever they wanted, what they wanted, how they wanted. Visitors came and went whenever. Figure 9.8, Photo, holiday dinner, Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n. Turning things around brought lots of friction. Scandalous newspaper headlines. People were accustomed to using the elders like a common good. They brought them tons of junk food. So we instituted rules fixing visiting hours and restricting visits to the hallway. I asked for the Board's support. I told them, \"you have to back me up.\" We all agreed, and we moved forward. Even the residents themselves hated me at the beginning because I wouldn't let them eat candy. I wouldn't let them eat green mango with powdered chile, no, no. But now, if I'm out for just two days, they get depressed, and they start asking about me. I'm telling you that you make an emotional commitment and you say, \"well, I could be making a lot more money in my own business or doing whatever, or I could have a lot more time off, and all that.\" Yes, sometimes I think I'm going to leave. But then, gosh, ay, do\u00f1a C, ay do\u00f1a J, ay, no [she refers to residents]. And pardon me for being so immodest, but I think it'd be really difficult for anyone else to come in and take over so many responsibilities. 445 I also see it happen with the girls [the nurses]. They make a tremendous effort. There are 5 nurses - 3 during the day and 2 at night, who take turns on call. Because they're young, there comes a point at which they say, \"no, no more, no more, we can't do any more, no.\" Then there's the guy who does the cleaning, the cook, the washerwoman. That's it - just a small group of us and so many to take care of. Imagine bath days. On these two days, we have to bathe everyone. The nurses end up exhausted. They have to carry the elders, and sometimes right after the elders have been bathed, they poop; other times right in the middle of the bath, they poop at the girls' feet. What I'm telling you is just a fraction of what the girls put up with. They put up with it and do it all, everything. You see, we're short-staffed, but not just anyone can do this work. Few know how to do it and can put up with it. We really need a place for training people who want to care for elders. I understand that Dr. B wants to set up a geriatric clinic or some sort of daycare facility. That would be ideal. Here, the Board tried to set something like that up, but the attitude of a certain Board member has hampered everything. If she doesn't do it and she doesn't get all the credit, then she won't let anyone do it. That day that I went to the meeting [the Encuentro] was a fatal blow to her. And in the end, though, we turned this place around. We even won the a prize from the IDH. We earned it, you know. And we had two queens [akin to \"Ms. Elder Comit\u00e1n\"] two years in a row. In other words, the results are clear. In the end, the people who had attacked and fought me came up to me later and said, \" Ay, forgive me, you were right. It's just that we hadn't realized....\" Ah, it's good that they understand, but onward! Figure 9.9, Photo, residents, Casa-Hogar Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n. 446 B. Elder health care services in Comit\u00e1n: providers' \"unofficial\" assessment I assembled the previous description from providers' responses to my request that they describe their official services. These initial descriptions produced the illusion of a well- thought-out, well-functioning, comprehensive elder care system. This was far from the case. This section highlights the problems, shortcomings, and gaps identified by practitioners in response to my probing the challenges of providing elder care. Essentially, providers argued that: a) elders did not take care of themselves at home, b) elders did not take advantage of available health services, c) elders self- and over- medicated, d) families did not take care of elders, and e) providers lacked the resources and institutional support to offer the elder care they wished to provide. 1. \"Elders don't take care of themselves at home\" Providers contended that elders did not value their own health, were unwilling to admit to health problems, did not set aside the time to care for themselves, and were lax about diet and hygiene. The ISSTECH psychologist noted, for example, \"They don't value this stage of life, which is probably the most beautiful.\" Similarly, a Centro Adelante practitioner observed, \"Principally here in the region around Comit\u00e1n, people are a bit proud, stuck up, they won't say a word until they're dying.\" Many practitioners pointed to what they perceived as elders' high-fat, high-cholesterol diet as the culprit. The ISSSTE Director contended, I think that diet is a very important factor. The diet here is very rich in fats. We used to eat hand-made tortillas and they were cooked over the fire on a pan 447 covered with lime. Now we are eating processed tortillas that don't have all that calcium that the others had. This type of change in habits is what has repercussions in our population. [...] I don't have official data, but one of my worries is that this year, I'm sure that here in Comit\u00e1n, we have the highest levels of triglycerides, of cholesterol. I'm going to get this information from the lab because we have a machine here that keeps track. We've had people in here with triglycerides of more than 2000! This has caught my attention and I think it's pretty unlikely that it could possibly be as high as this in other regions of the state. [...] Counts like this are the result of a bunch of factors, including age, but they're metabolic, but here I think that diet is a key factor. The diet here is very high in fats. A practitioner from the Centro Adelante similarly asserted, Bad diet, not because they don't have anything to eat, but because they don't know how to manage it. [...] The problem here is that they grow vegetables and they sell it to benefit others. They don't eat it. They eat the worst while selling the best. [...] In contrast to other places in which people don't produce vegetables, but they do eat them. Here they produce vegetables but they sell it elsewhere. [...] Further, there's the consumption of fat. If the bread does not have pork lard, it's not bread. If the food doesn't contain lard, it isn't food. And always after a meal, a tequila, or an aperitif. With all this, they harm themselves little by little, without realizing the risks that they'll be running later. Providers also pointed out elders' lack of hygiene. A Centro Adelante practitioner argued, for instance, Hygiene is also important in people of this age, because they don't always bathe, brush their teeth, or change every day. Some people are truly poor, but the majority have at least one change of clothing. So we need to teach this to people of the third age and to people who work with them. Bathing daily is absolutely necessary, as is changing clothing, it doesn't matter if it's tattered, but it should be clean. Service providers should start by teaching hygiene and then move on to getting rid of bad habits. 448 2. \"Elders don't take advantage of health services\" Providers asserted that elders should be entitled to care offered by health and social service practitioners, yet lamented that, in reality, access to services was far from universal. They were well aware of - and disappointed by - the fact that a large segment of the elder population was uninsured. As the Director of the insurance-based ISSTECH Clinic observed, The majority of the population doesn't have the benefit of an insurance plan. Here we see a little of everything. We have people who have the economic resources to treat their ailments, but there are also people who don't.... The population lacking services is bigger, and this group needs help.... We have a great summer program for the older adults. There are exercise classes, cooking courses, musical events. There are a lot of spaces still open, so we have to get the word out. We have these fliers. But it's only for those folks with insurance, eh? The Casa Director lamented that elders with considerably few problems were more prone to receive help, while those with more involved needs had no place to go: For example, we can't take anyone with Alzheimer's, or anyone with bad habits like tobacco or alcohol addictions. We can't take them if they have any psychiatric or nervous complications. But there are so many people like these who need a place to live. It's very important to create a place for the people who are not accepted here, and I understand that they are turned away from other places as well. Where can we refer them? We should take this on as a homework task. Where to refer them? What to do with them? Because those who are doing well and don't have these problems, \"Of course, welcome, come in.\" But those who do have problems, and this is actually a lot of people, they are out of luck. While aware of some access issues, providers were very frustrated and puzzled, then, when some elders who did have access to services underutilized these available resources. A Centro Adelante provider noted, for instance, \"...the ISSTECH Clinic is only for those who are insured, yet they don't even take advantage of it, while there are people of the third age who don't even have the money to visit a geriatrician.\" The 449 ISSTECH Director then admitted, \"[Patients] have the culture of coming to see the doctor and, 'I'm outta here.' ... We have to call them so that they'll come, to remind them of the activities. We have to look for other strategies to get their attention so they'll come and take advantage.\" The ISSTECH psychologist noted, They put up a lot of barriers to talking with the psychologist. They don't see this as an ongoing medical supervision, as if it were just like other doctors. They show up when they are really overburdened and need to get it all out, and when they feel good, they don't continue the therapy. [...] The elders themselves say that a lot of things start weighing them down and when they get over-burdened, that's when they come talk, rather than thinking, \"I really need psychological help.\" It's like they don't value it enough. 3. \"Elders self-prescribe and over-medicate\" Practitioners complained about elders' propensity to self-prescribe and to over-medicate. The ISSSTE Director observed patients' excessive demand for medication: Each time patients get lab work done, it gets more complicated because they say, \"I went to a private doctor and my febrile test was positive.\" Even when their numbers are at 120, 140, and they have no symptoms of typhoid fever, they demand treatment. Well, even if they are continually taking medication, those numbers are never going to go down, they're never going to get down to zero, no. So there's a real need to educate patients. Practitioners were aware of the potential for over-prescribing and said they tried to avoid it. Some advised not taking medication at all. A Centro Adelante practitioner explained, \"We start with detoxification, get patients to stop taking unnecessary medication, as these are toxic and poisonous drugs.\" She later argued that physicians should take a proactive role in using medication aptly: It's not appropriate to be medicating a lot among people of the third age.... That's simply a technical control treatment, it does not eradicate the problem, it's just a technical control. What we really want to do is eradicate the problem, and the way to do this is to use natural means, teaching doctors to use them well. 450 Official medicine is very good. They help in many cases, but they take so many pills and [the doctors] don't advise them to drink plenty of water, and this ends up affecting their kidneys. If doctors would mix some of their medicine and teach people good habits, then the official medicine would have great results, especially in older people whose systems are very deteriorated, fatigued, and fragile. Providers insisted that they were doing this. In fact, the ISSSTE social workers measured progress in terms of decreasing medication among their diabetes and hypertension group participants. Their efforts, however, were wrought with challenges. For instance, the ISSSTE Director illustrated elder patients' insistence upon obtaining medication: We have patients who come and this is how the consult goes. The patient says, \"I'm here for my calcium.\" And even if the doctor explains that they don't need calcium, they are here for their calcium and there's no way to convince them, no way to explain to them that they don't need it. I even increased the clinic's stock of calcium, but it's never as much as they want. The ISSSTE Director noted that elders were often motivated to take medication upon viewing their lab results, which they can receive from any number of private labs in town. Many then skip the physician's visit and self-prescribe, or go to a pharmacy and ask an employee what to take. This points to the need for elders to understand the risks of trying to interpret lab results, determine proper dosage, foresee impact of drugs, etc. A Centro Adelante practitioner argued, People should be taught not to self-prescribe and self-medicate. But here in the pharmacies, principally it's people of this age who self-medicate, the elders. For example, the other day, we went to a pharmacy. A bit later, 3 or 4 people came in. \"I want something for my headache,\" said one. And the pharmacist goes and gives them something not only for a headache, but also for a fever, and for nervios. Suddenly the bill was $300-$400 pesos when this amount would seem exorbitant for a physician consult. And many people save their prescription for 6- 8 years, and they keep using the same one. This happens among people who are 50-40-30 years old. The elders are the ones who most often self-medicate. So we need to teach people not to do this. 451 While the previous quote emphasizes the cost of medication to the patient, the ISSTECH Director noted the expense of over-medication to the institution, observing, \"There are many elders who take a lot of medication and they don't need it. It'll harm their body and it increases institutional spending. So we have to take care of our patients' health, helping them with existing therapies and offering them our psychologists' support.\" 4. \"Elders families don't take care of them\" Practitioners felt that elders should be able to count on home-based assistance from relatives (youth, adults, and other elders), but that there was a shortage of such elder caregivers, and those who provided such support were overburdened. The net result was deficient, abusive, or non-existent home-based elder care. Some perceived increased need and ebbing resources. For instance, the Casa Hogar Director recalled that the home's staff used to seek elders who might benefit from their care; but switched to waiting for elders to be brought to them and enforcing eligibility requirements. The Casa's residents usually arrive, ...when they are 85 or 90, when they become more difficult to take care of - that's the ones who have family. Those who don't have family are referred by the DIF or people from their communities who realize they're suffering in situations of abandonment, so they get together and ask us to admit them.... There are also others who ask us for help taking care of their relatives because they work. Practitioners asserted that, compounding inadequate support at home, elders often attended medical consults alone, leaving caregivers out of the formal medical feedback loop. For instance, ISSSTE social workers said that diabetes and hypertension support group participants usually arrived unaccompanied, despite encouragement to bring 452 relatives and caregivers. Providers recognized that this home-based caring network plays a key role in elders' nutrition, activities, health care, and mental well-being, and thus hoped that they would participate in elder health consults and education programs. The ISSTECH psychologist exemplified the need for practitioner-caregiver-elder communication in discussing this case: \"I had a patient who had to get her leg amputated. I asked the family and the doctor to explain to her before the operation what was going to happen and what would happen after the operation. But I don't think anyone said anything, so the impact was huge.\" While family support was supposed to be universal, practitioners argued that this was not the reality. Some neglect stemmed from instances of what providers saw as more legitimate challenges of elder caregiving on top of the rigors of other work and family responsibilities. The Casa Director, for instance, observed, \"There are so many people like these who need a place to live, their families can't care for them for x or y reason or due to work, or the woman is working and needs help with her children and the elders can't take care of them anymore.\" In other cases, family caregivers were clearly blamed for mistreatment. For instance, the ISSTECH psychologist observed, Something that all of them have in common is depression.... Generally at home, they can't even find anyone to talk with. No one listens to them and then if they say something, the others scold them, \"Yeah, you and your same old song... That's not true,\" and so on. Elders have a lot to deal with and eventually they overload.... Providers had seen extreme indifference on behalf of relatives. The ISSSTE Director recounted cases of elder neglect and abandonment by relatives: 453 Before holiday vacations, there is a spike in the number of elderly patients admitted to the hospital. Why? Because families want to go away for vacation, and no one wants to stay behind and take care of the grandparents. So they check them into the hospital. In some cases, relatives never come back and pick them up. And these are the well-to-do! Once a patient called me to say that his kids were going on a trip. They didn't have anywhere else to leave him so they were going to leave him with me [at the hospital] because he was \"sick,\" yet the man felt good. The man asked me to tell his kids that was okay, that we would admit him to the hospital, and that later, some friends of his would pick him up. All the while his kids would be away vacationing. So situations like this are hard, you know? Here our colleagues in social work have had patients of the third age who come, they're admitted and then their relatives never ever show up again. Sometimes we have to call the courts so that the family assumes their responsibility. Other participants echoed disappointment in the family for not caring for their elder relatives. A Centro Adelante practitioner insisted, We have to revive the family, because the family no longer exists. First elders are abandoned because the family lacks education and culture. They have ideas, illusions, but they leave the primary values aside. They end up disdaining old people, even hitting them. They end up abandoning them. They don't even have the time to take care of them. Why? Because there's not even any unity among them. So we need to correct all the bad habits that exist among adults as well as in other areas, like the family. That's where to start. Elder caregiving, all asserted, is a demanding task, often resulting in caregiver fatigue, frustration, and stress. Some home-based caregivers helped more than one elder, as in the case of a young woman who aided both her 98 year-old grandmother (261) and her 50ish year-old mother. Caregivers themselves mentioned how tiring elder care could become. For instance, the daughter of a couple, both 72 years old (299), was the only remaining unmarried daughter, and was therefore expected to live at home and care for her aged parents. This task was getting harder and harder, as her father had multiple health problems (nearly deaf, blind in one eye, with hypertension and arthritis) as did her mother (cervical-uterine cancer and difficulty walking). Her mother already required 454 help going to the bathroom and bathing. Her father helped a bit. This daughter requested participating in the study as she was frustrated, worn out, and concerned by her parents' health. Of this type of caregiver burnout, the ISSSTE Director observed, A problem we have is that people get tired, right? It's tiring to take care of patients, and I've asked myself on many occasions, well, who cares for the caregivers? We need someone to deal with what's happening to those who take care of the ill and invalid. People, relatives may end up not providing good care to patients of the third age, and they need help and psychological support themselves. The ISSTECH psychologist similarly advocated for training and support aimed at elder caregivers: It would be good to talk with caregivers because they often think, \"Well, if grandma can't walk, she can't see well, she's clumsy, then why should I have her do anything? She can sit and watch T.V. or listen to the radio.\" These caregivers have to realize that elders want to do things, that having them sit there doing nothing makes elders feel useless and worse - they feel like, \"I can't do anything anymore.\" And this makes them more depressed. Caregivers should also know that just like the people they care for, they, too, can get sick. Why? Because sometimes they dedicate themselves full-time to caregiving, and in dedicating all their time to others, they don't take care of themselves. So it creates an environment of tension, of sickness. Caregivers, too, need to feel mentally healthy enough to deal with an elder, their illness, probably some disability. But when a caregiver is not mentally healthy, they cannot offer the same treatment. Why? Because they'll always be upset and will probably not try their best, and that elder will sense it. They'll sense the rejection. They'll think, \"I'm a burden.\" So caregivers, too, have to get some type of psychological help, or dedicate a certain amount of free time to themselves so they can get out of the sickly environment for a bit. There was a sense that a potential cadre of well-intentioned caregivers already existed, but that they lacked training. The Casa Hogar Director explained, 455 People want to participate but don't know how to do it. They come wanting to help and mess things up because they don't know how to do it.... Among other things that I've observed here in Comit\u00e1n is that there are a lot of people who want to help. It's very common that people support noble causes and form groups, meet, and so on. I haven't seen that in other places. Some of those elders who had no home-based caregivers - for whatever reason - ended up living at the Casa Hogar. The home's staff and other residents became their surrogate family, with all the responsibility this entails, from sharing meals to changing diapers, from celebrating holidays together to accompanying them at death. The Casa Director insisted, \"It's extremely draining, emotionally draining. Especially here [at the Casa] where people have no relatives. Who is their family? We are! It's with us that they complain, fight, cry. Everything, us. Everything.\" She concluded that if it were so draining for a corps of sensitive, trained, paid personnel to provide home-based elder care on a regular basis, that she imagined that those caregivers attempting to cope at home on their own must be truly challenged. According to providers, home-based caregivers were not fulfilling their elder relatives' caring needs and were getting burned out. Providers noted that, in Comit\u00e1n, there was no training or support system in place, so that caregivers had nowhere to go for help. Further, caregivers did not seem to gain much social return for their labors. This caring work, while expected, was not publicly recognized, but rather invisible. Perhaps in lieu of recognition for their caring work, many caregivers (especially adult children) insisted on other types of potentially unhealthy and resented returns for the support they provided, in that they required elders to baby-sit, tend a store, and do housework (see Chapter 8). 456 When the returns (social and otherwise) on providing home-based elder care ebb, it is possible that elders' ability to count on care also shrinks. 5. \"We don't have the necessary resources and institutional support\" Practitioners complained about obstacles to access, time constraints, and insufficient staff (in terms of numbers and training). They also noted a general lack awareness of and responsiveness to local elder health and care needs among other providers and institutional directors, in part evident in inadequate institutional investment in elder care and compounded by over-centralization of decision-making. Further, providers cited individual provider egotism and institutional sectarianism as challenges to improving elder care. In addition to limited eligibility to care services, providers felt the number of places in which elders could seek care was inadequate. They also contended that services were not well geographically-dispersed, as clinics and hospitals were positioned far from some of the neediest pockets of the city. Providers also noted the need to space services in a more equitable manner. For example, a private physician, Dr. A, recommended relocating a doctor from the well-staffed Health Center in the southern part of Comit\u00e1n to the virtually unstaffed Red Cross in the burgeoning northern area of the city. Further, they noted that practitioners did not often leave the confines of the clinics and hospitals to establish relationships and tend to elders within the community. All of these factors limited elders' access to services. 457 Informants insisted that the number of elder care providers was inadequate relative to the quantity of elders theoretically entitled to their services. ISSSTE social workers noted that this large hospital did not even have a geriatrician on staff, and that, as elsewhere, providers were stretched so thinly that wait-times were too long, while consult times were cut short: We definitely want to provide integral care, but... what happens is that sometimes the office hours are so saturated that there is little space to tend to a patient, so the doctor doesn't check their feet, doesn't, well, the detailed review the physician should do doesn't get done because a lot of factors come into play. And that's why the patient leaves unsatisfied with the care. Either that or the specialist, let's say the internist (who is closely tied to diabetic and hypertensive people) says, \"Make an appointment.\" ... The patient goes to make an appointment, and it turns out that there's no opening for another month. The list is full and they even assign 4 or 5 too many patients on top. Or in the lab, too. The doctor asks for lab work to see how the patient is doing and the lab is super-saturated. The ISSTECH Geriatric Clinic was similarly pressured, In the first place, we don't even have a physician at all right now.... And then if the psychologist has a workshop and the patient has a consult, the patient just goes to her consult, and doesn't want to wait for the workshop. We don't have any more staff! So today, for example, I [the Director] gave the yoga class and the phone was ringing off the hook. I told the secretary, \"tell them to call back or I'll call back because I can't interrupt the class.\" Human resources is a huge limitation. Likewise, at the IDH, \"we're just three therapists, here for eight hours each: one occupational, one medical, and 1 physical therapy. When each therapy lasts 30 to 45 minutes, we run out of time to see all the patients.\" 458 Practitioners were not only challenged by staff shortages, but also emphasized the shortage of service providers with both interest and specialized training in elder care provision. The Casa Director lamented that they had no staff physician, and observed, \"We have one doctor who comes in to see the old folks here. He's our guardian angel. But most of those physicians have never, ever set a foot in here.\" The Casa Director dreamed, \"I'd love to have a psychologist, a therapist, someone who could come give them massages or physical therapy, among other needs.\" Even in the comparatively well-staffed ISSSTE Clinic, social workers observed, \"We need a diabetologist and another two doctors in internal medicine, exclusively for hypertensive and diabetic patients. That would really be preferential care, because then they wouldn't have to come and wait a month to see a specialist.\" In some cases, it was not even a question of having a medical specialist, but simply a provider suitable for elders' demographics. For the Casa Hogar, this meant finding a male nurse. The Casa Director mused, Until now, the staff has been all women, but I would like to try a man. In fact, we began to consider the possibility recently when we had an old man who was too tall for my petite nurses. So we were thinking of getting a male nurse to help move him, because the nurses do everything, bathing the residents and all. There's no other choice. And everyone has to put up with embarrassment. Practitioners were critical of other providers and of their employing institutions for not making elder health an explicit focus of care. True dedication to elder well-being, they posited, would be a 180 degree turn from the long-standing focus on health among reproductive-aged adults and children. For instance, the ISSSTE Director complained that national norms maintained the clinic's stock of oral contraceptives excessively high, while there was a constant shortage of hypertension medication needed by elders. 459 Providers advocated a shift toward elders as a target population while simultaneously concentrating on the goal of quality. They were concerned about the shorter life expectancies among elders in Chiapas than among elders elsewhere, yet asserted that increasing longevity should not necessarily be the top priority. In the words of a Centro Adelante practitioner, \"What we aim for is to give elders not quantity years but quality years.\" Quality care for quality years would entail remedying providers' \"cold\" interaction with their elder patients. For instance, the ISSTECH psychologist observed, Elders are very sensitive and generally they want a more emotional contact, they want to be pampered a little. Sometimes the doctors tell them, \"What you have is psychological because we've done a thousand tests and you don't have anything.\" So they come in here and say, \"How can it be that I don't have anything, if it hurts here, and there.\" And many have commented that, \"I go in to consult the doctor and he's already writing me a prescription and he doesn't even look at my face, nothing, and he just hands me the prescription.\" So many really get stressed by this because they want more, to be pampered more, to be told, \"Let's see, it hurts. Why does it hurt?\" They are looking for a little attention, everyone, the men too. So the doctors are like, \"Well, I didn't see anything in your analysis, so go home.\" They'd like to know, \"Well, what could be happening to me?\" Not just, \"Oh, your problem is in your head.\" Why? Because then it makes them think, \"Maybe I'm crazy.\" ... They don't get an explanation.... The doctors can be so cold. This psychologist and her colleagues called for practitioners to provide warmer, more sensitive and responsive elder care. A big challenge for practitioners was that of providing quality consults given the previously mentioned time limitations and staff constraints, as the physical therapist at the IDH observed: There will always be friction, disagreements between us - the personnel - and the patients, always because sometimes they want faster care, or higher quality care, but the time we have for each patient is limited, it depends on how many patients we have and how few providers we have. There are always little problems. 460 A Centro Adelante practitioner noted, Even those who work in geriatrics here in Comit\u00e1n, the way they treat their clients is horrible. Why? Because the patients show up, and wait all day for their consult, and the doctor doesn't even see the patient. They just sit down and say, \"okay, go home!\" And then they say, \"look how much I'm earning.\" It's not fair to fill up your wallet and leave bad things worse. Practitioners should listen to their clients, pay attention to them, find out what their needs are, encourage them, support them, and above all, love them. One problem that providers identified was the practitioners often did not conceive of themselves as members or soon-to-be members of their elder beneficiary group. They posited that this (honorary) membership would require empathizing with elders and practicing what they preach. Even the Municipal DIF Director, one of the younger working group participants, asserted, \"We're headed that way! We're going to be elders [laugh]! Yes, we're going to be elders, so we have the ability to ask these questions.\" A Centro Adelante practitioner critiqued service providers for being poor role models for their elder patients: If you want to change the world, change yourself first. I'd like service providers to get educated first. Because our goal is for people to know how to take care of themselves, but not only to hear how to do it, but to hear it from people who can testify that it works. If I'm not a vegetarian, I can't tell someone, \"you have to be a vegetarian.\" The providers say, \"here's your prescription, but don't smoke.\" And when he walks into the office, you can smell smoke on his clothes. This is why people are so disappointed. They say, \"Ah, yeah, I went to see the doctor, but we'll see.\" They leave with a prescription, but they don't take the pills and then they don't get better. They didn't take them in the first place because their guide doesn't do it either. You cannot say to someone, \"do this,\" without doing it yourself, because then you're the same or worse. Providers insisted that their own commitment to elder patients was not matched by institutional investment. This was evident in human resources, such as an adequate staff and relevant training. To cultivate a sufficiently-sized and -specialized staff of providers, 461 participants advocated that institutions both hire specialists and train personnel across the board in elder health and care. All agreed that providers should receive instruction on physiological aspects of care as well as the psycho-emotional facets of elder care. Of this balance, for instance, the ISSSTE Director illustrated, \"We need to educate staff. For example about osteoporosis, we would start with the doctors. All the doctors need to know what osteoporosis is, who we are going to treat, how we can prevent it.\" But training would go beyond the nuts and bolts of specific diseases and treatments, as he continued, We're conducting a campaign to raise consciousness among our medical colleagues regarding care for patients in the third age. They should get preferential treatment, without lines, without long waits to be seen. This type of patient requires another type of care. And this doesn't end with offering them a seat, but continues throughout the care process. The fact that they're old elders should entitle them to preferential care and above all should stimulate more respect on behalf of public servants. While most complained of lack of local training, a private doctor critiqued the lack of upstream elder care training, such as its absence in medical school curriculum. The state's priorities were not well-organized. The ISSSTE Director gave an example, mentioned above: \"The government sends us birth control pills, tons. They are piled high in the storeroom. And all this time, there is a constant shortage of medication for hypertension. We never have enough.\" Institutions were not forthcoming with necessary material resources, either. For instance, participants said that institutions did not provide necessary space and equipment dedicated to their elder patients' needs and designed around their limitations. The IDH doctor, for example, called for, \"a larger rehabilitation 462 area, with instruments adequate for patients' need for more quality care. And a larger waiting room. Why? Because there are so many patients and such little space and equipment.\" The ISSTECH psychologist reflected, We need a bigger space, with green areas, a garden, where they could play sports and go from there to see the doctor. A bigger space, where there aren't so many steps and stairs because many can't walk that well. Here, they have to climb stairs to go to their psychology appointment, and it's complicated. Some women have arthritis, leg problems. Practitioners contended that institutions did not allocate enough money for elder care. Some resented the government for not providing funds to non-government organizations. The Casa Director urged, Existing services for elders need more direct support from the government. I mean, the ISSTECH has it's own income, but here at the Casa Hogar, we survive by the grace of God, and with a ton of shortages.... We don't have any money budgeted for these activities. When we put on music, we even have to bring tapes from home! A few providers' initiatives to spur institutional shifts toward more quality elder care had run into budgetary constraints. For example, the ISSTECH Director revealed her institution's reigns on spending when she said that, \"This space is for sharing, living with older adults, as long as the institution doesn't need to spend money.\" This institutional culture, providers argued, would have to change to one in which adequate funds are earmarked for elder health care. A private practitioner lamented, \"A few years ago, a couple of us - physicians - got together and drafted a great proposal to assess the medical needs of older people here. We worked very hard on it. But then the new mayor came into office and that was it. Nothing ever happened.\" 463 Providers felt that control over elder care program design and funding was overly centralized, with distant policymakers wielding excessive control from their offices in county seats, the state capitol, and Mexico City. They were frustrated by the control over funding exerted by upstream governing bodies. A private doctor critiqued, \"It's all about money. The Municipal Government won't release its grasp on the money that the Health Jurisdiction III needs.\" Power over funding then shaped quantity and quality of personnel. For instance, an IDH doctor stressed, \"this is a delegation [i.e. an administrative jurisdiction] and it is regional,\" and lamented, \"I can ask for more material resources, more human resources, but really it depends on higher up, because we depend on the Central Delegation.\" Providers longed for institutional engagement mediated by locally designed, managed, and conducted initiatives and interventions. Practitioners were also frustrated by how authority over money and staff was exercised in line with externally-established visions of health care, which were concretized in official norms and program guidelines. This enabled influential individuals and offices, not in immediate contact with the patient population, to determine where elder health and care fell among service priorities. An ISSTECH social worker explained, \"The problem is more at the institutional level.... Sometimes they believe that some things are no longer necessary and they start channeling these resources elsewhere. Institutions have to be convinced that elder care is a priority.... For us here, institutionally, what we do is already defined.\" Ironically, those mid- and low-level providers, who possessed the most extensive base of experience with elders, often had the least control over shaping 464 objectives, designing strategies, and selecting staff. In the context of participating in the CAIMAM working group, for instance, the ISSSTE social workers felt distanced and slowed by the centralized bureaucracy. They lamented the need to run all invitations for working group meetings through the clinical director, who ironically, was often out of town at meetings with higher-ups, resulting in days of lag time required for information and invitations to trickle down to them through the ranks. To effect institutional change, however, providers recognized that shifts would have to be validated from above. For instance, a private physician insisted, \"the directors need another vision; for example, they should give doctors permission to miss work in order to receive training.\" Practitioners lamented the culture of egotism on behalf of individual providers and institutional isolation and tension, rather than one of inter-institutional collaboration. They emphasized an urgent need to overcome rivalries, suspicions, and sectarianism. On an individual level, practitioners told stories of how egotistical behavior on behalf of key individuals had impeded collaboration and advances in efforts to improve elder health and care. For example, the Casa Director told of how, \"the organization's Board of Directors tried to create a geriatric clinic and elder daycare center, but again it was doomed by the attitude of this one person, because if she doesn't do it and if she doesn't get all the credit, she doesn't allow anyone to do it.\" This board member's attitude often threatened to thwart the Casa's activities, as the elder residents were easily \"destabilized because all it takes is for one person to come and say, 'No, but you should be treated in 465 such-and-such a way.' And then they become insecure, right?\" Similarly, the Municipal DIF Director asserted, The main challenge is political, and the resistance of doctors against other doctors, right? Against the other health care professionals because they think that this implies... how can I say this? That if you do a project, you're going to steal work from others, take the food right out of their mouth. And so you're going to run up against obstacles, right? And this would be one of the main ones. And the rest of it is about money. Institutions were not exempt from critique. For instance, the ISSSTE Director noted, Aside from the ISSTECH's geriatric home, there's no place where patients of the third age can show up, there's no place that's open to the public. [We need one.] But not within an [existing] institution because these are sectarian. It would be one place for everyone.... Let's not leave it up to the institutions, because they are very sectarian, you know. Finally, a few providers mentioned challenges to elder well-being that surpassed even the sphere of influence of their employing institutions, such as wider environmental conditions and political economy. For instance, of infectious disease and water problems in Comit\u00e1n, the Municipal DIF Director contended, Why do I refer to infectious disease of gastro-intestinal types, like salmonella, typhoid, and brucellosis? Because we have a public health problem in terms of water treatment. Nearly all the crops that are grown here are watered with drainage water. So this is a very serious public health problem. And this is when there is water; and when there is not, there's sewage. A practitioner from the Centro Adelante asserted, \"People grow vegetables here, but then they sell them. What the foreign and domestic factories send them is what they eat, while the quality food that they produce is taken away.\" In discussing these macro-factors, practitioners again asserted that they were ill-equipped to ensure elder well-being. 466 C. Contrasting perspectives on elder care in Comit\u00e1n: Providers' \"official\" version of elder health care services, presented in the first section of this chapter, contrasted greatly with their \"unofficial\" assessment, described in the second section. Their testimony evidences that the rights, programs, and facilities championed by the state may be little more than an empty shell. Large buildings, colorful brochures, National Elder Health Cards, etc. create an illusion that contrasts with providers' subsequent assessment. Among practitioners' key observations are that: \u0001 Elders cannot rely on care at home; on the contrary, relatives may abuse and abandon their older relatives. \u0001 Access is a problem. Very small numbers of elders were actually served by health care programs. For instance, the elder ambulance transport service at the ISSSTE had helped just one patient, and the Casa Hogar housed only 25 elders. \u0001 The range of elders' problems addressed was circumscribed, focusing on diabetes and hypertension, while widespread conditions such as pain, depression, and economic difficulties were back-burnered. \u0001 Providers had an immense task to accomplish with very limited resources, and many of the health care barriers faced by elders were not specific to the elderly, but shortcomings of health care for all. Clinics and hospitals had shrinking budgets to cover expanding health conditions among an ever-growing population. Services were severely understaffed. For instance, the Casa Cl\u00ednica ISSSTE, devoted to meeting geriatric needs, had no physician on staff at all. Staff was in need of training. 467 Supplies were poorly allocated, aimed at state priorities (e.g. family planning), rather than the epidemiological and demographic profile of the local population. \u0001 Elder health services were provided in clinic only, excluding patients with transportation and mobility obstacles. \u0001 Even when elders were eligible for care and these services existed, many did not consult at the clinics, but instead turned to self-regulation and self-medication via pharmacies. \u0001 There was no articulation between the various individuals and institutions who purported to help elders. This fragmentation made it easy for elders to fall through cracks and difficult for providers to collaborate. \u0001 Providers had not yet been made accountable for elder health and care. There did not seem to be much pressure from civil society, the state, or the international community to address elder health, especially compared to that placed on infectious disease control (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria, HIV) and maternal-infant health. In addition to the contrast between providers' \"official\" version and their \"unofficial\" assessment of services for elders, providers perspectives differed greatly from elders' experiences. Practitioners seemed to blame elders, their families, and institutions for poor health. From elders' standpoint, in contrast, the state and its employees were to blame. Consider the \"faulty\" behavior providers claimed as the reasons for ill health among elders, compared to aspects of life elders described in the surveys and interviews: 468 a) While practitioners argued that elders did not take care of themselves at home, elders asserted having little \"free\" time given the work and home tasks they had to do. Regarding what providers conceptualized as \"home health basics,\" elders often lacked water with which to bathe and wash clothing, and rather than worried about becoming overweight, many were concerned about having sufficient food. b) Providers critiqued elders for not taking advantage of available health services, but recall from Chapter 7 that over a third of elders were uninsured, and even those who were insured deemed coverage unsatisfactory. Elders cast a wide net of critiques: cost and quality of care, excessive bureaucracy, unreasonably long waiting times, poor interpersonal skills among providers, lack of medication, short-staffed facilities, and differences in perspective between patients and practitioners regarding treatment. c) According to practitioners, elders inappropriately self-prescribed and over-medicated themselves. Elders, in contrast, describe taking medication as self-care and self- regulation in a context of very limited care options. Deprived of strong, trusting relationships with providers, many elders relied on trusted pharmacy employees to council them about remedies and sell them medication on the spot. This strategy was faster, cheaper, and perhaps more respectful than elders might expect in a clinical visit. d) Practitioners asserted that families did not take care of elders, yet overlooked the fact that many relatives did care for elders (some even did so for more than one elder). Providers also failed to reflect on the reasons that relatives might not be able or willing to care for elders. 469 e) Finally, while providers claimed they lacked the resources and institutional support to offer sufficient elder care, elders could see the resources, status, and wealth in the clinics and at the site of the body of medical personnel. The provider-elder schism was due to a combination factors. Returning to the class and power structure described in Chapter 1, the health practitioners and institutional directors were from the old elite families and the new professional class. Many held their positions by virtue of intimate family involvement in the control of local and state government. As mentioned previously, for example, the DIF is run by the mayor's wife. This upper class cohort held corresponding values, vested interests, and perspectives, as well as the power to voice these and operationalize them in the health care system. Elders, in contrast, tended to be of the more marginalized social echelons, and had little cultural, social, and material capital. This situation persisted because the providers spent their days in clinic, and did no home care delivery. As the Director of the Casa Cl\u00ednica ISSSTE noted, \"We strive to bring most of the action to the clinic. Why? Because that's why the clinic was established, so elders would come to us.\" This clinic-based dynamic equipped providers with knowledge of health problems for which elders sought care in the clinics, but not for problems that elders would not articulate in a short clinical visit. The power divide further hindered the ability with which elders could make their voices heard, such that their reality remained obscured to practitioners. Therefore, despite their concern and good intentions, providers had a distorted view of elders' situation. Further, in practitioners' discourse regarding elder health and care, they unwittingly infantilized 470 elders and blamed the victims - the elders and their families - for their own lot. For instance, providers used condescending language, such as likening elders to \"little kids [chamaquitos] taking their first steps.\" Practitioners themselves noted that their cohort really did not see themselves as elders or soon-to-be elders. While providers had misconceptions about elders' lives, they were clearly experts in what their professional needs and resources were. Practitioners were ideally positioned to identify the misallocation of state resources, for which they were not at fault, as these reflected misguided assumptions and priorities among state policy makers above them, who were removed (physically and mentally) from the Comit\u00e1n context. They mentioned, for instance, poor geographic distribution of clinics, staff shortages, lack of training, and time limitations. Providers also insisted that their own commitment to elder patients was not matched by institutional investment in staff, material resources, infrastructure; that control over programs was overly centralized; and that efforts were hampered by individual egotism and institutional sectarianism. 471 Reflections on Chapter 9 This chapter grows out of my role in encouraging another group of stakeholders - providers - to speak about issues, problems, and obstacles (formative research stages 1 and 2). Because their participation entailed admitting the existence of an elder care problem, I had to inspire confidence. Beyond simply spewing out the institutional spiel, I had to get them to speak from their multiple positions, as employees and representatives of institutional apparatuses, as well as concerned physicians trying to provide care. The initial findings from the surveys and interviews with elders and home-based caregivers, as well as dialogue from the Encuentro, served as a springboard for providers' reflections. Professionals' perspectives - both the official and unofficial versions - contrasted greatly with elders' experiences. These contrasts underscore the danger of allowing the providers to plan interventions at this point, as their perspectives would lead them to an unrealistic assessment of what should and can be done and then misplaced faith in inappropriate strategies. A space for direct dialogue between stakeholders must be created first. Until this space is developed, it falls to me to elicit, document, and circulate stakeholders' multiple voices - in the form of hard data and in narratives. My next task would be to create this type of space and initiate a discussion of intervention options. These contrasts in perspectives - providers' official version versus their on-the- ground assessment and providers versus elders and caregivers - would shape \"the politics of the possible.\" I would have to inspire \"thinking forward,\" rather than making providers defensive about the faulty programs and care that they offered. I hoped to take the capital that both elders and providers held in the form of intimate knowledge of 472 different facets of the elder health and care experience, and put it to work. I describe my efforts to do so next, in Chapter 10. Figure 9.10, Photo, Comit\u00e1n General Hospital's vision. (This was painted on the wall of the recently-constructed administrative building. The statement posits an organized, multidisciplinary team, conducting timely care, education, and research via technical quality and adequate infrastructure, to \"resolve health problems with ethics, professionalism, responsibility, equity, and justice,\" and inspiring the trust and respect of the population.) 473 CHAPTER 10. JUMPSTARTING ORGANIZATION AMONG LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS Overview of Chapter 10 At the First Encuentro, I asked participants to identify urgent, applicable issues and to propose means for exploring and addressing these. To credit them for their contributions and to encourage information sharing and networking, I heeded a suggestion from an Encuentro participant and developed a CD of Encuentro abstracts, PowerPoint\u00ae shows, minutes, photographs, and a directory of participant contact information. I then made a series of visits to Encuentro participants and other health service professionals. At the first visit, I gave them an Encuentro CD and newspaper articles in which their attendance at the event had been noted. I asked for feedback and suggestions about the next step. The most widely embraced proposal was to organize a meeting in which interested individuals might strategize together. At a subsequent visit, then, I extended invitations for what we came to conceptualize as a strategic meeting. They agreed, and I organized, this time independently of CISC, the first \"strategic meeting for planning related to health and well-being in the third age.\" This meeting began with reflection on Encuentro content. We then discussed survey progress and preliminary results, participants' insight directly applicable to subsequent research. Infused with both concern and hope, the conversation then turned to the formation of an independent (from government and non- government institutions) working group. Participants decided to establish this group then and there. They carefully created its title (Committee for Integral & Multidisciplinary Care for Older Adults, CAIMAM), crafted a mission statement, discussed guidelines for 474 membership and decision-making, and appointed a coordinator. In this way, a community-based organization was born of interaction regarding community-generated insight and local interest in transformative action; \"the community\" in this case consisted of professional health and social service providers and CISC researchers. In the first part of this chapter, I detail CAIMAM's formation. I then discuss how, in the process of the Strategic Meeting and in the creation of the CAIMAM working group, I managed to both engage local people and then \"hand over the stick.\" I consciously worked to reverse roles so that rather than expert researcher and project organizer, I became a facilitator, while local people took over as a group (rather than individuals). So, after jumpstarting local action, I transitioned into an advisory role as this group matured. In the final section, I present my recent attempt - a work in progress - to maintain interest and inspire problem-solving in CAIMAM. Drawing on providers' suggestions, I document an emerging notion of what primary elder care in Comit\u00e1n might look like. I present this in the form of a very rough sketch of components of an Elder Primary Health Care (EPHC) system. I consolidate the wide range of needs and resources identified by providers into components that may serve as the foundation for local critique and creative problem-solving. Proposed EPHC components include an elder care coordination center, a community outreach program, a pharmaceutical support program, and social scientist/NGO facilitation. CAIMAM will then bring together key individuals and 475 institutions to review this and other options. This local group may then select facets that are appropriate and viable, and develop a plan to refine, propose, and enact intervention to improve elder health and care in Comit\u00e1n. In my ongoing role as facilitator, I hope to provide insight from a medical anthropology stance regarding how to ground the group's proposals in the reality revealed by the formative research. 476 A. Strategic meeting for elder health and care planning 1. Follow-up visits with Encuentro participants, articles, Encuentro CD To credit participants for and follow up on the proposals voiced in the Encuentro, interviews, and informal conversations, visited Encuentro participants. I also visited a few individuals and organizations that had been invited but for some reason had not participated (such as the Municipal Health Office, which had been in a staff transition at the time of the Encuentro). I gave Encuentro participants a newspaper clipping that included their name, institutional affiliation, presentation topic, etc. Additionally, I gave each person an Encuentro CD. I developed this CD in response to an Encuentro participant's suggestion. The CD contained: \u0001 11 PowerPoint\u00ae presentations that the authors agreed could be used freely to promote health of elders in Comit\u00e1n \u0001 abstracts of papers for which presenters did not use PowerPoint \u0001 a summary of Encuentro proceedings with photos of each presenter, the group, and the audience, \u0001 a directory of contact information for 30 individuals working in 14 local government and non-government organizations in which elders are served. This CD was posited as a resource promoting communication between providers and institutions (thanks to the directory), as well as facilitating discussion of elder health care among colleagues, perhaps in continuing medical education spaces (based on the presentations). With the clippings and the CD in hand, I then repeated the question with which I had ended the Encuentro: \"What next?\" 477 The most widely embraced suggestion was to organize a meeting in which interested individuals might strategize together with the goal of improving elder health and care in Comit\u00e1n. For instance, the Casa-Hogar Director contended, The only way I can see is to form this group with geriatricians, gerontologists, nurses who want specialized training in elder care.... Just those of us who participated in the first Encuentro should meet again, because if we make it an open invitation, 25 people are going to want to participate, without even knowing how, but they're going to want to be there, when we have already discussed what we want to do. So we could meet and define the project more. As a subsequent step, maybe the same day, we could establish a sort of governing board, a sort of group of people who commit to doing different things, given each one's time and possibilities. And then calendar another meeting, and assign homework due then. At a subsequent visit, then, I invited everyone to participate in what we came to conceptualize as a \"strategic meeting.\" 2. Strategic Meeting A few weeks after the Encuentro, then, I convened the \"First strategic meeting for planning related to health and well-being in the third age.\" I invited all Encuentro participants, as well as others who Encuentro participants felt might illuminate aspects of elder health mentioned yet unaddressed in the Encuentro. These additional invitees were a dentist, a pharmacist, and a laboratory owner. While CISC had quite obviously convened and hosted the Encuentro, it retreated into the background for the Strategic Meeting, assuming footing equal with each of the other participants. I made this apparent from the outset, for example, using a non-institutional design (rather than CISC's logo) on the invitations. 478 The loose meeting agenda, elaborated on the basis of suggestions from the Encuentro and follow-up visits, was to: \u0001 Briefly summarize the content of the Encuentro. This was especially important background for those joining us for the first time. \u0001 Present an Encuentro CD to those attendees who had not yet received one. I also offered each person a copy for their institution. (An Encuentro participant had argued for a \"personal\" copy in addition to the \"institutional\" copy, as the latter would likely be usurped by the institution.) \u0001 Discuss the progress of and preliminary observations from surveys and interviews to date (at the request of a number of Encuentro participants). \u0001 Explore the possibility of forming an elder health and care working group. We held the Strategic Meeting one morning in the conference room at the ISSTECH's Clinic, thanks to the Clinic's Director, who had offered this space, coffee, and cookies. This building is conveniently located in the center of town, just in front of Health Jurisdiction III and the ISSSTECH. This was a smaller, more intimate gathering than was the Encuentro. Fourteen of us arranged chairs in a circle, then sat and talked for over two hours. The group was just the right size for a conversation in which all could participate without a moderator. 479 B. Engaging participants and handing over the reigns at the Strategic Meeting At the outset of the Strategic Meeting, participants most likely saw me as the organizer, the expert, the researcher, and themselves as isolated individuals, perhaps sharing a common interest. I did indeed welcome everyone, pass out the CDs, and present preliminary findings. Yet I hoped that those attending would walk out not only \"in my shoes\" but also as an integral group. Over the course of the Strategic Meeting, I consciously worked toward these reversals in dynamic and roles. In Chambers' (1994) words, I wanted to \"hand over the stick\" (Chambers 1994: 1254, see Chapter 2). Part of my strategy was to encourage a shift in the learning dynamic. Participants started without the confidence to challenge my guidance or to assume responsibility for the meeting and future activities. From the beginning, I tried to instill confidence in them so that they did not look to me for direction. Yes, I said, I convened, provided an occasion, and initiated the meeting, but this was their idea and their chance to share, suggest, assess, act. I made it clear that they were in the driver's seat, and that I was learning from them by listening, asking questions, as well as by encouraging ideas, proposals, and evaluation as a group. In my behavior, I asserted that their own knowledge and insight is valuable, that they are agents not objects, and that they are capable of analyzing and addressing their own problems. Through co-learning and analysis of research findings, participants realized the value of their own knowledge and were empowered to speak up. In this way, my role shifted from researcher/director to facilitator and catalyst, and the social ties between us from vertical to more horizontal. This meant welcoming the 480 unpredictable nature of the group discussion, which strayed from what I had envisioned. Further, I declined making decisions about the group's organization and future, instead allowing the group to make these by consensus. At the same time, I tried to assuage the power differentials between participants. Clinical directors, for instance, can be long- winded, and I tried to curb this tendency while encouraging more quiet participants to open up. From the start, when we discussed the research progress and preliminary findings, I asked participants to verify themes, clear up my doubts and misconceptions, and elaborate on details from their own experience. Because the survey was still underway and I continued to interview, this was a timely opportunity to receive participants' feedback, so that I could incorporate it in subsequent interviews and analysis. But equally as important was that discussing the findings was an effective means of engaging the group in conversation, educating me and each other. Some jumped into the conversation after hearing some shocking statistic, for instance that 1 of 4 elder men had been or were currently pack-a-day smokers, or that 1 of 10 women aged 50+ were medicated for menopausal symptoms. Others were provoked, for example, by critiques of health services. Hearing the results provoked much discussion about causes, consequences, potential for change, and additional questions. Participants engaged with the data and expanded upon it. I became the audience and they became the experts. 481 Figure 10.1, Photo, discussion during the Strategic Meeting Another shift effected during the Strategic Meeting was that from individual to group. A small portion of the Encuentro was reserved for group interaction; otherwise, it was individual presentations. The surveys and interviews were all individual. The Strategic Meeting began to reverse modes of interaction and analysis from individual to group. The shift from individual to group participation had various advantages. For one, overlapping spread of knowledge at the Strategic Meeting covered a wider field than that of any individual present. The group also automatically and immediately filled in gaps left by others, and added, crosschecked, and corrected detail. For this mutual self- checking, they used both verbal and visual means. For instance, one physician was enlisted to write up meeting notes on poster-sized paper, while others corrected and prompted him. The collective and creative enthusiasm that built up in the group was contagious. Some sensitive subjects, such as pressures of institutional superiors, were more freely discussed in this group than when I conversed with them one-on-one. Debate was lively. Information built up cumulatively. 482 C. Creation of the CAIMAM Elder Health Working Group Strategic Meeting participants felt so good about the group dynamics and value of group work that they were eager to form an elder health working group. There was some initial discussion regarding the challenges involved in creating and sustaining a working group, but those present concluded that the task was worthwhile. Not only did all involved (CISC, elder informants, and service providers) agree that elders' needs merited immediate attention, but they also worried that if a nascent group did not embark on some short-term activities, the initiative sparked by the Encuentro would fizzle. Providers' desire to form a working group also coincided perfectly with CISC's hope of promoting continuity without dependence or (to be honest) financial drain. So, the group set to work establishing its name, mission, and coordinating team. Major accords followed much discussion and were noted on the easel. The group tossed around a number of names, debating each term, before settling on \"the Committee for Integral and Multidisciplinary Care for Older Adults\" (Comit\u00e9 de para CAIMAM). CAIMAM's mission would be to \"revive the importance of quality of life for older adults in Comit\u00e1n via a multidisciplinary, interinstitutional group belonging to the social collective\" (Revindicar la importancia de la calidad de vida del en Comit\u00e1n a trav\u00e9s de un grupo multidisciplinario, interinstitucional y del colectivo social). The group considered adopting a motto. Suggestions included, \"Old age is a way of thinking and beauty is an attitude,\" \"Promoting health and extending life,\" or \"Forging our future.\" In 483 choosing a motto, participants reflected on the message that they want to convey. Debate and disagreement prevented a final decision about the motto, and the group decided that it should postpone this particular task in order to address more pressing matters, such as its coordinating team. CAIMAM elected as its facilitator Dr. Guadalupe Alvarez, a native resident of Comit\u00e1n and current health researcher at the College of the Southern Border (ECOSUR), with previous experience in health care provision in the region and collaboration with CISC. The group decided that, at least for the time-being, CAIMAM should remain somewhat independent from the participating institutions (government, non-government, and CISC alike). The group agreed to meet again in a month, and perhaps every six weeks thereafter. CAIMAM's meeting place, they determined, would rotate through the different organizations, such that the space would be free of charge, the burden of hosting would be shared, and service providers would get to know each others' facilities and services. For instance, the Municipal DIF Director observed that rotating meeting sites, \"would be good because we'd get more cultured\" [se va uno culturizando m\u00e1s]. Representatives from three institutions were quick to offer their institutional spaces for the meetings. Some also offered to equip the meeting room with projection equipment and to provide hot coffee and cookies. The ISSTECH Director added, \"I want to offer our building as a meeting site because I'm also very interested in having my personnel hear this.\" 484 The group agreed that CAIMAM would attempt to work on very specific, short-term projects; the development of proposals for broader long-term research and intervention projects; and self-education and training. Among immediate suggestions for short-term initiatives was a proposal to celebrate Grandparents' Day. An ISSSTE social worker brainstormed: Grandparents' Day is August 28th. We could organize a program in which elders could come, or care brigades could go. Elders without a means of care could receive care. Last Women's Day, a couple of institutions got together and did something like that. The institutions are willing to cooperate.... This would be open to the general public. The Casa Director agreed, Yes, I would really like to do something, anything special for August 28. It could be something very small but symbolic. We could meet on July 8th and assign ourselves work to get things in order for August 28th. We have to give ourselves assignments. Each of us has to reflect on, given our possibilities, what can we give? And then after this, we can invite others to join us, but sensitizing them along the way. Participants were also adamant about the need for self-education, training, and group development. For instance, an IDH physician asserted, Before we spring it on the public, we have to agree among ourselves that we do everything well, that everything should be a team effort, and that we have to study the topics, we have to figure out what we are going to do within our general goal of helping older adults. To foster group organization and cohesion, the ISSTECH Director asserted that participation should be limited to the core group of providers, \"this time without the media and all. This time it would be a more intimate meeting. And when we get things in order, well, we can open it up to others.\" Eventually, however, the group would take 485 on a more regional and even state-wide role, as envisioned by the Municipal DIF Director, who proposed, Once we get this committee well-established, we can then work on an elder care committee for the State of Chiapas. Because there isn't one at the state level yet, but this can be the starting point.... We don't need to invest much, just at some point invite the Secretary of Health, the official governing body, and they can validate/authorize [dar fe] our group. By the end of the Strategic Meeting, this group was clearly engaged, with concrete short- term goals as well as inspiring long-term vision. Further, I had managed to \"hand over the stick.\" At a follow-up meeting, Guadalupe Alvarez and I reviewed meeting minutes, gleaning feedback on both the content and the process of the meeting. We discussed what worked and what did not, and agreed that she would send out a copy of meeting minutes before extending invitations for the subsequent CAIMAM meeting. I left Chiapas soon after, continuing to communicate through her via e-mail and telephone calls. 486 D. An emerging notion of Elder Primary Health Care (EPHC) At the strategic meeting, in interviews beforehand, and conversations afterward, the issue of group sustainability was a lurking concern. I would have to find ways of motivating the group from afar. My most recent attempt is to to sketch components of a elder primary health care model that might jumpstart a process of reflection and critique among CAIMAM participants in order to develop an intervention plan of their own. At the Strategic Meeting, the Municipal DIF Director evoked vigorous nodding of agreement when he contended that the response to the aging health crisis in Comit\u00e1n had been very slow: The difference is truly abysmal. For example, in large cities like Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, care for older adults has been developing for about the past ten years. And here in Comit\u00e1n, I think we are just barely looking at first steps to assess elder health. But it's not too late! This should be done as soon as possible! Having awakened interest in addressing elder health and care, and having achieved a basic diagnosis of the problems in need of solutions, the moment is propitious to propose that the group think about an Elder Primary Health Care (EPHC) strategy. Elders, caregivers, and providers provided many suggestions that I have attempted to integrate. The components I present here are initial sketches, conceptualized as rough, bare-bones suggestions to be shared with the various stakeholder groups, ideas that they may evaluate, modify, and build on - or discard altogether and start with something new. The final product might end up looking very distinct; the purpose of this model is simply to jumpstart the process. As long as it engages stakeholders in a discussion of which facets 487 of the problem to address, the feasibility of implementing intervention, the most effective means of doing so, etc., then I will deem this model a success. 1. EPHC rests on an expanded notion of elder health and care This EPHC proposal rests on what providers conceived of as an \"expanded\" notion of elder health and care. As an IDH physician in Comit\u00e1n observed, the elder care problem is \"...political, economic, social, all over the place, because it's multidisciplinary. [Care] is not based on just one aspect.\" To orient these various facets of well-being, providers called for a new 'culture of the third age' in which everyone, including elders themselves, respects elders and values their later years. This would entail a shift in \"our life style, our orientation, our habits.\" For instance, the Municipal DIF Director argued, \"first and foremost, we need a gerontological culture. We should begin from the bottom, in the elementary and middle schools, working with kids and their teachers to talk about aging and instill a preventive culture.\" Participants advocated moving from a focus on purely palliative care to one that encompasses prevention and curative care. In a \"preventive culture,\" education moves people to avoid problems, screening allows for early identification of problems, and proper treatment of chronic problems helps prevent problems from escalating. The Municipal DIF Director recommended both gerontological and geriatric care, specifying, \"these are very different things. One is preventive and the other is practically palliative. We need both.\" Similarly, a Centro Adelante provider said, \"[Medication is] simply a 488 technical control treatment, it does not eradicate the problem.... What we really want to do is eradicate the problem.\" Providers recommended starting with basic, home-based personal hygiene and diet. A Centro Adelante practitioner argued, for instance, \"Service providers should start by teaching hygiene and then move on to getting rid of bad habits.\" Of nutrition, the IDH doctor said enthusiastically, \"Nutrition! I believe that is the foundation, the keystone of all of our major illnesses. This starts at birth, in childhood, with our education. We have to have an education, also a culture, and someone who teaches us. That way, we'll change our eating habits.\" This shift in culture toward increased value on later years of life and preventive measures should, according to many practitioners, start with efforts among younger people. The ISSSTE Director asserted, \"I insist on exercise, healthy diet, and starting to take care of yourself at age 40 instead of waiting for problems. [...] We take x-rays of 80 year-olds and they have the bones of 80 year-olds, and that's normal for their age, but what worries me is when a 40 year-old has what look like 80 year-old bones.\" The ISSTECH Clinic Director echoed this perspective: Our life style, our orientation, our habits - that's the key to the future, to improvement. We have to create programs around that. Unfortunately, we work with people who are already old, but we should get institutions together to conduct programs with younger people, in school from childhood, inculcate sports, exercise, healthy eating habits. That'd be basic, because everything else starts there. A Centro Adelante provider, openly exasperated with elders so set in their ways, sighed, There will always be sick elders. But I think that instead of trying to fix the adult population, we should concentrate on the future generation so that when they arrive at this age, they are mature [cabales] people, because a lot of older adults 489 still seem like little kids [chamaquitos]. So when these people who are on their way finally get there, they arrive with health, potential, and a will to live well. She also recognized the impact of elders' behavior on younger generations, and elders' potential as role models for younger adults, observing, \"Speaking of the third age, it's important to observe how they have advanced in their culture, their way of life, and they have left their mark [huellas] on those who follow them.\" 2. Interactive EPHC components Beyond existing prevention and basic home health care, providers proposed four potential components of an Elder Primary Health Care (EPHC) system in Comit\u00e1n: Tertiary health care structures Secondary health care structures Existing Primary health care structures Casa de Oro elder care coordination center Community outreach program Proposed Pharmaceutical support program Social scientist/NGO EPHC facilitation a. Existing tertiary health care structures These Tertiary Health Care (THC) structures are hospitals located outside of Comit\u00e1n, in the state capitol (Tuxtla Gutierrez) and Mexico City. In this model, these services would continue to provide care for elders with acute illness episodes via referral from Secondary Health Care Services, and in a few cases from Primary Health Care Services. 490 b. Existing secondary health care structures In Comit\u00e1n, Secondary Health Care (SHC) would continue to be offered by the IMSS and ISSSTE (for insured elders) and the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital (for uninsured elders). The one aspect of THC and SHC system that might be addressed, because of the link to the PHC structures, is the referral process. In general, practitioners advocated for care to be offered locally, rather than for elders to be referred to out-of-town clinics and hospitals. They recognized that referrals tended to be characterized by a disconnect in doctor-doctor and doctor-patient communication. As the Municipal DIF Director explained, We should try not to refer them out, but instead to keep them here... and to make sure that they always have follow-up right here, too. This way, we reduce expenses and we manage the money better. Referral is sometimes counter- productive, because the patients go and say, \"the doctor said that I need this and that,\" and resources become even more limited. c. Existing primary health care structures In Comit\u00e1n, ISSSTE and ISSTECH (for insured elders), the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital, the Health Center, and private physicians would continue to offer Primary Health Care (PHC) to elders. In terms of elder care, however, these institutions would concentrate on providing emergency and SHC services while much of the work of community and professional education and training, screening, patient follow-up, and ongoing support for chronic problems would be facilitated by an Elder Care Coordination Center and a Community Outreach Program (see below). 491 d. Proposed Casa de Oro elder care coordination center Practitioners insisted on the development of a place in which the various stakeholders would come together to engage in satisfying elders' multifaceted needs. The ISSTECH Director proposed, \"We need a place, but not like an asylum, rather a 'Casa de Oro' ['Golden Home'].\" Providers envisioned this Elder Care Coordination Center as both a physical site and conceptual space for facilitating EPHC in Comit\u00e1n. It would enable elders, caregivers, and providers to do one-stop-shopping. Most of the details I suggest were originally proposed by providers. Briefly, the Casa de Oro would aim to serve all elders - regardless of insurance and type of caring needs - as well as all involved in providing elder health and care. It would be a place in which stakeholders' experience is respected and where all are expected to share their insight and abilities as they are able. Structurally, the Casa de Oro would be designed with the elder population in mind, adequately architected to accommodate elders' needs, to ease movement among those with functional limitations, and to encourage activities and interaction. In addition to meeting spaces, a lounge, a courtyard, offices, and consult rooms, it would have gardened areas in which to stroll, sit, cultivate plants, do artwork, socialize, play music, and exercise. The Casa de Oro would be staffed by volunteers and service providers. Service providers might serve on a rotating basis, in return for training, CME credits, public recognition, and institutional bonuses. Volunteers would include adults, elders themselves, and youth. Youth volunteers might 492 be recruited to conduct their practice-based internships [servicio social], required for many high school and college degree programs. The Casa de Oro would be a \"conceptual space,\" a place from which to conduct a comprehensive review of elder care needs and resources and then integrate efforts to tend to the multiple facets of elder care. Its mere existence would be a tribute to elder well- being and the value of improving it. The ISSTECH Director emphasized the complex nature of elder care, \"We have to review all the areas of a human being: physical, emotional, intellectual, and start from there in order to help them, not just tend to one area, but all of them in an integral manner.\" This would be the physical space for elders and other stakeholders to meet, exchange ideas, and collaborate on institutionally-neutral ground. The Casa de Oro would be a home for CAIMAM and other relevant groups. It would house resources on elder health and care, including printed matter, posters, and audiovisual materials. Further, the Casa de Oro could be a home-base for inter- institutional research efforts and subsequent dissemination of findings. It would a clearinghouse for information generated and organized in the course of addressing this problem. In other words, a fundamental function would be a space from which to explore and improve elder well-being. The Casa de Oro would also be a physical center for action, one aspect of which would be elder health and care education and training. Talks, courses, workshops would be held onsite, aimed at elders themselves, caregivers, providers, and the general public. Such 493 specialized training for providers might include the basics of gerontology, but also expose providers to a variety of approaches, including alternative medicine. For instance, a Centro Adelante practitioner advocated, ...starting with service providers, teaching them to use natural medicine, hydrotherapy, physiotherapy, etc. Show them that these methods have been successful in cases in which official medicine has failed, and to prove to them that they, too, can practice natural medicine. Other specialized topic might be pain management, end-of-life care, reproductive health in elder women. Those working in pharmacies and laboratories would also be invited to participate in training to better serve their elder clients' needs and promote communication and collaboration between those who are writing prescriptions and those who fill them. Elders, too, would have access to taking and teaching courses and workshops. Some providers went so far as to suggest that treatment be contingent upon each patient's participation in formal health education programs. For instance, an ISSSTE social worker asserted, \"I think that the physician should require patients to have a little card stamped to prove they attended all relevant talks and orientations, so that they are sure to understand the need to love themselves more, to take care of their health, to cut back on medication dosage.\" Instances of inadequate care, neglect, and abandonment moved providers to advocate expanding the ranks of caregivers and promoting quality care provision. The Casa de Oro would be a base from which to identify current caregivers, develop a caregiver registration system, and recruit additional caregivers. Orientation and training form another crucial step. The Municipal DIF Director touched on these points: 494 The caregivers, well, I feel that first we ought to identify who they are. Are they relatives? Or are they people paid by the family? We ought to pay special attention to them, orient them, train them, right? We need to provide them with some kind of additional support, for example, help them out with transportation, tell them, \"come here, you can take care of elders.\" We need a training system for all these people who dedicate themselves to caring for people. And this should all be documented in a database. I think it'd work well. The ISSSTE Director suggested collaborating with NGOs and local municipalities to create a \"school\" for elder caregivers. Practitioners also stressed the need to provide caregivers with ongoing support in order to ensure mental stability and prevent burnout. The ISSSTE Director observed, \"...Who cares for the caregivers? We need someone to deal with what's happening to those who take care of the ill and invalid. People, relatives may end up not providing good care to patients of the third age, and they need help and psychological support themselves.\" The Casa de Oro would offer such support. It would also facilitate in matching individuals trained in elder health and care with employment and volunteer opportunities, both onsite and elsewhere. For instance, this might be the place where the Casa Hogar Director might recruit a male nurse, or a widow might find a vocation as a volunteer gardener. The Casa de Oro would serve as a social space for elders, a site for cultural events and recreation opportunities. The ISSSTE Director thought aloud, It would be one place for everyone where elders wouldn't feel alone, where they can talk to others their age, maybe do something together, I don't know, play dominos. ... It occurs to me that a park tended to by volunteers would work. People of the third age need a park or a place where they can walk and talk safely. 495 To make elders and their caregivers comfortable with spending time at the Casa de Oro, there would be daytime supervision and light care. The ISSTECH Director proposed a place, ... functioning like a daycare center, where elders can hang out, where they feel autonomous, self-sufficient, and at the same time, if they need anything, they would have access to some support. It would be a day center like this one [the ISSTECH], but open to the whole public. .... Yes, sort of a daycare center, so elders would have a place to go during the day. That would be ideal. The ISSSTE Director mused, I'd like to form groups of the third age.... We could have an hour to talk and an hour for an activity, right? Among them there are probably individuals who like music and can play an instrument. We should stimulate them to get together, remind them that life is not over, encourage each one of them give what he or she can give, right? Another major axis of the Casa de Oro functions would be to design, coordinate, and maybe even offer - onsite support services in physical health and social well-being that could be planned and scheduled in advance. Physical health services would provide chronic care, physical therapy, screening, and prevention. Rather than focus on crisis management, this component would focus on prevention, planning ahead, and looking \"upstream\" to identify individuals and groups who are socially vulnerable (alienated, stressed households) in order to reduce risks. These preventive services might include dental, vision, and hearing tests, as well as screening for reproductive, menopausal, and prostate problems. In terms of social well-being, there would be onsite mental health services for individuals, couples, and elder-caregiver dyads. The Casa de Oro would be a recruitment and/or meeting site for relevant self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous and domestic violence counseling, each tailored to the needs of this 496 generation. There would be legal council on hand to help with wills, divorce, banking, and property needs. Elders would also receive assistance in navigating the public support bureaucracy, such as filling out paperwork for insurance benefits. Utility (gas, water, electricity) company employees might be asked to volunteer their time to help elders, especially women, equip their homes with needed amenities. The Casa de Oro might also function as a donation and dispersal point for needed material resources, such as clothing, blankets, diapers, walkers, wheelchairs, eyeglasses, cell phones and pre-paid phone cards for elders. The Casa de Oro would facilitate transportation to help elders get to and from the Center. The ISSTECH psychologist insisted, There has to be transportation because many don't come because they can't, or because there's no one to bring them. Their children say, \"No, you better stay home because, what if something happens to you?\" So, they end up staying at home. Yes, transportation would be good so that they could come and if there's a problem, they'd be dropped off at home again. Further, taxi and bus drivers unions might be convinced to offer their services for free or at a lower rate in exchange for publicity and public recognition. The gas and drinking water distributors travel nearly every street of the city on a daily basis. If each truck were to provide just one ride to and from the Casa de Oro per day, this would greatly facilitate transport issues. A local government representative might be recruited to help identify and address environmental obstacles, like sidewalks and water supply. 497 Finally, the Casa de Oro would be a dispatch point for community outreach, described below. Providers shared this dream of a multi-functional Casa de Oro. A Centro Adelante practitioner imagined, My dream, well, perhaps it's not as far off as it seems, as it wouldn't require too much spending or time if we took some small but solid steps. I'd like a center or a place, a hospital where there are gardens, crops, workshops, teaching about good habits. In this type of place, elders would produce something and receive their treatment, therapy, talks, interacting like a group of club members. As members, they both offer their help and teach others skills, whatever they can bring to the table. ... People of the third age, they have experience, and this is still respected. If we supported people of the third age, they then could teach those who follow them. ...We could do something productive with all the people of the third age. The majority of those who retire don't dedicate themselves to anything. Well, some, some take care of their grandchildren. So they should do more handiwork, forestry, tree-planting, artwork.... We could create a small business with elders, for example crafts, teach them to do something that cultivates their minds, help them forget their problems and illnesses. ... If they dedicated themselves to something, they would forget about illnesses, they would forget about going to consult a doctor. Why? Because they wouldn't have time to get sick. But because they spend so much time just hanging out there, [they say] \"now I have this pain.\" They are black and blue from all the time they spend just sitting there. The Municipal DIF Director shared his concerns and resulting aspirations regarding this elder center: Institutions have not really opened up to geriatric or gerontological services.... So at the Health Sector level, I mean ISSSTE, IMSS, ISSTECH, only ISSTECH has a program for older adults.... The only place with this dynamic is the ISSTECH where there are doctors, a geriatric home should have training in gerontology. So there is so much more to do. The personnel is not trained en elder care. We don't have the multidisciplinary team that we need. There is so much more to work on, to do. I feel that older adults are one of the least protected populations, and it is growing almost constantly and daily.... This is very serious population situation. Critical. Critical. I suggest forming groups and having study sessions regarding gerontology, training people here.... My dream would 498 be to create the first state gerontological center in Comit\u00e1n, which would provide support during the day. No acute care, because that would be at the hospital level, but the first stages of gerontological treatment would be very good. This and the creation of a university for the third age, so that older adults feel they participate fully in society, they can earn their money, they can support themselves rather than living off bones the government throws them. They should feel useful in their work, because feeling useless causes a lot of problems as well as mental repercussions in older adults. This is my dream.... I have the proposal ready to go. It's right here [pointing to his head]. It's ready and waiting. In sum, this Casa de Oro would be a physical space and conceptual realm in which capital - social, cultural, and economic - would be concentrated and directed toward the shared goal of elder well-being, and from which awareness, education, and care would emanate into Comit\u00e1n and beyond. This effort would span legal-medical. e. Proposed community outreach program The proposed community outreach program has two major facets: involving providers in elder care outside the clinic, and involving elders themselves in elder care. The goals of both would be the same: education, prevention, screening, care and support, and referral. Among practitioners' own recommendations was to venture beyond clinic walls and into elders' communities within the city and outside urban bounds, via \"health brigades, seminars, events organized by neighborhoods, housing developments, and farms.\" Community outreach would enable providers to interact with and care for elders, 499 especially those for whom mobility is problematic, through home visits, mobile clinics, and provider-conducted research. As a Centro Adelante practitioner argued, literature reviews and first hand research and clinical practice out in their patients' communities would both educate providers and help patients: Service providers should really be good researchers. They should get into research and practice, because the truth is that they're there in the office and instead of reading the mountain of books they have, they've got the TV on. What can the television teach them? Nothing! What can they teach others when they're asked to go into a community? ... [Health care providers] should be willing to go out on campaigns and home visits, here in the city as well as outside it.... Home visits would serve not only geriatricians, but also physicians in general, as they would develop closer, more trusting relationships with people. When practitioners don't ever leave their offices, this creates a barrier. Moving from office to homes is something else entirely.... It would mean taking health and knowledge into people's homes. Now that would be something different! The second facet of the Community Outreach Program is based on the concept that elders are not only capable of, but would also benefit from, involvement in care for themselves and their cohort. On one hand, providers recognize and respect elders' entitlement to their support, but providers also moderated their own responsibility for elder care by prioritizing support from caregivers and other elders, and especially by calling on elders to engage in self-reliance, -responsibility, and -care. This perspective contrasts with an approach in which practitioners serve up elder care on a plate. Providers' ideal calls on elders to participate more actively in their own care and legitimizes elders' capabilities, efforts, and preferences. Practitioners recognized that, to create a culture of elder-to- elder support, elders need training, support, and encouragement.74 This would entail 74 The ISSSTECH Director suggested a program to train elders to help themselves. She envisioned this program as a collaboration between her ISSTECH (insurance-based) staff, the Health Jurisdiction 500 promoting shifts in elders' perspectives regarding care, entitlement, and responsibility. For instance, ISSTECH staff were learning about elder self-help groups, and realized, \"The elders need a lot, but they don't know how to give. They want to receive, but they don't want to give. We have to teach them to give, that giving is really special, that it's even better than receiving.\" Likewise, the Casa Hogar Director explained that she and her staff encourage self-help among the home's residents, \"we try to encourage the one who can walk to push the other's wheelchair. And that they communicate with each other.\" The ISSTECH psychologist observed that elders can, do, and should help each other: They help each other a lot. They can support someone else more then themselves. Why? Because they're looking at the problem from outside, and often their problems are similar. Yes, this happens a lot and here we have realized that they talk. For example, \"I had a pain wherever.\" \"Yes, I had that, too, and why don't you put this on it?\" Or, \"I went to see so-and-so.\" Or for depression, \"Well, I started to go out. I started to do this. Don't take so many pills,\" some of them say. Yes, they started to counsel each other, they start to talk. Community outreach would also enable elders to support themselves through an Elder Community Health Worker (ECHW) program. Likewise, a Centro Adelante practitioner contended that elders could be much more than babysitters, promoting their own physical and emotional well-being while helping to meet wider societal needs, via handiwork, ecological projects, cultural (art and music) contributions, small business, and especially elder health care. The ISSTECH Director suggested that elders be trained to return to their communities and neighborhoods to assist other elders in the community health worker tradition, \"Train elders to help themselves! Just helping them to feel useful is (municipal health), especially the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital (non-insurance-based) staff, and elders themselves. 501 enough! It would help.\" Interviews revealed potential for individual elders and groups of elders to facilitate elder health care. For instance, one man had translated for elder Tzeltal patients in the General Hospital. Another elder woman joined a group of volunteers at the Comit\u00e1n General Hospital. Elders could sit and talk with others, give out vitamin supplements, record elder care needs in each household, run an \"elder neighborhood watch\" program, promote Casa de Oro services, recruit other elder volunteers. These elder-to-elder efforts would not aim to isolate elders from younger adults and youth. On the contrary, participants hoped for stronger mutually-beneficial inter- generational interaction. They pointed out that teenagers could care for elders while elders could orient youth. The ISSSTE Director touched on this potential, \"we should gather youth to raise awareness among them via an inter-relation between youth and elders.\" Likewise, a Centro Adelante practitioner observed, \"People of the third age have experience, and this is still respected. If we supported people of the third age, then they could teach those who follow them.\" Sensitization and education efforts, too, might be aimed at elder, yet accessible to younger adults. A weekly radio program regarding elder well-being and providing information about health issues, for instance, might serve elders, younger adults, and the considerable illiterate segment of the local population. Given training and logistical support, practitioners believed that elders could help themselves, and that elders might appropriate or take over efforts aimed at them. For 502 instance, the ISSTECH Director, among others, dreamed of establishing a means of getting elders to take the reigns of their own programs, which would have the additional benefit of freeing already over-burdened care providers. She reflected, \"Maybe we [providers] won't always have to be present. Maybe we can create something and then they can go, the people of the third age can build something themselves. I mean we would give them the foundation and then they can take it from there.\" Providers were confident that elders could even go so far as developing and managing their own elder-to-elder care strategies. The ISSTECH Director was inspired by an organization established for elders by elders in southwestern Chiapas. She recounted: In Tapachula, a geriatric home, quote-unquote, opened up, but it doesn't function like a standard geriatric home. A group of people got together. Well, it began with just one person - a psychologist - with enthusiasm, concern, and love for elders. She invited people to share their resources. \"I know how to knit.\" \"I know how to embroider.\" \"I know how to cook.\" \"I do exercise and I have a video or I'll bring in an instructor.\" \"I'll offer my house.... That way, I won't be alone and we can keep each other company.\" Among all of them, they formed a geriatric home, among all these little old people. There are insured and uninsured. It's been open for about a year. The main thing is the enthusiasm, the willingness of each one. Here [in Comit\u00e1n], we have even more people to contribute.... This is an extremely important lesson because they didn't have to do much fund-raising. Now the challenge here is that people are used to receiving all the benefits. It's something we have to confront, how to teach them to help and to give a little of themselves. Providers envisioned benefits of this model for home-based caregivers, elders, and themselves. For home-based caregivers, providers saw the Casa de Oro offering sensitization to elders' physical and psychological needs, training in how to respond to 503 them, and psychological support in general and in crisis situations. The Community Outreach Program, with its ECHWs, providers making home and neighborhood visits, and mobile clinics, would help establish life-saving links between home-based caregivers and physicians and institutions. The ECHWs might reduce home-based caregivers' responsibilities by tracking elders' health status, medication, and needs on a regular basis. They could also answer home-based caregivers' questions and refer concerns to providers at the primary and secondary levels. Rather than isolated at home, this model would offer home-based caregivers personal links to a support network at the Casa de Oro and beyond. For caregivers, training might help build a cohort of supportive individuals, and perhaps credentials to help them find paid positions. Receiving recognition for their work would encourage caregivers to perceive themselves as part of a valued group. Finally, the Casa de Oro would aim to (re-)establish mutually-beneficial links between elders and youth, as caregivers and as eventual elders themselves. For elders, accessing services at the Casa de Oro and/or through community outreach efforts, would better equip them to tend to their own needs and be more self-reliant, so that family members would tire less and therefore more open to interaction with elders. By having their basic care needs - (e.g. chronic care needs and dental, hearing, visual needs) met on a regular basis, elders would feel better in general, and be able to assist others more. Those who served as caregivers for other elders through the ECHW program and/or through the Casa de Oro would become part of a publicly-recognized cadre of elder health promoters, who might then be able to interact from the more 504 powerful position as caregivers versus care-receivers. Also, for men who may have lost their occupational identity, working as a volunteer at the Casa de Oro might offer a new identity. For women, the vocation of ECHW might combine their capacity for caring work with official recognition and public respect they never had for their invisible caring and domestic work. Providers also envisioned benefits for themselves and their institutions. If the Casa de Oro and the Community Outreach Program were successful in removing some of the burden of conducting prevention, screening, and routine care, then providers working in institutions would be able to concentrate on the elders who truly need secondary and tertiary services. They can then increase the amount of time they spend with each patient. To curb over-medication, providers will have to compensate with emotional support. Additionally, the training and education offered through the Casa de Oro would heighten sensitivity to elders' and caregivers' needs. In conceiving of themselves as elders or soon-to-be elders, practitioners would gain empathy for elders. If, in recognition for their training, they receive certificates, diplomas, and media publicity, the public should have the means of recognizing each doctor as a member of an elder- friendly group, thereby increasing his/her professional status. In going through training courses, conducting research, and designing and operationalizing interventions in a collaborative dynamic with colleagues, providers would network into a supportive team rather than struggling as a lone ranger. When providers interact with elders & families outside hospital grounds, in the community, in mobile clinics, neighborhood health 505 events, and in elders' homes, they would simultaneously provide care and forge trust. By being able to provide elders with treatment that requires relatively little investment and can be scheduled in advance - such as dental work and eye glasses - institutions would also be more attentive to elders' concerns. f. Proposed pharmaceutical support program Elders' behavior and providers' comments alike made clear the need for a more informed \"culture of medication.\" As mentioned in Chapter 7, elders were open about self- medicating, frequently and without supervision. Practitioners realized, however, that the problem of over-medication is much larger than individual elders and their physicians, involving big business, money, national norms and trends. For instance, the ISSSTE Director alluded to the role of mass media in the medication craze: In our population, over-medication is partly due to lack of information. The demand for calcium persists because people think it will cure osteoporosis and it's because at a general level the population is bombarded with commercials, you know? For example, it's \"in\" to consume fiber, right? And there's a seed that... the whole world wants to take because it's being advertised. They think that these products are going to solve their problems. A Centro Adelante provider reflected on the government's role, and recommended avoiding confrontation along the lines of these charged issues: Thinking about this [demedicalization] shift entails a lot because the government has been quite irresponsible, in this case allowing people to self-prescribe.... Here we enter in controversies with the factories, because we'd have a really serious issue there because, for instance, a pediatrician who stops prescribing all that is established [in the norms] in order to change children's diet, well, they'd say that we're going against the flow. So we have to be very careful when we are dealing with these issues. Because there are tensions, better not to stir it up, better to let it be, better only to work with the ones who really want to change. 506 In contrast, the Municipal DIF Director suggested that the CAIMAM working group directly engage the pharmaceutical industry: I don't think there's anyone who is responsible for supervising the pharmacies, no. It's pure self-medication.... It would be good to invite [to the working group] a laboratory, a pharmaceutical lab director, like Novartis. I have a friend, a good friend who we could invite. If I call him, he'll come, and he can give us that perspective. Practitioners were vociferous about inculcating in people the need to avoid self- medication and over-medication, and to increase medical supervision of necessary medication. In terms of identifying relevant stakeholders in this venture, they pointed to elders, physicians, pharmacies, labs, media, national government, and even transnational media and pharmaceutical companies as stakeholders who would have to be acknowledged, if not engaged, in order to produce a change in the local culture of elder medication. Given the enormity of the challenge of medication, in a large part due to a largely unregulated capitalist pharmaceutical industry, an integral component of the EPHC model is a proposed Pharmaceutical Support Program. This would be a joint initiative, with pharmacy owners, employees, representatives alongside prescribing practitioners, elders and caregivers. Goals might include Health Department oversight of local pharmacies as well as sensitization and training for all (elders, caregivers, providers, pharmacy workers) regarding safe and effective drug use among elders. The program might work toward policy changes, such as price control and subsidies on products necessary for elders (from prescription medicine and vitamin supplements to diapers and 507 toothpaste). Community outreach might be accomplished by enlisting pharmacists to visit elders' homes to make sure that they have needed medication and take them correctly, as well as to review the dated prescriptions and medication that elders tend to keep for some time in their homes. Practitioners also suggested setting up an elder pharmacy at the Casa de Oro with a highly trained staff, alternative medicine alongside biomedical standards, and generic equivalents. g. Proposed social scientist/NGO EPHC facilitation Stakeholders clearly envisioned elder health and care as a collaborative community project, a partnership between elders, families, individual practitioners, policymakers, government and non-government organizations. Practitioners emphasized the need to get local government and non-government organizations on-board and involved in elder care initiatives. The ISSSTE Director suggested, \"We need to establish a nexus of communication with other non-government organizations, join forces with all the existing organizations to try to share experiences... establish more communication with the local Mayor's Office and with NGOs.....\" The ISSTECH Director similarly suggested, We should invite one of the Mayor's health officials because they should get involved and they are the links, the ones who look for the means to satisfy regional needs.... Our authorities are worried about fulfilling their commitment to elders. They are very interested in fixing this. I feel that it is everyone's responsibility. We are all going to help. The consensus was that there is a critical mass of individuals and institutions who would be willing to help. As the Municipal DIF Director reflected, \"I think that in Comit\u00e1n, 508 there are a lot of people who are willing to support these projects, private initiatives, institutions who want to collaborate in what should be done. With a good project in hand, we can get started.\" While participants advocated a multipartite, collaborative, team of local people, they felt that additional support was needed to facilitate collaboration, from building a team through seeing projects through to fruition. CAIMAM participants, for example, felt ill- prepared to take the project into their own hands. There were glitches in relationships between them, a sense of inadequate training, and a felt need to organize and commit to collaboration, all before engaging in anything even remotely public. Many underlined the need for providers to learn, to establish goals, and to gel into a team as a first step. The IDH physician, for instance, asserted, \"Before going public, first we have to agree among ourselves what we're working for, and let's do it well, and do everything as a team. So we have to study the topics. We have to see what we're going to do within our goal of helping older adults.\" Similarly, the ISSTECH Director reflected on the discussion at the end of the Encuentro: That day people were talking about a lot of things, but I think the most important is to develop a good program, like you say, with objectives, goals, everything, and based on what we are going to do. In other words, what do we have? What resources do we have? And then based on this, we'll launch it. Now it's like we have a lot of random ideas. We have yet to really talk. What can you offer? What can I offer? How about among all of us, we offer a bit of time and some activity that we can do or among all of us support each other. We haven't yet sat down to iron this out. Let's take a look at what we really want. A bunch of proposals flew through the air, but we didn't consider them well. 509 In calling for an organized, collaborative effort, providers specified that no one institution - including CISC - should be given more power or say in matters. Practitioners were grateful that CISC could convoke stakeholders and offer insight. For example, the ISSTECH Director pointed out, \"We like to listen to what CISC has to say. CISC has all the information.\" On the other hand, the Municipal DIF Director recognized that CISC could not do everything, specifying, \"You all [CISC] are a fundamental part of a road that has to made. The initiative has to go its own way.\" [Uds. [CISC] son parte fundamental de un camino que ir abriendo. Se tiene que hacer lo propio.] What participants called for, then, was help facilitating collaboration and initial problem- solving in order to create an EPHC system that would ultimately rest in the diverse hands of the stakeholders. Experience has shown that a propitious combination would be a social scientist (myself or another) backed by CISC's expertise, reputation, and resources. A main function of this local/social scientist/CISC partnership would be to engage, link, and organize the stakeholders mentioned so far, as well as others, such as international funders. There would also be a watchdog component, illuminating imbalances in power, challenging viewpoints championed by stakeholders, introducing topics that local people may not be aware of or may not broach or prioritize. In essence, the CISC-backed social scientist would be the facilitator/catalyst called for in the formative research model. I have now outlined how I served this role, and was able to \"jumpstart\" local participation and then transition into an advisory role as the group matured. In the next chapter, I discuss local initiatives and my role in sustaining local engagement and initiatives. 510 Reflections on Chapter 10 In the past, providers in Comit\u00e1n have gathered forces around other issues, from curbing infectious disease to safeguarding maternal health. In forming CAIMAM, this group took a first step in developing a community of practice around elder well-being. My role was to facilitate dialogue and the social formation of the group while helping them develop a plan. While CAIMAM was a group of motivated, well-intentioned individuals, research revealed that they were largely unaware of elders' lifestyles and constraints. Because they did not move in these elders' spaces, providers did not realize that many of the strategies that they envisioned were problematic. Formative research was necessary to inform them and move them past their assumptions and class prejudice. In the EPHC model, once again, providers' \"blame the victim\" tone underlined the class and power differences between the educated providers who were mostly salaried professionals, and the more marginalized elders of the popular class whom they were to serve. The ethnographic data, however, provided a basis for identifying elder/provider power differentials and the real circumstances of elders in Comit\u00e1n. For instance, practitioners argued for the importance of getting elders to work. The Municipal DIF Director contended, for instance, that elders \"can earn their money, they can support themselves rather than living off bones the government throws them.\" Elders, however, rarely received state handouts, and were working already. Providers seemed unaware of the extent of some elders' poverty, and that many elders were already doing salaried work, housework, grandchild sitting, and store-tending. Further, given a 511 general shortage of employment in Comit\u00e1n, teaching elders other money-making skills might be useless. Providers also posited elders as upper class retirees who should pass their time in leisure activities. In reality, many elders worked a lot and could not retire to a life of sitting in the park, doing crafts, and playing dominos, nor could they be expected to do much volunteer work when their next meal depended on their paid work and the tasks they did in exchange for resources from family members. Similarly, in suggesting that elders maintain better hygiene by bathing and washing clothing daily, providers presumed that elders had water (or could buy it), and that they could lift it, carry it, heat it, and afford the fuel to do so. This was not always the case. Recall, for example, that many elder women had to haul water from a faucet outside their home, and few had a washing machine. Elders' diet, another target point, was often restricted by cash flow, cost of food, ease of preparation, and dental health. Likewise, what providers perceived as non-compliance with treatment, over-medication, and self- medication, was in fact elders self-regulating within the context of restricted resources. Further, there was an infantilizing tone to some of providers' suggestions, such as requiring elders to show stamps to prove they attended health talks. Finally, many recommendations (such as nutrition and diet) were not gerontological, but general public health issues, related to the economic infrastructure of Comit\u00e1n and the surrounding region. 512 Such conflicting perceptions of elders' needs and resources made the presence of a cultural broker necessary. Someone would have to take providers' perceived options, and help them to tease out unrealistic notions, fill in project details (e.g. what might a pharmacy support program look like?), and fine-tune interventions to reflect elders' reality. The EPHC model, an assemblage of providers' own recommendations and a few others, should serve as a malleable template and a basis for non-confrontational discussion. In that the research allows elders to articulate their problems and needs, research findings should be the springboard for this exercise in providers' self-critique and strategic planning. I outline my efforts to inject these findings into the subsequent stages of formative research, i.e. reviewing options, in the following chapter. 513 CHAPTER 11. FACILITATING ONGOING LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AND TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION Overview of Chapter 11 It was during the appointment of CAIMAM's coordinating team that I publicly withdrew as the point person for this project and announced my return to the United States to finish my graduate studies. In preparation, I had discussed the nature of my ongoing participation with my colleagues at CISC and each Strategic Meeting participant. On one hand, I reassured them that I could continue to facilitate their efforts by: a) bringing sensitive and controversial issues to the table (as I had with gendered inequities and critiques of elder care services) that those fully inserted in the context either could not easily discern or would not risk introducing; b) analyzing and presenting findings in a format that is clear, trusted, and immediately applicable to local conditions and constraints; c) offering methodological and theoretical frameworks to help think and work through issues from various perspectives; d) monitoring the process and products in time to effect mid-course correction; e) channel human and material resources toward the end of improving elder health and care; and f) from my role as an insider-outsider, be sensitive to and address issues of power that might hinder the process. On the other hand, I asserted that the time was ripe for local stakeholders to take the reigns. While many did ask me to stay, they eventually stepped up to the plate. Indeed, CAIMAM went on to initiate and carry out activities, including forging collaboration with the state, conducting inter-institutional elder care events, reviving previous proposals for changes in local 514 government, and generating a new research proposal on elder quality of life. In the first section of this chapter, I briefly outline these initiatives and my roles in them. Having left Chiapas, I now strive from afar to facilitate and catalyze ongoing local engagement in Comit\u00e1n. In the second section of this chapter, I describe two of my strategies to engage stakeholders in using survey results. One strategy was less successful, the other more successful. I first tried sending the mass of survey data in a CD containing hundreds of tables of percentages. I soon realized that these tables, and even the summary documents I produced from them, were too quantitative and inspired no interaction at all. The format left a chasm between numbers and local environment. Seeking other ways to situate findings in context and inspire collective problem-solving, teamed with fellow graduate student, Ben McMahan. We took data from the survey - and mapped it via Global Information Systems (GIS). Specifically, we used GIS to generate various sets of maps from the survey database, addressing a variety of health- and care-related issues and using an array of GIS visualization tools. McMahan than shared these maps with local stakeholders, including CAIMAM participants, CISC personnel, and ECOSUR researchers. On one level, the maps were prolific ethnographic elicitors, evoking direct reflection on and evaluation of the data presented. At a deeper level, the maps encouraged appropriation of the research products and process. Beyond evidencing the potential of the formative research-participatory GIS merger in catalyzing problem-solving initiatives, this strategy inspired reflection on the power relations between researchers and local people in participatory research. 515 A. Promoting local engagement and facilitating ongoing transformative action Initially, elders and providers may have been disenchanted with efforts to understand and address problems, but the Encuentro, interviews, and Strategic Meeting helped to instill trust, motivation, interest, hope, and collaboration. Having started the ball rolling, participation generated interest in both elder well-being as well as researching and intervening. A few stakeholders who had more experience with participatory methods became efficient and dedicated facilitators, with minimal intervention or assistance on my part. Essentially, our roles reversed. I began as a leader, working on the front line to establish rapport, convene, and intervene. My role became to facilitate, listen, observe, and consult. Local people began to determine the agenda; select, adapt, and improvise methods; gather, express, and analyze information; plan and conduct intervention. The Elder Health Working Group (CAIMAM) has gone on to investigate and determine how best to implement promising interventions. This has been influenced by both individual and institutional interests, and has entailed exploration of supportive collaborations. The following are four CAIMAM initiatives. 1. Collaboration with the state through ongoing CAIMAM meetings Collaboration with the state is forged through the state employees who participate in CAIMAM on their own accord, borrowing time from the institutional clock. At these meetings, rather than guarded and defensive when their work or their institution was critiqued, providers were forthcoming, taking advantage of the opportunity to vent their frustrations about lack of time, resources, and support, and looking to their peers for 516 empathy and insight. The providers, most in decision-making positions, also employed my research findings to expose shortcomings in state elder care provision to then justify changes within their institutions. Because the findings come from a third \"neutral\" source (me/CISC), they would not be cited for jeopardizing their institution's reputation. In this way, providers served as a channel through which local knowledge and feedback on health programs flowed up to health officials and institutional policy makers enabling them to make more informed decisions about program design and mid-course corrections, and also insight into how state resources could flow down to the people. In this way, CAIMAM meetings helped to foster agreements with individuals who tied national institutions (and their resources) to meeting local needs. The research results may also validate the government's appeals for international funding in the face of perceptions that Mexico is more developed and is not in need of funding, which has threatened the sustainability of state programs. Further, the CAIMAM working group, like CISC, can provide long-term continuity that the state, which is subject to election cycles, cannot. 2. Inter-personal and -institutional accords for elder health care provision At the Encuentro, the Director of the Casa Hogar lamented that their limited budget and intense care needs forced this institution into an eternal state of sub-optimal medical care and supervision. I later introduced her to the geriatrician at the Municipal DIF, who was new in town. He offered to provide pro-bono care for Casa Hogar residents. His was an offer of personal collaboration, not contingent upon his position of institutional authority. At the Strategic Meeting, I encouraged reflection on long-term goals, but also underlined 517 the importance of short-term collaborative achievements. When participants mentioned the upcoming nationally-designated Grandparents' Day, I encouraged them to act on this timely event. In response, at the following CAIMAM meeting, the group planned a public service event. I was already out of the country by Grandparents' Day, but their initiative culminated in free medical consults for elders. Run out of booths set up in Comit\u00e1n's main square, providers offered information (e.g. on hypertension and domestic violence) and diagnostic testing (e.g. paps and blood pressure) to elders, free of charge. 3. Elder health and care research proposals and requests for funding A sub-committee of CAIMAM members drafted a research proposal on aging and quality of life in Comit\u00e1n as well as nearby San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas (in Chiapas), and urban Tabasco (a state bordering Chiapas). They aim to explore perspectives on the meaning of aging, family, health/illness, death, and personal and social needs and expectations. They plan on conducting group interviews with elders, family members, and health care providers, to distinguish perspectives along lines of gender, area of residence (rural/urban), level of family support, insurance status, ethnicity, and social class. These will be complemented by life histories and then followed by workshops in which to design context-appropriate interventions. This proposal was formalized and submitted to the National Council of Science & Technology (Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda, CONACYT) for funding. 518 While I worked to have this local team take charge of the research process, I also responded to their call for assistance. I helped develop the local research focus, questions, and design, based on my research and academic experience. I incorporated my findings to support and legitimize points made in the funding proposal. Because of my contacts with elders, I was also able to offer to help recruit participants for the Comit\u00e1n groups. While they will conduct data collection and oversee the on-the-ground research process, I will stand by to help if requested. I will encourage them to share findings and engage them in interpretation of results and implications for program practices. I can help with writing up for publishing and presenting, if they so choose. 4. Revisiting and reviving previous local efforts and experiences A local gerontologist unearthed an elder health care proposal that he and others had developed and submitted to local officials a few years ago. The project was tabled due to changes in the political regime. A sub-committee of CAIMAM offered to review the proposal to determine whether it might be updated and re-submitted to the current Municipal Health Office in an attempt to get the current mayor and other governing officials on board, as well as to obtain funds. For these initiatives, the likelihood of stakeholder participation is high, as local people are conceptualizing them. Partnerships can be established even the research has begun, even before proposals are written. Funds can be sought together, with local support 519 already in place. This helps to assure practical findings, in turn making the proposals more attractive to funders. Through initiatives such as those I just mentioned, the CAIMAM participants increase their knowledge and strengthen their abilities. This is a result of their efforts to collect, analyze, and present information, make their insight known, and build on this. Their empowerment, in turn, affords the opportunity to initiate, nurture, and sustain transformative action. I have not been deeply involved in any of the previously mentioned initiatives. In the next section, however, I describe how my involvement as a researcher straddling the Comit\u00e1n context and the U.S. academic realm yielded insightful findings and stakeholder engagement. 520 B. Merging formative research with participatory GIS mapping on elder health 1. Elder health survey data in standard table format Upon finishing the elder health and care survey (described in Chapter 5), I proceeded in the standard manner with data entry and statistical analysis in SPSS. I displayed all results as percentages in tables distinguishing men from women and local from national rates. Because of the extension of the data display document (hundreds of pages), I also created a summary document. I included both documents on a CD. I sent a dozen CDs to Chiapas to be distributed through CISC and CAIMAM to local health care providers and others interested in elder care. To exemplify this tabular display, Figure 11.1 illustrates the data display for a survey question about hypertension. The tables indicate percentages of elder men (in blue), elder women (in red), and the total elder sample (in violet) who indicated having been told that they have hypertension or high blood pressure. (All original data display and summary documents are in Spanish.) Figure 11.1. Standard hypertension survey data display. 521 2. Elder health survey data reworked into GIS maps Critically examining my own work, however, I realized that this method of sharing the data provoked neither individual engagement, nor group interaction. Around the time that I went back to the drawing board, Mark Nichter (my dissertation advisor) introduced me to a fellow anthropology graduate student, Ben McMahan. McMahan, he said, had a useful skill set: graduate background in medical anthropology and practical experience with GIS mapping. While commonly used in a more quantitatively oriented manner, GIS is a useful tool for analyzing how different patterns (e.g. behavior, ideas, disease) spread across the social and spatial landscape, that is, the interaction between local ideas and biologies. A foundational tenet is that where things are (happening) can be just as important as what things are (happening), as well as how things change in place over time. GIS data can be analyzed in various ways. In addition to the health statistics or proportions of people (usually presented in the form of percentages), we can observe where the units of analysis (individuals, diseases, etc.) are located and how they appear, disappear, cluster, and move over time. Additionally, the whole process - from assembling the constituting elements to subsequently analyzing data and applying findings - can be conducted in a participatory manner, such that stakeholders may design, direct, participate in, contribute to, and evaluate data collection, display, analysis, and application. In doing so, participants both make their individual/collective voices heard regarding local problems, and become invested in local problem solving. Below, I exemplify the process and products of the merger of participatory research and GIS mapping to address elder health in Comit\u00e1n by first showing examples of the maps 522 produced with elder health survey data, and then elaborating on the participatory nature of sharing such maps. McMahan and I met and decided to diverge from the standard survey display protocol. He suggested that, because I had maintained the data from each survey linked to each informant's neighborhood, we could enter this data into a GIS. The resulting maps provide visual clues and reveal patterns that are available, but less readily apparent, in tables. For instance, the map in Figure 11.2 displays data from the table in Figure 11.1, red dots for women with hypertension; blue dots, men, plotted over the city of Comit\u00e1n. Figure 11.2, Map, hypertension survey data display using GIS. 523 3. Participatory analysis of GIS maps on elder health in Comit\u00e1n We hoped these maps would help engage local people in evaluating survey results and catalyze local problem-solving initiatives. So, using a few basic GIS visualization tools, we developed a set of maps showing health and care data. McMahan traveled to Chiapas, where I arranged for him to meet with my colleagues. He shared the complete set of maps (i.e. these and others) with various stakeholders: CISC personnel (including those who helped design and conduct the surveys), two ECOSUR researchers who participated in the Encuentro, and health care providers in the CAIMAM working group. McMahan presented a prepared PowerPoint presentation as well as printed maps, and drew on the GIS database. He met with people individually and in groups. On one level, the maps were efficient ethnographic elicitors, evoking direct observations on the data presented. At a deeper level, however, the maps encouraged appropriation of the research products and process.75 To illustrate, I share four examples. a. Spatial extent and severity of pain, distance to sources of medication In Comit\u00e1n, chronic pain is not a focus of health services. Nevertheless, Figure 11.3 shows how widespread chronic pain is, much of it moderate and severe. When in pain, people want fast, convenient relief. So we plotted health care services, noting that elders live far from these services, and much closer to pharmacies, which are located within three blocks of every home, and supply medication instantly, without the hassle or cost of 75Chambers (1994) and Cornwall & Jewkes (1995) provide insightful reviews of the process, advantages, and challenges of participatory, community-based visualization of data. 524 a medical consult. Ben quoted from the survey that nearly 1 out of 4 elders surveyed self-medicates at least once a week, and 1 out of 10 does so over 3 times a week. This data illuminated the need to work with both clinics and pharmacies to address elders' pain. Figure 11.3, Map, spatial extent & severity of pain, distance to medication. Further, the maps challenged expectations. For example, participants did not anticipate the prominence of pain, and were struck by the distance between people and services. Maps, they said, also made the distribution of vulnerable groups clear. Even before our examples spelled out disproportionate health problems in the northeast quadrant of 525 Comit\u00e1n, one participant held the stacked maps up to the light to look for such clustering. At the same time, by looking at the outliers, participants noted negative cases, anomalies, and contradictions. They also appreciated the maps for demonstrating the severity or systematicity of certain problems, the maps showing how, rather than clustering, some health problems - like chronic pain - are endemic and spatially widespread. As ethnographic elicitors, then, participants asserted that visualizing a few variables was much better than exhaustive statistics and tables for exploring problems, envisioning solutions rooted in time and space, and conveying messages. b. Re-prioritization of health problems and potential for extra-clinical care Figures 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6 form a set of maps that layers different kinds of variables to suggest a re-prioritization of interventions. The map on the top left shows instances of diabetes and hypertension, the most commonly diagnosed diseases among elders in Comit\u00e1n, and those on which existing elder health services focus. The map on the top right plots cases of poor vision, hearing impairment, and dental problems, which are at least as common and limiting as diabetes and hypertension but not a focus of services. The map on the bottom shows elders with vision/hearing/dental problems, limited physical mobility, and no access to their own vehicle. Practitioners discussed how vision/hearing/dental problems affect the quality of everyday life and require specialized medical attention, but can often be screened for, diagnosed, and treated at home during easily pre-calendared home visits or a mobile clinic. 526 Figure 11.4, Map, diabetes and/or hypertension Figure 11.5, Map, vision/hearing/dental problems. Figure 11.6, Map, vision/hearing/dental problems, limited mobility, no car. 527 c. Formal diagnosis versus projected cases We used the next set of maps to compare current rates of disease to projected rates, and to emphasize the connections between many diseases and exposures rather than looking at just single exposure-disease pairs. The map in Figure 11.7 plots the relatively few elders with diagnosed respiratory illness (emphysema, tuberculosis, pneumonia). The map in Figure 11.8 shows these cases, plus those elders who had chronic cough and/or had smoked a pack or more of cigarettes a day. This map identifies elders who likely have, or will develop, respiratory illness, and should be monitored. Figure 11.7, Map, diagnosed cases of respiratory illness. Figure 11.8, Map, projected cases of respiratory illness. 528 d. Impact of infrastructure on production of health A final example. Participants, most trained as physicians, were much more accustomed to looking at individual-level data, such as a patient's chart. Looking at issues from a city-wide perspective offered a new orientation. Individual medical troubles became community problems. For instance, they were aware of health problems provoked by water quality and supply, but the maps encouraged discussion of wider societal issues. In response to this map, showing the 18% of elders without an indoor water faucet, participants discussed how the need to carry water made washing dishes and clothing, cooking, bathing, flushing toilets, and house cleaning difficult, and how, due to gendered nature of everyday tasks, water supply challenges women more than men. They pointed out to McMahan that the question of indoor versus outdoor faucets is moot because Comit\u00e1n's water supply is eternally limited, often non-existent, and that this is probably due more to politics than to the water table. They indicated on the map other influential factors: if you live along the PanAmerican highway or downhill from the mayor's house, you always have water. In the more recently settled outskirts of town, you never have water, etc. The hospital, perched on top of a hill, never has water and must rely on tanker trucks, an expensive solution. In this way, the maps triggered reflection on factors beyond the scope of the data presented. 529 City water tanks on hilltop Newer, perimeter barrios: never have water Mayor's street: always has water PanAmerican Highway: Hospital: always has water never has water Figure 11.9, Map and notes from discussion on water supply. 530 Figure 11.10, Photo, water storage. Figure 11.11, Photo, Comit\u00e1n's hilly terrain. 531 4. Participatory mapping as an ethnographic elicitor As ethnographic elicitors among participants, the maps inspired insightful observations about the data presented and an appreciation of value added by spatial information and visualization. People commented on how the maps facilitated exploration of problems, as well as envisioning solutions rooted in time and space. They asserted that visualization of a few variables seemed much more efficient for conveying a message than did exhaustive statistics and tables. For instance, a CAIMAM member said, \"These maps are very evocative and impressive. They really help describe the problem in a way that is easy to understand, much easier than a series of tables and statistics.\" Another noted, \"These maps could help us describe more effectively the problems we are working on, especially in places where there are fewer services.\" Presenting a sequence of maps which became successively more detailed was also deemed useful for considering multiple complementary and interrelated variables at once. Syndemics, or co-occurring problems, became apparent as well. As CISC's director explained while holding maps up to the light to see overlap, \"The visual display of the results helps to understand the interaction of the different diseases. We can't necessarily treat these as individual diseases, because clearly many interact with and affect each other.\" Georgina S\u00e1nchez, a demographer at ECOSUR and the colleague who worked on the elder masculinity index with me (see Chapter 8). similarly observed, \"I really like how the maps allow us to see how the data are distributed, especially the interaction between diseases. And also the gender differences that the data can demonstrate.\" 532 Further, the maps challenged participants' expectations. For example, people expected to see a relationship between the use of wood for cooking and respiratory ailments, yet were surprised to find that the dots did not evidence such a relationship. On the flip side, service providers did not anticipate pain as such a prominent problem, yet could not ignore the abundance of dots on the pain maps. 5. Participatory mapping for appropriation of research products and process Beyond eliciting reactions to the data on hand, the maps also spurred the appropriation of research process and products. This began with an altered nature of the researcher/informant dynamic. Rather than a vertical \"dumping\" of results, presenting the maps was a horizontal exchange, and sometimes even a vertical exchange with participants orienting the presenter, rather than the other way around. Presentation spawned lengthy discussion, as the maps encouraged people to share their knowledge and expertise, much aimed at increasing the accuracy and breadth of the map content. McMahan made it abundantly clear that he was there to share the maps with the idea that local people could contribute information in order to improve both the quality of the maps as well as the questions asked to produce such maps. This may be an important point to consider in the participatory research process, as maps can often be viewed as a technical result of an expert driven process, whereas our approach was to focus on the community-based nature of both the maps and the information that went into producing them. 533 Indeed, exposure to the maps also awakened informants' desire to pull in additional data in order to better address the problems at hand. Health service providers wanted to see the locations of water lines, transportation routes, pharmacies, and the topography of Comit\u00e1n overlaid with the survey variables. Rather than controlling for sex or residence, the maps inspired people to wonder about what is good for each sector of the population, and were motivated to study these subgroups and locations. For instance, Georgina S\u00e1nchez, an ECOSUR demographer dedicated to gender and health, requested maps distinguishing men from women, to visually evidence local women's plight. Additionally, CAIMAM participants noted that Comit\u00e1n extends far beyond the limits of the survey, and suggested that this swelling perimeter be added, with the conviction that people outside the central 2005 survey area would most likely be even more challenged by health problems, reduced mobility, and limited infrastructure. In this regard, a nurse from the General Hospital noted, \"Many come from the surrounding countryside when they have problems - so the hospital often has a higher percentage of morbidity and mortality than you might expect.\" Practitioners emphasized social structural factors as part of the cause of problems, which propelled them to consider political and judicial approaches to the remedies. Providers were able to recognize that their usual means of looking at data, for example in tables of statistics, has drawbacks. They began to insist on alternative routes of information and analysis. At the same time, participants provided McMahan with insight unavailable to analysts, for example, the information on garbage 534 disposal, air quality, and water supply. Their approaches were innovative and directly aimed at producing an impact on behavior and policy. Not only did the maps fuel desire for additional data regarding elder health, but they also inspired brainstorming about issues to address via GIS tools. Participants expressed a genuine curiosity about how the process works, the types of variables one could map, and how this might work in future endeavors. They began to talk among themselves about how this method might be implemented for other diseases/variables and other groups of stakeholders. For instance, various people suggested instituting an education-based prevention program, involving younger people in order to prevent hypertension and diabetes in old age. Asserting that prevention is more economical than treatment, they pointed out that maps might help communicate the risk involved, i.e. \"you will become one of these dots if you fail to do x (or if you keep doing y).\" Guadalupe Alvarez, the ECOSUR researcher who assumed the coordination of the CAIMAM working group, observed, Specifically, how do you think we can use the maps as part of research/interventions? They have to be more than just pictures of the data.... One of the big problems we have encountered is the lack of perception of risk in 'at-risk' communities and how this affects behavior and response to these risks. Maybe if we took maps and showed them to people to generate a sense of risk, this might be useful for motivating behavior... to make people think about diabetes. They are at high risk but they are unaware or ignorant of these risks. These maps might display visually what tables and statistics are often unable to convey. Further, participants realized that the maps could be used from the research planning stage. One CAIMAM participant asserted, 535 We should use maps to design our future studies to make sure that we accurately represent the entire region. Maps could be used in sample/research design as well as analysis. This way we would be sure to cover all the areas, especially the area to the northeast where lots of growth has occurred and is far away from most of the services. Participants also suggested using maps to keep track of progress and distributions of people visited and to visit. Participants went beyond suggesting variables and issues that might be mapped to considering the possibility of learning how to do GIS analysis themselves. Guadalupe Alvarez, for instance, asked, How easy is this to learn? Because this is a tool that would be very useful, especially if other researchers on the project were able to learn how to analyze and explore the data. If we were able to analyze our own data over time, we could think about new questions to ask with the data. And we could always be thinking about how our data might fit into the maps. They wanted to get involved, understand, and manipulate the technology. This is a real possibility, given that no high level GIS skills are required for basic map creation and manipulation. Much GIS work is based in conversion of non-GIS data into a usable format in order to then fill and maintain a database. Once the data is ready to be manipulated, anyone with intermediate computer skills can learn how to do the basics in a fairly short period of time. Key capabilities are then to ensure that the data that goes into generating the maps is not flawed and to develop an accurate interpretation of the maps. If local people acquired these skills, outsider researchers could then retreat into an advisory role, perhaps assisting via Internet between in-person support sessions, while local actors perform data collection and analysis. 536 The map presentation also piqued interest in merging with other local researchers and projects. Participants noted the existence of other local mapping efforts. Most, however, were conducted at the municipal and state levels, moving participants to realize that they could incorporate information from these larger-scale projects to contextualize local findings, and produce more locally-relevant information. In terms of specific projects that came to mind, CISC's director suggested the utility of GIS in studies already underway, such as one tracing HIV/AIDS among migrants from Guatemala through Chiapas to the US and visualizing women's risk as their husbands move back and forth. He had McMahan meet with the head of ECOSUR's GIS lab. A nurse at the General Hospital was excited about the possibility of drawing on the skills of and data collected by the Hospital's statisticians: \"You should really meet with the statistics people at the hospital. They might have some information that you could use with the maps, like where people are coming from and what sorts of problems they are experiencing.\" In general, participants were enthusiastic about presenting results in this format to a larger group of people. CISC director said encouragingly, \"I think it would be really important to present this information to some local leaders. This information could be really useful and I think that there should be a public presentation of this information.\" Even the possibility of sharing with the general public was touched on - either by public presentation (a suggestion during McMahan's visit to Comit\u00e1n), or via an Internet Map Server (IMS) or similarly organized site. 537 A final noteworthy instance of appropriation of the research process and products was the reaction of CISC personnel, among whom seeing the maps of the data they collected spurred satisfaction of a job well-done. Having participated in development of the survey questions as well as data collection, they were pleased with the visual demonstration of work completed. CISC's Director commended the work, These are really just representations of the information collected as part of the survey. In order to generate maps such as these, there is a lot of work that goes into data collection in order to have data that is possible to map.... So it's nice to see the outcome of the survey put into maps. There was a lot of work put into the survey, and these help to display the problems that we are dealing with. In sum, presentation of GIS maps was useful on a number of fronts - much more useful than presentation in tables. With the survey tables, information was transferred from the words of the informant to the paper, becoming personal and private. With visual sharing of the maps, all present could see, point to, discuss, and perhaps even manipulate and alter objects or representations. The presentation complemented other means of ethnographic elicitation (e.g. interviews and Encuentro) by inspiring participants to reflect on, question, debate, request, and share information. Because visualization is not a neutral language, interpretations varied, provoking rich discussion. The maps motivated people to explore, analyze, and represent their perspectives in their own terms. It motivated thinking about appropriate interventions, including prevention programs and risk communication. The learning is progressive. The information is visible, semi- permanent, and public. It was cross-checked, verified, amended, added to, and owned by the participants. Local people became analysts, engaged in this tangible, visual process 538 of presenting, sharing, adding and correcting information. The outsiders' role (McMahan) was to observe, assess, document, and support this process. Presenting the maps, documenting responses, and facilitating appropriation of the process and products reinforced the notion that the local perspective absolutely must be included, if not prioritized, to solve problems. Some individuals became engaged precisely because they could contribute to, challenge, improve, alter, and re-generate the maps. The success of the exercise also rested on McMahan as a presenter and myself as a facilitator of the broader process. The maps, then, were catalysts, encouraging community buy-in and increasing stakeholder social capital. Table 11.1 contrasts my first data display strategy - the CD of tables - with the participatory GIS data sharing. Table 11.1, Table data display versus participatory GIS data sharing modes.

Potential expansion of formative research-GIS map merger There was, however, room for improvement. The participatory component of this project relied heavily on the data gathering process and the presentation of the completed maps to community stakeholders. The intermediate stages of analysis and map construction were left to McMahan and myself as external researchers. However, the comments and criticisms received as part of the map presentation process is indicative of the way in which participatory elements could be included in the mapping and analysis stages as well, as part of the iterative nature of formative research. One could imagine a project in which the research design and data gathering stages are also an iterative negotiation involving local people's ideas and perspectives. The analysis and representation stage (using maps) could be similarly iterative and participatory - revised and modified on-the- fly based on the dialogue between all involved. Eventually, the final stage of data presentation and discussion could take place within a public context in which additional feedback and commentary might be recorded, thereby improving both the quality of the research and the community engagement in research process itself. For instance, local stakeholders could go on transect walks in Comit\u00e1n to guide research design; construct, embellish, and edit maps; present results to residents, etc. Spatial information might be combined with chronological information, such that series of maps can show locally- relevant trends and historical patterns, by week, season, year, generation, etc. Local people may take up the mapping technique and use the method for themselves, interpreting, applying, and adapting the method themselves. Their appropriation of the method is a true affirmation of local people as knowledgeable actors, and of researchers 540 as learners and facilitators. Further, maps made by different groups of stakeholders would likely evidence key contrasts in perspectives. Stepping back to gain even more perspective the participatory GIS mapping experience inspired questions regarding the relations of power between researchers and local people. McMahan reflected on his experience in sharing the maps: When Georgina S\u00e1nchez asked, \"is it possible to display the data based on gender differences?\" I was able to respond by modifying the data/display/representations/etc. Yet the dynamic went beyond requests from the participants and me manipulating the data in response. Some participants were very excited and energetic to discuss and interact with the maps. They picked them up, flipped through them, returned to previous maps to compare them, etc. This speaks to the methodology of the participatory research process. Although we have the technology to present the maps digitally, it makes sense to also make paper maps that are left with the participants. That way, viewing the maps is not centered on the technology of - and access to - the computer. Instead, the maps become property of the partner, to do with as they please, to return to other ideas, etc. The linear nature of a PowerPoint presentation is good for organizing a narrative for presentation to a group, but it limits the crucial ability of the group to interact and modify the order of discussion. The possibility of making the project overly-technological is certainly a risk. If we show up with computers and information, how do we convey this information to partners without dominating the process? This goes beyond a question of computer literacy, as most/all partners are computer literate to varying degrees. It is a question of expertise and how to convey that expertise (in this case GIS) without obfuscating the real reason of making the maps: to solve a problem. The issue is as much the interaction with the maps as it is the actual maps themselves. How do they help generate questions or lead to solutions of existing questions/problems? How do they spur on local involvement in a research process? How do they foreground problems and power relationships that might otherwise be in the background? (McMahan, B., Personal communication, 2007) 541 Reflections on Chapter 11 Formative research stage 3 calls for the generation of a list of intervention options via discussion with local stakeholders invited to reflect on problems, practicalities, and background data collected during previous stages. Stage 4 refers to fostering problem solving and critical assessment of a variety of possible intervention strategies among stakeholders. Stage 5 entails investigating and determining how best to implement promising interventions identified in the previous stages; specifically, \"Attention is directed toward identifying the best modality for conveying information, encouraging reflection, fostering problem solving, or changing behavior\" (Nichter et al. 2004: 1917). This chapter describes how I moved through these stages to set up a space for non- confrontational and honest dialogue between and among health care professionals. In this space, I aimed to sensitize providers about the lives of elders and what elders wanted in terms of health and well-being (e.g. water, transportation, income, pain control versus vaccination and diabetes checkups). I accomplished this with the help of colleagues via presenting the maps of the survey data. Providers accepted this in a non-confrontational way, and rather than contesting the maps, engaged with the maps and their colleagues to look the distribution of problems - some of which they had not anticipated. In doing so, providers added to their capital as concerned practitioners the capital of the science. Practitioners then began to discuss more detailed problem-solving regarding the practical details of operationalizing different interventions, such as a mobile clinic, community health workers, and a community center. The were able to think both upstream at matters of prevention, and downstream at distribution of patients, resources, and needs. Rather 542 than getting bogged down in the politics of critique and planning, the data, presented in this non-threatening way, became a springboard for them to address realities. This entailed first accepting that their assumptions regarding elders' needs and resources differed from the life experiences of most elders in this context, and that this intersects with realistic planning. Again, the interaction with the data was as important as the data itself in generating questions, foregrounding inequities, spurring local involvement in research, and leading to solutions. 543 CHAPTER 12. FOSTERING CONVERTIBLE CAPITAL VIA FORMATIVE RESEARCH Overview of Chapter 12 In this concluding chapter, I discuss how adopting the formative research framework and viewing elder health and care from a social capital perspective allowed me to overcome two shortcomings of community-based participatory research: the reification of community and the idealization of participation. Having made this adjustment to my research approach, I was better equipped to explore the resources (i.e. economic, cultural, and especially social capital) actually available to elders and to health care providers in Comit\u00e1n. In the process, I illuminated various misconceptions about elder entitlement and access to caring resources. Beyond pointing out elders' meager stocks of capital, the formative research included the generation of informed recommendations regarding how to foster convertible capital among elder health and care stakeholders in Comit\u00e1n. Finally, I reiterate my role in capital flow within the broad formative research process. 544 A. Overcoming reification of community and idealization of participation On many counts, the formative research process I embraced is in synch with the community-based participatory research (CBPR) models advocated by such health and development scholar-activists as Robert Chambers, Andrea Cornwall, and Rachel Jewkes. First, I engaged people in Comit\u00e1n in collectively reflecting on their world to assess and address their own priorities. By selecting issues that they wanted to address, I was able to validate their experiential knowledge and facilitate problem solving. At times, this meant that I had to postpone researching topics that interested me, employ methods that made sense to participants and/or were given high scientific status (e.g. GIS), and include variables that tested the preconceptions of participants. I learned from both the data collected and the response to data and methods used to collect and present it. While I became more educated about less anticipated issues (e.g. dental health and pharmacy roles) and alternate methods (e.g. the strategic meeting as source of data), participants acquired familiarity with (if not expertise in) research, data analysis, and problem-solving skills. As participants engaged in dialogue about elder health and care, each of us developed a critical awareness of emerging issues, the manner in which problems were interlinked, and the larger context affecting the social status of the elderly, family relations, and health system responses to community health. Finally, the project inspired action, with people in Comit\u00e1n sharing information with others, conducting interventions, and forging alliances. 545 In the spirit of CBPR, I sought to shift from the knowledge, categories, and values of outsider professionals to those of local people. For instance, I began with topics drawn from previous research and a literature review, but then shifted to issues identified by stakeholders during the ongoing process. I also attempted to move from individual to group interaction, for example switching from one-on-one interviews with providers to group discussions. In the group, overlapping spread of knowledge covered a wider field than that of any one member, and group work built up collective and creative enthusiasm, filled in gaps, added and crosschecked detail. Further, rather than extracting information, I hoped to empower people, increasingly assuming a convening and facilitating role myself, while encouraging stakeholders to became analysts and actors, especially clear in the Strategic Meeting. From the outset, however, I ran into practical and ethical issues that arose when I was forced to ask - repeatedly - Who is the community? Who wants to and is able to participate in the research? Who does this involvement empower? It also became clear that those who might participate in CBPR were likely to be those who were already more powerful - the better-off, elites, officials, local leaders, men, adults and the healthy, rather than the worse-off, the underclasses, the vulnerable, lay people, women, children, elders, and the sick. The formative research approach helped me to reveal such biases and take deliberate steps to offset them. By conducting a series of iterative activities, I was able to identify stakeholders and understand the relations of power between them, triangulate this data to reveal and correct misconceptions and gaps in real time, and 546 enrich research via the cumulative interaction of the various activities. With each successive activity conducted with different interest groups, I was able to highlight intra- community difference, exposing assumptions of consensus within \"the community.\" I quickly identified plural communities nested within the Comit\u00e1n \"community,\" including elders, home-based caregivers, health care providers, and NGO personnel. Soon, my work revealed frictions and factions within each group, with repercussions on both the research and on elder health and care. In Table 12.1, I paraphrase quotations from informants to exemplify rifts between communities and even within communities. Not only did I find \"the community\" to be multipartite, but \"participation\" also emerged as multifaceted and contested. Each stakeholder had a different notion of who should participate - and how they should participate, both in the formative research process and in elder care in general. For instance, one local practitioner referenced various groups of stakeholders within \"the community\" (researchers, elders, and providers), moving in different spaces (doctors' offices, elders' homes, the city, small towns), and participating in various ways (research, education, practice): Service providers should really be good researchers. They should get into research and practice, because the truth is that they're there in the office and instead of reading the mountain of books they have, they've got the TV on. What can the television teach them? Nothing! What can they teach others when they're asked to go into a community? ... [Health care providers] should be willing to go out on official campaigns and do home visits with elders and their families, here in the city as well as outside it.... Home visits would serve not only geriatricians, but also physicians in general, as they would develop closer, more trusting relationships with people. When practitioners don't ever leave their offices, this creates a barrier. Moving from office to homes is something else entirely.... It would mean taking health and knowledge into people's homes. Now that would be something different! 547 Table 12.1, Perspectives exemplifying plurality within \"the community.\" Elders Caregivers Providers State CISC Elders Elder woman: Some who get public assistance shouldn't; they're not even as old or as poor as I am. Caregivers Elder woman: My kids forget about me. They don't visit me unless I'm dying. Woman's son: My mother wants me to come over for every little pain. Caregiving daughter: When my father drinks, he stops caring for my mother and I have to step in. Caregiving husband: My wife feels best when my daughter cares for her. Providers Elder woman: The doctors didn't figure out what I had until it was too late. Doctor: Elders don't come in for diagnostic testing or preventive care. Doctor: Families just drop elders off at the hospital and never come back. Caregiver: The doctor doesn't cure my mother, he just prescribes pills when the pain flares up. Provider: Some doctors only want to make money in private practice. Provider: The institution doesn't pay much, plus I have uninsured patients, so I see them on the side. State Elder man: The clinic pharmacy doesn't stock my medication, so I have to buy it at the pharmacy. Clinical director: Elders need to be educated about medication. They skip doses, or self- prescribe and over-medicate. Caregiver: When my father was sent to the hospital in Mexico City, I had to pay my own way to take care of him. Clinical director: If an elder needs tertiary care, we pay to send them by ambulance to Mexico City. Provider: The SSA sends us norms for treatment, but they don't give us the time, equipment, or resources to put them into effect. Clinical director: The staff really needs to be trained in preferential treatment for elders. Clinical Director: This clinic is here to give elders the care they need, and we can help with anything, as long as we don't spend the institution's money. CISC CISC researcher: We focus on vulnerable populations, but we've never studied elders. Elder man: What are you going to do for us? Caretaker: I'm just as sick as my elderly father, so what about interviewing me? CISC surveyor: I'm sorry, but we can only survey one person per household. Provider: CISC should help us. CISC Director: CISC has no funding for an elder care project. Clinical Director: CISC can get the money from international foundations to train our doctors. CISC Director: We don't want the state to slack off when we step in. CISC Director: Elder health is very important to us, but this project is not funded, so CISC can't prioritize it. 548 Formative research gave me the freedom to engage people in participating in a variety of strategies, quantitative and qualitative, individual and group, research and practice, in different ways at different stages. The iterative spiral of informing/becoming informed, planning, acting, evaluating, reflecting, and developing theory diversified the nature of participation. For instance, health care providers participated as educators in the Encuentro, as informants in the interviews, as analysts in the GIS session, and as leaders in the working group. The cyclical formative-reformative dynamic allowed for monitoring stakeholders' responses and then facilitating mid-course correction, as exemplified in the case of the media evaluation. In sum, the formative research model was fruitful because it is open to a critical questioning of \"community\" and an inclusive concept of \"participation.\" Taking the inequitable relations and tentative, ever-evolving participation among myriad stakeholders as a givens (rather than confounding factors to be controlled for) paved the way for me to explore, in much the same way, the resources actually available to elders and to health care providers in this context, and to generate informed recommendations regarding how to foster capital among elder care stakeholders in Comit\u00e1n. 549 B. Exploring the availability of care capital among elders and providers Below, I first explore the availability of resources - \"care capital\" - among elders and then among health care providers, the two main groups of stakeholders with whom I have worked so far. 1. Care capital among elders a. Elders' economic capital Research affirmed that the general characterization of Chiapas as \"a rich land, a poor people\" applies to Comit\u00e1n as well, and is especially appropriate for most of the elder participants. Elders had obvious shortfalls in economic capital, i.e. that which is \"immediately and directly convertible into money and may be institutionalized in the form of property rights\" (Bourdieu 1986:47). Most had worked their entire lives, many in agriculture, yet their stores of economic capital were meager or non-existent, as few had steady income, property (from land down to appliances), or savings. Most had started poor and remained so, while others had seen declines in prosperity due to the global, national, and regional events described in Chapter 1. Elders, then, entered their later years without economic capital for their care needs. b. Elders' cultural capital Elders' cultural capital was also severely limited. Their dwindling embodied cultural capital, or \"long-lasting dispositions of the mind and body\" (Bourdieu 1986:47), was reflected in debilitated bodies and failing memories. Most elders' homes had scant stores 550 of cultural capital objectified in cultural goods, such as books and machines. Nor did elders have much institutionalized cultural capital, apparent, for instance, in very low levels of formal education and in their inability to maneuver in the highly bureaucratized government social and health care systems. c. Elders' social capital It was obvious that elders' had scant economic and cultural capital. This shortfall in turn placed a premium on social capital. Social capital, however, is less easily detected and assessed via quantitative research than are economic and cultural capital. Formative research proved especially fruitful in revealing the nuances of social capital in this context, primarily in exposing misconceptions about the assumed existence of social capital among and between elders and those with a stake in their care. Below, I draw on the bonding/bridging/linking categorization of social capital to structure a characterization of elders' illusive social capital stocks. Bonding social capital is a characteristic of existing relations, or ties within one's group or between individuals of similar demographic characteristics. These are usually closely- knit groups of people who know each other and are very similar to one another, such as close family members (Green & Haines 2002, McLean et.al. 2002, Warren et.al. 2001). Policymakers frequently assume the existence of bonding social capital hoped to ensure elder health and care. Bonding relationships are expected between: elders and their 551 spouse, their children (-in-law), other household members, and non-household members. Research revealed that, in Comit\u00e1n, these bonding relationships are tenuous, at best. Elder-spouse: It used to be that elders had and could rely on their spouse for care during old age. In this current generation, however, many elders were single, due to divorce, separation, or widowhood. Being partner-less was much more common among elder women, as men who lost a spouse were more likely to remarry than were women. Further, women who did have a husband could not automatically count on him for care during elder years. On the contrary, many women endured abusive relationships, far from the caring, trusting interaction that they needed. Some marital relationships were so unsatisfactory that widowed and separated women were relieved to be on their own, even if this entailed financial hardship. While the social capital and health literature lauds marriage as a positive influence on elder health, its relevance among the many single elders and impact among elder women are questionable in this context. Elder-children (-in-law): Traditionally, elders in the region had many children on whom they could later rely for elder care. This study, however, revealed that a number of elders had very few children. Even those with many children did not necessarily enjoy their offspring's support during their senescence. Many elders did not live with their children, and complained that their children did not visit them enough or care about their health. Others lived with children but felt alone anyway. For elder women, adult children's support often came at the cost of being expected or required to do housework, tend a 552 front-room store, and/or care for grandchildren, a contingency not placed on men. Further, some elders gained access to health insurance through their employed children, thus making them dependent on their children for enrollment and continued beneficiary status. Additionally, those few elders who had savings and property may have been pressured to pass this on to their children without being able to predict their longevity and future need for health care resources. In this case, preparing for future health contingencies may have been constrained rather than facilitated by social ties. Some informants, for instance, had long ago signed over deeds to their home and property to their children. Without control over these resources, these elders depended on their children to provide housing, food, care, and money to cover health care expenses. The children, with control over the resources, assumed a position of increased power over decisions related to their parent's health and care. Even those elders lucky enough to have a spouse or child as a home-based caregiver could not count on these individuals for sustained support, as caregivers had virtually no training, psychological support, or recognition for their caring activities, such that they easily became burned out. Elder women's relationships with their spouse and children - traditionally posited as horizontal familial ties - were in fact quite hierarchical, producing more negative than positive social capital, with poorer health as the net result. Further, for women, gaining social capital via having a spouse or adult children may come at the expense of accepting generation- and gender-based subordination in the form of conforming to desires of their spouse and children. Another gendered impact of changes in family structure and 553 household power dynamic is that women in Chiapas used to derive assistance, power, respect from being a mother-in-law. Today , however, courtship and marital strategies are evolving, such that daughters-in-law may now elope, relocate far away, or simply be independent of family. Elder-other household members: In addition to spouse and children, elders often used to live with other people in multi-generational, multi-resident homes. With demographic transition, however, there has been a shift to a \"beanpole\" family structure, with various generations in the home, but fewer and fewer members in any one generation. Many elders in Comit\u00e1n lived alone or with just one or two other people, rather than in the burgeoning multi-resident home common of the past. This reduction in household size was a product of people having fewer children and grandchildren, increased labor out- migration, and loosening of customs such as those requiring young couples to live at home for the first years of marriage. Thus elders are now less likely to have daughters- and sons-in law and other extended relatives living with them at home. My research does not sustain the idealistic notion that the household is a harmonious space in which interests coincide and well-being of each family member is integrated into an equitable umbrella of family well-being. In reality, elders' households were sites of competition and collaboration in which certain members' well-being and needs were prioritized, and resources and power were distributed unequally along generational, gender, and status lines. At the very least, elders' households were sites of \"cooperative 554 conflict,\" which cannot be treated as a unit of altruistic decision-making and care for elders in their later years. Elder-non-household members: Beyond elders' households, elders may have had friends and acquaintances, but they did not rely on non-household members for health care resources. Perhaps a friend would drop by with some sweet bread or herbal tea once in a while. Maybe a neighbor would help them up carry a grocery bag or step up from the street to the sidewalk. An acquaintance might inquire about an elder's health. But this was the limit. Non-household members did not often pull up the slack in regular elder health care or support. Further, the ties that elders did have with friends and relatives were not automatically healthy. Women seemed to be more burdened than men by these relationships, as they had to reciprocate in response to the support that they were given. For their part, men's acquaintances were all too often other men with whom they got together to drink. Bridging social capital facilitates new relationships with people holding about as much power, but located outside of one's social circle (Green & Haines 2002, McLean et.al. 2002, Warren et.al. 2001). Bridging relationships between unrelated/unfamiliar elders are frequently assumed to exist and expected to benefit elder health and care, as well. Elder-unrelated/unfamiliar elder: The great majority of elders in Comit\u00e1n had either lived in very rural communities and then moved to Comit\u00e1n, or had resided in Comit\u00e1n 555 all their lives. Their youth in small villages and/or their sedentary residence in Comit\u00e1n limited their contact with unrelated and unfamiliar elders. Further, elders in Comit\u00e1n were not at all organized in elder-specific groups. The most common situations in which elders found themselves among other unrelated/unfamiliar elders were, among women, church congregations and, among men, Alcoholics Anonymous chapters. These groups, however, were not elder-specific and were fairly insular, with few newcomers. For the most part, elders were seldom exposed to other unrelated/unfamiliar elders, and those who they might have met most likely were just as depleted of resources such that there was little caring capital to be gained from these relationships. This is in sharp contrast to elders in the United States, for example, who may often make new elder acquaintances when moving from place to place, among the residents of their group retirement homes, and via their participation in groups such as the AARP and interest clubs (reading, film, exercise/sport). Linking social capital consists of connections that span differences in power, such as between people and local organizations (Green & Haines 2002, McLean et.al. 2002, Warren et.al. 2001). Linking relationships assumed to exist and expected to benefit elder health and care include those between elders and their employers, and between elders and providers and their overarching health institutions. Elder-employer: Elsewhere, elders may be able to draw on their relationships with their employers or former employers for information, insurance and retirement benefits, and 556 perhaps even monetary support in health crises. In Comit\u00e1n, however, many elders had spent the bulk of their lives self-employed as farmers, masons, cooks, etc. These elders never had direct access to employment-based insurance and retirement benefits. Given the frequent political party changes, even men with blue collar government jobs probably had a series of short-term employers, rather than one with whom they worked over a long period of time. Some of the many women who worked as domestic servants may have developed lasting ties with their employers or their charges, but many described these relationships as abusive, driving them from household to household. The types of work in which elders engaged limited elders to short-term relationships with each employer, and to employers with circumscribed stocks of resources they could or would be willing to bestow on their employees. Elder-health and social service institutions: Decades ago, Mexicans were able to rely on minimal state services for care, yet even these bare basics were no longer available, given the downfall of the health care system since the debt crisis (see Chapters 1 and 3). Further, many elder participants were mistrustful of the state and its local projects. Elders both voiced their wariness of practitioners and voted with their feet by not consulting a physician even when they thought they had a major health problem. For instance, while interested in Popular Insurance program (see Chapter 3), elders were extremely skeptical that it would work, given the failure of the government to cover their expenses in the past. Some painted it as a scam. Those who were better off financially, with insurance coverage, had slightly more faith in the government clinics. Yet even they 557 had plenty of experiences that legitimated distrust of public aid. Paperwork and charts were misplaced. Insurance supposed to cover everything did not. Necessary medication was out of stock. Promised social welfare funds suddenly ceased to arrive. Fragmentation of services was problematic for elders, who needed to establish and maintain rapport and orientation to ensure treatment compliance and continuity, especially for the chronic diseases that plagued them. The bureaucracy for accessing and paying for services seemed to elders a quagmire. Further, in Chapters 7 and 9, I note that elders deemed doctor-patient interaction as unsatisfactory, and I suggest that this is due in part to the social distance arising from class distinctions and spatial segregation between poorer elders and upper class practitioners. Elders feel - literally - the differential treatment they get in the health care system based on their lower social, cultural, and economic status. 2. Care capital among health care providers Providers had larger stocks of economic and cultural capital than did their elder patients. However, practitioners' social capital had limits. Those who shape health policy take for granted bonding relationships among health care providers, especially among professionals within the same health care institution. Policymakers assume that providers have colleagues upon whom they can trust and rely for information and back-up. In this study, however, physicians were unconvinced of their peers' knowledge of elder care, wary of their colleagues' intentions and commitment to elders, and critical of providers' loyalty to their own private practices. 558 Linking relationships are also assumed to exist (and expected to benefit elder health and care) between practitioners and their employing institutions, as well as state policymakers. Logically, providers should be able to count on their employing institutions, yet this was far from the case in this context. Throughout the clinical echelons, from nurses and social workers to physicians and directors, personnel said that they did not feel that institutions supported them in their efforts to tend to elder health. Instead, providers were forced to follow national norms that they felt were inappropriate for the local context. They were also supposed to comply with national mandates without being provided with what they deemed necessary and appropriate resources, such as time, personnel, space, equipment, training, and medication. For instance, the ISSTECH Director, running a clinic for elders, essentially said that the State encourages her clinic to, \"do as much as possible for elders, as long as it does not cost the ISSTECH anything.\" 3. Low stocks of social capital In sum, while experiencing many of the same problems facing elders in the rest of Mexico and the world, elders in Comit\u00e1n - especially women - confronted these problems from a disadvantaged position. In this context, the social capital (resources attached to relationships) that has historically facilitated and is frequently assumed to facilitate elder well-being has deteriorated over elders' lifetimes, so that although elders may have extensive social networks, day-to-day and long-term support is now tenuous. In the past, elders could count on caring resources from a support network including their 559 spouse, children, other household members, and the state. Today, this is rarely the case. In contrast to assumptions and hopes, elders could not count on home-based support, neighborhood or wider therapy management groups, cash reserves, or cultural capital in the form of respect for elders. Nor could elders rely on the state's fragmented medical system or its employees to fulfill their needs. The gap between elders' needs and their capital to fulfill these needs has grown due to the historical contexts and personal factors. In terms of personal factors, elders' social capital declined over the past few decades, and was increasingly threatened as individuals aged and lost their spouse and even some adult children; as they were less able to reciprocate via housework, childcare, and store- tending; as they worked less and therefore had a diminishing income; as the state became less forthcoming with services; and as they confronted one or more health problems that required ongoing investment of resources. Influential historical factors include the reduction in state resources due to structural adjustment; demographic trends like lower fertility and migration; and broad shifts in gender and generational roles, such as women working full-time in the formal sector. This review of capital among elders and health care providers especially underscores the tenuous existence or complete lack of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital between elders, practitioners, and the state, and how generalized economic constraints brought on by Neoliberalism ever circumscribes elder care resources. The modes that gave elders social capital before (such as farming, a large family, being a mother-in-law) had lost much of their exchange value. The most marginalized - in this case poor elderly 560 women - had disproportionately low stocks of capital. Non-existent, decaying, and delicate social relationships were especially detrimental for them, as they began with less economic and cultural capital which, for more wealthy and/or male elders, could be used to purchase caring goods and services (such as transportation to and from health services, home remedies and medication, and home health care). Further, women were more likely to mention social capital in a negative light, as in their complaints about the burden of commitments to children and grandchildren, and their fear of gossip, so strong that it prevented some elder women from visiting a doctor even when they suspected a serious health problem. 4. Two illustrative cases Below, I detail elders' lives in two different households to highlight and further illustrate the confluence of health and social inequities discussed in this dissertation. The first narrative, about Do\u00f1a Paty and Don Ruben, details how Do\u00f1a Paty's health was failing, yet she had not received the health care she needed, and her life had been one long bout of suffering due to a marriage turned sour by alcoholism and violence, bittersweet interdependence with her children, unprofitable work in domestic service and food sales, and life with few amenities. Do\u00f1a Paty and Don Ruben: \"Alone all my life\" Do\u00f1a Paty, a 56 year-old woman (265) showed me into her front room, containing just a wooden table covered by a Christmas print tablecloth and a few wooden chairs, nothing more. Perhaps noting my curious glance around the room, do\u00f1a Paty explained that the house was so stark because they had to sell most of their few belongings. \"My parents were very poor, so I never went to school, not even one day. I helped my mother at home, and as a teenager began working as a 561 servant, cleaning, washing, ironing. I've done that ever since.\" She also made chalupas (tostadas with beans, pork, cheese, and pickled vegetables) and sold them in her doorway on weekend evenings. Her street was not heavily traveled though, and she wondered whether she came out ahead. She had the same doubt about housecleaning. Do\u00f1a Paty had four children. She cared for her daughters-in-law following the births of her grandchildren, for whom she babysat quite a bit, while her children contributed what they could to keep do\u00f1a Paty's household (do\u00f1a Paty, her husband, and their youngest [15 year-old] daughter) afloat. Despite having family around, do\u00f1a Paty maintained, \"I have felt alone all my life.\" She was almost always depressed; only her children raised her spirits, but they also filled her with sadness and guilt. Most recently, she lamented that her youngest daughter had been forced to follow in her footsteps, leaving school to work as a maid. Figure 12.1, Photo, pickled vegetables for sale in a front room. \"My husband (296) began drinking about 20 years ago. He drinks a lot, he yells at me, and he's very aggressive. I used to drink, too. I think I was even an alcoholic, because I sort of kept my husband company. I drank a lot, maybe half a liter of that liquor they make in Tzimol, almost every day. It all started when my mom passed away. It was just too much for me.\" Tears ran down her face, \"I still walk up to the cemetery to visit her grave.\" Do\u00f1a Paty now seldom drank, but her husband continued to drink and smoke a lot. He had also stopped working. He had been a mason, and she was proud that he built their house. Now he never gave her a cent and he ran up debts, which they had covered at times by selling their possessions. Their only appliance was a 562 television, and her husband dictated when it was on, who watched it, and what they would watch. He controlled many other aspects of their home life. He turned out the lights early. He broke the radio so that they would not listen to music. He no longer ate his meals with the family. He did not let his daughter go out and was always \"hovering\" over her. He did not let do\u00f1a Paty make her own decisions, and did not value her work. He had, in effect, extinguished life and happiness at home. She stopped sleeping with him two years ago, and wanted to kick him out of the house, but had been unable to figure out how. Since the onset of her husband's drinking, she had suffered from high blood pressure and severe headaches, \"But I don't have any money to go see a doctor or pay for medicine, so I just try to get out of the house or shower to cool off.\" Don Ruben had also limited Do\u00f1a Paty's opportunities to socialize with relatives, friends, and neighbors. None liked to be around when he was around, and he discouraged Do\u00f1a Paty from going out to visit other, and even from chatting with neighbors in her own doorway. Do\u00f1a Paty asked that I return to visit again, and I did. As I neared the house, I heard her husband, don Ruben, yelling at their dogs. I knocked hesitantly. Do\u00f1a Paty ushered me in and quietly explained, \"He hasn't drunk for a week, but his character is just as ugly. It's almost worse than when he's drunk because when he's sober he doesn't sleep and he bothers me and my daughter all the time.\" Nevertheless, don Ruben did sit and talk with us. After describing his forty years as a mason, carpenter, and electrician, he \"retired\" eight years ago. He admitted he often drank bottles of alcohol in a day, but asserted that he cut his pack-a-day smoking habit down to two cigarettes a day since he began feeling ill. \"My health is as low as the ground,\" asserted don Ruben. He suffered from hypertension, heart and breathing problems, diabetes, knee pain, stomach discomfort, weight loss, insomnia, hallucinations, and memory loss. Everyday, he took over-the- counter pills from the pharmacy, in addition to prescribed medication. Don Ruben described the government as a scam, and the clinics as good for nothing. Both Do\u00f1a Paty scolded him for not working and worse. \"He has no problem managing his money; he doesn't have any!\" his wife quipped with an edge in her voice. Yet she and their older children paid for don Ruben's food and medical expenses, and he most likely diverted some of their resources to cover his alcohol and cigarettes. Don Fernando and Do\u00f1a Lolita were older and poorer, yet seemingly happier than were Do\u00f1a Paty and Don Ruben. They felt lucky to have each other and a few close relatives on whom they relied as they faced health problems typical for their advanced age, with meager economic and cultural capital. 563 Don Fernando & Do\u00f1a Lolita: \"2 or 3 tortillas, that's all we have\" Don Fernando (033), the veteran of the informants at 105 years old, was quite wan and hunched over, his 85 year-old wife (034), do\u00f1a Lolita, was just as slight. I found the two at, literally, the bottom of town, on the edge of the eastern side of the city, living off a path so muddy and deeply rutted, that surely no public transportation passed their door. Don Fernando and Do\u00f1a Lolita had grown up in the same Tojolabal farming community about an hour outside of Comit\u00e1n. For many years before and after the marriage that their families had arranged, they farmed corn and beans. Neither had ever been to school. \"There was no school,\" Don Fernando chuckled. Neither had learned to read or write. It was a hard life, they said, even dangerous. In a farming accident, Don Fernando's head had been slashed with a machete. Do\u00f1a Lolita's glance was downcast as Don Fernando said that they had 7 children, but only 6 still lived. When his wife mentioned that he had been an alcoholic, Don Fernando was equally silent until she recounted convincing him to join an Evangelical church, upon which he stopped drinking. In the early 1970s, their sons became disillusioned with agriculture and decided to try their luck as manual laborers in Comit\u00e1n. Without help on the farm, the couple followed their children to \"the city.\" In Comit\u00e1n, they could no longer support themselves without land, literacy, or even Spanish language skills. Instead, they came to depend on their adult children in exchange for help around the house and with the grandchildren. The couple lived in a one-room clapboard structure with dirt floors and a hearth in one corner. Do\u00f1a Lolita still cooked all of their simple meals over wood on her knee-high hearth. She boiled corn before grinding it up to make tortillas by hand. Her husband admitted that she had often burned herself, and that the smoke from the fire had taken its toll on her vision. The combination her failing eyesight, a widespread symptom of aging, and the poverty that deprived her of both vision care and a gas stove put Do\u00f1a Lolita at heightened risk for burns and vision problems. The couple used a toilet in an outhouse next to their house that they had to flush out with a bucket of water from the water tank, next to the wash basin, where Do\u00f1a Lolita still washed their threadbare clothing. An extension cord powered a single light bulb dangling from the rafters. The cord ran from next-door, where their grandson and his family occupied a larger brick home with a cement floor, gas stove, and television. Occasionally, their son (the grandson's father) and his family would stop by to watch a soccer game and share a meal, but for the most part, their children and grandchildren were now absorbed by life elsewhere. In much the same way that age and economy combined to expose his wife to health risks, Don Fernando's daily trips to the market illustrate the same problem. With little money, no refrigerator, and no means other than foot to carry groceries, 564 Don Fernando had to make frequent, energy-demanding trips to market, where he would have to pay higher prices for small quantities of spoilable food. To do their shopping, he told me he had to walk a mile and a half uphill to the market, which I did not believe until I saw him striding back home one day. He held a walking stick in one hand, had a woven Tojolabal satchel over his shoulder, his two mutts on his heels. It was clear that Don Fernando was very much in love with his wife, dedicating himself to caring for her and keeping her company. He thought it was unfair that she was so much younger but so much worse off physically, and he described to me how hard and fast she used to work on their farm and praised her for continuing to do their housework. He spoke of his wife in an animated and endearing way and worried aloud about her deteriorating health, functional difficulties, and failing vision. Do\u00f1a Lolita nodded with a barely perceptible smile on her lips. The couple's scant diet was compounded by their nearly toothless mouths, which prevented them from chewing much more than soft tortillas and boiled beans. In addition to her vision problems, Do\u00f1a Lolita also had itchy feet, headaches, pain in her neck and extremities. When walking, she needed a broomstick to support her and to avoid tripping. Because of her eyesight, though, she rarely left home, even to go to church. Don Fernando, too, suffered from chronic pain in his waist, neck, and knees. He had grudgingly gone to the Health Center a few times over the past year, but \"only when I feel like my blood pressure is high.\" On the other hand, both elders had self-medicated with pills from a nearby pharmacy more than he could count. Neither had been hospitalized recently. Neither had any health insurance, and would only consider going to the hospital in a major health emergency. Their nearby grandson had the most sway over their health-related decisions, as he held the purse strings. Until 4 or 5 months before I met them, the couple had received minimal financial support and free medication from the DIF. They were baffled at their last visit when they were told that they were no longer eligible for the cash. They expressed gratitude to their children and grandchildren for the help they provided. Despite this patchwork of assistance, they were visibly needy and openly lamented lack of money and food. Don Fernando said that they never had enough food, \"2 or 3 tortillas, that's all.\" When I asked about wanting to gain weight, he said, \"sure, but what am I going to eat?!\" 565 5. Social network does not guarantee support network I have presented these narratives at some length to make a central point. Although elders may know many people, their day-to-day and long-term support was fragile; one must not conflate one's social network for one's support network and safety net. As Bourdieu observes, the volume of capital possessed by an individual depends on the size of the network of social connections s/he can effectively mobilize and on the volume of the capital (economic, cultural, or symbolic) possessed by each of those to whom s/he is connected (Bourdieu 1986). In other words, elders' capital rests on the number of connections they have, the resources those individuals have, and their own ability to elicit these resources in exchange for their own. Social capital alone, then, is insufficient to guarantee well-being, unless it can be exchanged for other resources, such as food, lodging, medication, and medical treatment. This creates a challenge in Comit\u00e1n, because, while caring resources rest on access to all types of capital via resourced others, in this context, deeply embedded and widespread structural inequality segregate the rich from the poor, and limit the convertibility of elders' social capital into caring capital. Poor health among elders may result less from a lack of connections and more from a lack of access to resources among the members of their social network. Thus, rather than focusing solely on strengthening social capital, the goal of interventions should be to inject and redistribute capital in ways that favor elder well-being. 566 C. Fostering convertible capital among elder health and care stakeholders 1. Fostering capital among elders In the past, elder Chiapanecos were able to convert capital derived from having children, farming, working at a handcraft, collaborating on community projects, etc. for care in old age. For elders in Comit\u00e1n, this is no longer the case. The challenge, then, is to fortify elders' capital - economic, cultural, social - in its own right, and also so that elders can convert it to needed caring resources. Additionally, capital that providers might once have counted on - state investment in infrastructure, salaries, etc. - had also withered, leaving their capital needs unsatisfied, as well. Fostering capital among elders began with the initial steps of this research. The Encuentro, as the first local public forum on elder health and care, brought attention to the health of the elderly as an urgent and deserving focus of community efforts. The media coverage - radio press releases and newspaper articles - affirmed elders' entitlement to quality care. The building of cultural capital continued with the surveys and interviews. Inviting elders to talk about their experiences allowed them the opportunity to correct societal misconceptions about the nature of their problems and the care they need and desire. The findings highlight the potential of equipping elders with cultural capital in the form of knowledge of how to access care resources and maneuver though the bureaucratic, health, and social service systems. Promoting the literacy (literal and figurative) necessary to fill out forms, to navigate the insurance maze, and to understand the pharmaceutical realm may be key means of boosting elders' cultural 567 capital. I aspire to return the aggregate findings to the elders (perhaps via television and radio), and invite them to generate and reflect on options for intervention. This exercise would entail establishing linking relationships with the providers and policymakers with whom they would share the podium and bargaining table. Eventually, however, elders must be voiced beyond the data that represents them. Fostering the development of solid elder interest groups requires time to set up a structure and space in which elders can be collaborators in the design and implementation of interventions and policy. We might begin with the few existing groups mentioned by elders as supportive - Alcoholics Anonymous and religious organizations - which might be convinced to cater certain events, activities, and services to elders in exchange for increasing membership. In the context of such groups, elders may work together to frame themselves as an interest group with commercial value. Vendors of medication, diapers, eyeglasses, etc. may be persuaded to offer special deals as they pursue the business of elder consumer bloc. Elders may build their relationships with policymakers by stressing not only that they are a legitimate justification for increased federal and state funding, but also their potential political clout as a powerful voting constituency. None of these suggestions is risk-free; all must be carefully assessed and planned. For instance, service providers suggested the development of a cadre of elders who provide elder community health care. This is another possible means of fostering bridging relationships between unrelated elders and linking relationships between elders, practitioners, and institutions. There are potential risks, of which I will mention three. 568 First, if we invite elder women to form a brigade of elder caregivers, we might position them in caring roles that subject them to pressures similar to those placed on them by relatives who expect them to care for their husband and grandchildren. To avoid this pitfall, the community health worker position would have to bestow on women other kinds of cultural and economic capital, such as institutional training, recognition, and incentives. Second, if elders are trained to provide limited support to other elders - for instance physical therapy, review of medication, identification of symptoms, referral to services - there is a risk of over-burdening them with responsibility that should be physicians'. An adequate back-up system of professionally-trained practitioners must be developed first. Third, simply tying excluded elders to other excluded elders would increase elder isolation and segregation; elders must be able to form connections with others having larger stocks of capital, via bridging and linking relationships. 2. Fostering capital among providers While Comit\u00e1n's elders are clearly in need of an injection of capital, a systems assessment points to the need for fostering convertible capital in the health care structure, as well. Again, the formative research may have started to generate capital among health care providers. I sparked bonding capital among them in creating an interest group around elder care, in which practitioners can interlink networks, develop a common language, and do constructive thinking together. The research process and product also offer opportunities for providers to develop bridging capital with other local players, including business-people, laboratory and pharmacy staff, legal and social service 569 providers. Further, the data and their involvement gives them a platform on which to engage institutional higher-ups and policymakers in linking relationships. In dedicating themselves to elder care research and intervention, these professionals have an opportunity to accumulate capital. Providers, who are largely upper-middle class, could be motivated by the potential of earning a valuable moral identity by serving marginalized elders. Those more oriented by profit would likely appreciate invitations to train others, press exposure, and grant opportunities. For those with political aspirations, involvement brings opportunities for leadership roles, media air time, and public acknowledgement in the form of awards, diplomas, and certificates bestowing recognition as elder health specialists. Finally, those providers to whom educational credentials are important may welcome continuing education credit and opportunities for writing theses on elder care issues. In each case, the more they do, the more capital they reap. A risk here, however, is that because providers are embedded in existing power structures (in that they were trained and paid by large, national institutions), they may encourage dominant norms in order to secure funding, gain legitimacy, and participate effectively in bureaucracy. Thus the importance of: a) being attentive to the representativeness of the participating providers to insure that group identity and power over decision-making are not concentrated in the hands of a few spokespeople who speak on behalf of their entire group, silence dissent from more marginal voices (for instance alternative care 570 providers); b) fostering an understanding among providers of elders' real life conditions, health problems, and care needs (for instance explaining that what providers have labeled as 'non-compliance' is really elders' strategizing in the face of limited options); and c) working simultaneously to make providers more thoroughly part of the communities they serve (e.g. via home visits) while incorporating elders more thoroughly in the state apparatus (e.g. via making elders voting members of health service review and planning panels). Figure 12.2, Photo, proposing strategies. Figure 12.3, Photo, negotiating strategies. 3. Fostering capital among state institutions Fostering convertible capital in state institutions would best be aimed at offering the government cultural and social capital in exchange for state infusion of economic capital into the cash-poor segments of the Comit\u00e1n context. The data from this research can help to guide policymakers in a reprioritization of health problems in which elder well-being is deemed urgent, and then to orient the redistribution of existing resources and the search for additional resources to attend to elder care. In some cases, it is not a question of 571 finding new resources, but of using existing capital most efficiently. For instance, a clinical director complained that his institution maintained a surplus of birth control pills, while there was an eternal shortage of hypertension medication. Adjusting details such as this does not require additional economic capital, but instead requires knowledge and pressure, and conduits through which these may flow. Local health service administrators, often practitioners themselves, are ideally positioned to establish linking relationships with institutional higher-ups as well as with lawmakers. Providers might lobby their supervisors to allot more physician time per patient because of the premium that elders place on being able to speak and having people listen. When providers listen, they might make their patients feel better, even if \"nothing can be done\" clinically about the elders' condition. State institutions can also put their seal of approval on preferential elder care in the form of official norms, which alone are not sufficient to produce change, but can be necessary impetus to start. To complement the \"paper norm,\" the state might facilitate programs that get practitioners out of the clinics and into elders' living spaces, as a means of co-learning, prevention, and treatment. It is crucial to involve state institutions in this process in part because if we work outside or against these structures, the wider impact of the project can be weakened, and the entire project can be marginalized. On the other hand, involving institutions entails the risk of falling back on or being manipulated and co-opted into conducting work according to their narrowly-defined institutional agendas. It is here that Chiapas' 572 international political capital - i.e. the visibility derived from its natural resources, indigenous population, and sociopolitical history - can be used very effectively. State institutions are embedded in a global context in which there is a premium on evidencing that the population is well cared for. When the most vulnerable members of the population - the poor, young, elderly, and infirm - are visibly neglected, the international community slaps the country's hand. Chiapas' visibility, then, can be used to pressure the Mexican government into dedicating more resources to elder health. Research findings call attention to the disconnects between Mexico's commitment - for instance in the context of the post-Cairo discourse - and actual achievements in the realm of health and well-being. Policymakers will likely view this grassroots research initiative and the resulting initiatives as a positive way of engaging this nascent social movement. The potential for fostering bridging and linking capital with neighboring governments (especially the United States), supra-national philanthropic foundations, and even virtual and media power blocks is great, as the national and international elder primary health care movement is in its infancy. Ironically, a risk of supporting the government in fostering capital development among elders and state employees is that local work may relieve the state of its responsibility, as these efforts may be seen as a replacement for state investment, thus justifying cutbacks in public expenditures. This is not so far-fetched. For instance, one local clinical director hoped that CISC and/or the working group would offer classes for providers that would allow him to fulfill government mandates that arrived on his desk without state funding to 573 operationalize them. He then mused that perhaps this was not such a good idea, as \"then the state will never send the money for it.\" 4. CISC's negotiated role in the flow of capital The possible snags are plentiful, but the potential gains of fostering capital flow via \"political opportunities, social energy and ideas, and the processes of 'scaling up' local representation and bargaining power\" are great (Fox 1996:121). Local NGOs can help provide a means of action and a climate of rewards. In this case, CISC, an NGO with a critical consciousness, shows much promise as a key player in the local elder health care movement. CISC has successfully linked linking civil society, the state, and the international community around other health issues by ensuring gains for all stakeholders. Analysts contend that NGOs have become pawns of the State and of the international foundations funding them, casting doubt on the legitimacy of NGO's claim to represent the People. A decade working at CISC convinces me that this is not necessarily the case. CISC has succeeding in balancing its social mission, commitment to participatory problem-solving, and financial stability. CISC depends heavily on international funders because funds from national sources are limited; however, this does not mean that the Mexican government has turned a blind eye to NGOs like CISC. On the contrary, the Fox administration supports government-civil society collaboration, and the National Plan for Development 2001-2006 dictates that, \"to encourage the social wealth of Mexico, the social and human development policy... proposes actions and programs 574 which will diminish the presence of the State in areas where NGOs can make an effective contribution.\" CISC's civil society status has allowed it to act relatively unencumbered by government bureaucracy, yet form exceptionally strong collaborative relationships with official institutions. CISC needs the propitious environment fostered by government engagement, for instance in the form of legally-binding norms and accords with the local Health Department. On the other hand, CISC can save the state money while helping to fulfill national and international commitments. CISC negotiates the terms of its contribution. Rather than uncritically catering to the state's interests (perhaps getting women to have tubal ligations or to give birth in clinics), CISC has a history of opting to explore issues not on the state radar (adolescence, virginity, sexuality, infertility, violence, drinking), elder health being the most recent axis of investigation. Further, CISC studies the social and political causes of illness, even if it means revealing state shortcomings. Rather than depending on \"expert\" assessments, CISC insists on asking the opinions and observing the actions of the true experts, in this case, elders and their caregivers. So, with elder well-being, CISC has once again taken the initiative to broaden its scope beyond the state's comfort zone. While some NGOs admirably step in to address gaps in public services, CISC is aware that such a technical fix might absolve the government of its responsibility to provide care; it could divert attention from key structural problems; and CISC's infrastructure would only allow it to serve a fraction of the population. These details 575 are inconsistent with CISC's vision of insuring equitable public health services for all. In this case and others, CISC focuses on research, education, evaluation, collaboration, rather than providing direct service. Through the cascade effect, CISC starts with higher institutional echelons or an initial group of community members, who then replicate CISC's vision and work. The Encuentro marks an initial step in the elder health cascade effect. This formative research has been embraced by CISC and state employees alike, yet because the state did not fund this project, we were free to expand membership, challenge viewpoints championed by the state, criticize government services, and introduce topics the state might not broach or prioritize, like elder neglect within the health system and the pharmaceutical industry. Providers, many in decision-making positions, can employ research findings to expose shortcomings in state elder care provision to then justify changes within their institutions. When findings come from a third \"neutral\" source (me/CISC/working group), the providers themselves cannot be cited for jeopardizing their institution's reputation. In this way, practitioners can serve as a channel through which local knowledge and feedback on health programs flows up to health officials and policy makers enabling them to make more informed decisions about program design and mid-course corrections, and also insight into how state resources can flow down to the people. CISC work, then, promotes agreements with individuals who tie national institutions (and their resources) to meeting local needs. The research results may also validate the government's appeals for 576 international funding in the face of perceptions that Mexico is more developed and is not in need of funding, which has threatened the sustainability of State programs. Further, the CAIMAM working group, like CISC, can provide long-term continuity that the state, which is subject to election cycles, cannot. CISC is also key in encouraging the dissemination of local insight - cultural capital - among the local population and between the local, regional, national, and international stakeholders. CISC's scholarly publications have helped to call attention to urgent health issues among a broad community, yet CISC has also been dedicated to getting the general public to reflect on these issues. In the past, CISC has used two promising strategies that were initially met with raised eyebrows. First, from extensive field notes recorded by Tojolabal/Mayan ethnographers, we extracted pieces with aesthetic, anthropological, and literary value, and wove these excerpts into monographs about local lifestyles and health issues, creating a bilingual indigenous literature. In addition to print material, CISC lined an office with egg-cartons, installed sound equipment, and recorded spots and mini- novelas in Spanish and indigenous languages, which were broadcast on radio stations to the region's largely illiterate population. CISC's literary and mass media expertise, initially unrecognized, later earned the Center national prizes, state contracts, and international funding. To interact with international philanthropic foundations, CISC had to learn to depict its work truthfully, yet reassure funders they get enough \"bang for their buck.\" Once versed in what would be asked of us, we became skilled in framing 577 projects. For elder well-being, this same potential exists to disseminate information as a means of acquiring and circulating economic, cultural, and social capital. CISC, while faithful to the State, funders, and the people, has not lost its autonomy or its identity. On the contrary, CISC's relationships with the Mexican government, its funders, and Chiapanecos are better characterized as mutually interdependent rather than hierarchical. All participate in the flow of capital: CISC provides unique skills and knowledge, the state provides infrastructure and legal legitimacy, the foundations provide funds, and the people provide the motivation. Improving elder health will require all four, along with the facilitation those of us who translate between these various groups. 578 D. My role as facilitator of capital flow via formative research My immersion in Chiapas and its unique elder health care context placed me in the ideal position, with appropriate skills, at a propitious time to address elder well-being. As a medical anthropologist, my role in the formative research process is as a catalyst, an invited facilitator, and stakeholder. Figure 12.2 illustrates the iterative process, in which I have been an engaged participant observer. Specifically, I have dedicated myself to: (a) identifying stakeholders and (b) identifying the kinds of data stakeholders see as credible and respond to, (c) obtaining this data, and then (d) using it as the hook to inspire critical reflection with the goals of (e) educating, linking, and motivating stakeholders, so that they can then engage in (f) creative problem-solving, while (g) boosting their capital, which in turn gives rise to further opportunities of (g) obtaining even better data and deeper understanding, and (h) repeating the process. In this dynamic, rather than provide answers, I outline the circumstances, ask and elicit questions that invite critical problem-solving. I aim to engage and mobilize stakeholders around what they feel they have a moral imperative to do (the politics of responsibility) and what they can do, and do well (the politics of possibility). I use the convertible capital inherent in practical lessons from qualitative research to support local people in on-the-ground community-based problem solving, while gleaning strengths of social science theory to critically examine and critique health practice, policy, and research itself. This anthropology of elder health and anthropology in elder health is a nascent effort, but with the potential of sparking a sustained movement. As a reporter said to me on his way out of the Encuentro, \"If you had opened the doors to the public - anyone who is concerned about elder health - the city soccer stadium would not have been big 579 enough to hold everyone!\" Indeed, we are in the very first stages of what I anticipate will be a long-term formative research process with life-changing implications for elders and all those with a stake in elder health and care, in other words, each and every one of us.
