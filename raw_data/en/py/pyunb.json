No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the pandemic that has sickened millions and caused more than 575,000 deaths worldwide. \"The world urgently needs vaccines to protect against Covid-19,\" said Dr Lisa Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and lead author of the study.

Moderna's shot, mRNA-1273, uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected into people, the vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus, which the body recognises as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against. The results released on Tuesday involved three doses of the vaccine, tested in groups of 15 volunteers aged 18-55 who got two shots, 28 days apart. The groups tested 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of the vaccine. The team reported that individuals who got two doses of the vaccine had high levels of virus-killing neutralising antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in people who had recovered from Covid-19. The race for a vaccine is on around the world, such as at the University of Queensland, where they recently began human trials for a COVID-19 vaccine.

In the highest-dose group, three patients had severe reactions such as fever, chills, headache or nausea. One of these had a fever of 39.6 degrees Celsius. \"We didn't see any events that are characterised as serious adverse events,\" Jackson said, referring to reactions that require hospitalisation or result in death. In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimise adverse reactions. At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company's internal US manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drug maker Lonza.

Moderna said it will follow study volunteers for a year after the second shot, to look for side effects and check how long immunity "}
