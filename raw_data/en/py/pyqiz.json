WASHINGTON , D.C. 20515 A REPORT Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations January 2011 (In This Version, Appendix Material Is Sorted by Appropriations Subcommittee)Pub. No. 4245Notes Numbers in the tables may not add up to totals because of rounding. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing committee, and by appropriations subcommittee. Each entry is listed only once\u2014generally under the primary committee to which the bill was referred.Preface T his report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) satisfies the requirements of section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, as amended. The report, which must be completed by January 15 of each year, is intended to assist the Congress in determining the authorizing legislation that should be in place before it considers the regular appropriation bills for the upcoming fiscal year\u2014in this case, fiscal year 2012, which begins October 1, 2011. Ordinarily, this annual report shows the total amount that the Congress has provided in appropriation acts for programs whose authorization has expired. However, no appropriation acts have been signed into law for fiscal year 2011. All programs covered by those acts are currently funded under a continuing resolution (Public Law 111-322), which expires March 4, 2011. Thus, no information is available about unauthorized funding for 2011 as a whole because the full-year appropriations have not yet been enacted. Appendix A, which normally lists those programs that have been funded in 2011 but whose appropriations have expired, does not include figures relating to the amou nt of unauthorized appropriations. Appendix B lists authorizations of appropriat ions that will expire by the end of fiscal year 2011. (Because that listing does not display any appropriation figures, it is not affected by the lack of enacted appropriation laws).

Summary of Authorizations of Appropriations Expiring On or Before September 30, 2011, by Appropriations Subcommittee 5CBOUnauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations Overview As required, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports each January to the Congress on the following: /square6All programs and activities funded for the current fiscal year for which authorizations of appropriations have expired, and /square6All programs and activities for which authorizations of appropriations will expire during the current fiscal year. That requirement is specified in section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The purpose of that provision is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legislation that must be in place before the regular appro- priation bills can be considered.\" 1 The Role of Authorizations The term \"authorization\" is used to describe two types of laws. One is an \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" statute, which creates a federal agency, establishes a federal program, prescribes a federal function, or allows a particular federal obligation or expenditure within a program. That type of authorization may allow a federal agency, program, or function to continue indefinitely or only for a specific period. It may also authorize direct spending (also known as \"mandatory spending\") if it provides the direct author-ity to draw money from the Treasury to implement the statute, or it may simply specify a purpose for which a subsequent appropriation is made available. Although enabling statutes, particularly those whose implementation depends on future appropriation action, are necessary for programs to operate, authorizations of that type are not the focus of this report. Instead, this report focuses on the second type of law described by the term \"authorization\": a specific provision that authorizes the appropriation of funds (generally known as \"discre- tionary spending\") to carry out the program or function established in the enabling statute. Such a provision con- stitutes guidance to the Congress regarding the amount of funding that will be necessary to implement the enabling statute. An authorization of appropriations may be contained in the enabling statute or may be provided separately. Such an authorization may set a specific dollar amount (definite authorization) or allow the appro- priation of \"such sums as may be necessary\" (indefinite authorization) and may be permanent, multiyear, or annual. For the purposes of this report, an appropriation is considered unauthorized when it is made available for a program after that program's authorization of appro-priations has expired. This report does not address appropriations that have never been authorized. House and Senate rules\u2014dating from the 19th cen- tury\u2014contain restrictions on the consideration of appro- priations that are unauthorized, although the rules and their application are different. 2 What constitutes an \"unauthorized appropriation\" and whether it is a viola-tion of the House or Senate rule is determined by the Speaker of the House or the Presiding Office of the Senate, respectively, on advice of the respective House's Office of the Parliamentarian. Although this report is intended to aid the Congress by identifying those authorizations of appropriat ions that have expired or will expire, it is not\u2014and should not be considered\u2014 definitive with respect to the application of House or Senate rules. 1. H. Rept. 99-433, at 114 (1985) (Conference report accompany- ing the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budget Act to include the requirement for this report).2. See Rule XXI of the House Rules and Manual, H. Doc. 110-162, at 836-891; and Rule XVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, S. Doc. 110-9, at 11-12.2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS CBOListings of Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations This report covers all programs funded through the annual appropriation process that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has since expired (see Appendix A) or will expire this year (see Appendix B). Each listing includes the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount (definite or indefinite) authorized in that year. In separate versions of this report, the listings of public laws in the appendixes are displayed in three ways\u2014by House authorizing committee, by Senate authorizing commit-tee, and by appropriations subcommittee. Each entry is listed only once\u2014generally under the primary committee to which the bill was referred. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws that contain nonp ermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including laws enacted during the second session of the 111th Congress. In general, House and Senate rules require the appropria- tions committees, in their reports on general appropria- tion bills, to identify any programs that are funded in the bills but lack an authorization\u2014including programs for which an explicit authorization of appropriations has never been enacted. This CBO report, as specified by law, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or is scheduled to expire. Many laws also establ ish programs with an autho- rization of appropriations that does not expire. The reports of the appropriations committees as well as this report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent. Programs Funded in Fiscal Year 2011 With Expired Authorizations of Appropriations Ordinarily, Appendix A would list programs and activi- ties funded by an appropriation for fiscal year 2011 whose authorization has expired. However, as of the publication date of this report, no appropriation acts have been signed into law for fiscal year 2011. All programs normally covered by those acts are currently funded by a continuing resolution (Public Law 111-322), which expires March 4, 2011. This report omits figures and totals on unauthorized appropriations because full-year appropriations for 2011 do not exist. Several laws enacted recently provided long-term reau- thorizations for agencies or programs with annual appro- priations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (reauthorized through 2013), the America COMPETES Reauthoriza- tion Act of 2010 (through 2013), and the Museum and Library Services Act of 2010 (through 2016). Authorizations of Appropriations That Expire On or Before September 30, 2011 For certain programs and activities, the authorization of appropriations expires by the end of fiscal year 2011. (Appendix B shows the amounts authorized to be appro- priated in 2011 for the expiring programs and activities, not the amounts actually appropriated for that year.) Definite authorizations (speci fically, those contained in laws under the jurisdiction of House and Senate authoriz- ing committees) that will expire by the end of this fiscal year total about $767 billion (see Tables 1, 2, and 3). Most of that amount, about $725 billion, is authorized in a single law, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authoriza- tion Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (P .L. 111-383). Typically, authorizations for defense funding are renewed annually. Some of the other definite authorizations for programs that are expiring at the en d of 2011 include the authori- zation for the Coast Guard (P .L. 111-281, authorizations of $10 billion), several provisions in the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (P .L. 109-162, authorizations of $1.5 billion), and several provisions regarding construction in the Vet- erans' Benefits Act of 2010 (P .L. 111-275, authorizations of $1.2 billion). In addition, in the past few months lawmakers have enacted temporary authorizations that will expire during fiscal year 2011. They include programs of the Small Business Administration (through January 31, 2011), surface transportation programs (through March 4, 2011), and the Airport Improvement Program (through March 31, 2011).
