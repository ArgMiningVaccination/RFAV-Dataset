For much of the nation, any given winter packs a dermatologic triple-threat: dry outdoor air, even dryer indoor air and buffeting winds. But with this winter's addition of masks and [perpetual handwashing](https://www.organicspamagazine.com/winter-hand-regimen/), skincare anxiety is running unseasonably high. Thus the intel and antidotes you'll find here. First, know that masks may prove beauty allies in winter, however counterintuitively: \"They can help trap moisture,\" explains Dendy Engelman, MD, a dermatologist at New York City's Shafer Clinic Fifth Avenue. \"The only way they'd exacerbate dryness is if they were too tight and causing friction.\" Of course, even with a well-fitting mask (the Robot Bunnies Luxe Face Mask 2.0 is our new favorite), you'll want to ensure that the fabric doesn't syphon off any of the moisture you intended for your skin, so factor a bit of absorption time into your routine. The simplest rule? \"Wait until your face is dry to the touch before putting on your mask,\" says Engelman. As for what you're applying underneath (actually, what you're applying anywhere), it should be extra-nourishing\u2014and used immediately post-cleansing, while your skin is still damp, for maximum moisture retention. These eight finds\u2014and one cult classic\u2014are all naturals for the job.
