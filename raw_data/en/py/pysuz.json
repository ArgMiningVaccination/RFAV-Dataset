We aim to recruit men and women and have equal representation of those who benefited from the programme (ie, experienced improvements in their IBS symptom severity) as well as individuals who did not. We anticipate needing to interview between 10 and 15 participants to reach both code and meaning saturation [22](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/5/e059604?rss=1#ref-22) aiming for a maximum variation sample. Semistructured interviews will capture participants' experiences, programme satisfaction, facilitators and barriers to participation, perceptions of social support and supervised learning, perceived impact on IBS symptoms and overall physical and mental health, and input on improving future programming ( [box 1](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/5/e059604?rss=1#boxed-text-2)). Interviews will happen virtually using Microsoft Office Teams and be approximately 30-45 min in length. The study coordinator will interview the participants, take notes during the interview and reflect following each interview. Interview recordings will be transcribed verbatim without identifying information. Data will be coded and analysed in duplicate using NVivo V.12. Thematic analysis inductively reveals patterns and themes providing an understanding of participant experiences, with the programme and their perspectives on its impact. Thematic analysis is a method for systematically identifying, organising and offering insight into patterns of meaning (themes) across a data set. [23](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/5/e059604?rss=1#ref-23) This method makes sense of shared meanings and experiences that allows the researcher to identify what data are important to the research question. [24](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/5/e059604?rss=1#ref-24) Semistructured interview questions and probes 1.
