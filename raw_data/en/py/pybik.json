A flu shot helps you stay healthy and protects those around you from influenza. Because the flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms, the University Health Center highly recommends the flu vaccine to prevent respiratory illness on campus. Students, faculty and staff can receive their flu shot by appointment in the medical clinic. Call [402.472.5000](tel:+14024725000) to schedule. Drop-in flu vaccine clinics The University Health Center hosts drop-in flu vaccine clinics for students. Clinics are held at the University Health Center in Room 240, from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. on the following dates: - Oct. 4 - Oct. 5 - Oct. 6 - Oct. 11 - Oct. 12 - Oct. 13 - Oct. 18 - Oct. 25 - Oct. 26 - Oct. 27 - Nov. 1 - Nov. 2 - Nov. 3 The East Campus drop-in flu vaccine clinic will be held Oct. 10 from 9 a.m. to noon in the Nebraska East Union across from Starbucks. Only students are eligible to attend drop-in flu vaccine clinics. Faculty and staff must make an appointment at the medical clinic by calling 402.472.5000. If you are 18, Nebraska state law requires parental permission to get vaccinated. If you have not already submitted the Power of Attorney form to the health center, bring a completed copy with you to the drop-in clinic. If you are 17, the Power of Attorney form is invalid until you turn 18, which means you are ineligible to attend a drop-in clinic. However, you can still get vaccinated by making a flu shot appointment at the medical clinic during normal business hours. We will call a parent or guardian at the time of check-in to obtain permission to vaccinate you. Cost Flu shots are free for currently enrolled undergraduate and graduate UNL and UNMC students. Faculty, staff and community member flu shots have a charge, which can be submitted to private insurance. Most insurance plans cover flu shots at 100%. Employees can also choose to pay the out-of-pocket cost. Please contact the billing and insurance office with any questions at 402.472.7435 or 1.866.662.8662. (Please note, we are not offering the high-dose (65+) flu vaccine this year.)

Do I need a flu vaccine if I wear a mask and practice physical distancing? Yes. Although these measures can help protect you from respiratory viruses like the flu and COVID-19, the best way to reduce your risk and prevent serious complications is to get a flu vaccine each flu season.

Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine the same day I get the flu vaccine? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people who have not yet received their COVID-19 shot get vaccinated the same day that they get their flu shot. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available in the health center pharmacy for those who would like to receive the COVID-19 vaccine the same day as their flu shot.

Getting vaccinated can prevent illness, reduce the severity of flu symptoms if you get sick and prevent serious complications caused by the flu. It also helps protect our Husker community. When is the best time to get vaccinated? It is recommended you get the flu shot as soon as it becomes available because it takes about two weeks to be fully effective. Flu season begins in October and extends through March or April. Do I need a flu shot every flu season? Yes because the flu vaccine only provides protection for about six months. Another reason is that the flu vaccine is updated every year to protect against the latest strains of the virus. I don't get sick often, so why should I get vaccinated? When you get your yearly influenza vaccination, you are not only protecting yourself, but you are also protecting the people you love and the people in your community who are at higher risk for serious complications. Babies, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at greater risk for complications from influenza, including pneumonia and death.

Is it better to get sick with flu than to get a flu vaccine? No. The flu can be a serious disease, particularly among young children, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease and diabetes. Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend everyone six months and older get vaccinated against the flu, especially those with higher risk of flu complications or who live with high risk individuals. The flu vaccine is not recommended for the following: - People with a life-threatening allergy to eggs or other vaccine ingredients - People with life-threatening reaction to any previous vaccine - People who have had Guillain\u2014Barre syndrome from the flu vaccine Are there side effects? You may experience minor soreness, redness or swelling at the site of injection as well as mild fever, mild headache, muscles aches and nausea. These symptoms will be minor compared to an active influenza infection. What about serious reactions to flu vaccine? Serious allergic reaction to flu vaccines is very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after vaccination. While these reactions can be life-threatening, effective treatments are available?
