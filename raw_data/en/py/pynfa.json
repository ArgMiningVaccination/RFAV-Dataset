You can find thousands of detoxifiers on your shelves for cleaning out your bodies but did you know there is such a thing as a hair detox? Ah - I caught you there, right? Here is what it means... Just as a body detox is to remove impurities and toxins, a hair detox removes all chemicals, products, and environmental pollutants, UVA, and UVB exposure that damage our hair. It also helps to remove some toxins that have found a way into our hair shaft. Cool, right? Here are some super safe, quick, and effective remedies to detox your hair - just for you! EVERGREEN ALOE VERA REMEDY - NATURALLY YOURS Do a scalp detox with aloe vera. A scalp detox removes all the dead skin, products, and toxins from the hair follicles, roots, and oil glands.

Aloe Vera contains vitamin A, C, and E that promotes a healthy scalp. Its rich properties can treat itchy scalps and flaking skin too. HOW TO APPLY: Rub Aloe Vera gel/pulp on your scalp very gently and wash it off after an hour with a mild shampoo. BLESSINGS OF BAKING SODA - RIGHT FROM YOUR KITCHEN Baking soda is a great scalp cleanser. It helps to remove dandruff, eliminate built-up oils on the scalp, and remove hair shafts from scalps.
