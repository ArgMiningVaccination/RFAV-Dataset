I NTRODUCTION The dual efforts of law enforcement and public health person- nel are important to the governmental purpose of protecting citizenhealth and safety. However, while the goal is the same for bothinvestigations, their objectives are different. Public health personnelseek to identify individuals who need to be treated or isolated in order to diagnose and contain the disease. Law enforcement per-sonnel also seek to identify individuals, but for the purposes of de-termining who can assist in providing information leading to theapprehension of the perpetrator and supplying evidence of a poten-tial crime of bioterrorism. Expectations of privacy exist which make it more difficult to conduct these investigations with joint public health and law en- forcement personnel involved in the investigations. 1 Public health personnel have private health information which is given to themunder an expectation of privacy, while law enforcement personneldo not want to disclose information which may identify witnessesor jeopardize the investigation. 2 Both law enforcement and public health personnel are conducting investigations with the same indi-viduals, which under the constraints of these concerns, would lead * Victoria Sutton, M.P.A., Ph.D., J.D., is the Robert H.

J. H EALTH L. & P OL'Y to the same individuals being interviewed twice\u2014once by public health personnel and once by law enforcement. Beyond these problems, other issues, such as handling and col- lecting evidence, Miranda warnings, and false statements, all indi-cate different outcomes depending upon whether it is lawenforcement personnel or public health personnel who are in-volved. 3 Yet, it is essential that both objectives of the dual investiga- tions are served under time constraints. Patricia Quinlisk, State Epidemiologist for Iowa, gave congres- sional testimony on July 23, 2001, which illustrated the problem ofnot sharing information between law enforcement and public healthpersonnel in investigations. 4 She related the story of an outbreak of a sexually-transmitted disease in a state facility in Iowa for the men-tally and physically handicapped. 5 Local and state authorities be- gan an investigation to control the outbreak, but law enforcementwas investigating probable rape. 6 Because the mentally handi- capped are not competent to consent to sexual relations, there wasipso facto sexual abuse or rape. 7 Both investigations proceeded with- out sharing information between the two groups, often asking inter-viewees the same questions. 8 As Dr. Quinlisk suggested, sharing information between law enforcement and public health personnelwould have been helpful in bringing a successful closure to theinvestigation. 9 This article reviews the current authorities and commentaries on the dual-purpose investigation of law enforcement and publichealth personnel in a bioterrorism event. With that background, thearticle concludes with questionnaires for use in the dual-purposeinvestigation. 10 It also provides a set of guidelines for reference in planning and carrying out investigations, which can be used as a 3See infra Part IV. 4Combating Terrorism: Federal Response to a Biological Weapons Attack , Hearing Before the Health Comm. on Gov 't Reform , 107th Cong. 5 (2001) [hereinafter Hearing ] (statement of Patricia Quinlisk), available at http://bioterrorism.slu.edu/bt/official/congress/quinlisk072301. pdf (last visited Oct. 28, Seq: 3 13-APR-06 12:13 DUAL PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 153 resource by public health lawyers, health lawyers in general, and law enforcement personnel.11 II. W HAT ARE THE RESPECTIVE CONCERNS ? Both law enforcement and public health personnel have con- cerns about sharing information in the investigative process of a bi-oterrorism event. 12 Law enforcement personnel have two primary concerns.13 First, they do not want to compromise their investiga- tions by sharing informants ' often-sensitive information with more individuals than absolutely necessary, because the more people whoknow the information, the more likely it is to be misused or ex-posed. 14 Second, allowing public health personnel access to infor- mation about the individuals or type of information lawenforcement seeks could cause the information 's exposure and re- sult in the individual evading capture.15 Public health personnel also have two primary concerns.16 First, the public health community is generally concerned about lia-bility for releasing private health information. 17 This concern in- cludes sharing clinical samples taken from individuals who may besought by law enforcement as evidence. 18 In some jurisdictions, public health officials have taken the position that the isolates19 col- lected from patients belong to the state.20 Under that rationale, such individuals then have no legitimate expectation of privacy or privi-lege when their samples become part of a criminal investigation. 21 Second, public health personnel and medical personnel are con-cerned about the ethical responsibility of trust between patient andhealth care giver. 22 This atmosphere of trust is intended to en- courage the patient to disclose otherwise sensitive information, thus 11Id. 12INVESTIGATION HANDBOOK , supra note note 1, at 3. 18Id. at 4. 19Id.

III. D ID HIPAA C HANGE THE QUESTION OF SHARING BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH PERSONNEL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ? HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,24 was created for several purposes.25 One was to stand- ardize information used in health care administration where infor-mation exchanged between insurers and administrators wasstreamlined. 26 As part of this requirement, provisions for maintain- ing the confidentiality of the information were created.27 HIPAA also resolved some issues of when covered entities may share infor-mation with law enforcement personnel. 28 Covered entities are per- mitted to disclose otherwise private health information to publichealth authorities for matters of national security, 29 and to protect the President.30 Further, covered entities may disclose to law en- forcement personnel who are investigating a potential act of bioter-rorism, although the information is limited to name and address,date and place of birth, ABO and Rh factor blood types (no DNAinformation), social security number, type of injury, date and timeof injury, and physical characteristics, 31 as long as it is relevant to the investigation.32 However, when an administrative order or sub- poena from law enforcement personnel is specifically tailored to berelevant to a particular investigation, then the covered entity is re-quired to release the information. 33 The latter instance does away 23Id. 24Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996). 25See PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 155 with the question of discretionary disclosure on the part of the cov- ered entity.34 Interpreting the meaning of the term \"covered entities \" may be critical to the information-sharing process during a bioterrorismevent. If the term is interpreted broadly to include the ad hoc as-sembly of emergency healthcare response teams, then HIPAA pro-tections apply; whereas, if these are not considered covered entities,then prior agreements or state law can govern information-sharing. 35 IV. R ECOMMENDATIONS FOR WORKING TOGETHER A. Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Bioterrorism Exercises The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act36 provided for training local personnel to respond to bioterrorism attacks, and other weapons ofmass destruction. 37 Bioterrorism scenarios and tabletop exercises addressing those threat scenarios were developed to create a two-day exercise for local responders. These tabletop exercises were uti-lized in communities across the nation. 38 Coincidentally, the first such exercise in bioterrorism was held in Lubbock, Texas just daysafter the first anthrax attacks in October 2001. 39 The exercise 's for- mat provided the opportunity for law enforcement personnel andpublic health personnel, as well as many other groups of local andstate responders to meet, 40 often for the first time.41 This kind of 34See id. \u00a7 164.512(f)(1). 35See James G.

SCCCOM Guidance In December 2000, before the anthrax attacks of the fall of 2001, the United States Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command(SBCCOM) suggested that in the context of a bioterrorism eventthere was a perceived gap in communication between law enforce-ment-lead investigations and epidemiologist-lead investigations. 42 A report resulting from the SBCCOM workshop described a processwhich made timeliness a priority, and which required each group toadapt to the needs of the other group by integrating their ques-tions. 43 The recommended approach called for minimizing the need for each group to interview the same people.44 The approach achieved this result by providing public health personnel (in thisplan, identified as epidemiologists) and law enforcement personnelwith questionnaires. 45 The questionnaires were designed to satisfy the investigation needs of both groups.46 The report gave an exam- ple of how this process might work.47 If between the epidemiologist and the law enforcement personnel there was a pool of 100 peopleto interview, then each group would interview only fifty. 48 The law enforcement personnel would obtain information for the epidemiol-ogists through additional epidemiological questionnaires. 49 The epi- demiologists would use these questionnaires to decide which of thefifty should have follow-up epidemiological interviews 50 For exam- ple, thirty of the fifty might require follow-ups.51 The same process would be followed in interviews by the epidemiologists.52 As a re- sult, the number of interviewees would be reduced by twenty foreach group, thus maximizing the time and efficiency of theinvestigators. 53 42REPORT TO SBCCOM, supra note 40, 45Id. Seq: 7 13-APR-06 12:13 DUAL PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 157 The Questionnaire in Part VI combines the National Domestic Preparedness Office/Department of Defense (NDPO/DOD) reportquestionnaires for law enforcement personnel and public healthpersonnel into a single form. 54 The combined questionnaire uses the set of questions that public health personnel ask which can also ben-efit the criminal investigation, 55 and the set of questions that law enforcement personnel ask which can benefit the public healthinvestigation. 56 Consistent with these questionnaires is the guidance from the declassified coordinated document by the Federal Bureau of Investi-gation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the De-partment of Health and Human Services & the Centers for DiseaseControl (DHHS/CDC). 57 That document directs: In coordination with public health and law enforcement, identify and list the names and contact information for anyone who mayhave been exposed to the suspicious substance so that they may becontacted when the LRN [Laboratory Response Network] test re-sults are available or if there is other additional information. If pos-itive results are obtained, state and local public health departmentswill need to contact those potentially exposed as soon as possible toprovide appropriate assistance (e.g., antibiotics, education, addi-tional testing, vaccination, surveillance/symptom reporting). 58 Conceivably, taking clinical samples could be part of the inter- view process. Sample taking could be accomplished if each inter-viewer is accompanied by healthcare personnel for purposes oftaking and handling samples. The SBCCOM report for the exchange of the information be- tween law enforcement personnel and public health personnelmakes seven recommendations: (1) establish an information ex-change group whose function is to identify key investigators oneach team to bring them together for information sharing; (2) de-velop close personal relationships between law enforcement andpublic health personnel, beginning by meeting each other; (3) in-clude an epidemiologist on the criminal investigation team; (4) in-crease awareness of the threat of a bioterrorism incident in theemergency response community; (5) pre-establish agreements infra Part VI. 55INVESTIGATION (Table 2), supra note 1, at 33. 56INVESTIGATION HANDBOOK (Table 1), supra note 1, at 28. 57FBI ET AL ., G UIDANCE ON INITIAL RESPONSES TO A SUSPICIOUS LETTER /CONTAINER WITH A POTENTIAL BIOLOGICAL THREAT (2004), http://www.bt.cdc.gov/planning/pdf/suspicious package-biothreat.pdf (last visited Oct. 8, 2005) [hereinafter G UIDANCE ON INITIAL RESPONSES ]. 58Id. at 6.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\6-1\\HHL103.txt unknown Seq: 8 13-APR-06 12:13 158 H OUS.

Evidence and Chain of Custody The topic of collecting and handling evidence merits separate treatment within this article, because those activities are criticalthroughout the investigation and must be considered in any processor pre-agreement between investigative groups. The chain of cus-tody is a process and method for tracking, maintaining control over,and providing accountability for all evidentiary items in a criminalinvestigation. 61 Constitutional law provides that evidence used in criminal proceedings must be collected with the protection of the FourthAmendment which prohibits unreasonable search and seizures. 62 Evidence collected by public health personnel, if used in a criminalproceeding, must also conform to those standards because in a crim-inal proceeding context such personnel are government actors. 63 Thus, the Fourth Amendment applies and protects individuals fromgovernmental intrusions beyond the individual 's expectation of pri- vacy.64 For example, collecting public health evidence in a private dwelling would not extend to searching through desk drawers, un-less this was part of a public health investigation. 65 The most specific guidance on the chain of custody is found in an unclassified document, dated November 2, 2004, and coordi-nated between the FBI, DHHS, and the CDC. 66 The document ad- 59REPORT TO SBCCOM (Table 10), supra note 40, at 27. 60See generally Jay C.

Preserve evidence in coordination with law enforcement and ensure that materials are safely pack-aged. Take steps to retain enough suspicious material for: (a) Labo-ratory analysis; and (b) Forensic examination of criminal evidence,regardless of whether the threat is ultimately determined to be ac-companied by a hazardous material. Transfer custody of evidenceto a law enforcement officer as soon as possible. Maintain chain ofcustody by obtaining a record of names and signatures every timecustody of a suspicious material or sample for laboratory analysischanges hands. 68 The same guidance further recommends that the FBI or re- sponding law enforcement agency must include a chain-of-custodyform with the incident report. 69 The coordinated document directs that hazardous materials (HAZMAT) units70 screen evidence from the crime scene (otherwise collected by public health officials or other law enforcement units)for the presence of chemical or radiological material on-site, andthen double-bag the evidence in clear sealed bags, consistent withchain-of-custody requirements. 71 Photographs of the area or other site are also recommended, as is making a record of who is takingthe photograph. V. N EW YORK CITY'S GROUNDBREAKING PROTOCOL The FBI is the lead agency for investigating potential bioterror- ism,72 thus New York City and the FBI worked together to craft an agreement which allows public health personnel and law enforce-ment personnel to work together in the event of a bioterrorism inci-dent. 73 On November 21, 2004, the New York Times reported that after two years, New York City and the FBI had reached an agree-ment on bioterrorism investigations. 74 The agreement includes a set of rules to protect the respective interests of the city and the FBI,while sharing information collected by both public health personnel 67Id. 68Id. at 5. 69Id. at 3. 70Occupational Safety and Health Standards, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.120 (2005). 71GUIDANCE ON INITIAL at 2. 72INVESTIGATION HANDBOOK , supra note 1, at 8. 73Judith Miller, City and F.B.I.

H EALTH L. & P OL'Y and law enforcement personnel.75 The need for this agreement to address information-sharing conflicts arose from the investigationsof the fall 2001 anthrax attacks. 76 The agreement allows law enforcement officials to access bi- oterrorism victims ' private medical information, but they must agree to keep the information confidential.77 HIPAA, however, does not consider law enforcement personnel to be covered entities.78 Therefore, law enforcement personnel are not required to keep pri-vate health information confidential. 79 However, under the New York City/FBI protocol, law enforcement must agree not todisclose. 80 A. Protocol Assumptions and Principles This protocol establishes a means for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), New York Police Department(NYPD), and the FBI ( \"the parties \") to collaborate in joint investiga- tions during the initial phase of the epidemiologic and possiblecriminal investigations of a suspected or confirmed bioterroristevent. 81 It rests on the following shared understandings and principles: 1. All activities and data sharing that occur as part of thisprotocol will comply with all applicable laws, rules andregulations (including the NYC Health Code, NYC Ad-ministrative Code, NYS Sanitary Code, Federal PrivacyAct and the Health Insurance Portability and Accounta-bility Act) that govern when routinely collected publichealth and law enforcement data can be shared with otherparties. 2.

Datacollected will be shared and protected in accordance withall applicable laws and regulations. 3. Absent unusual circumstances as agreed upon be- tween all of the parties, joint investigation interviews willoccur in a location adequately removed from potentiallycontaminated areas or crime scenes. 4. All parties recognize the potential \"chilling effect \" that the presence of law enforcement officers may have on pa-tients being interviewed, on the medical professionalswith whom DOHMH routinely works and upon whomtraditional public health surveillance\u2014through mandateddisease reporting\u2014depends. Efforts will be made to min-imize those effects (e.g., law enforcement personnel inter-viewing patients will not be wearing uniforms). It isunderstood that joint investigations remain essentially apublic health epidemiologic investigational activity, thatDOHMH is not an agent of law enforcement when con-ducting such investigations, and that all confidentialmedical information discussed or obtained in the courseof such investigations shall be deemed subject to the pro-visions of NYC Health Code Section 11.07(c). 5. When possible, FBI and NYPD personnel will be as- signed to train with DOHMH field investigation teamsbeforehand to facilitate familiarity among team members. 6. When possible, FBI and NYPD personnel will be as- signed to work with the same DOHMH field investiga-tion teams for the duration of a joint investigation. 7. FBI and NYPD will be responsible for evaluating and addressing the security needs of DOHMH field investiga-tion teams. 82 B.

Absent unusual circumstances as agreed upon be- tween all of the parties, if the subject of the interview ishospitalized, DOHMH will inform the facility 's on-call administrator that public health and law enforcementpersonnel will be interviewing a patient(s) at their facility.Whenever possible, the interview will be conducted in amanner that minimizes disruption to normal hospital op-erations and patient care. FBI and NYPD will deploy theminimum number of personnel needed to perform theinterview(s). 2. DOHMH, FBI, and NYPD teams will collect needed equipment and meet at an agreed upon staging area for abriefing and transport to the hospitals or other facilitieswhere individuals will be interviewed. 3. Absent unusual circumstances as agreed upon be- tween all of the parties, when arriving at a facility,DOHMH, FBI and NYPD personnel will inform the on-call administrator. 4. While at the hospital, DOHMH team members will in- dependently identify other patients who may have illnessconsistent with the disease of concern by reviewing addi-tional medical records and/or interviewing medical staff.Absent unusual circumstances as agreed upon betweenall of the parties, FBI and NYPD will not be present whileDOHMH conducts these activities, in order to protect theconfidentiality of other patients at the hospital or medicalcare setting who are not yet known to have the disease ofconcern. 5. Whenever joint interviews are conducted, DOHMH, FBI and NYPD team members will introduce and identifythemselves and explain that they need to ask a series ofquestions to help determine where and when the subjectsmay have been infected. 6. During the joint interview, DOHMH questions will be limited to those pertaining to the illness of concern andhow the subject may have been exposed or infected. Tothe extent possible under the circumstances and as agreedupon between all of the parties, confidential medical in-formation will not be discussed in the joint interview andwill be maintained by DOHMH. Absent unusual circum-\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\6-1\\HHL103.txt unknown Seq: 13 13-APR-06 12:13 DUAL PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 163 stances as agreed upon between all of the parties, DOHMH personnel will review medical records and in-terview patients and health care providers independentlyto collect confidential medical information that is neededfor the public health investigation. The subject of the in-terview will not be physically examined when law en-forcement personnel are present in the room. 7. Absent unusual circumstances as agreed upon be- tween all of the parties, DOHMH staff will interview thesubject of the interview first, while the FBI and NYPDpersonnel are present in the room. The data collectiontool that will be used will be a DOHMH-prepared ques-tionnaire. After completing the DOHMH interview, theFBI and NYPD personnel will interview the patient, whilethe DOHMH staff remains in the room. 8. If the subject of the interview requests that either party leave the room before or during the interview, this willoccur, although DOHMH, FBI or NYPD personnel maydecide to return to interview this person at a later time. 9. After the interview, DOHMH, FBI and NYPD joint in- vestigation team members will review the collected dataand share information as appropriate. 10. If requested by FBI and NYPD, and agreed upon by DOHMH, copies of all completed questionnaires will beshared with FBI and NYPD, as appropriate and consistentwith all applicable laws. Records containing confidentialinformation will be maintained at DOHMH, FBI andNYPD in a secure manner that is agreed upon by theparties. 11. During the period of the joint investigation, FBI and NYPD may assign liaisons to DOHMH, and vice versa. 12. During the period of the joint investigation, the par- ties will inform each other in a timely fashion of any in-formation that may have an impact on the jointinvestigation. If DOHMH determines a possible timeand/or location of a biological agent 's release, it will in- form FBI and NYPD immediately, and vice versa.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\6-1\\HHL103.txt unknown Seq: 14 13-APR-06 12:13 164 H OUS.

If it is mutually agreed by the parties that the investi- gation of a BT event is concluded or no longer suspected,all confidential DOHMH, NYPD, and FBI documents willbe maintained in a secure manner that is agreed upon bythe parties. 15. It is understood that any DOHMH information or documents that may have been provided to the FBI and/or the NYPD in the course of a joint investigation shallremain confidential and will be separately maintained bythe FBI and/or the NYPD, respectively. Such informationor documents shall not be used or redisclosed for anypurpose other than one directly related to the suspectedor confirmed BT event that generated the subject joint in-vestigation, without the specific approval of the DOHMHcommissioner or his/her designee. Similarly, all FBI orNYPD information or documents, which are provided toDOHMH in the course of a joint investigation, shall re-main confidential and will be separately maintained byDOHMH.

S HARED QUESTIONNAIRE APPROACH The use of a shared questionnaire for both law enforcement and public health investigators will streamline the investigation andallow the same form to be used. Many of the initial questions thatboth law enforcement and public health personnel must use in aninvestigation are identical. Investigators should also question eachother, and utilizing these shared questionnaires can achieve thegoals of a dual investigation. 83Id.\\\\server05\\productn\\H\\HHL\\6-1\\HHL103.txt unknown Seq: 15 13-APR-06 12:13 DUAL PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 165 A.

J. H EALTH L. & P OL'Y VII. C ONCLUSION In situations where time is the controlling factor, the shared questionnaire approach of the SBCCOM in combination with the in-terview process is optimal. While public health is the predominateconcern, law enforcement concerns are still protected. The chain-of-custody issues must be carefully planned and should include chain-of-custody training for public health investigators. From these reports, studies, guidances, and the City of New York and FBI agreement, the following guidelines can be summa-rized into a resource for the dual-purpose bioterrorisminvestigation: 1. Face-to-face meetings: Planning should occur prior to an event and include face-to-face meetings between law enforcementand public health personnel in local jurisdictions. An importantpoint to recognize is that if any incident is determined to be a poten-tial bioterrorism event, the FBI will intervene and lead the investiga-tion. Therefore, FBI offices should ensure that their personnel makepersonal contacts with the public health personnel in their respec-tive jurisdictions. Taking into account the rotation of FBI personnelto different offices, these contacts should be made on an annualbasis. 2. Authorities: Agreements should be made between law en- forcement personnel and public health personnel for determiningauthority. These agreements should include any instances wherestate law may be more restrictive than federal law (HIPAA) in theprotection of private health information. The role of each agencyshould be clearly set forth in the agreement. The agreement be-tween New York City and the FBI is an example of such a step. 84 3. Legal authorities: To guide a dual-purpose investigation, there must be advance interpretation of legal authorities includingstate public health law, federal laws (including HIPAA), and evi-dence and chain-of-custody legal issues. The advance developmentof a list of public health lawyers and criminal lawyers in each juris-dictional division in the state (counties, regions, etc.) who will vol-unteer to analyze legal issues in their specialized areas wouldprovide a legal expertise network. 4. Questionnaire development: Questionnaires such as those developed by SBCCOM, which can be used to assist the dual pur- 84See generally NEW YORK CITY-FBI PURPOSE BIOTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS 169 poses of the bioterrorism event investigation, should be reviewed and discussed as part of the planning process. The combined formin Part VI can be used for discussion purposes. 85 5. Chain of custody: Using a common chain-of-custody form is also recommended, as well as recording names and signatures forevery transfer of the evidence between persons. As soon as possi-ble, the evidence should be transferred to the appropriate law en-forcement officer, who will continue to maintain that record-keeping process. 6. Maintaining a list of interviewees: From the beginning of any incident, record the names and contact information for any indi-viduals who may be exposed so that the analyzing laboratory cancontact them for appropriate treatment. 7. Preserving evidence: The primary concern of both law en- forcement and public health personnel is the immediate protectionof individuals ' health. Once the activities to protect individual health are underway, further attention to preserving evidenceshould be addressed. 8. Record depository: Both law enforcement and public health personnel should keep copies of the same records for theiruse throughout the investigation. The groups should agree on se-curity procedures for those records for the periods during and afterthe investigation. These recommendations address the preparation and early re- sponse phase for any potential bioterrorism event concerning infor-mation-sharing in a dual-purpose investigation. The next phase of aresponse to a bioterrorism event will likely move to other considera-tions as dictated by the particular circumstances and controlled bythe Biological Incident Annex 86 and the Terrorism Incident Law En- forcement and Investigation Annex of the National Response Plan.87 However, establishing these guidelines and the proper legal proto-col for initiating the investigation will further the objective of lessen-ing the terror which bioterrorists evoke.
