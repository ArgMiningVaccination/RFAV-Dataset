F508del mice. Adult m ice were mock- infected intranasally with 50 l virus diluent or infected with 10,000 FFU/mouse influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) for 1- 6 days. Body weight, carotid arterial O2 saturation and heart rate were monitored daily . Pulmonary edema was evaluated by lung wet:dry weight ratio. Lung function parameters were measured by the forced- oscillation technique (flexiVent ). were were depleted by intranasal administration of clodronate liposomes 1 day prior to and every 2 days following infection . Relative to WT littermate controls , -infection ( d.p.i.) , although weight loss and viral replication did not differ between the two strains . At 2 and 6 d.p.i., pulmonary edema and bronchoalveolar epithelial injury were reduced in HETs . Likewise, alterations in lung function in infected WT mice were absent in HETs at both 2 and 6 d.p.i. BALF from influenza- infected HETs contained approximately 3-fold great er numbers of alveolar macrophages and more than 10- fold higher IL-6 6 d.p.i.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically devastating viral disease of pigs, cause d by PRRS virus (PRRSV) responsible for greater than $ 3 million loss daily to the US pork industry. Routinely used modified live PRRSV vaccine provides incomplete protection from emergent PRRSV variants. Because of its safety advantages, in our previous study we attempted strengthening inactivated vaccine by entrapping in PLGA nanoparticles based delivery system (NP -KAg) and the results were encouraging. To further reinforce, in this study we coupled the NP -KAg (using MLV vaccine strain, VR2332) vaccine w ith entrapped/unentrapped potent adjuvant, Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole cell lysate ( M. tb WCL), that we identified earlier. We tested various vaccine adjuvant formulations with a virulent heterologous PRRSV (MN 184) challenge in pigs. Our results indi cated that NP -KAg vaccine with unentrapped adjuvant combination elicited superior cross -protective immunity, with the following immune correlates: (i) increased levels of PRRSV specific IgG and IgA titers with enhanced antibody avidity; (ii) balanced Th1 and Th2 responses; (iii) enhanced titers; (iv) increased Th1 and suppressed immunosuppressive cytokines response ; (v) increased population of activated and IFN - producing CD4 +, CD8+, CD4+CD8+ T cells, + T cells, and NK cells, and the frequency of APCs. These immune correlates were supported strongly with complete clearance of the replicating challenged virus from the lungs and blood of pigs. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that adjuvanted PLGA nanoparticle delivered vaccine elicited superior cross- protective immunity in pigs against challenged heterologous PRRSV.

Bonnegarde- Bernard , J. Jee, M. Fial, F. Aeffner , E. Cormet - Boyaka, I. Davis , M. Lin, M. Karin and P. Boyaka. Depts of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA and Depts of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA Regulation of allergic responses by intestinal epithelial cells remains poorly understood . Using a model of oral allergen sensitization in the presence of cholera toxin as adjuvant and mice with cell -specific deletion of IKK in intestinal epithelial cells IECs (IKKIEC), we addressed the contribution of IECs to allergic sensitization to ingested antigens and allergic manifestations at distant mucosal sites and the skin. Cholera toxin induced higher proinflammatory responses and altered the profile of the gut microbiota in IKK IEC mice. Antigen -specific IgE responses were unaltered in IKKIEC mice, but Th1 responses and associated IgG2a Abs were enhanced. Interestingly, allergen- specific Th17 and IgA Ab responses were enhanced in IKKIEC mice. Upon nasal antigen challe nge, these mice developed lower levels of allergic lung inflammation, which correlated with higher levels of IgA Abs in the airways. However, IKKIEC mice recruited a higher number of gut -sensitized T cells in the airways after nasal antigen challenge and developed airway hyper -responsiveness, which were suppressed by treatment with anti-IL-17A. Orally sensitized IKKIEC mice were also protected against allergic inflammation in response to epicutaeous challenge. Ongoing studies are investigating the relat ive contribution of IgA and T helper cell subsets to the protection achieved in the skin.

Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine. Six H14 influenza A virus (IAV) isolates recovered in 2010 during routine virus surveillance along the Mississippi Migratory Bird Flyway in North America raised questions about the natural history of these rare viruses. These were the first H14 IAV isolates recovered in the Western Hemisphere and the only H14 IAV isolates recovered since the original four isolates in 1982 in Asia. Full length genomic sequencing of the 2010 H14 isolates demonstrated the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from the 1982 and five of the 2010 H14 isolates showed 89.6% nucleotide and 95.6% amino acid similarity and phylogenetic analysis of these viruses placed them with strong support within the H14 subtype lineage. A sixth 2010 H14 isolate showed 14 amino acid changes with the other five 2010 H14 isolates indicating a separate H14 subtype lineage circulating in North America n waterfowl . The level of genomic divergence observed between the 1982 and 2010 viruses provides evidence that the H14 HA segment was circulating undetected in hosts. The evolutionary relat ionship observed between 1982 H14 and the closely related H4 subtype HA segments were similar to contemporary comparisons suggesting limited adaptive divergence between these sister subtypes. The nonstructural (NS) segment s of two 2010 isolates were placed in a NS clade isolated infrequently over the last several decades that includes the NS segment from a previously reported 1982 H14 isolate indicating the existence of an unidentified pool of genomic diversity. An additional neuraminidase reassortment event indicated a recent inter -hemispheric gene flow from Asia into the center of North America. These results demonstrated temporal and spatial gaps in the understanding of IAV natural history. Additionally, the reassortment history of these viruses raises concern for the inter -continental spread of IAVs and the efficacy of current IAV surveillance efforts in detecting genomic diversity of viruses circulating in wild birds.

Green , D. Kim, D. Huey, S. Niewiesk. Department of Veterinary Biosciences Inhibition of seroconversion after vaccination by maternal antibodies is a problem widely observed in human and veterinary medicine. Generally, the development of neutralizing antibodies is inhibited, whereas the T cell response is not affected. We seek to define an effective immunization strategy for vaccination in the presence of maternal antib odies. It has been demonstrated that maternal antibodies inhibit B cell responses through cross -linking of the B cell receptor with CD32 (FcRIIB ). Theoretically, a downregulation of CD32 should alleviate B cell inhibition. In vitro , cotton rat B cells express CD32 following stimulation with LPS . Incubation with interleukin 4 ( IL-4) leads to a reduction of CD32 molecules. In order to induce IL-4 in vivo, we used the glycolipids -galactosylceramide secretion by NKT cells whereas OCH selectively induces IL- 4. Cotton rat spleen cells stimulated with -gal-cer for 20 hours produced similar levels of IL-4 and IFN - whereas OCH produced IL-4 only. Using the cotton rat model of MV infection, we have been able to demonstrate that when immunizing against MV in the presence of passively transferred human IgG (maternal antibody) the B cell response is inhibited and vaccination is unsuccessful. However, following intranasal co- immunization of MV and -gal-cer in the presence of inhibitory antibody, a low but detectable serum titer of neutralizing antibodies was induced which led to reduction of viral titers after challenge in comparison to MV immunization alone. Co -immunization experiments with MV and OCH still ne ed to be performed. So far, o ur results indicate that immunization with MV plus -gal-cer induces neutralizing antibody production in the presence of maternal antibody and provides protection against measles virus infection.

Department of Veterinary Biosciences Surfactant protein C (SP -C) is a key component of pulmonary surfactant that is produced exclusively by alveolar type I I (ATII) pneumocytes. ATII cells are small cuboidal epithelial cells that comprise approximately 15% of the total cells but only 5% of the surface area within the alveolus . The much larger and flatter alveolar type I (ATI) pneumocytes cover approximately 95% of the surface area of the lung and are the primary site of gas exchange. Following lung injury, ATII cells can produce inflammatory mediators and will also differentiate into AT I cells to repair the damaged epithelium. ATII cell differentiation res ults in a reduction in surfactant lipid and protein production. We hypothesized that, as a known cause of severe lung injury, i nfluenza A virus infection will significantly alter ATII cell function. We therefore infected transgenic mice that express a GF P transgene under the control of the ATII cell -specific surfactant protein C promoter with influenza A/WSN/33 (a mouse- adapted H1N1 strain) for 2- 6 days . ATII cells were then isolated from lung digests and analyzed by flow cytometr y. We found that influen za infection resulted in a progressive decline in SP -C-positive cells from a mean of 50% in unin fected mice to 24% at day 6. These findings were confirmed by whole- lung imagin g using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) . Furthermore, ATII cell expression of GRO/KC and TGF -1, but not IFN - or IL -6 was increased in influenza- infected mice. The f low cytometric analysis techniques which we have developed will increase our ability to d etermine specific effects of influenza infection on ATII cell function and the role of these cells in the post -infection inflammatory cascade and recovery from lung injury . They will also allow us to generate highly -purified ATII cell preparations by cell sorting , which can be used for analysis of influenza effects on ATII cell gen e expression.

Protection is type I interferon (IFN) dependent, and we have established a novel axis of antiviral immunity in which hsp70 is released from virus - infected neurons to induce IFN - in macrophages. The present work used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to determine if the relevance of hsp70 -dependent antiviral immunity extends to fulminant lytic neuronal infections. vitro , VSV replication was enhanced by hsp70 constitutively expressed in mouse neuronal cells and infection induced an early extracellular release of hsp70 from viable cel ls, similar to MeV. However, VSV- induced release was also progressive, increasing with virus -induced cell death. The impact of this VSV -hsp70 interaction on neurovirulence was established in weanling male hsp70 transgenic and non- transgenic C57BL/6 mice. C onstitutive expression of hsp70 in neurons of transgenic mice enhanced viral clearance from brain and reduced mortality in a type I IFN -dependent manner. Non- transgenic mice were also protected against neurovirulence in a type I dependent manner when hsp70 was expressed by a recombinant VSV (VSV -hsp70), indicating that hsp70 expressed in the virus infected cell is sufficient for host protection. In vitro data confirmed extracellular release of hsp70 from cells infected with VSV -hsp70, and also showed that v iral replication is not enhanced when hsp70 is expressed in this manner, suggesting that hsp70- mediated protection in vivo is not dependent on stimulatory effects of hsp70 on virus gene expression.

Ehrlichia inclusion resembl es the early endosome devoid of lysosomal markers ; However, it is unknown how the replicative inclusion is formed and how Ehrlichia acquires nutrients for growth in the inclusion . We previously found ECH0825 is the type IV secretion effector required for E. chaffeensis infection. Here we found Ehrlichia infection was significantly enhanced in host cells overexpressing ECH0825- GFP as compared with cells expressing GFP alone. Both native and ectopically expressed ECH0825 was with native Rab5 and reciprocally, GST-Rab5A interact s with native ECH0825. The interaction was also observed in cells co -express ing GFP-Rab5A and ECH0825- GFP. Thus, ECH0825 alone is sufficient to interact with Rab5 in the absence of other Ehrlichia proteins. A Rab5 effector, Vps34 directly binds Beclin 1 a Class III phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3KC3) complex , which regulates the formation of autophagosome precursors. Affinity pull -down of recombinant ECH0825 showed native Beclin 1 and Vps34 along with native Rab5 in the complex. Ehrlichia growth, but not binding or entry was inhibited by a PI3KC3 inhibitor, 3- methyl adenine, which was partially reversed wi th supplementation of essential amino acids. Furthermore, Ehrlichia growth was enhanced by rapamycin treatment, indicating involvement of autophay in Ehrlichia nutrient acquisition. The macropinocytosis marker GFP-Rabankyrin- 5, which binds to PI3P and is an effector of Rab5, was localized to Ehrlichia inclusions. These data suggest ECH0825 recruits early endosome- complex to promote autophagosome IMID - 9 DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLA TION AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES OF PIG MYELOID CELLS FOR UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DI SEASE IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS R ESEARCH K. M elendez . H. Strange, T. Papenfuss, Z. VanGundy. Dept. Of Veterinary Biosciences Pigs are susceptible to various pathogens as humans and can bridge a gap between mouse and human model systems. In particular, given the physiological and immunological similarities between pigs and humans, the use of pigs as a model for gastrointestinal pathogens with no in vivo or in vitr o model for human infections can be particularly useful. Myeloid cells are a population of immune cells important in defense against pathogens, control of inflammation and maintenance of homeostasis. Myeloid cells consist of macrophages, dendritic cell s, monocytes and their precursors. Monocytes are a circulating myeloid cell derived from the bone marrow that in inflammatory conditions give rise to tissue macrophages and DCs. The gastrointestinal tract is a primary site of pathogen entrance and the m echanisms controlling immune responses at this mucosal site are critical for protection against infection. Given that monocytes directly contribute to intestinal myeloid cells (DCs and macrophages), we were interested in isolating, identifying and charact erizing pig myeloid cell populations from the blood and tissue (systemic and mucosal). In these studies, we are developing methods to evaluate myeloid cells from blood and tissue monocytes and differentiated bone marrow dendritic cells and macrophages. Phenotypic markers in pig myeloid cells that are potentially useful for applications in modeling human disease include CD14, CD16, CD172a( SWC3), CD80/86 and density (ficoll - paque) gradients for blood, tissue digestion for lamina propria and extracting bone marrow to identify these phenotypic markers using flow cytometry, we can determine the ratios of our cells of interest for each tissue. Future isolation and identification of macrophage and dendritic cell surface markers in t he blood and tissue of pigs and comparison to human myeloid cell populations will give a better understanding to pathogenesis and immune pathways.

Department of Veterinary Biosciences. Ehrlichia chaffeensis that causes an emerging infectious dis ease, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, is a small obligatory intracellular bacterium of limited metabolic capacity. In order to survive, it is essential for E. chaffeensis to enter eukaryotic host cells that support its growth. E. chaffeensis binds, enters, a nd replicates in mono cells . E. chaffeensis ligand and the cognitive host cell surface receptor that mediates bacterial entry are, however, unknown. Here, we report that the anti body against the C -terminal fragment of outer surface protein ECH1038 (ECH1038C) significantly inhibited E. chaffeensis binding, entry, and infection both phagocytes and non- phagocytes. ECH1038C -coated polystyrene beads bound and entered non-phagocytic and phagocytic host cells, and the entry was blocked by chemical inhibitors that are known to block E. chaffeensis entry. Furthermore, we found ECH1038C directly bound DNase X, a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol -anchored mammalian cell -surface protein, by yeast two-hybrid screening, which was confirmed by far -Western blotting, affinity pull -down, immunofluorescence and co- immunoprecipitation. Antibody against DNase X or reduction of DNase X by small interfering RNA diminished E. chaffeensis binding, entry, and infection of both phagocytes and non -phagocytes. E. chaffeensis binding and infection of bone marrow -derived macrophages (BMDMs) from DNase X -/- mice were significantly less than those from wild- type mice, and DNase X-/- mice were less susceptible to E. c haffeensis infection than wild- type mice. ECH1038- coated beads entered BMDMs from wild -type mice, but not those from DNase X-/- mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ECH1038 is the ligand for the host cell entry of E. chaffeensis with DNase X as its HORSES Pigott1, A Ishihara1, M Wellman2, D Russell2, AL Bertone1 From the Comparative Orthopedics Research Laboratory, Departments of Veterinary Clinical Sciences1 and Veterinary Biosciences2, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210. Objective\u2014To characterize the inflammatory and immune response to intra- articular injection of autologous, genetically modified (bone morphogenetic protein autologous , allogeneic, and xenogeneic bone marrow -derived (MSC) in horses. Animals \u2014Six 5 -year-old Thoroughbred mares. Procedures \u2014The 4 fetlock joints were each injected on day 0 with 1 of 4 MSC groups with 15 million MSC and were assessed for 1 month for inflammatory parameters including synovitis, joint swelling and pain. Arthroscopic examination was performed and synovial biopsies were taken at day 60 for histologic and molecular analyses. On day 120, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were is olated from each horse and co- cultured with monolayers of each MSC group for analysis of CD4 positive cells via flow cytometry and cytokines via ELISA. Results\u2014 There was no significant difference between autologous and genetically modified autologous MSC for the inflammatory parameters examined. Xenogeneic and allogeneic MSC produced greater peak of inflammation than either autologous perivascular cuffing and bon e morphogenetic protein 2 antibody uptake for MSC injected joints compared to normal controls. Adaptive immunity was demonstrated upon re-exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to xenogeneic MSC in co- culture. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance\u2014In tra-articular MSC resulted in a marked acute inflammatory response that was significantly increased for allogeneic and xenogeneic MSC. This difference was small and clinically, appeared insignificant. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a persistent mononuclear synovitis for at least 60 days, the significance of which is unknown. An adaptive immune response was detected for xenogeneic but not for allogeneic MSC suggesting that a second injection of xenogeneic cells would result in a more robust immune response.

VanGundy , J. Baker, H Strange, A. White, T. Papenfuss Myeloid cells (MCs) play important roles in the modulation of the immune system . Regulatory MCs (regMCs) modify the innate and adaptive immune responses through multiple mechanisms . The factors which contribute to the development of regMCs remain poorly understood. Retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, is a steroid hormone that contributes to immunoregulatory abilities seen in the gut. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether RA could promote the differentiation of regMCs. In order to investigate this, we used an in vitro differentiation model that generates dendritic cells (DCs) from bone marrow (BM) progenitors. We hypothesized that the presence of RA during differentiation would induce regDCs. BM cells were differentiat ed with GM -CSF \u00b1RA for 6 -7 days . At 6 -7 days of differentiation, BM-MCs containing DCs were evaluated both phenotypically and functionally (ie. Flow cytometry and proliferation assays). We found that day 7 RA BM-MC demonstrated increased expression of activation and maturation markers CD80 , CD86, and MHCII . inhibitory marker PD-L1. Functionally, RA BM -MCs had increased levels of intracellular IL- 10 and were able to increase Treg percentages when cultured with na\u00efve helper T cells compared to control cells . Importantly, d7 BM -MCs were able to suppress t he proliferation of responder (splenic) immune cells even when stimulated with an inflammatory challenge (ie.LPS) . Taken together, these results demonstrate that the presence of RA during differentiation produces a regMC population . Interestingly, CD11c+ (DCs) within the population were not the suppressive population. Rather, the suppressive cells were CD11c-CD11b+Ly6Cint/low and likely represent a regulatory monocyte or other myeloid population. The development of this model will not only provide a critic al tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in the regMC generation, but will also be a useful tool to provide regMCs for possible therapeutic applications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases .

Department of Veterinary Biosciences and The Ohio State College of Medicine. The alveolar epithelium is composed of two distinct cell ty pes. Alveolar type II (ATII) pneumocytes are small cuboidal epithelial cells that comprise approximately 15% of the total alveolar cells, but only 5% of the surface area within the alveolus. These cells produce surfactant and carryout several functions inc luding the regulation of alveolar surface tension, fluid balance, and host defense. The much larger and flatter alveolar type I (ATI) pneumocytes cover approximately 95% of the surface area of the lung and form the epithelial component of the air -blood bar rier, making them the primary site for gas exchange. Under pathological conditions, ATII cells , which have stem cell -like properties, possess the ability to differentiate into ATI cells . This serves as an epithelial repair mechanism , and results in a reduc tion in surfactant lipid and protein production. We hypothesized that, as a known cause of severe lung injury, influenza A virus infection will significantly alter ATII cell function. We therefore infected transgenic mice that express a GFP transgene under the control of the ATII cell -specific surfactant protein C promoter with influenza A/WSN/33 (a mouse- adapted H1N1 strain) for 2- 6 days. ATII cells were then isolated from lung digests and analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that influenza infection resulted in a progressive decline in SP -C-positive cells from a mean of 50% in uninfected mice to 24% at day 6. Likewise, western blot analysis of whole lung lysates and qRT -PCR of purified ATII cells confirmed thes e results. In contrast, i nfluenza infection had little effect on ATI cell -specific marker expression (Aquaporin- 5 and T1) at the whole- lung level, which suggests that ATII cells may be differentiating into ATI cells given that both cells types are key sites for influenza infection.

B A Obanda : Visiting Scholar in Veterinary Preventive Medicine Background: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a major cause of skin, soft tissue , bone and joint infections. Published reports of MRSA infections in Kenya are limited. We describe for the first time molecular features of MRSA from h ospital, HIV and bovine in Kenya. Methods: 218 isolates of S. aureus were isolated from community , hospital , farms and HIV outpatients Clinic in Kenya from 2008 to 2010. Fifty isolates of MRSA and three MSSA were selected. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was conducted using the Kirby - Bauer disk diffusion method. Enterotoxins gene types Sea, Seb, Sec, Sed ,Tst and Pvl genes were tested by Multiplex PCRs together with SCC mec Typing and PFGE typing using Xba restriction enzyme. Result: Twenty (40%) of isolates were multi -drug resistant, nineteen (39%) of which were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 10 (7.5%) were pan susceptible. Seventy percent of multi -drug resistant strains were nosocomial. Those isolates recovered from HIV patients were resistant (63%) to cortrimoxazole at 63% . SCC mec type II was predominant ( 67 % ) of the SCC mec type able originating from nosocomial infections. Non typeable detected seb (40, 75.5%) 13%), Tst (7, 13%) and Pvl (12, 22.6%) of which one was of bovine origin Seven of the 53 isolates could not be typed using Xba restriction enzyme. A total of 10 clusters groups (A to J) were identified . Conclusions : There was higher drug resistance among MRSA strain in hospital than community acquired MRSA. Mos t of the isolates in both groups had enterotoxin Sea and Seb. Toxin Pvl was detected in few isolates mainly from HIV patients. The most prevalent pulsotypes in cluster F were associated with nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug resistance; cluster G contained human and bovine similarity. MCB - 2 THE ROLE OF TAX-1 AND THE ALTERNATIVE NF-B PATHWAY IN HTLV TRANSFORMATION . J.Al-Saleem and P. L. Green, Department of Veterinary Biosciences Human T -cell Leukemia Virus Type -1 (HTLV -1) is a infecting ldwide. HTLV -1 is the etiological agent of an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T cells termed Adult T -Cell Leukemia (ATL). ATL patients , on average, survive one year from disease onset . The HTLV -1 regulatory protein Tax is required for HTLV - 1-mediated cellula r transformation both in vitro and in vivo . Tax primarily functions to promote transcription of viral genes , but has also been shown to deregulate cellular genes leading to cell growth and genetic instability . Previous studies showed that Tax activates two NF-B signaling pathways: the classical pathway, which is rapid, and the alternative pathway, which is delayed. The exact role of the alternative pathway in HTLV -1-mediated transformation is unknown. We propose that Tax interaction with the alternative NF-B pathway is important for HTLV -induced pathogenesis . To test this hypothesis we will utilize Tax mutants that have been shown to be deficient in their ability to activate the NF -B pathways. Viruses containing these mutant forms of tax will be used to infect primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and transformation will be monitored via a cell ular proliferation assay . We also plan to identify Tax -1 binding partners that are important for Tax -mediated activation of the NF- B pathway. To identi fy these binding partners we will generate S -protein epitope tagged Tax expression vectors for both wild type and NF-B activation deficient tax genes. We will express tagged T ax proteins in 293T cells and pe rform immunoprecipitation followed by mass spect rometry to identify binding partners . By comparing the differences between the wild type Tax and mutant Tax binding partners we will be able to identify candidate proteins required for Tax -mediated activation of the alternative NF-B pathway . We hypothesis that these candidates could then be used in future studies as clinical targets to treat patients with ATL.

Department of Veterinary Biosciences HTLV -1 and HTLV -2 are related but distinct pathogenic complex retroviruses. HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of adult T -cell leukemia (ATL) and a chronic neurological disease . In contrast, HTLV -2 is much less pathogenic with only a few reported cases of neurological disease. In addition to the structural and enzymatic proteins encode d by all retroviruses , HTLV encodes regulatory and accessory proteins. The sense strand of the provirus encodes most of the viral proteins including the transforming protein Tax . However, the antisense strand of both HTLV -1 and HTLV -2 encode protein (HBZ and APH-2, respectively) that down- regulates Tax-mediated viral transcription. Animal studies have shown that while HBZ is essential for infected cell survival and high proviral loads , loss of APH -2 results in increased viral replication and proviral loads. This lends itself to the hypothesis that the biological activities of HBZ and APH -2 are distinct and these differences are important for virus biology and pathogenesis . We examined and directly compared the effect HBZ and APH -2 had on several cellular transcription factors that have been previously shown to int eract with HBZ . We observed that APH -2 acted in a similar manner to HBZ in repression of interferon regulatory factors ( IRFs ) and the classical NF -B pathway . A difference was observed, however, in the activator protein 1 (AP-1) pathway and the transforming growth factor - (TGF-) signaling pathway. While we observe that HBZ represses c -Jun, as reported previously, we see no repression by APH -2. We also found that while HBZ enhances TGF- signaling, APH- 2 does not. We hypothesize that these differences could help explain how the two related viruses have such different disease outcomes and elucidate specific pathways to target f or new therapeutics.

M Hicks , Q Hu, J DeWille, Department of Veterinary Biosciences Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women. C hemotherapy plays a critical role in prolonging the disease- free survival of cancer patients. Despite chemotherapy advances, 30% of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients won't respond to current treatments. There is a critical unmet need to understand breast cancer resistance . OncostatinM (OSM) is a cytokine which can be secreted by either tumor cells or immune cells and is important in immune modulation, migration, EMT, and tumor progression in breast cancer patients . Little is known, however, about the role of OSM in chemother apy treatment. This study investigated the novel induction of JUNB in human breast cancer cell lines in response to OSM and its effects on chemotherapy induced apoptosis. JUNB is a member of the AP -1 transcript ion factor complex and has been associated with survival of pancreatic -cells in Type 1 diabetes . JUNB is markedly induced in b reast cancer cel l lines treated with OSM . Both JUNB mRNA and protein is also dramatically induced in surviving b reast cancer cells challenged with a lethal dose of Flavopiridol (FP), a CDK9 inhibitor chemotherapy drug. Increased JUNB mRNA levels were not due to increased mRNA stability or loss of function of FP. To determine the functional role of JUNB in response to FP , JUNB levels were challenged with FP, JUNB siRNA treated cells were more susceptible to cell death . These results demonstrate that JUNB may play a previously unrecognized pro- survival role in chemotherapy treated breast cancer cells . Breast cancer cells that are pre- treated with OSM, are protected against FP induced apoptosis . These results demonstrate that OSM, an IL- 6 family cytokine, induces JUNB. OSM induced JUNB may play a role in breast cancer chemotherapy resistance. This is the first investigation of OSM protection against chemotherapy is breast cancer cells.

Perez -Castro2, A. Clements2, V. Bravo2, K. LaPerle1, G. Leone3 1 Department of Veterinary Biosciences, 2 Comprehensive Cancer Center, 3 Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics Endometrial cancer (EMC) is the most common malignancy in the female reproductive tract and the seventh overall most common malignancy worldwide. Alterations in PTEN occur in up to 61% of type I EMC in humans and appear be an early event in the transformation process since up to 21% of foci of endometrial hyperplasia contain PTEN mutations. Epithelial proliferation is mediated through paracrine and autocrine cell -cell interactions between the epitheli um and stroma. Understanding the relationship between EMC tumor cells and their stroma is essential for improving diagnosis and treatment, particularly as to how they relate to invasion and metastasis which are primary reasons for treatment failure in human EMC patients. Previous mouse models designed to study the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer have had significant limitations primarily due to lack of endometrial -specific genes that could serve as promoters for driving transgene expression. The gene Spr r2f was recently identified on an organ- specific microarray gene expression analysis as a possible uterine- specific candidate to use in the development of transgenic mice. A Sprr2f -Cre mouse model was developed but resulted in ectopic expression of Cre rec ombinase within the brain and when crossed with floxed Pten mice, resulted in lethality within the first few weeks to months of life. In our lab we are creating novel transgenic knockin mice to utilize in studies of uterine development and cancer. The firs t of these models will result in inducible, uterine- specific expression of Cre recombinase which will then be initially utilized to study the effects of in vivo Pten deletion. Additional mouse models will be developed for studying how tumor cells and strom a interact during the natural evolution of EMC. We anticipate that these mice will serve as important preclinical animal models for the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or treat EMC.

S. Nelson , A. Bowman, C. Hofer , J. Nolting, I. Davis, R. Slemons. Department s of Veterinary Preventive Medicine and Veterinary Biosciences Influenza A viruses in swine are a public health risk, emphasizing the need for surveillance and characterization of these viruses. We previously reported that Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells maintained in serum free media (SFM) are superior to embryonated chicken eggs for the isolation of swine origin influenza A viruses . This led us to hypothesize that the increased accuracy of isolation of these viruses with MDCK cells maintained in SF M was due to the receptors expressed on the cell surface . Flow cytometry was used to determine the distributions of -2,3-linked and -2,6-linked sialic acid cellular receptors on the surface of the MDCK cells. At passage 20 the MDCK cells maintained in SFM are expressing 98% terminal -2,6-linked sialic acid cell receptors , with 2.25% of the cells also expressing -2,3-linked sialic acid s. Previous studies have shown that embryonated chicken eggs have predominantly terminal -2,3- linked sialic acid cell receptors. The predominance of -2,6-linked sialic acids on SFM adapted MDCK cells is a n explanation for the superior recovery of influenza A viruses, especially since it has been prev iously shown that these viruses prefer entially bind to terminal -2,6-linked s ialic acid s. Previous characterization of other MDCK cell lines, maintained under traditional cell culture practices with fetal bovine serum ( FBS), have shown that MDCK cells have a more equal distribution of both receptor types , leading us to hypothesize that maintaining MDCK cells in SFM may select for -2,6-linked sialic acid expression. Flow cytometry will be used to investigate if weaning the MDCK cells off FBS and main taining them in SFM over many passages affects the receptor distribution on these cells. This information will provide a better understanding of the selective pressure of SFM on MDCK cells and will provide insight into the benefits or detriments of these cells in isolating influenza A viruses from swine .

Department s of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Orthopedics Our hypothesis was to develop a concise, comprehensive analysis of Osteoarthritis (OA) gene expression and identify novel genes and pathways for future innervation. The Medline and Cinahl databases identified 3347potential articles related to OA gene expression. Following screening and eligibility requirements, 70 articles met inclusion criteria and full data sets, specifically significant differential expression, were extracted from all papers. Genes were ranked in frequency of occurrence, intensity, and interrelatedness, had ontologies identified in terms of biologic process, cellular component, and molecular function, and the comprehensive interactions of the genes were mapped in visual network s. In total 473 unique genes were detected from the expression profiles. Of those identified, four down regulated and three up regulated genes displayed disproportionately high fold changes. Five of these genes, Vitrin (VIT), Regulator of cell cycle (RGCC), F -box protein 2 (FBXO2), H1 inhibitor heavy chain 2 (ITIH2) , ranked in the bottom third in terms of relatedness to the other genes . Due to their unrelated nature, they lack influence from the other genes , thus potential optimal novel targets for a OA si gnature. Gene ontology information in conjunction with comprehensive interactions used to develop a visual network, identified three biological processes, skeletal development, phosphate transport , and cell adhesion , significantly up regulated in the extracellular zone of the cell and one significantly down regulated process , transcription, in the nucleus. We concluded that our system -based analysis supports the biologic model for osteoarthritis consisting of chondrocyte apoptosis and ineffective efforts to repair. This approach has the exciting capability for identifying specific pathways and novel genes for future research into intervention strategies.

Bridges; Depts. of Animal Sciences And Veterinary Cl inical Sciences The objective was to determine if decreased concentrations of progesterone (P4) during early follicular development would impact number and quality of oocytes recovered by transvaginal ultrasound- guided ovum pick -up (OPU). Ovulation was synchronized with the 5 d CO -Synch + CIDR program in postpubertal heifers in two groups (n = 18 per group) with d of the 2 nd GnRH treatment designated as d 0. On d 5.5 all visible follicles in the ovaries were ablated. Heifers were stratified, within group, by estrous expression (yes or no), weight, age, and antral follicle count to receive either a new CIDR (high P4; H) or a previously used CIDR and two- 25 mg doses of PGF given 8 h apart (low P4; L) on d 5.5. On d 10.5 (OPU -1), all visible follicles were aspirated, new and used CIDR were replaced, and OPU was performed again on d 15.5 (OPU -2). Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH; 50 mg per dose) was administered on d 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 9 and d 12.5, 13, 13.5 and 14. Bloo d samples for P4 were collected at and OPU recorded at each OPU and oocytes were graded on a 1 to 6 scale (1 = 5 layers of compact cumulus and homogenous cytoplasm, 6 = denuded). Concentrations of P4, total follicles aspirated, total oocytes recovered, and oocyte quality were compared with the MIXED procedure of SAS. Concentrations of P4 did not differ on d 5.5, but were lower ( P < 0.01) at OPU -1 and OPU 2.00 \u00b1 1.01 ng/ml, r espectively) in the H (5.47 \u00b1 2.06 and 5.36 \u00b1 1.60 ng/ml, respectively) treatment. Across OPU -1 and OPU -2, the L treatment had more ( P < 0.05) total follicles aspirated (15.3 \u00b1 1.1) and oocytes recovered (9.9 \u00b1 1.2) than heifers in the H treatment (12.1 \u00b1 1.0 and 6.4 \u00b1 0.8, respectively). Furthermore, decreased P4 resulted in increased ( P < 0.05) number of grade 1- 3 oocytes lesser P4 concentrations during follicular emergence and ear ly development resulted in collection of a greater number of good quality oocytes per heifer by OPU when compared to heifers peripheral P4 concentrations Keywords: p rogesterone, heifers, -RESTRICTION MIMETIC AGENT OSU -CG5 REDUCES PROSTATE CANCER SEVERITY IN A TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL OF PROSTATE CANCER .

However, because CR is not a practical treatment strategy for human cancer patients, drugs that can mimic CR at the cellular level are needed. These compounds are termed energy restriction-mimetic agents (ERMAs). We have previously shown that 100 mg/kg/day of the ERMA OSU neoplasia lesions of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, resulting in decreased urogenital tract and prostate lobe weights. In our current study, we evaluated OSU -CG5's ability to act as a che mopreventive agent. While administration of 1286 ppm (approximately 100 mg/kg/day) of OSU -CG5 via an AIN - 76A diet to intact male TRAMP mice for 18 weeks did not alter the incidence of poorly differentiated prostate carcinomas or the age at which these tumors developed, OSU - CG5 reduced prostate disease severity, as determined by tumor volume and mass. Namely, the tumors that developed in OSU -CG5-treated mice were 54.6% smaller by volume and 54.1% smaller by mass than the control mouse tumors. The reduction i n tumor size was associated with decreased tumor cell proliferation, as determined by Ki67, and reductions in androgen receptor and phosphorylated- Akt levels within the OSU -CG5 treated tumors. OSU -CG5 administered in the diet was well tolerated and did not cause systemic toxicity. Given OSU -CG5's ability to reduce prostate tumor size, OSU -CG5 may have potential as a chemotherapeutic agent for men with prostate cancer.

Departments and Veterinary Clinical Sciences The N -terminus of PTHrP 1) stimulates MSC proliferation and 2) promotes bone and cartilage formation while inhibiting fat and muscle formation from MSC . Since the roles of the NLS and C -terminus of PTHrP are unknown, we investigated the effects of deleting these regions on the proliferation and multi -lineage differentiation of MSC. MSC were isolated from neonatal mice lacking the -terminus ( Pthrp /) and Proliferation a MTT assay and direct counting . MSC -, chondro- , and days. protein secretion , gene expression, and flow cytometric/ histochemical/morphological indices were compared. Pthrp/ MSC proliferated faster and displayed greater ALP activity (P < 0.0001) . However, Pthrp/ MSC pellets were smaller ( P 0.0001) and expressed less Sox9 (P = 0.042) , but greater Ihh producing more adipocytes ( P = 0.023) and a trend towards increased Ppar (P = 0.087), both genotypes had similar adipogenic gene expression profiles. Interestingly, Pthrp/ MSC produced more myocytes ( P < 0.0001) and expressed more d esmin and myogenin (P = 0.002 and 0.031). In conclusion, r egions distinct from the N -terminus of PTHrP influence MSC proliferation and differentiation. Increased proliferation, ALP, and Ihh by Pthrp/ MSC , but less bone and cartilage formation, indicate that the NLS and C -terminus inhibit proli feration, but promote osteoblast and chondrocyte maturation. Our study is the first to demonstrate that additional regions of PTHrP are involved in adipogenesis and myogenesis , of which they complement the inhibitory function of the N -terminus. Similaritie s in adipogenic gene expression profiles, despite number of Pthrp/ MSC -derived adipocytes, suggest dysregulated energy metabolism, may SF - 4 QUANTITATIVE T2 MAPPING OF KNEE CARTILAGE AT 3 AND 7T IN AN EQUINE MODEL. 1,2M. I. Menendez, 2D. J. Clark, 2M. V. Knopp. 1Veterinary Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, 2The Wr ight Center of Innovation in Biomedical Imaging, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States. Purpose Knee articular cartilage is only 2.2- 2.5 mm and 1.5- 2 mm thick respectively, in humans and horses 1. Thus, Equine joints have been recommended as biological models for comparative car tilage repair research by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Our goal was to describe and compare a two channel transmit/receive radiofrequency coil and one channel knee coil at 7T and an eight channel knee coil at 3T. Methods Five ex-vivo mature horse knees were us ed. Knees were assessed with a 3T whole- body system using an eight channel knee coil. A multi -echo sequence with ten echo times was performed (TR/TE=[3000/12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]ms. A 7T investigational whole body system using two channel transmit/receive coil and one channel knee coil performed multi -echo sequences with five echo times (TR/TE=[5000/7, 21, 36, 51, 66]ms, and TE=[6, 18, 30, 42, 54] ms respectively. T2 values were calculated via linear least - squares f it. All calculations were performed using in- house software written in the IDL environment. ROIs in sagittal cross sections were manually traced. Results Average T2 mapping values were as follows: (58.8 \u00b1 3.3 SEM) ms for the 3T eight channel knee coil , (61.5 ms \u00b1 8.09) ms for the 7T two channel coil , and (56.4\u00b1 6.3) ms for the 7T one channel knee coil. No differences in average T2 mapping were shown among different coils and magnets. Nevertheless, i mages obtained with the multi - transmit/receive coil at 7T were superior to visualized articular cartilage. Discussion Quantitative T2 mapping helped to assess normal articular cartilage using different coils at 3T and 7T. Images obtained with the multichannel coil showed higher qualitative charac teristics that facilitated articular cartilage identification and delineation, thus making this method useful for cartilage visualization and evaluation.

This study evaluates \u00b5CT and microradiography to assess subchondral bone d ensity in dogs with naturally occurring OCD. We hypothesized there would be significant differences between 2- D microradiographic data and 3- D \u00b5CT r econstructions and that data from volumetric \u00b5CT reconstructions would be significantly different from those determined from a less data- intensive 2D reconstruction. Tissues obtained from two affected Golden Retrievers were confirmed with histology. Microradiographs and \u00b5CT were performed to calculate and compare BV/TV and assessment of the depth of trabecular bone changes from the cartilage surfac e between the lesion and an adjacent unaffected reference region. On microradiography, t he m ean (\u00b1 SD) BV/TV for the lesion was 86.53 \u00b14.93 the reference range 75.53 \u00b15.52 (p=0.07). Mean (\u00b1 SD) dept h of 25.83 and 47.63\u00b17.68 (p=0.029) for the lesion and reference region, respectively. Three- dimensional BV/TV measurements had a mea n (\u00b1SD) of 71.19 \u00b126.30 for the lesion and 46.97\u00b17.72 for the reference range (p=0.03). A statistically significant correlation was identified between microradi ography 2D measurements (r= and 3D measurements (r=0.790, p=0.002). The results of this study suggest that data from \u00b5CT reconstructions of OCD closely match microradiography results of the sample and are representative for the subchondral bony changes seen on histology. The region of subchondral trabecular architectural disruption was extensive both in widt h and in depth for each lesion which may have implications for dissecans, HYPERLACTATEMIA WITH ALDOSTERONE AND ARGININE VASOPRESSIN CONCENTRATIONS AND CLINICAL INDICATORS Medicine; Columbus, OH, USA; 2Hagyard Equine Medical Institute, Lexington, KY, USA; 3Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, Lexington, KY, USA. Critically ill foals often present with increased L- lactate concentratio ns . endocrine response in aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to maintain blood pressure, electrolyte balance and organ function . Several studies have investigated the ability of L -lactate concentrations to predict severity of disease and outcome in critically ill humans, horses and foals. However, information on the aldosterone and AVP response to hypovolemia in septic foals is limited. We hypothesized that septic foals will have higher L -lactate, aldosterone and AVP concentration compared to healthy foals. We also proposed that increased L- lactate, aldosterone , and AVP concentrations will be associated with markers of hypovolemia, renal function, and mortality in hospitalized foals. Blood samples were collected on admission from 96 septic (sepsis score >12), 182 sick non-septic (SNS), and 37 healthy foals of <3 days of median age. Blood concentrations of aldosterone, AV P were determined by immunoassays. Aldosterone and AVP concentrations were higher in septic compared to healthy foals (P<0.05). L-lactate concentration was higher in septic and SNS compared to healthy hypoperfusion Non- surviving septic foals had a higher L -lactate concentration than su rvivors (P<0.05). Admission L-lactate above 7.9 mmol/L could predict survival septic non- survival in hospitalized foals increased with every 1 unit increase for L-lactate concentrations (P<0.0 5). Based on the results of this study, tissue hypoperfusion in critically ill foals is characterized by elevated L- lactate, aldosterone, and AVP concentrations, and these factors can be used as predictors of non- survival in sick foals.

Traditionally indicated for unstable fracture/luxation injuries, canine cervical vertebral column stabilization is an emerging treatment option for dogs with cervical spondylomyelopathy. One longterm complication after stabilization is failure of im plants, especially if bony fusion between stabilized vertebrae has not occurred. The objective of this study was to compare the biomechanical effects of an intervertebral disk spacer in canine vertebral columns after monocortical titaniu m screw/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) fixation. The hypothesis was that addition of a spacer would significantly increase construct stiffness compared to cervical vertebral columns stabilized without the addition of a spacer . Six cervical vertebral columns were surgically stabilized at the C4- C5 articulation with a previously evaluated fixation method (monocortical screws/PMMA). Prior to stabilization, a partial diskectomy and placement of an intervertebral spacer into the distracted disk space were perform ed. Cortical ring allografts of appropriate dimensions served as spacers. Construct stiffness was determined by 4- point bend testing in extension, flexion and lateral bending. Data were compared to that of 6 specimens stabilized with the same fixation meth od but without an intervertebral spacer. Addition of an intervertebral disk spacer significantly increased stiffness in this cadaveric model (p=0.002). Clinical significance of these findings relates to the potential for improved load- sharing between vert ebrae and improved implant longevity until bony fusion may occur.

Although many studies have been performed to classify seizures by type in humans and small animals, similar study is lacking in horses. The purpose of this study was to 1) characterize the distribution of seizure types in 104 horses presented for seizure disorders to OSU Veterinary Medical Center in a retrospective case series; 2) further characterize the various type of seizures by identifying associated clinical factors. Seizures were classified based on ictal phenomenology and seizure type (axis 1 and 2, respectively), according to the most rec ent accepted definitions in both human and small animal epileptology. History, clinical and neurological observations, diagnostic investigations and postmortem examinations, when available, were recorded for univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Seizures were categorized as primary generalized in 23% of horses, focal without secondary generalization in 42% of cases and secondary generalized in 24% of cases. The type of seizures could not be classified in 11% of cases. Significant univar iate correlations were found between seizure type and: 1) gender; 2) frequency of seizures; and 3) presence of seizures during hospitalization. Seizure type was not significantly associated with etiology. For a horse with recurrent seizures (i.e., epilepsy ), the odds of having focal seizures was higher (OR=4, P=0.02) compared to a similar horse with non-recurring seizures, in the final logistic regression model. Similar to human and small animal classification, the majority of the seizures described were f ocal seizures with or without secondary generalization. The clinical presentation was independent of the underlying disease. This study provided a comprehensive classification of seizures by type and showed similarity between seizure semiology expressed in horses and other species.

Bednarski. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Peri-operative and long -term pain management is essential for dogs undergoing TPLO. Combination analgesic techniques may be superior to individual techniques in dogs after stifle surgery. Thirty -four dogs presented for tibia plateau leveling osteotomy (same surgeon) were randomly assigned to 4 groups (four group repeated measure ANOVA): 1) Coinfusion (MLK) of morphine (0.24 mg kg- 1); 3) MLK plus LE; 4) No additional analgesic drug administration after premedication. All dogs received acepromazine (0.02 - 0.1 mg kg- 1) and morphine (0.4 mg kg- 1) intramuscularly (pre- medication), propofol, and isoflurane in oxygen (depth controlled by adjusting vaporizer setting). Indices of cardiorespiratory function and isoflurane requirement were recorded prior to and at 5- minute inter vals during anesthesia. Coinfusion discontinued at the end of surgery. A validated Sedation Scoring System and the Modified Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Score were used by two blinded evaluators to assess comfort and sedation upon extubation, at 60 minut e intervals for 4 hours then every 4 hours for 24 hours Dogs with pain scores greater than 6 were given morphine (0.4 mg kg -1 IM). No differences in pain score, rescue analgesia requirement, or time to rescue analgesia were detected. Values (mean +/ - SD fo r groups 1,2,3 and 4 4.2). Rescue analgesia was administered to 4 of 7, 4 of 10, 3 of 8, and 3 of 9 dogs in each group for groups 1,2,3, and 4, respectively. No one technique demonstrated superior analgesia.

P. Martin -Vaquero , R.C. da Costa. Dept. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences. Morphometric investig ations improve our understanding of spinal diseases by comparing anatomic measurements of clinical normal and affected populations. The purpose of this study was to prospectively characterize and compare the cervical spine morphometry of Great Danes (GDs) with and without clinical signs of CSM using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty client -owned GDs were prospectively enrolled: 15 neurologically normal, and 15 with clinical signs compatible with CSM and confirmation using MRI . All dogs underwent 3.0 T MRI of the cervical spine (C2- 3 to T1 - 2 intervertebral spaces) . Cranial and caudal arti cular facets areas were measured and total facet area was calculated. V ertebra l canal and spinal cord height/width/ area were obtained at three different levels for eac h space. Right and left middle foraminal heights were measured. The same investig ator performed all measurements. I ntraobserver agreement was calculated. All measurements were compared for each intervertebral space between groups using a random -effects lin ear regression model. Mean age at the time of enrollment was 2.3 and 3.9 years for normal and CSM -GDs, respectively. Significant differences were found for the cranial articular facet area at all intervertebral spaces, caudal articular facet area at C6- 7, and total facet area at all spaces except T1- 2, with CSM -GDs having larger facet areas. The vertebral canal area measurements centered at the disc space and cranial aspect of the caudal vertebral body were significantly smaller in CSM -GDs from C2 -3 through C6-7. The spinal cord area was significantly smaller on the CSM -GDs at C5 -6 and C6- 7 for all 3 levels measured. Middle foraminal height was significantly smaller in CSM -GDs from C3 -4 through C7- T1. Intraobserver agreement was high for all measurements (median variation of 1.91%). This study provided the first MRI morphometric data of clinically norm al GDs. CSM -GDs have vertebral canal stenosis and marked foraminal stenosis throughout their cervical vertebral column when compared to normal GDs.

Department of Clinical Sciences1, All Animal Eye Care and Animal HealthQuest Solutions, Jupiter, FL2 Purpose : To determine if three antioxidants, grape seed extract (GSE) , acid s (O3FA), alter oxidative stress, migration, and proliferation in lens epithelial cells (LECs) . Methods : An antioxidant reductive capacity assay determined . A dichlorofluorescein ( DCF) assay evaluated the ability of antioxidants to reduce ROS production in UV stressed and unstressed LECs. Arrays were used to determ ine changes in protein expression following antioxidant treatments . An ex vivo model of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) was used to evaluate LEC migration and proliferation. Results : The antioxidant reductive effect of GSE surpassed the positive control, while lutein and O3FA showed reductive ability. The DCF assay corroborated this data; GSE reduced ROS production in both UV stressed and unstressed LEC cultures compared t o the positive control. Lutein appeared pro -oxidative and O3FA had littl e to no ability to reduce ROS. Protein arrays showed GSE decreased expression of IL- 6, IL-8, CCL3, and CCL5 compared to controls. Lutein and O3FA showed an increase or no change in expression of studied proteins as compared to controls. The ex vivo PCO mod el demonstrated increase d LEC number and migration resulting in increased area of the posterior lens capsule covered following treatment with O3FA, while GSE and lutein treatments were similar to controls. Conclusions : Only GSE showed substantial antioxidant capabilities with ability to reduce ROS generation. Lutein and O3FA demonstrated no antioxidant abilities and lutein proved pro- oxidative in vitro . Following treatment wi th antioxidants, unstressed LEC s showed altered expression of cytokines known to i nfluence redox signaling, migration, and proliferation. O3FA increased cell proliferation and migration in the ex vivo PCO model while GSE and lutein demonstrated little effect. Careful conclusions should be made regarding the effects of the studied antiox idants on LEC s due to findings of variable and limited reducing power.

Bertone. of Veterinary Clinical and Biosci ences Objective: To determine the potency (percent analgesia), duration of action (up to four months), and clinical and histological effects of surgical exposure and intra- neural injection of 98% dehydrated medical -grade ethyl alcohol compared to no treatment (negative control), sham operation (surgical control), or formaldehyde injection (positive control) to decrease experimentally -induced palmar heel pain in horses. Animals: Six horses Procedures: The horses were fitted with a custom pressure- inducin g shoe and had outcome measurements for each heel performed before and after nerve treatments. Outcomes included induced lameness grade and vertical peak force with pressure applied to each heel, thermal and touch sensation for each heel, and pastern circu mference. Outcomes were followed serially for 112 days when nerves were harvested for histology. Results: Alcohol and formaldehyde reduced all measures of heel pain which progressed toward return, but persisted over the 112 days of the study (P<0.05). Pas tern circumference was not different for alcohol than sham treatment, but was greater in formaldehyde than alcohol or baseline (P<0.05). Histological evaluation showed preservation of nerve fiber alignment with an intact epineurium, loss of axons (axon drop out), axon degeneration, fibrosis and inflammation in alcohol - and formaldehyde- injected nerves compared to control nerves. Formaldehyde injection induced greater fibrosis and inflammation than alcohol. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Alcohol injecti on induced effective neural blockade for months with evidence that nerve structure and function could return. Formaldehyde injection showed no advantage over alcohol and is not recommended under the conditions of our study due to soft tissue inflammation.

Mudge, R .E. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Rationale: Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is the result of sustained increases in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). Risk factors for IAH identified in people may be comparable to horses with colic due to abdominal/visceral distension, shock and hypoperfusion. IAH has been documented for individual horses, but this area remains minimally studied in cases of equine colic. The purpose of this study was to investigate abdominal pressures in horses with colic using a routine ventral abdominocentesis. Methods: Ventral abdominal cannulation and direct IAP measurements were collected from 53 horses with colic and 9 control horses. IAP was measured in triplicate at the end expiration and mean values were used for statistical analysis. Differences in IAP between horses grouped according to their type of colic, treatment and outcome were assessed using unpaired t -tests, one -way ANOVA was significant. Results: Ventral IAP was significantly higher in horses with colic controls (29mmHg and 25mmHg respectively; had ventral IAP greater than two standard deviations above the mean IAP of control horses and were considered to have IAH. 7/15 IAH horses had a large bowel obstruct ion and 5/15 IAH horses had small bowel obstruction. No difference in IA P was found between colic survivors and non -survivors (P=0.873) or between horses receiving medical versus surgical management (P=0.587) . IAP associated with small intestinal lesions was not different to large colon lesions (P=0.83) . Horses with large intestinal disease receiving medical management had a significantly higher IAP than horses with medical small intestinal lesions or surgical large intestinal lesions (36 mmHg, 25 mmHg and 27 mmHg respectively); P=0.0003. Conclusions : Acute abdominal disease in horses is associated with increased ventral abdominal IAP. Large intestinal medical disease showed highest IAP values. Magnitude of IAP increase did not predict management strategy or outcome.

Ge breyes1. 1Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 2Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, North Carolina State University , Raleigh, North Carolina. Heavy metals are included in the feed of swine to promote growth and improve feed efficiency . Heavy metal tolerance genes and multidrug resistance (MDR) have been identified among Salmonella strains ; however, the emergence and persistence, as well as the potential association betw een copper and zinc tolerance factors and antimicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens are poorly understood and not investigated in US. The objective is to identify and characterize the role of copper and zinc intervention in the emergence of heavy metal resistant Salmonella and its association with the emergence and persistence of MDR Salmonella in swine . We hypothesize that the use of heavy metals is associated with the occurrence and persistence of MDR Salmonella . A total of 351 Salmonella isolate s were selected; minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cu 2+ and Zn2+ and the presence of pcoA and czcD tolerance genes were determined. About 48% of the isolates were tolerant to Cu2+ at 24mM , while 52% showed tolerance ranging from 4mM to 20mM. About 58% of the isolates showed Zn2+ tolerance at 8mM and the remaining 42% showed tolerance at 4mM. Among the most tolerant isolates , the most common MDR patterns were AmClStSuTe and AmStTeKm , both commonly f ound in swine. Low Zn2+ MIC isolates were more likel y to be MDR than high Zn2+ MIC (P=0.0829). High Zn2+ MIC isolates were strongly associated with the AmClStSuTe R-type (P<0.0001) and they were more likely to carry the czcD gene (P<0.0001). High Cu2+ MIC isolates (>20 mM) were more likely to be MDR ( P=0.00 73), they were strongly associated with the R -type AmStTeKm (P<0.0001) and were more likely to carry pcoA gene (P=0.0003) than low Cu2+ MIC isolates (20 mM) . Findings suggest that t he use of in-feed Cu2+ and Zn2+ leads to a higher tolerance, which in turn co-selects antimicrobial resistance among Salmonella strains .

Bertran , M. Alizadeh, G. Knapik, W. S. Marras and M. J. Allen. Depts. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Integrated Systems Engineering Background: Accurate three- dimensional (3D) models of spine are required in applications such as implant design, finite element analysis and computer -aided surgical planning. Computed tomog raphy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently the gold standard for the acquisition of anatomic data from live patients . The objective of the current study was to compare the accuracy of a novel surface imaging method, white light scanning (WLS) , to that of CT for the generation of a 3D model of the canine cervical (Ce) spine. We hypothesized that CT-based models would be sensitive to partial volume effects due to variations in user-selected CT thresholds. Additionally, we sought to determine the feasibility of fusing WLS , MRI and CT data in order to generate a high fidelity 3D model of the Ce spine . Methods: An isolated canine Ce spine underwent CT scan and WLS. Eleven different models were then created; 1 generated from the WLS data and 10 models with different threshold settings ( with different threshold selections ) were generated from the CT data. Geometric deviations were calculated between the WLS model and the ten models generated from the CT data. A second intact cervical spine was the n imaged by MRI, CT and WLS, with the data being fused to generate a composite anatomic model. Results: Variations in CT threshold resulted in measurable differences in model geometry. Differences were also seen between levels when using the same threshol d suggesting inevitable inaccuracies during CT modeling of a structure. WLS provided a high- resolution model of the cervical spine and we are currently working to fuse the MRI and CT data into this model. Discussion: This study form s the foundation of ong oing work in which we are fusing WLS data with advanced imaging data to construct anatomically accurate 3D models for surgical simulation of the canine cervical spine.

Slemons. Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine Agricultural exhibitions are the primary setting in the United States in which swine from various sources and humans commingle, providing opportunity for bi -directional zoonotic transmission of influenza A viruses (IAV) . This animal -human interface proved active in 2012 when 306 human cases of infection with influenza A (H3N2) variant virus (H3N2v) were epidemiologically associated with agricultural exhibitions in 10 states, resulting in 16 hospitalizations and one death. Public health officials in Ohio documented 107 H3N2v cases during 2012, second only to Indiana. Here we compare 14 swine -origin H3N2 IAV isolates containing the M gene from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, termed H3N2pM, recovered from pigs at seven agricultural exhibitions in Ohio during 2012 to seven H3N2v human isolates contracted at each of those respective exhibitions . These data, obtained from active IAV surveillance in exhibition swine, provide a unique view of IAV activity occurring at the swine- human interface at agricultural exhibitions . Nucleotide identity of the H3N2 isolates recovered from both humans and swine at all seven exhibitions was greater than 99%, indicating that the same swine- origin H3N2 pM IAV infected exhibition swine at numerous exhibitions and was transmitted to humans in at least seven separate events occurring at geographically disparate locations across Ohio over a period of several weeks . Phylogenic analyses showed this H3N2pM virus was similar to contemporary H3N2pM isolates recovered from North American swine. These results provide mol ecular evidence that zoonotic transmission was widespread and confirm s the epidemiological linkages between human H3N2v cases and swine exposure at agricultural exhibitions . The results of the current study demonstrate the need to define the ecology and evolution of IAVs in exhibition swine. Swine-to-human transmission of IAV occurred with an unprecedented frequency in 2012 necessitating the development of veterinary and public health interventions to reduce inter - and intra- species transmission of influenza A viruses at swine exhibitions.

L da Costa , P Rajala -Schultz, A Hoet, G Schuenemann . Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the most prevalent contagious mastitis pathogen in US dairies , and mastitis is the main reason for antimicrobial use in dairy herds. The use of antimicrobials in agriculture has, in general, been blamed as one of the potential causes of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureu s (MRSA ) has emerged as a concern in veterinary medicine in the past years i n Europe. In the USA, a limited number of studies have been published in dairy herds and a low prevalence of MRSA has been reported in those . Purpose: The objective of this study was to estimate MRSA prevalence in Ohio dairies and the hypothesis wa s that MRSA w ould be found in milk but in low prevalence. Material and Methods: Bulk tank milk fro m 307 Ohio dairies was cultured for isolation and identification of SA, using selective Baird Parker media, Gram stain, and positive catalase and coagulase tests. A duplex PCR using relatedness isolates was determined using pulsed- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Staphylococcus protein A (spa) typing, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) typing. Results/Conclusion: Over two -thirds (69%) of the bulk tank milk samples were found positive for SA. For this project, 209 SA isolates from SA positive herd, distributed across the state were screened. MRSA was detected in two isolates from the same farm (herd prevalence <0.5%), collected at different time points. Both isolates appear ed highly clonal and belonged to, USA200, spa type t021 , SCC type IV , designed as a community -acquired strain. These results confirm that MRSA can be isolated from milk in Ohio dairies although with a low prevalence. Further studies should investigate the epidemiology and mode of transmission of this very important pathogen.

Studying the epizootiology of Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) is an integral part of control efforts in the face of an increasing poultry epidemic . vlhA is the only MS gene identified as the target for sequence typing . The 5' third of the gene is relatively conserved and can be used for geno typing purposes while t he 3' two thirds of the gene are variable. The source for such variation is suggested to be g ene conversion between a single expressed gene and a family of pseudogenes . However, no data is available on the location beyond which the gene conversion process could occur . The purpose of this study is to pi npoint the end of the conserved region and the exact beginning of the variable region. A new PCR assay was designed to amplify a larger segment of the gene which spans the conserved region and part of the variable region. Ampl ification and sequencing were performed on c linical MS samples and on the in -vitro sequential generations of standard MS strain. This allowed both retrospective and prospective investigation of the gene conversion incidence. A 3 base segment was observed as the most proximal point where the gene conversion could occur . This segment is proposed to mark the beginning of the variable region and depict the extent of conserved region. This in turn identifies the maximum discriminatory potential that could be harnessed from this gene . Additionally t he new PCR can offer a feasible studying tool for the vlhA gene variation frequency and mechanisms gene EAR - 6 ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEILLANCE FOR EXTENDED SPECTRUM -LACTAMASE RESISTANCE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI AT THE JACKSON PIKE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT . CA King , DF Mollenkopf, and TE Wittum, Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University. In response to ever increasing use of antibiotics, bacteria are evolving resistance to critical frontline drugs that fight deadly invasive Gram -negative infections. The most serious threat is bacteria that are resistant to carbapenem drugs. Bacteria gain t his resistance by acquiring mobile genes that confer the ability to produce enzymes that inactivate the antibiotic. Two genes, blaKPC and blaNDM -1, are known to encode the ability to produce carbapenemase. While blaKPC is known to be present in the US, blaNDM -1 is primarily disseminated in India. Because of the frequency of international travel we hypothesized that bla NDM -1 could be present in Ohio waste- water plants. The purpose of this study was to determine if carbapenem -resistant E. coli were present in Columbus wastewater, and to fully characterize those isolates and their resistance mechanisms. We collected 334 samples of untreated sewage water at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Plant between June and August of 2011 and 2012. Using selective media, we identified 158 (47.3%) samples with suspect colonies that grew in the presence of 1 mg/L of meropenem. Of these, 51 (32.9%) were classified as meropenem resistant using Kirby - Bauer disk diffusion assay and 29 isolates were also confirmed to be E. coli using biochemical tests and PCR. These isolates were resistant to most of the 26 drugs on our MIC panels using micro- broth dilution. Carbapenemase production was verified for 76 isolates using the Modified Hodge test. However, none of the isolates w ere positive on the Double Disk Diffusion test, indicating absence of metallo- -lactamase production. Our detection of these isolates suggests the presence of a reservoir of important resistance genes for pathogens. Furthermore, resistant E. coli can becom e pathogenic in hospital environments where patients may be more susceptible to infections. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is an important part of education, awareness, and prevention in the public health sector.

D. Mathys , D. Mollenkopf , T. Wittum,. Dept. of Veterinary Preventive Medicine. The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine. Objective: blaCMY and blaCTX-M are genes that allow bacterial production of extended- spectrum beta lactamases that confer resistance to important c ephalosporin antimicrobials . The epidemiology of these resistance genes has been described for food animal population s. However, little is known about the frequency and dis tribution of these resistance genes in the flora of companion animal populations. The a im of this study is to estimate the preval ence of these resistance ge nes in the fecal flora of the general canine population providing samples for parasitology testing at the OSU Veterinary Medical Center. Methods : We obtained fecal samples from 60 dog submissions for parasite screening from Jan. 22 - Feb. 19, 2013. Approximately 4g of feces were incubated overnight in nutrient broth containing 4 ul/ml of c efotaxime . These samples were then streaked o nto 3 different MacConkey agar plates containing 2 ul/ml of m or cefoxiti n. Results: We fou nd 42 fecal samples produced c efoxiti n-resistant isolates , representing the expected phenotype of blaCMY. Therefore the estimated prevalence of blaCMY in the general canine population at the OSU VMC is 70% (95% CI 58%-82%). We found that 4 samples produced c efipime resistant isolates, representing the expected phenotype of blaCTX-M. The estimated prevalence of b laCTX-M in the general canine population at the OSU VM C is therefore 6.67% (95% CI 0.2% - 13.2% ). Of these 46 isolates, 78% were lactose and indole positive, indicating that they are E. coli . The remainder likely represents other common enteric bacteria, such as Klebsiella spp. Discussion : Our results suggest that the general dog population has similar fecal prevalence of blaCTX-M and blaCMY as has been reported in livestock populations. Additional investigation to identify populations at greatest risk would be beneficial to determine important risk factors, such as chronic antibiotic use, surgical implant, ICU patient , or other high risk populations.

A McMurray , M Allen, W Drost, B Chaffee, and K La Perle . Depts. of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Clinical Sciences Introduction: Osteosarcoma (OSA) is a common canine cancer . Presence of and progression or regression of pulmonary metastasis has bearing on prognosis and treatment. An objective in -vivo method for measuring efficacy of treatments is lacking . Most studies involv e euthanasia of large numbers of mice at different time points to track the effect of treatment via histopathology which precludes assessment of individual treatment response. Our purpose was to determine whether micro- computed tomography with positron emission tomography (CT/PET) was more sensitive for pulmonary metastasis than CT alone and if PET could quantify active pulmonary metastatic load. Methods: Twelve mice had canine osteosarcoma cells injected into their right tibias. Mice were imaged and CT and CT/PET images evaluated at 3 and 5 weeks post injection. Volumes of interest (VOI) were drawn around the lungs on CT then applied to corresponding PET images and fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG) uptake measured . Lung standard uptake value s (SUV) were divided by corresponding liver SUV s. The SUV ratios were compared. Mice were euthanized after imaging at 5 weeks and histopathology and stereologic analysis were performed. Results: 10/12 mice had confirmed metastasis 5 weeks post -injectio n. PET and CT findings were concordant for 70% of the nodules. In 15% of cases, PET scans identified a nodule not initially evident on CT , and in 10% of cases a nodule was indicated that was not seen on CT. In 5% of cases , nodules identified on CT were not identified on PET . A statistical difference was not found between the 2 time points (paired t test p= 0.075). SUV values did not correlate to metastatic load. Conclusion: CT/PET improved detection or confirm ation of pulmonary metastasis compared to CT alone . In this model, PET d id not quantify metastatic load. Possible reasons include respiratory motion, variable uptake of 18F-FDG or overlap of signal from nearby anatomic structures.

Wittum1. 1Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Columbus, OH; 2Diagnostic Bacteriology Laboratory, USDA - APHIS- VS-NVSL, Ames, IA. Extended- spectrum cephalosporin drugs are approved for veterinary use in livestock worldwide. In the US, extended activity formulations are frequently applied prophylactically to intensively managed l ivestock housed in population- dense environments conducive to the exchange of enteric flora. Bacterial resistance to these drugs is conferred by -lactamase production which is encoded by genes such as bla CTX-M. The widespread dissemination of Salmonella spp. carrying bla CTX-M would pose a threat to animal health and well -being, and their zoonotic food -borne transmission would pose a public health concern. We screened 2034 Salmonella clinical diagnostic submissions to the USDA APHIS NVSL between October 201 0 and June 2011 for the blaCTX-M phenotype. We identified 12 (0.6%) Salmonella spp. isolates carrying bla CTX-M on mobile plasmids. We found 6 of 88 (6.8 %) turkey diagnostic submissions carrying blaCTX-M. Of these, one S . Bredeney carried bla CTX-M-1 on an IncN plasmid. The remaining 5 turkey isolates were S . Ouakam received from March to May 2011 originating from 3 US states carrying bla CTX-M-1 on IncN plasmids. One additional S . Ouakam carrying bla CTX-M-1 was identified among submissions received August 2011. One of 940 (0.1 %) swine diagnostic submission was a rough O:d:e,n,z15 isolate carrying bla CTX-M-1 on an IncN plasmid. We found 5 of 143 (3.5 %) equine submissions all from one state between November 2010 and March 2011 were S . Anatum, one carried blaCTX-M-1 on an IncN plasmid and the remaining 4 carried CTX-M-1 on IncI1 plasmids. All IncN plasmids were ST1 which has been reported to be epidemic in Europe, indicating pandemic dissemination of this plasmid. None of the 581 cattle, 83 chicken, or 199 s ubmissions from other species carried blaCTX-M. The emergence of multiple Salmonella spp. carrying bla CTX-M in diverse US livestock populations is an important concern for both animal and public health.

Garabed1 1Veterinary Preventive Medicine Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite primarily described as a cause of abortion in cattle and a disease of the central nervous system in dogs. A sylvatic cycle of the parasite has also been demonstrated to exist in some wildlife species, such as white - tailed deer and coyotes . However, there are limited investigations on Neospora caninum having an effect in the dynamic of nondomestic ruminant's populations. Therefore, we focus our study of Neosporosis and its effect o n wildlife and recovering populations in order to help conserv e endangered species . The Wilds , a safari zoo and conservation center with the main mission of breeding endanger ed species has reported a positive prevalence in American bison. Therefore, t he goal of this project is to evaluate the effect of Nesopora caninum in a bison ( Bison bison) population at the Wilds. We used a structured population model that incorporates demographic data ( i.e., age classes , fecundity, mortality ) and epidemiological transitions (i.e., susceptible, infected and recovery classes). The dataset contains around 10 years of Bison demographic data (births, deaths, gender and fertility ) and disease parameter values are obtained from the literature. Model simulated give age related prevalence in the herd for 20 years . Also, we did a sensitivity analysis to explore how a small perturbation in vital rates such as fecundity and survival may affect the per capita growth rate () and to identify what ages may be the most important for pathogen control. This project is in progress, thus we hope to implement bison disease data to make a more accurate model. This type of model can be applied to understand the disease ecology in different host species, including livestock in which econo mic losses are driving the study of control measures.

L. Mu\u00f1oz -Vargas , Wittum . Dept. of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Resistance to antimicrobials has been observed in the enteric flora of a variety of wildlife species. Deer and other wild small mammals have been implicated as potential reservoirs for maintaining bacterial resistance within natural habitats. Additionally , they may reflect the dissemination of resistant organisms and resistance genes into the environment from other sources. W e assessed the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli strains isolate d from fecal samples collected from wild Ohio white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) living in the Cleveland Metropark System . Fecal samples were collected from individual deer during the annual cull intended to control overpopulation. Indivi dual fecal samples were inoculated onto MacConkey agar , and a single isolated E. coli from each sample was subsequently selected for further characterization. Minimum inhibitory c oncentrations (MICs) for 15 antimicrobial agents were performed for 462 isolates recovered before 2009 and 228 isolates from 2012 using micro -broth dilution . Increase of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli strains between the years was observed for amoxicillin/clavulanic largest i ncrease in resistance was observed for sulfisoxazole which MIC s mean changed from 17.6 ug/ml (sd=16.7) to 57.0 ug/ml (sd=59.1) , and the proportion resistant from 0.004 to 0.065. No increase in MIC was observed for the drugs ceftiofur, g entamicin , tetracycline, or trimetoprim/s ulfamethoxazole. It has been suggested that n atural environments can potentially become contaminated by antimicrobial residues from livestock operations that are spread in water or soil. However, the factors influencing the changes in resistance of enteric flora of the deer population living in this a rea remain s unknown.

EAR - 12 ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE FOR MRSA IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND CANINE PATIENTS OF A SMALL ANIMAL TEACHING HOSPITAL . J. Van Balen 1, C. Kelly2, R. C. Nava S. Bateman1, T. A. E. Hoet1,2. 1College of Veterinary Medicine, 2College of Public Health; The Ohio State University. Infectious disease prevention and control programs are critical for manag ing pathogens such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in veterinary hospitals . To understand the molecular epidemiolog y and ecology of this bacter ium in the hospital environment , an active MRSA surveillance program was established at the OSU Veterinary Medical Center. Molecular epidemiological analysis was performed on environmental and canine- origin MRSA isolates. Antimi crobial typing , and dendr ographic analysis were used to characterize and analyze these isolates. Overall, 13.7% of the surfaces sampled were contaminated with MRSA through the year. During this time, 91.4% of the environmental isolates collected were SCC mec type II and 88.9% USA100, which is consistent with HA -MRSA. This reflects a low diversity of MRSA strains circulating in the hospital. One unique PFGE pulsotype was the most prevalent for 5 consecutive months, circulating among different surfaces and hospital locations. It was later replaced by a combination of several different strains , some of which were only detected once on one surface, and others that were found up to 4 consecutive months in different locat ions and surfaces. The molecular analysis of isolates also suggested that incoming MRSA positive dogs were capable of introducing a new strain not previously seen in the hospital environment. Based on these results , it is evident that once a MRSA strain is introduced into the hospital, it can be easily spread and maintained in the environment over time. This information has been used to develop biosecurity and biocontainment protocols with the goal of decreasing student and personnel occupational exposure t o MRSA, in addition to protecting our patients and their owners from potential nosocomial or zoonotic transmission of this pathogen.

Departments of Veterinary Biosciences and Veterinary Clinical Sciences Recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have allowed researchers to identify genes and molecules associated with cancer in people . Understanding the genetics and behavior of genes and proteins in cancer cells prov ides information for prevention and early detection, and enables researchers to identify targets for new drug therapies. Millions of dogs and cats are diagnosed with cancer each year. We have only begun to investigate the genetics and molecular biology of cancer in dogs and cats , but based on advances in human medicine, it is likely that similar progress can be made in the ear ly detection, treatment, and prevention of cancer in veterinary medicine. The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine established the Biospecimen Repository or \"Tissue Bank\" to collect tissue samples from dogs and cats with cancer so that the genetics and molecular biology can be more closely studied. The Tissue Bank collects samples of tumors and normal tissue from dogs and cats, and stores these tissues under controlled conditions for future use by multiple investigators. Tissues are collec ted and archived only after receiving informed consent from the owners. The types of biological materials that are processed include a piece of the tumor, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor, whole blood, plasma, serum, and urine. Samples are preserved in liquid nitrogen, formalin and Optimum Cutting Temperature (OCT ) medi um. This tissue bank will serve as a tremendous resource with the ultimate goal of developing new prevention and treatment strategies for companion animals with a variety of illnesses. Because the biology and behavior of m any types of cancer in dogs and cat s are similar to cancer in humans , knowledge gained from research on companion animal cancer patients benefits both people and pets.

The Comparative Pathology & Mouse Phenotyping Shared Resource (CPMPSR) at The Ohio State University supplies readily available, affordable, expert experimental pathology support to investigators utilizing animal models of human and veterinary disease. The CPMPSR c omparative pathologists are familiar with the normal anatomy, physiology, and pathology of many animal species, including the potential impact of confounding factors such as age- and strain- related background lesions, pathogens, and husbandry practices on study outcomes. Primary research interests for the CPMPSR pathol ogists encompass cancer biology , toxicologic pathology. However, translational research based on any animal model is supported. The CPMPSR offers a full array of path ology services, and can tailor its support to the needs of a client. Routine procedures include comprehensive macroscopic and microscopic examinations with an emphasis on phenotyp e characterization of newly produced lines of genetically engineered mice as well as pre -clinical efficacy and toxicity studies. Other common methods include clinical chemistry, hematology, radiography, whole slide digitization (Aperio), frozen and paraffin slide preparation, tissue microarray preparation, and many special histoche mical and immunohistochemical staining techniques. The CPMPSR pathologists are valuable collaborators for all facets of animal model development including study design, optimal sample collection, data analysis and interpretation, and communication. The CPM PSR was created to serve the experimental pathology needs of investigators at The Ohio State University, especially those in the seven health- related schools and the Comprehensive Cancer Center.

The CTO works closely with the Ohio State Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences, Ohio State Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Nationwide Children's Hospital as well as pharmaceutical companies across the country to bring advanced diagnostic techniques and new treatments for animals with a variety of diseases , with the ultimate goal of translating these findings into human medicine. The CTO provides assistance in the design, execution, and evaluation of veterinary clinical trials of client owned animals, as well as familiarizes those involved in the principle s of Good Clinical Practice/ Good Laboratory Practice (GCP/GLP) guidelines. The CTO facilitates the conduct of such studies through input into clinical trial design, networking with regional veterinarians to insure timely enrollment, assistance in collection and coordination of data, and establishment of standard operating procedures (SOPs). There are several advantages for patients and clients to participate in a clinical trial. In many cases all of the costs associated with the study are covered. Clinic al trials frequently provide a financial credit at the Veterinary Medical Center for future treatments and patients enrolled in clinical trials often receive advanced therapies not currently available. The CTO has established and maintained a network of regional specialists and veterinarians to assist with patient enrollment, through newsletters and periodic updates. Plans are also underway to set up satellite locations in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh areas to enhance recruitment into various studies. Clients may participate knowing that these studies provide critical new information that helps advance the treatment of humans with similar diseases. Over that past four years the CTO has supervised more than 80 c linical trials involving over 2000 cl ient-owned animals. These studies have provided an unparalleled opportunity for animals and their owners to participate in state- of-the art treatments that have helped to shape the future of both veterinary and human medicine. The ability to perform effect ive and well -executed clinical trials also enhances the regional, national and international recognition of the OSU CVM as a center for veterinary research, contributing to the advancement of both veterinary and human health.

A.T. Amburgy and B. A. Scansen, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Pulmonary valve stenosis (PS), a common congenital heart defect in dogs, results from a developmental abnormality in the right ventricular outflow tract whereby the valve leaflet s are thickened and fused. Dogs with PS may progress to show signs of lethargy, collapse, right heart failure, or sudden death. S ymptoms of PS can be alleviated or delayed with balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) , though balloon size chosen for BPV requires an accurate measurement of the pulmonary valve diameter, which can be estimated by either echocardiography or angiography. The purpose of this study was to determine if the two methods commonly employed to estimate the pulmonary valve diameter are comparable i n a population of dogs with PS. Records from the OSU VMC Cardiology Service of dogs with PS who had both an echocardiogram and a right ventricular angiogram were reviewed. Echocardiographic and angiographic measurements were obtained at 3 phases of the cardiac cycle (onset of systole, end systole, end diastole), each measured in triplicate by a single observer for both imaging modalities . All data was analyzed for descriptive statistics and normality. The comparison between methods was made by the Spearman rank -order correlation coefficient and the method of Bland and Altman. Forty dogs had sufficient imaging to be included in the study; the median age of the dogs was 6 months. At all phases of the cardiac cycle, the angiographic vs. echocardiographic measure of pulmonary valve diameter showed near perfect correlation (r = 0.99) with minimal bias and tight limits of agreement. These data suggest that either echocardiography or angiography can be used to obtain a measurement of pulmonary valve diameter, with both providing comparable results at all phases of the cardiac cycle.

Veterinary Preventive Medicine and University Laboratory Animal Resources Swine are often used as surgical research and teaching models because of their size, physiologic and anatomic similarities to man. The aim of thi s study was to compare three thermal supple mentation devices during experimental swine surgeries . The cardiovascular and CNS effects of anesthesia can result in intraoperative hypothermia. Maintaining intraoperative normothermia is not only beneficial for the patient, but also for any surgical research or teaching, since it best simulates normal surgical operating conditions. The devices compared in this study were the Bair -Hugger, the circulating warm water blanket, and a heated table. Both survival and non- survival surgeries were analyzed, and esophageal temperatures were recorded every 15 minutes from the onset of anesthesia. Significant results were observed following data analysis for the animals in the non- survival data set . None of the selected devices maintained normothermia after the ons et of anesthesia , however thermal supplementation minimized the degree of thermal loss. Use of the Bair -Hugger maintained higher body temperatures compared to the control after 90 minutes of surgery. Furthermore, the Bair-Hugger maintained higher body temperatures when compared to the heated table after 150 minutes of surgery. Finally, both the Bair -Hugger and circulating water blanket maintained higher body temperatures when compared to the heated table at 180 minutes. These data show that the Bair -Hugger is the best device analyzed at maintaining temperature, followed by the circulating water blanket.

Bonagura, and L. Visser. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences ; The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine Introduction: Chronic mitral regurgitation (MR) due to degenerative valve disease is the most important cause of congestive heart failure (CHF) in dogs , with >10% of the older canine population affected. Staging severity of MR and recognizing CHF depends on identification of left atri al (LA) and ventricular (LV) dilation. Echocardiographic methods currently used to assess LA size do not record maximal chamber size and are relatively insensitive to enlargement. A simplified approach has been proposed that uses linear measurements to cre ate ratios of the LA/aortic root (Ao); LV/Ao; and LA/LV with Ao from each subject serving as the internal reference. We hypothesized that diameter ratios could predict ACVIM functional class of heart disease in dogs with MR. Methods and Procedures: Three groups of dogs were studied: Control Group A (n=24) were dogs (4.8- 20 kg) without heart disease; Group B (n=14) were 14 healthy dogs with compensated MR; Group C (n=7) were in CHF due to MR. Echocardiography -derived LA/Ao, LV/Ao, and LA/LV were calculated for each dog. Descriptive statistics were calculated and differences across groups compared using ANOVA (Welch's correction) and Dunnet's (T3) multiple- comparison test. Receiver operator characteristic curves analysis was performed to calculate cut -offs fo r identifying heart disease and CHF. Results: LA/Ao for Groups A, B, and C increased with progressive severity of MR with mean(SD) values of 2.02(.22), 2.47(.43), and 3.77(.51), respectively (p<0.05). The 95% confidence interval LA/Ao in Controls was 1.7 -2.5. LA/Ao>2.2 was ~80% sensitive and specific (likelihood ratio 3.7) and LA/Ao>2.6 was 100% specific but insensitive for recognizing heart 89.8%). Conclusions: 2D echocardiographic ratios referenced to aortic diameter can identify cardiomegaly associated with MR and follow the progression of disease. LA/Ao>2.6 defines cardiomegaly; values > 3.3 DETERMINATION OF R EFERENCE ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS IN THE BENGAL CAT. K.L. Ferguson and B.A. Scansen. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Echocardiography is the gold standard clinical test in veterinary medicine to detect functional and morphological changes of the heart. The Bengal breed is a relatively new breed of cat and is considered a hybrid, created by crossing the Asian Leopard Cat with the domestic cat; however, measurements of Bengal heart size are currently compared to referenc e intervals established for all cats . The purpose of this study was to evaluate echocardiographic exams from asymptomatic Bengal cats, which were interpreted by board- certified cardiologist s to be structurally normal. Echocardiograms were reviewed either from a retrospective database (n=39) or prospectively recruited for this study (n=10). A single observer (KLF) measured each echocardiogram and averaged variables of heart size and function over 3 cardiac cycles . Forty -nine cats were enrolled in the study, 25 of which were male. The median age at the time of the echocardiogram was 2 years and the median weight was 4.2 kg. The median weight of the females (3.6 kg) was statistically smaller than the males (5.0 kg). Measures of heart size were all within expected feline reference intervals for the female Bengals . However, the male Bengals had significantly larger (95% CI: 3.8-6.0 mm) than the females. In addition, the upper 95% measures of heart size for the males were consistently greater than reported feline reference intervals. This study established measurements of heart size for apparently healthy Bengal cats. Of clinical importance is the finding that the hearts of male Bengal cats measure larger than what is traditionally considered normal for the domestic cat.

D. Gale , J. Au, B. Hettlich, M. Allen, T. Motta. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences The circumfabellar -tibial suture (commonly referred to as the lateral suture) is a common procedure in private practice for the repair of the cruciate deficit stifle. The suture is placed such that it eliminates cranial thrust by maintaining the tension applie d to the prosthesis at the time of implantation. While it may seem desirable to completely eliminate cranial drawer, excessive suture tension may be more detrimental than minor joint instability. Excessive tension can cause premature failure of prothesis, may cause abnormal pressures within the joint, eliminate normal range of motion, and induce significant excessive external rotation of the tibia, which can lead to abnormal cartilage and meniscal wear, and degenerative joint disease/osteoarthritis This stu dy used three- dimensional motion capture technology to determine the changes in tibial translation and rotation after the placement of the lateral suture at different applied tension. We hypothesize that tibial translation and the degree of internal and ex ternal rotation was different depending on the applied tension to the lateral suture. The Polaris Vicra motion capture technology measured tibal translation and rotation in relation to the femur in the normal and cruciate deficient stifle. A Fiberwire\u00ae lat eral suture was applied to the stifle and tightened to different tensile forces (20- 100N, in increments of 20N), as Arthrex's with (1.10mm \u00b1 0.43) and internal rotation (0.43\u00b0 medially) while weight bearing, which is exaggerated in the deficient stifle (translation: 9.2mm \u00b1 0.22; rotation 14\u00b0 to the suture exceeded 60N caudal translation and external rotation of the t ibia were observed. Excessive tightening of the suture caused caudal translation and abnormal external rotation of the tibia. These conditions are not biomechanically normal for the stifle.

G. Glucksman , B. Hettlich, M.J. Allen, G . Fosgate, and A. Litsky. Departments of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Orthopaedics, College of Medicine, and Biomedical Engin eering, College of Engineering Our objective was to compare the biomechanical effects of an intervertebral disk spacer in a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) model simulating the canine cervical vertebral column after monocortical titanium screw/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) fixation. Our hypothesis was that addition of a spacer would significantly increase construct stiffness and improve fatigue resistance of the construct. A cervical intervertebral space was simulated using two PVC pipes separated by a gap and multidirectional stiffness was determined with and without an intervertebral disk spacer. PVC pipe (12.7 mm OD, 2 mm wall thickness) was cut at a 30- degree angle to create a gap model mimicking vertebral endplate orientation and disk space width similar to that of a large- breed dog. Twelve models were created, six with a 4- mm gap with no spacer (group 1), and six with a spacer filling the gap (group 2). Spacers were made out of 4 -mm thick rings cut perpendicularly from PVC pipes to simulate a cortical ring allograft used in clinical patients with cervical distraction/fusion. All models were instrumented with monocortical titanium screws and PMMA for fixation of the simulated disk space. Construct stiffness in both groups was determined by 4 -point bend testing in extension, flexion and lateral bending. Addition of an intervertebral disk spacer significantly increased stiffness in this model (p<0.001). Preliminary data on load to failure and cyclic loading also support use of a spacer. Next, testing will be performed on canine cadaveric cervical vertebral columns stabilized by monocortical screw/PMMA fixation, with and without an intervertebral spacer. If similar results are found, this could have a large clinical impact as the addition of a disk spacer would allow load- sharing between vertebrae, thereby off -loading the applied fixation and improving longevity of spinal implan ts until bony fusion occurs.

Herron, M.; Kirby -Madden, T. ; Lord, L. Depts. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Veterinary Preventative Medicine Objective - To determine if food- toy enrichment combined with cage- behavior training increased desirable behaviors and/or adoption rates in shelter dogs. Design - Prospective study Animals - 107 dogs Procedures - Dogs placed up for adoption in a municipal shelter were randomly assigned to either an enrichment treatment group (n=48) or control group (n=59). Treatment group subjects were exposed to an environmental enrichment and training protocol consisting of twice- daily cage- behavior training and provision of a daily food- filled toy a. Cage -behavior training included operant conditioning via positive reinforcement of \"desirable\" behaviors, including approaching the front of the cage, sitting or lying, and remaining quiet when approached. Behavioral observations were performed by a blinded observer using a scan- sampling techni que on day 0 (first day on adoption floor) and again on day 3. Body posture, location in cage, and other behavioral parameters were recorded. Adoption information and behavioral observation data were compared between groups. Results - Dogs exposed to the enrichment protocol were more likely to show an increase in desirable behaviors on day 3, compared to day 0, including sitting or lying down (68% vs. 22%, p <0.0001), and being quiet (40% vs. 22%, p = 0.017); and a decrease in undesirable behavior - jumping (54% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001) than dogs in the control group. Location in cage, fearfulness, and eye contact were not significantly different between groups. Survival analysis revealed no significant difference in adoption rates between groups. Conclusions - Results suggest that enrichment programs improve desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behavior in shelter dogs which may enhance basic welfare and adoptability. aKongTM Keywords: Shelter, enrichment, dogs, behavior, welfare VME - 8 EFFECTS OF IMPLANT MALPOSITIONING ON LOAD TRANSFER FOLLOWING TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT IN DOGS. M. Martinez 1, J. Bertran1, A. Adams2*, R. Siston2*, M. Allen1. Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences; Department of Mechanical Engineering*. Introduction: In humans malalignment of TKR (Total Knee Replacement) implants is associated with an increased risk of early implant failure. We hypothesized that alterations in varus -valgus alignment would be associated with qualitative changes in the pattern of femorotibial contact and statistically significant changes in load transfer within the canine medial and lateral joint compartments. Materials and Methods: Custom tibial inserts with zero, three or five degrees of varus or valgus angulation were used to create clinically relevant degrees of implant malalignment. Limbs were loaded axially and the distribution and magnitude of femorotibial load transfer was measured using thin- film pressure sensors . The distribution of contact pressures within the medial and lateral compartments of the TKR were determined using pressure- sensitive film that was placed between the femoral and tibial components. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance and a significance level of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Valgus angulation resulted in preferential loading of the medial compartment (8 of 8 limbs) and reduced loading of the lateral compartment (5 of 8 limbs). In contrast, varus angulation increased lateral compartment load transfer (6 of 8 limbs) while decreasing medial compartment loading (7 of 8 limbs). Discussion/Conclusion: Data from these exper iments support the hypothesis that implant malalignment alters load distribution in canine TKR. The clinical significance of these data remains to be determined and we plan to use the findings from this study to develop a retrieval analysis program.

Adin1. 1Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Ohio State University . 2Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Ohio State University . 3Department of Surgery, Ohio State University Transplantation of pancreatic islets is recognized as a potential curative therapy for Type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) . However, islet s are extremely susceptible to the mechanical, hypoxic and immunologic stresses associated with transplantation, causing a high rate of failure. Our overall goal is to evaluate a novel technique to improve islet cell survival , involving dual nanoporous encapsulation and local delivery of the incretin hormone exenatide . In this initial study we used in vitro models to tune exenatide drug delivery and biocom patibility of the implant materials prior to applying the technique in animal models. First, w e used an inverted plate technique to investigate the kinetics of exenatide diffusion across a nanoporous drug delivery membrane . Outer chambers of an inverted 6- well culture plate contain ed RPMI; inner chambers contained one of two different conc entrations ). Exenatide concentrations in the outer chamber were measured over 24 hours and a drug concentration curve was constructed . Based on these data, a 10ug/mL concentration of exenatide is required to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations (10nM) during long - term implantation. Next, we investiga ted the effect of implant material and hydrophilic Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) coating on implant biocompatibility using a fibroblast adhesion model . There was no significant difference in fibroblast adherence for the three materials studie d: polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) . PEG coating significantly improved fibroblast growth resistance on PMMA, but did not significantly improve the biocompatibility of PC and PS membranes. These data were used to construct a biocompatible transplantation device (using PC and PMMA materials) with two nanoporous gates, allowing exenatide delivery and diffusion of insulin and nutrients . Future plans incl ude the implementation of dual encapsulated islets and exenatide for in- vivo studies in mice and dogs, with the ultimate goal of curing human TIDM.

The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences 1 and Veterinary Medical Center2; The OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center3 (Columbus, OH); Sighthounds , including Deerhounds, have unique physiological traits that result in laboratory test results that may lie outside reference intervals for dogs in general. Although the reference intervals for most analytes are thought to be similar among sighthound breeds, specific reference intervals for sighthounds are available mainly for the Greyhound. The aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemical profiles in Deerhounds. Methods : Venous blood samples were collected from a population of 96 healthy Deerhounds. Haematologic and biochemical analytes were examined and reference intervals were established using the 5th and 95th percentiles. Results : The suggested reference intervals for platelets, reticulocytes, T4, chlori de, GGT, bilirubin, and glucose were lower than the reference intervals adopted for the general dog population. On the contrary, the reference intervals for MCV, potassium, BUN, ALT, AST, ALP, and cholesterol were higher than the intervals for the general dog population. The reference intervals for eosinophils and globulin were wider than the intervals used for the general non- sighthound population. Clinical Significance : These results confirm that differences in haematologic and biochemical values exist in the Deerhound. While some of these appear to be shared by all sighthounds, other differences may be unique to the Deerhound.

Ten mares were random ly allotted to one of the following groups: Group I ( early diestrus mares ) and Group II (mid- diestrus mares ). On the s ubsequent cycle, the mares received the opposite treatment in a switchback design. Group I mares were treated with twice daily injections of 10 mg PGF on days 0 (ovulation), 1 and 2, and then once daily injection on days 3 and 4. Group II mares were administered a single injection of 10 mg PGF on day 10 post ovulation. Serial blood samples were collected throughout the study. Plasma was stored at - 80C until assayed for progesterone (P4) by RIA . Transrectal ultrasonography was used to document follicle growth , time of ovulation and corpus luteum formation. When in estrus, mares were artificially inseminated with semen from a proven stallion and examined for pr egnancy 14 days post ovulation. Significance for all statistical analyses was set at P<0.05 and d ata are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. The inter -ovulatory period was compared using a paired t -test and fertility by a McNemar's test. Progesterone radioimmunoassay data is pending and will be analyzed using a n ANOVA for repeated measures. The mean inter ovulatory interval for mares in Group I was shorter than that of mares in Group II; 18.5 + 2.0 days and 13.1+ 3.7 days , respectively . Preliminary progesterone values indicate PGF administra tion in early diestrus mares had an antiluteogenic effect , reflected by the absence of rise in concentrations o f serum progesterone following ovulation. PGF administration had no effect on progesterone lev els in the subsequent ovulation and t he mean size of the pre- ovulatory follicles did not significantly differ between the two groups. There was no difference in the number of mares becoming pregnant after artificial insemination; 9 out of 10 and 9 out of 10 in Groups I and II, respectively. The novel approach validated by this study will enhance our ability to pharmacologically interrupt luteal function and shorten the estrous cycle while maintaining the fertility potential of the next induced cycle. This protocol could be applied clinically in breeding management including estrus synchronization and controlled timing of artificial Luteum, 12 EFFECT OF DYSTOCIA ON DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS PRIOR TO PARTURITON IN HOLSTEIN DAIRY COWS . M. K. McCullough, and G.M. Schuenemann. Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Dystocia increases the risk for health disorders or mortality, and reduces performance of both the dam and calf. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of dystocia on cow activity behavior 4 d before calving. A total of 147 Holstein cows (PRIM and MULT) housed in free -stall barns from 3 dairy herds were used. All cows were housed in similar facilities using a close- up pen 15 d prior to the expected calving date and a contiguous individual mater nity pen for parturition. Electronic data loggers (IceQube TM, IceRobotics, Edinburgh, Scotland) were placed on the hind leg of periparturient dairy cows at 7\u00b13 d prior to the expected calving date and 14\u00b13 DIM. Calving ease (CE; scale 1 -4), parity, calving date and time, and stillbirth (born dead or died within 24 h) were recorded. The number of steps, standing time (min), number of lying bouts (LB), and mean duration of LB (min) were recorded. Unassisted cows (n=132; CE score of 1) were compared to assisted cows (n=15; CE scores of 2- 3). Data were analyzed using MIXED (activity patterns) and GLIMMIX (stillbirth) procedures of SAS. Activity patterns for assisted or unassisted cows were adjusted for the effect of herd, parity, and CE. Cows with assisted births spent more time standing (18.6%; (P<0.05), had similar number of LB (P>0.05), but LB of longer duration (42.6%; (P<0.05) 24 h prior to birth compared to unassisted cows. These findings provided evidence that cows experiencing difficult births showed dist inct activity behavior 1 d before calving. Recognizing early warning signs (restless activity) of dystocia prior to birth may help identify those cows most at risk and pre- plan a triage as opposed to waiting for the usual signs of intervention. Monitoring cow activity along with proactive management practices around the time of calving should improve the overall survival and welfare of both the dam and calf.

Daniels, B.M. Pressler. The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Efficacy of nitrofurantoin (NFN) for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in people is >70%. In dogs and cats, however, NFN is preferentially used for treatment of resistant UTI, with an anecdotally high prevalence of adverse effects (AE). Study objectives were to determine NFN efficacy for treatment o f UTI, and describe NFN- associated AE. Animals prescribed NFN were retrospectively identified. Inclusion criteria for determining NFN efficacy included culture- confirmed susceptible UTI prior to NFN start, and repeat culture within 45d of NFN discontinuation. Inclusion criteria for AE description included treatment of suspected or confirmed UTI (culture confirmation not required) or for UTI prophylaxis, and ability to determine NFN dosage and days at AE onset and resolution. NFN efficacy: 18 dogs and 2 cats were prescribed 2.9- 5.2 mg/kg NFN (median, concurrent E. coli /Enterococcus Resolution was confirmed for 8/21 (40%) 3- (median, 7.5d) after start of NFN; total daily mg/kg dose was similar in dogs with (13.2; range, 4.1- 17.1) or without (12.1; range, 3.3- 18.4) AE. Ef fects resolved in 6 dogs 2- 6d (median, 4d) after NFN reduction or discontinuation; 1 dog was euthanized 3d post onset of neuropathy. Low NFN efficacy is likely due to preferential use for treatment of complicated UTI, and inappropriately long dosing int ervals in some animals. AE consistently resolved with NFN discontinuation or dose reduction.

Russell*, E.S. Cooper, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Veterinary Biosciences*. Rationale : Large colon (LC) volvulus represents a serious and life threatening strangulating obstruction in the horse associated with high morbidity and mortality even with surgical correction. Patient outcome relies on accurate intra-operative assessment of colonic viability to determine the most appropriate course of management. Viability assessment in the clinical setting is largely subjective; whereas objective histomorphometry, while accurate, is not a practical option available to the colic surgeon. We hypothesize that real -time dark field microscopy (DFM) (Microscan\u00ae) can detect changes in serosal microcirculatory blood flow in horses with naturally occurring surgical lesions of the large colon and may be useful in the intra- operative assessment of viability . Our objective was to quantify microcirculatory perfusion indices (MPI) (total vessel density (TVD), perfused density (PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) flow index (MFI) in horses with strangulating, non- strangulating and simple obstructions of the large colon in addition to normal control horses. Methods : Control horses with no colonic lesion and client -owned adult horses with primary surgical lesions of the LC were categorized by lesion and imaged using the Microscan\u00ae - a hand held video micros cope . MPI were determined from video loops using AVA 3.0 software. Comparisons of MPI between lesions types were performed by ANOVA. P<0.05 was significant. Results: Colic horses (n=23) had different MPI compared to control horses (n=9). Specifically, angulating (P=0.04) than control was not different among all groups (P=0.07). Strangulating obstructions also had lower PVD and PPV (both P<0.05) compared to simple obstructions (n=7) but not statistically different from non-strangulating obstructions (n=7; P>0.05). Conclusions : DFM is an intra -operative technique that can detect differences in colonic serosal microcirculatory blood flow in naturally occurring cases of surgical col on lesions in horses.

E Wetli , KE Schober, W Drost . Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Left atrial enlargement (LAE) has been reported as an important radiographic finding in the diagnosis of l eft-sided CHF (l-CHF) in cats . We hypothesized that LA size as assessed by thoracic radiography can be normal in cats with l -CHF. 100 consecutive cats with acute l -CHF were evalu ated. To be included, thoracic radiographs taken in or thogonal planes and transthoracic echocardiography performed within 24 hours of diagnosis were required. On ra diographs, presence of CHF (CTR) were assessed. On echocardiography, LAE , maximum LA dimension (LAD max) and area (LAA max), and LV size were evaluated. Reproducibility of radiographic and echocardiographic data was done using the coefficient of variation and Cohen's Kappa from 20 randomly selected samples . Data was evaluated using standard statistical procedures. Cats h ad hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, unclassified cardiomyopathy, di lated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, chronic renal failure, hyperthyroidism , and other diseases. Administration of blood products, fluids, corticosteroids, and onset of ar terial thromboembolism could be identified as trigger events leading to cardiac decompensation. On echocardi ography, LAE was diagnosed in 96% of cats based on visual ins pection of images; 93% had LAD max>15.1mm -dorsal radiographs, only 48% and 5 3% of cats had evidence of LAE based on subjective assessment , respectively. 36% had absence of LAE in both views, 3 6% had presence of LAE in both views , and 28% had presence of LAE in only one of the two views. 96% of cats had cardiomegaly based on s ubjective assessment radiographs , in 43% cats. Pulmonary arterial enlargement (67%) was found in mor cats compared to pulm onary vein enlargement (51%) . These data suggest that LAE on thoracic radiographs may be absent in cats with l - CHF.

Hoet1,3. 1 Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Veteri nary Medicine; 2 College of Nursing; 3 College of Public Health, The Ohio State University Staphylococcus aureus (SA ) is an opportunistic zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted between people and their pets. Nevertheless , it is un known if dog ownership is a risk factor for SA colon ization/infection and under what circumstances such transmission occurs. Increased colonization is important because it could increase the risk of health consequences in families with pets. The main objective of this study was to determine the clonal relationship of isolates obtained from people and pets in the same household using spa typing . The second objective was to determine the isolates ' antimicrobial resistance patterns. spa typing was bas ed on a technique described by Hallin et.al. (2009). DNA was extracted from each SA isolate using boiling followed by a PCR targeting the spa gene . The amplicom obtained was cleaned with a commercial kit and sent to a commercial sequencing lab. The s equence results were entered into an open source web- based program (spaTyper, www.Fortinbras.us ) which matched the sequence to a global database of spa sequences , assigning a spa type to each isolate. Antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined by standard Kirby -Bauer disc diffusion method. To date, 356 humans and dogs have been screened for SA , with 83 (29.8%) humans and 6 (7.7%) dogs test ing positive. Of those, 7.2% (6/83) human and 16.7% (1/6) canine SA isolates were Methicillin -Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Currently, the most frequent spa type detected was t012, which has been reported globally and is one of the most common spa types circulating in humans . t012 is associated with children and young adults, women, and health- care workers. All MRSA isolates were considered pansuceptibles, mostly resi stant to Beta -lactam drugs as expected. Because this is ongoing, double blind research , the final analysis to determine any association and potential risk factors involved in human- to-canine transmission of SA at the household level has not been perform ed.

EM Bryant , JK Cenera, CA King, DF Mollenkopf, and TE Wittum , Veterinary Preventive Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Zoonotic pathogens commonly contaminate retail chicken breast meat , which can produce acute gastrointestinal illness in consumers as a result of improper kitchen hygiene and cooking procedures. T here is a common perception that retail chicken products labeled as \"organic\" or \"antibiotic free\" are healthier than products from conventionally raised chicken due to the belief that meat from chicken s raised in an organic or antibiotic free manner will contain fewer pathogens. However, there is little scientific data t o support or refute this belief . Therefore, we hypothesized that fresh retail chicken breast labeled as organic or antibiotic -free would have differences in recovery rates of zoonotic pathogens when compared to similar products without those label claims. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we purchased 231 retail packages of fresh raw chicken breasts from 98 stores located in OH, MI, and P A. Of these, 96 packages were labeled as antibiotic free, 40 were labeled as organic, and 95 were conventional packages without either label claim . We then cultured each package for the presence of S almonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli, representing three zoonotic bacteria that commonly contaminate packages of retail chicken breast meat . We recovered E.coli from 162 ( 70%) of the packages , Salmonella from 53 (23%) packages , and C ampylobacter from 25 (11%) of the packages . We observed no difference in the recovery rates of these bacteria between chicken breast packages labeled organic, antibiotic free, or conventional. Our results suggest that retail packages of boneless chicken breast labeled as organic or antibiotic free are microbiologically similar to conventional boneless chicken breast without those label claims.

Recently, the use of antimicrobial drugs in food animals has been implicated as a potential source of resistant bacteria, leading t o the introduction of these pathogens into the food supply. To better understand the potential public health risk associated with antimicrobial use in food animals, scientific data is needed on the frequency of resistant pathogens and resistance genes in t he food supply. We investigated the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among commensal E. coli and the presence of specific resistance genes on fresh retail chicken breast sold in Ohio , Pennsylvania, and Michigan. A total of 231 packages of boneless c hicken breast labeled as either organic (n= 96), antibiotic -free (n=40) or neither (n= 95) were collected from 98 retail supermarkets in the three states . Each sample was cultured for commensal E. coli, and for E. coli resistant to fluoroquinolones, and E. coli resistant to extended- spectrum cephalosporins using selective media. E. coli with an AmpC resistance phenotype were recovered from 162 packages ( 70.1 %) while E. Coli resistant to cefepime were recovered from 16 packages (6.9%). Fluoroquinolone resis tant E. coli were recovered from 20 packages (8.7 %). Preliminary results indicate the presence of E. coli resistant to cefepime, E. coli resistant to fluoroquinolones and E . coli with an AmpC resistance phenotype in each chicken type. Characterization of samp les (PCR to confirm genotype, plasmid profiles, conjugation experiments and sequencing) was performed to better evaluate and understand the presence of the antibiotic resistance pathogens recovered from the samples. We observed little difference in th e frequency of resistance among the chicken types . Further research is needed to determine if antimicrobial restriction would reduce the presence of resistant bacteria in food, or that antibiotic use reduces food- borne pathogens.

Glowacki1 W.K. Reeves2 1The Ohio State University, College of Veterinary 1900 Coffey Rd. , Columbus, OH 43210. will.reeves@wpafb.af.mil Thule Air Base in western Greenland had a previously uncharacterized mosquito problem. Swarms of mosquitoes have been reported from June to late August, but the species were unknown. We conducted a base- wide mosquito vector survey from June- July 2012. Active breeding sites were located throughout the base and surrounding valley. One species of mosquito, Aedes impiger , was collected and more than 3000 were processed for PCR based virus surveillance. Two pools of mosquitoes tested positive for an Orthobunyavirus , however DNA sequencing of the viral amplicons was not complete enough to fully identify the agent. A survey of ectoparasites from dogs on the American Samoa islands of Aunu'u and Tutuila was conducted in June 2012, and followed by pathogen screening of the samples. One species of flea, Ctenocephalides felis , and one tick species, Rhipicephalus sanguineus , were collected and test ed for Bartonella and Rickettsia species via PCR. Bartonella clarridgeiae and an unnamed spotted fever group, Rickettsia , were detected in the fleas. None of the ticks were positive. T he Rickettsia species was previously reported from Ctenocephalides spp. from Egypt, Thailand, USA, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and is likely closely related to Rickettsia felis , a flea- borne pathogen. Th is is the first report of flea- borne Rickettsia and B. clarridgeiae, from American Samoa. Ectoparasite- borne infections are easily misdiagnosed or ignored as their symptoms are often vague and similar to other illnesses (e.g., dengue). Our results indicate a potential threat to human and animal health as infected fleas were collected from household pets.

Capitini, P. Dennis, E. Kariuki, M. Olum, and W. Ogara. The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Depts. of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Veterinary Preventive Medicine, Kenya Wildlife Service, and University of Nairobi. Tick-borne disease is major concern in Kenya, especially in livestock production. Wildlife are commonly blamed as the source of in festation, despite evidence that tick species were introduced to Africa from the exotic cattle trade and that the contribution that wildlife make to the tick problem is overestimated. The prevalence of ticks between domestic animals and wildlife was examined at Rimpa Estates in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Rimpa Estates is an 1800 acre farm located approximately 25 km from Nairobi and close to Nairobi National Park, which creates a unique human- livestock -wildlife interface . Ticks were collected from domestic animals at opportune times and placed in labeled vials with 70% alcohol. Traps from Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) were placed along the river where the carnivores inhabit. Animals that were caught were anesthetized by Dr. Kariuki of KWS for tick collection. To compare tick species and density, t ransects were swept for ticks in areas occupied by livestock, areas where they interact with wildlife, and areas where the livestock do not go and only the wildlife cross . Transects were also swept for ticks in differe nt microhabitats to compare tick prevalence and density. Ticks were identified in the laboratory at Kenya Wildlife Service. The main tick specie affecting the cattle was Rhipicephalus (Boophilus ) decoloratus , which was only found on the cattle (except for one tick found on the sheep) and is a species that is maintained by cattle. Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi was the most common species found in the environment and was also found on the domestic animals. The domestic dogs and wild carnivores (mongoose and genet) had one species in common, Hae mphysalis leachi , which feeds on domestic and wild carnivores. The wildlife is not contributing to tick infestation as much as thought, especially as far as the cattle are concerned.

M. Maxwell ,a E. Jones,b R. Garabed,a R.E. Toribioa aCollege of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University ; bUnited States Department of Agriculture, USA; cCOPEG , Ministry Panama; Cochliomyia New World Screwworm fly, is a voracious consumer of living flesh through its larvae (maggots) and is a threat to food security worldwide causing decreased productivity, increased susceptibility to other pathogens, and, in severe cases, death of domestic livestock and specifically cattle. Screwworm caused extensive economic losses to the US livestock industry. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) was used to eradicate screwworm throughout North and Central America and continues to be used as a method of control in the eastern provinc es of Darien and Comarca Embera in Panama. The goal of t his study was to evaluate the temporal and spatial trends of screwworm myiasis cases collected in Comarca Embera and Darien (border with Columbia) , Panama from 2001- 2011. We hypothesized that there will be a temporal trend with more cases of screwworm myiasis during the transition between dry to rainy season. We also hypothesized that data would be spat ially clustered near Colombia as a result of eradication strategies and the presence of an endemic population of flies. Temporal (month and season) and spatial (Darien, Comarca Embera) data from 2001- 2011 was retrieved from the COPEG -USDA database (Panama) and analyzed by an ANOVA, Ripley's K f actor, discrete Poisson, and Get is- Ord Gi*. The data were determined to be spatially clustered via Ripley's K factor analysis , and three case clusters were identified using a discrete Poisson and Get is-Ord Gi*. One cluster of cases occurred from 2001- 2003 and was considered a focal temporal and spatial cluster. The two remaining clusters contain cases from 2004- 2011 and 2001- 2011 suggesting an endemic population of flies. No temporal trends were found in the data. We propose that the lack of a temporal pattern in the number of myiasis cases in this region was the result of warm humid conditions associated with a lack of seasonality.

Rajala -Schultz, G. M. Schuenemann, M . L. Titler, P . N. Gott. Department of Veterinary Preventative Medicine Introduction Mastitis continues to inflict dairy cows as one of the most common and economically devastating diseas es within the dairy industry . Sickness behavior may be useful as an early detection tool for clinical mastitis (CM). The objective of this study was to describe sickness behavior in cows with naturally occurring mastitis cases and assess the usefulness of sickness behavior as an early indicator of mastitis. We hypothesize that cows with CM will show altered activity due to udder discomfort after the formal diagnosis of mastitis and that these changes in activity could assist in early diagnosis of intramammary infection. Methods and Materials To study sickness behavior, activity monitors (IceQube, IceRobotics, Edinburgh, Scotland) were placed on a hind leg of pregnant dairy cows approximately one week before calving and left there for approximately two weeks after delivery. Eighty cows in two central Ohio dairy herds were monitored during 2011 and 2012 . Fifteen cases of CM were identified and included in statistical analysis. The monitors measured number of steps taken, lying time, number of lying bouts, and standing time and an overall motion index was calculated based on these parameters. CM cases were diagnosed by farm personnel according their standard operating procedures. Data were analyzed using MIXED procedure in SAS, v. 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Using daily summary data from CM cows on different activity parameters as the outcomes, days with respect to diagnosis of clinical mastitis was the main variable to int erest. Data from 5 days before the clinical diagnosis of mastitis to 3 days post diagnosis were included. Day 5 before diagnosis was used as the baseline level in the analysis. Days in milk at CM diagnosis and herd were included in the models as potential confounders. First order autoregressive covariance structure was used to account for the correlated data between days within cows and cows within herds. Results and Discussion Clinical cases of mastitis were diagnosed an average of 4 days in milk (DIM), wi th a minimum DIM of 1 and a maximum of 15. Preliminary results suggest that cows with CM do show altered behavior patterns. The most significant changes were seen 2 days before CM diagnosis. The length of a lying bout decreased by 30 minutes two days before CM diagnosis compared to the baseline, 5 days before diagnosis ( P=0.036) (Figure 1). Also two days prior to mastitis diagnosis, motion index increased by 1457 points ( P=0.0923) and daily standing time was 2.1 hours longer ( P=0.0304) than 3 days earli er. Overall lying time and number of lying bouts and steps taken per day were not significantly altered prior to CM diagnosis. These results suggest that cows ex hibit subtle behavioral changes approximately 2 days before farm staff will notice changes in appearance of milk or more generalized sickness behavior.

MS3, MS, PhD, Dipl ACVN1 1College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; 2Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; 3Procter & Gamble Pet Care, Mason, OH 45040 USA; 4Zoological Pathology Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Champaign IL 61820 USA Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder has been previously reported in fishing cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ) maintained in North American zoos 1,3, but the pathogenesis and prevalence of TCC are unknown. In this study, our objectives were to: 1) investigate the prevalence of TCC in captive fishing cats in North America and internationally, 2) evaluate risk factors possibly associated with TCC occurrence in North American zoos, and 3) begin assessing nutritional parameters in fishing cats to explor e a possible link between diet and TCC . A combination of email survey of zoo veterinarians and pathological surveillance identified 29 confirmed cases of TCC in fishing cats housed in North American zoos since 1995 , representing ~35% of all fishing cats (>5 yrs of age ) that died during this time period. Notably, TCC was diagnosed in three imported founder s originating from three different fishing cat range countries (Thailand, Cambodia, Sri Lanka). Additional TCC cases (n = 13) were observed in fishing cats housed in European and Australian zoos . Epidemiologic analysis of data from the Fishing Cat International Studbook determined that genetic relatedness, geographic region, number of transfers between zoos , and gender were not (P > 0.05) correl ative factors for TCC. Nutritional analysis of serum samples ( n=58) from 42 fishing cats (including 19 TCC cases) in 17 North American zoos found increased (P = 0.032) saturated fatty acid and increased (P = 0.048) palmit oleic acid and decreased ( P = 0.022) gamma -linolenic acid (G LA) concentrations in cats affected with TCC versus cats without TCC . Vitamin s A and E , and antioxidant levels did not differ (P > 0.05) . These findings indicate that TCC is a global disease concern , occurring at an epizootic l evel in captive fishing cats with no identifiable demographic risk factors. Because f ishing cat diets in North American zoos are comprised primarily of beef with very little fish (~20%, on average), we suspect that TCC occurrence may be influenced by dietary factors . Beef -based diets are substantially higher than fish in saturated fatty acids, a dietary component correlated with TCC in humans2 and found in the present study to be higher in fishing cats with TCC . Similarly, levels of G LA, a tumoricidal fatty acid , were lower in TCC -affected cats. These observations suggest that increasing fish composition of zoo diets to more closely mimic diets of wild fishing cats may be warranted as a preventative measure to reduce TCC -related morbidity and mortality .

SEROPREVALENCE OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII IN Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia . 2Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210- 1092 3US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center , Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory, Building 1001, Beltsville, Maryland 20705- 2350. 4Department of Microbiology, The Tennessee, Knoxville, nnessee 37996- 0845 Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic protozoa of world- wide public health concern. Felids are the definitive hosts shedding infectious , hardy oocysts in their feces. This parasite can infect any warm -blooded mammal including humans . Humans , especially those that are immunocompromised, become infected by consuming undercooked meat infected with tissue cysts, ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocy ts, or through accidental ingestion of oocysts directly from the environment . Free-range chickens are a good indicator of environmental co ntamination with oocysts since they feed directly from the ground. In this study, the seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies in 125 free- range chickens from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia was examined using a modified agglutination test. IgG a ntibodies against T. gondii were found in 38.4% (n=48) of the 125 chickens with titers of 1:5 in 14, 1:10 in 12, 1:20 in 14, 1:40 in 3, 1:80 in 1, 1:160 in 1, 1:320 in 1, and 1:640 in 2 chickens. Titers less than 1 :5 were considered seronegative. Our previous study in feral cats in Addis Ababa found a high proportion of them with antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii suggesting a heavy oocyst contam ination load in the environment . The r esults of this study in chickens support those results. In a number of developing countries, including Ethiopia, a high proportion of chickens are killed at home or in unsupervised slaughter facilities and the viscera are left for scavenger s or are improperly disposed of . Toxoplasma gondii infection can be transmitted if care is not taken to wash hands thoroughly after handling meat and during cooking of meat; however, risk assessment studies have not yet been performed.

Molla, W. Gebreyes. Dpt. Of Veterinary Preventative Medicine Salmonella serovars are among the most important foodborne bacterial pathogens causing gastroenteritis in humans. Disinfection of swine production facilities is a critical aspect of the industry's food biosecurity measures to decrease the pathogen load of pigs. The goal of t his study was to compare the resistance profiles and biocide tolerance levels of previously collected Salmonella isolates from pre- and post - disinfection of swine finishing barns that use Synergize\u00ae disinfectant . We hypothesized that the use of Synergize\u00ae results in selection of strains carrying multiple antimicrobial resistant and biocide tolerant genes. From swine barns disinfected with Synergize\u00ae, Salmonella isolates were collected and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined . Serial agar dilutions of Synergize\u00ae were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Synergize\u00ae. Results from 398 samples taken from barns treated with Synergize\u00ae showed MIC' s which ranged from 80- 320\u00b5g/mL. Of these samples, the majority of those acquired prior to Synergize\u00ae disinfection were inhibited at 160 \u00b5g/ml. Of the s amples acquired post Synergize\u00ae disinfection a greater amount showed inhibition in the 320\u00b5g/mL subset . The shift toward a higher percentage of Salmonella isolates requiring greater Synergize\u00ae concentration may suggest that the disinfection is producing a selective environment for more Synergize- tolerant isolates. Based on preliminary observations, we expect to identify Synergize- tolerant Salmonella strains and identify a positive association between the chemical intervention (Synergize\u00ae ) and of multi -drug resistant Salmonella. Identification of Synergize \u00ae tolerance among Salmonella in the swine production environment is the first of its kind in the US and would warrant further tests to identify co- selection of resistance with that of antimicrobial resistance. This study, as part of a broader study of Salmonella resistance, could result in identification of risk factors and selective pressure in the production environment and assist the pork industry and producers' decision on class of biocide use.

Wagner , R. Garabed . Department of Veterinary Preventative Medicine Veterinarians working within the One Health paradigm are committed to a healthier world for both humans and animals. Veterinary diseases not only lead to health problems in animals, but also possible zoonotic concern and severe economic loss in many parts of the world. Trypanosomiasis is a parasitic protozoal disease spread by tsetse fly (Glossina spp) vectors in Africa that can cause sleeping s ickness in people and nagana in animals . Preventing the spread of this disease can be theoretically achieved thro ugh tsetse fly control and eradication. Past eradication strategies have involved insecticides including aerial spraying, treated screens and traps, and treating cattle directly. Pastoralists on the Logone Floodplain have also anecdotally used controlled burning of the grasslands in the hot/dry season to control fly numbers near their herds, but the effectiveness of this practice has not been tested. We developed an agent -based model to examine the dynamic interaction between controlled fires and tsetse f ly prevalence. We used previously published data on the biology of tsetse fly population dynamics and environmental characteristics of the Far North Region of Cameroon to parameterize the model. It was hypothesized that controlled burning reduces fly numb ers in a local area, but is not effective as a permanent eradication method. Though seasonal fluctuations in tsetse fly population densities were evident, statistically significant changes in mean population numbers in the treatment groups indicated that habitat burning does adversely affect tsetse fly po pulations; however, t his study did not test whether fires are a sustainable or ecologically healthy means of long -term fly control. This study does not recommend that habitat burning be used as a primary method for tsetse fly control without further real -world testing, but contr ol of fly populations may be a benefit to naturally occurring or man- made fires started for other reasons (dry habitat, lightning, stimulate grass regrowth).

Oral contraction is the primary route of infection chiefly occurring by consumption of contaminated water and undercooked meat pr oducts. Because of selective pressures, such as the environment, antibiotic usage and carrier species, Campylobacter spp has undergone evolution. In the present study, the genotypic diversity and dynamics of Campylobacter coli were invested by means of MSLT, a molecular method of detection which allows for highly sensitive, specific and rapid identification of Campylobacter sequencing types. By using MSLT and comparing the isolates from different areas of the world and from different species of origin, some hypothesis can be formed about the route of transmission and the evolution of Campylobacter coli.

M Brink , D Nair, TH Lai, and Y Rikihisa, From the Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, Research supported by Merial and NIH T35 OD010429 and NIH R01 AI047885 Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) is caused by infection with a rickettsial organism, Ehrlichia canis . CME has been reported throughout the world but at higher frequencies in tropical and subtropical regions (Ristic, 1993) . CME is likely under -recognized since the disease is difficult to diagnose due to variable clinical signs, different stages (acute, subclinical, or chronic) of the disease, and the frequent co- infection with other tick -borne pathogens or other infectious agents. PCR -based diagnosis and serology based on specific antigens provide more sensitive and specific diagnosis for CME. E. canis molecular analysis, led to cloning and producing E. canis recombinant proteins for serodiagnosis. E. canis major surface antigen P30 was found to be a sensitive and specific antigen for CME serodiagnosis. Objectives of this project are to compare recombinant P30 antigen with other potentially immunogenic E . canis surface antigens. Our previous study revealed ECH1038 is an outer membrane protein and its N -terminus is highly conserved among Ehrlichia spp. Therefore we cloned the N -terminus conserved region of ECH1038 to compare the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of CME using well -defined experimentally and nat urally E. canis infected dog specimens. We will employ slot blot assay combined with highly sensitive chemoluminescence detection. We will optimize the assay conditions to carry out reproducible and reliable comparisons of these antigens. Our preliminary data showed ECH1038N is a good antigen to detect CME. Once the assay is optimized we will also test other potential Ehrlichial antigens for serodiagnosis. Improved sensitive and specific serodiagnosis will help prompt and proper treatment of CME, when the disease is still responsive to antibiotic treatment. This will prevent infected dogs from serving as a reservoir for tick transmission.

VanGundy, T. Papenfuss . Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Research Supported by NIH T35 RR017491. Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) constitute a recently described heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that abnormally accumulate during cancer in multiple species and significantl y contribute to dysregulation of the host immune sy stem. MDSCs are one of the most important factors that limit the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy and a greater understanding of these cells is necessary for the advancement of cancer immunotherapy . Mouse and hum an MDSCs have been identified (Gr -1+/CD1 1b+) and (CD11b+/CD14- /MHC II -/low) , respectively. While mice have traditionally been used in the study of hum an cancer, d ogs experience spontaneous forms of cancer and are increasingly being used both as large animal model s for studies of cancer immunotherapies and incorporated into the clinical evaluation of candidate therapies for use in humans. The purpose of this project was to generate and characterize in vitro canine MDSCs for study. Canine bone marrow progenitor cells were cultured in the presence of tumor conditioned media (TCM) and phenotypically evaluated by flow cytometry using ant ibodies correlating to known mouse and human MDSC markers. An increase in (CADO48A+/CD11b+) and (CD11b+/CD14+/ MHC II -/low) cells was observed in canine bone marrow populations cultured in TCM when compared to cells cultured in media alone. The immunosuppressive function of these cells was evaluated in the presence of responder canine splenocytes and it was found that splenocyte prol iferation was suppressed. Further study of the immunosuppressive mechanism of these c ells is needed. Specifically, it is hypothesized that canine MDSCs will have increased expression of arginase, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species when compared with cells cultured in media alone as described from human and mouse MDSCs. In summary, this project generated canine MDSCs in vitro that are (CADO48A+/CD11b+) and (CD11b+/CD14+/MHC II -/low), similar in surface marker expression to mouse and human MDSCs, and indicates that these canine MDSCs are immunosuppressive.

Wu. Dept. of Veterinary Biosciences SAMHD1 is a cellular protein that has been proposed to negatively regulate the innate immune response. Mutations in the SAMHD1 gene are associated with Aicardi -Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) . AGS is an early onset autoimmune disease that causes neurologic symptoms . Myeloid cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages highly express SAMHD1. Human SAMH D1 blocks the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV -1) in myeloid cells and resting CD4+ T-cells. SAMHD1 mediates of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) in noncycling cells, which blocks HIV -1 reverse transcription during the infection. Murine leukemia virus (MLV) is a mouse retrovirus that can cause leukemia in certain mouse strains . However, it is unknown whether mouse SAMHD1 can bloc k MLV infection in mouse cells. The goal of this study was to examine whether mouse SAMHD1 protein can block MLV infection in the mouse fibroblast cell l ine NIH3T3 . This was accomplished by first transfecting a human cell line to generate retroviral vectors expressing human and mouse SAMHD1 and an antibiotic selection marker . Then NIH3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors that express SAMHD1. A stable cell line expressing human SAMHD1 was generated by puromycin selection. Human SAMHD1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Then the NIH3T3 cells were infected with a single -cycle luciferase reporter MLV. The infection was quantified by measuring luciferase activity in the cell lysate post -infection. Our preliminary data suggest that human SAMHD1 can block MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells by decreasing the intracellular dNTP pool . We are currently generating stable NIH3T3 cells that express two isoforms of mouse SAMHD1 and optimizing HIV -1 and MLV infections in these cell lines . These studies will enrich our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying SAMHD1 -mediated retroviral restriction in mouse cells.

The specific aim of the study is to determine whether stress affects antibody titers in naturally infected bison. Thirty bison cows were di vided into treatment (stressed) and control (non- stressed) groups. Control animals were housed in a 60- acre pasture. Treatment animals were housed in a 1- 2 acre pen and under human manipulation once a week for 8 weeks . Pregnancy status and blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study (Week 0) and after 8 weeks. N. caninum antibody titers were evaluated by ELISA. Fecal samples were collected weekly from individual animals throughout the study and evaluated for fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels using a corticosterone enzyme immunoassay to determine stress response. Glucocorticoid concentrations and antibody titers were not significantly different between treatment and control groups , however a decreasing trend in antibody titers was detected in both treatment and control groups . It is hypothesized that the lack of difference in glucocorticoid concentrations may be associated with the sensitive stress response of bison to human interaction. Chronic stress is also hypothesized to be associated with generalized immune suppression. This may have resulted in decreased antibody production. Future studies of glucocorticoid levels in response to exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation and characterization of the immune system will aid in supporting these hypotheses. Understanding the effects of stress on pathogenesis of N. caninum will allow investigators to better manage and control the disease, reducing its negative impact on the cattle industry.

A. Tima , J. Van Balen, A. E. Hoet Depts. of Veterinary Preventative Medicine Methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carries a myriad of virulence genes including several toxins, such as Panton- Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) and Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin (TSST). PVL lyses neutrophils, inhibiting the immune system, facilitating tissue invasion and necrosis. TSST , a superantigen, causes the host to produce numerous pro- inflammatory molecules , launching a non- specific immune response that destr oy host cells and facilitates septicemia. Both toxins are able to worsen patient outcome during MRSA infections. Currently, MRSA strains have been found in dogs and horses, but they have been poorly characterized in regards to the presence of virulence factors such as PVL and TSST. Therefore, isolates from canine and equine patients , as well as the environment at the Veterinary Medical Center will be screened for PVL and TSST . Since a majority MRSA strains found in animals tends to be from human origin, which frequently contains these toxins, we hypothesized that some MRSA isolates f rom animal sources will carry one or both toxins . An improved DNA extraction utilizing achromopeptidase was tested against the traditional boiling method. Also, a novel multiplex PCR to detect TSST and PVL, including 16S as an internal control, is being st andardized to test the isolates. Currently, it has been determined that the new DNA extraction is superior to boiling. Two duplex PCRs, one for PVL and 16s and another for TSST and 16s are standardized and work is ongoing to combine them into a multiplex P CR. After standardizing and validating the PCR, the objective will be to test all field isolates. A low prevalence of these toxins is expected in the canine isolates since 91.9% of these are HA -MRSA, which infrequently possess these genes. In contrast, a higher prevalence of TSST and PVL is expected in the equine isolates since 100% of these are CA -MRSA, which more commonly genes. CURCUMIN AND CALCITRIOL ON CANINE TRANSITIONAL CELL CARCINOMA IN VITRO . R. Gaffke , N. Inpanbutr, and E. Green. Department s of Veterinar y Biosciences and Veterinary Clinical Sciences . Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is an aggressive malignancy that affects both humans and animals and presents a therapeutic problem in veterinary patients because the disease is often very advanced at the time of clinical presentation. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has been shown to have anti -inflammatory, pro- apoptotic, and growth inhibitory properties in cancer cell lines. Previous work in our l aboratory has shown enhanced radiosensitivity of TCC when pretreated radiation (IR) is a well- established t herapy in the treatment of many malignancies . However, its therapeutic application in the lower urinary tract for the treatment of TCC is limited due to side effects experienced by adjacent small intestine and colon when aggressive dosing prot ocols are used. In the current study, curcumin and calcitriol were evaluated to determine if they would enhance the effects of IR on TCC in culture. Canine TCC cells were treated with calcitriol at 10-7 M and curcumin at 10, 20, and 30 \u00b5M for 24 hours before irradiation by 6MV X -rays at doses ranging from 2 to 10 Gy. Cells were then incubated for 72 and 96 hours. Proliferation was assessed using the CyQuant assay. Curcumin at 10 \u00b5M was cytoprotective, 20 inhibitory, while 30 showed significant inhibition , varying by IR dose. Calcitriol had variable effects at the 10-7 M dose, however concentrations less than 10-7 M were cytoprotective. IR doses of 8 or 10 Gy showed marked cell death as compared to 6 Gy or lower, regardless of the addition of curcumin or calcitriol. Western blot analysis of vitamin D receptor (VDR) showed enhanced expression over controls in IR -treated cells and in cells treated with 20 \u00b5M curcumin.

Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, East Lansing, MI. Hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) -associated laminitis (EMSAL), and induces laminitis when experimentally produced in normal horses. The laminar basal epithelial cell (LBEC) layer, the cell layer which dysadheres from the underlying basement membrane leading to laminar failure, does not have insulin receptors but expresses insulin- like growth factor -1 receptors (IGF -1Rc) which can bind insulin. The two primary pathways downstream of IGF -1Rc are the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/Erk pathways, both of whic h can result in activation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) . We hypothesized that, in EMSAL, hyperinsulinemia leads to aberrant LBEC signal ing due to activation of pathways downstream of the IGF -1Rc. For this study, 22 ponies stratified by body condition (lean [LN, n=11] and obese [OB, n=11]) were exposed to a low non- structural carbohydrate (NSC) diet ( CON, n=5 for OB and LN groups ) or a hi gh NSC diet (CHO, n=6 for OB and LN groups) for 7 days. Serum insulin concentrations were obtained prior to the feeding protocol; insulin concentrations and laminar samples were obtained at the end of the 7 day feeding protocol. Immunoblotting was employed to assess laminar concentrations of both activated (phosphorylated) and total protein for key proteins downstream from the IGF -1Rc. Significant correlations existed (P<0.05; r> 0.5) between the 7 day insulin phospho- phospho- Erk. The only change (P<0.05) in activation state between groups was a marked increase in laminar phospho-RPS6 in obese CHO -challenged ponies laminar RPS6 activation occurs in EMSAL d ue to activation of the PI3K/Akt /mTORC1 pathway. As RPS6 activation is associated with decreased adhesion properties of epithelial cells in human disease, further investig ation of this pathway may reveal new therapeutic targets LBEC dysadhesion in EMSAL.

L . Mundy *, A. Ishihara*, M. Wellman+, A. Bertone*. Comparative Orthopedics Research Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences* and Veterinary Biosciences+ This study assessed the performance of a novel equine bone marrow stem cell harvest filter set by cell recovery, cell viability, and stem cell replication and differentiation capacities. Twelve horses were induced by a short -acting intravenous anesthesia agent and the sternum prepared aseptically. Jamshidi bone marrow aspiration needles were used to collect 60mL of bone marrow into heparin anticoagulant. The bone marrow aspirate was processed through the novel gravity filtration system designed to capture cells and platelets and produce approximately 13mL of bone marrow product. Bone marrow aspirate successfully flowed through ten of the twel ve filter sets. Mean cell viability of harvested bone marrow product was 95.9%. Concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets were not found to be significantly different between bone marrow and harvested bone marrow product indicating that the filter did not concentrate these hematologic cells. White blood cells and platelets were captured >95% on the filter, but inefficiently released into the bone marrow harvest product. Manual cytology counts indicated that the percentage of neutrop hils was significantly lower in the harvested bone marrow product compared to bone marrow. There was a tendency that the total progenitor count was higher in the harvested bone marrow product than bone marrow with a 1.56- fold concentration and 37% recovery . The cells were further characterized by flow cytometry as CD90 positive, MHCI negative, and MHC II negative. Cells from the bone marrow harvest product were multipotent and differentiate d into chondrocytes, osteo cytes, adipocytes, Our resul ts showed that this novel equine bone marrow stem cell harvest filter set can significantly increase the progenitor cell component and decrease the neutrophil component of harvested bone marrow. However, it did not efficiently harvest a large portion of captured white blood cells or platelets.

Murphy 4, and H.L. Chandler 1. 1 The Ohio State University; 2 Louisiana State University; 3 Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Wisconsin- Madison; 4 University of California, Davis. Purpose. Heat shock proteins, particularly HSP70, HSP47, and HSP 27, have been implicated in facilitating wound healing in multiple tissues. Expr ession and localization of these three HSPs were assessed in normal and wounded canine corneas to eluci date a role in normal wound healing. Methods. Paraffin -embedded tissue obtained from previous studies of normal corneas , acute and repeatedly abraded corneas, and clinical keratectomy specimens obtained from dogs with spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs) were subjected to routine i mmunohistochemistry . Additionally , four - millimeter axial corneal defects were created in cadaveric eyes. Wounded corneas were excised and incubated in culture media treated with anti -HSP antibodies or an IgG control for 48 hours. W ound healing was monitored with Richardson's stain. Res ults. Normal canine corneas exhibited constitutive epithelial expression of each HSP in specific intracellular locations . Inducible expression was demonstrated in acutely wounded tis sues with similar distributions as the normal corneal sections. In contr ast, expression in repeatedly abraded specimens was diminished compared to the acutely wounded tissues and localized to different intracellular compartments . No HSP expression was demonstrated in SCC ED samples. Inhibition of HSP expression in culture resulted in delayed wound healing when compared to the IgG control s. Corneas treated with anti -HSP70 had significantly larger wound areas compared to all other treatment groups at all time point s. When compared to rabbit IgG control corneas, those treated with anti -HSP47 demonstrated significantly larger wound areas at 12 hours only. There were no statistical differences in wound area between corneas treated with anti -HSP27 and the controls. Conclusions. These findings suggest expression of HSPs is induced in the normal canine cornea during re- epithelialization. HSP70 expression is likely important for the cytoarchitectural remodeling and migration necessary early in the canine corneal healing response, an d suppressed expression may contribute to the pathophys iology of non- healing defects.

J Armstrong1 , Popovich2, D McTigue2 1Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences and Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, and 2Dpt. of Neur osciences, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM) is a challenging neurologic disease in which, despite a multitude of treatment options, the long -term outcome and survival of affected dogs is po or. We hypothesize that apoptosis is present in the spinal cord of dogs with CSM, serving as an underlying mechanism for continuous deterioration. This study investigated the presence of apoptosis in CSM -affected spinal cords and characterized the cell type undergoing apoptosis. Spinal cords of 12 CSM -affected dogs and 12 large breed dogs euthanized for unrelated reasons were used. Those without compressive lesions, as identified at necropsy, were used in the control group. Spinal cords were evaluated using hematoxylin- eosin staining to determine the severity of grey and white matter changes. Immunohistochemical evaluation with Caspase- 3 was used to document apoptosis. Double labeling with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (TUNEL+MAG) or anti -neuronal nuclei markers (TUNEL+NeuN) were used to identify oligodendrocytes and neurons. For cell count, 10 areas from white and grey matter were selected. Caspase- 3, TUNEL+MAG and TUNEL+NeuN positive cells were counted in a blinded manner and comparisons between groups were performed using a Wilcoxon rank -sum test. The mean number of Caspase- 3 cells in the CSM group was 83.3 (\u00b140.9), and 36.5 (\u00b112.6) in group ( The mean number of TUNEL+NeuN cells was 4.5 (\u00b12.91) and 4.5 (\u00b12.28), for the CSM and control group, respectively ( p=0.83). The mean number of TUNEL+MAG cells for the CSM group was 4.68 (\u00b12.78), and 1.78 (\u00b10.84) for the control group (p=0.002). The results indicate that CSM -affected dogs have apoptosis in their spinal cords, preferentially affecting oligodendrocytes. This may be related to the demyelinating and remyelinating process associated with chronic compression, and play a substantial role in the long -term surviva l and outcome of CSM -affected dogs. apoptosis, URINARY HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS MacKinnon1 & M. Stoops1 1Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden, Cincinnati, OH 45220 . 2College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210 Long -acting neuroleptic s (LAN) are frequently used during immobilization and transport of rhinocero s. Long -term use ( >3 weeks) of LAN's have not yet been examined in this species . The goal of this study was to assess long -term use of the LAN haloperidol to acclimate a female Indian rhinoceros to novel stimuli. Haloperidol is unique in that it can be ad ministered orally. Specific o bjectives included validating a and gonadal hormone profiles were compared before and during treatment. Finally, behavioral correlates related to public exhibition and handling for reproductive assessment were evaluated. During the first 50 days of treatment , the rhino ceros received 50mg PO and then dosage increased to 80mg PO. After 203 days, dosage was tapered for 34 days to discontinue treatment . Urine samples were collected daily . Urine haloperidol was measured using a commercially available immuno assay (Neogen, Lexington, validated for I ndian rhinocerose s by analyzing urine from two untreated and one treated female (80mg PO) . Urinary estrogen conjugate, were measured . No extrapyramidal side effect s were noted during treatment and the female successfully ovulated once. We found no difference ( P=0.16 ) in background concentrations of haloperidol between Indian rhinoceroses and both were similar to background values reported in equine urine. Urine from the treated female (80mg PO ) demonstrated parallelism (r=0.99) to the haloperidol standard no ( P=0.32 ) in urinary haloperidol concentrations and were higher ( P<0.05) than background levels . A dose dependent excretion effect ( P<0.05) occured during dosage decline . Concentrations returned to background levels within 2 weeks of treatment ending . A positive correlation ( r =0.15; P<0.05) between urinary EC and cortisol was observed. This is the first data on urinary pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics of the LAN haloperidol i n the Indian rhinoceros .

Diabetic heart disease is a distinct clinical entity that can progress to heart failure and sudden death. However, the mechanisms responsible for the alterations in excitation-contraction coupling leading to cardiac dysfunction during diabetes are not well known. Hyperglycemia, the landmark of diabetes, leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on long -lived proteins, including sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca regulatory proteins. However, their pathogenic role on SR Ca handling in cardiac myocytes is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether an AGE cross -link breaker could prevent the alterations in SR Ca cycling that lead to in vivo cardiac dysfunction during diabetes. Streptozotoci n-induced diabetic rats were treated with alagebrium chloride (ALT -711) for 8 weeks and compared to age- matched placebo- treated diabetic rats and healthy rats. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiographic examination. Ventricular myocytes were isolat ed to assess SR Ca cycling by confocal imaging and quantitative Western blots. Diabetes resulted in in vivo cardiac dysfunction and ALT -711 therapy partially alleviated diastolic dysfunction by decreasing isovolumetric relaxation time and myocardial perfor mance index (MPI) (by 27 and 41% vs. untreated diabetic rats, respectively, P < 0.05). In cardiac myocytes, diabetes -induced prolongation of cytosolic Ca transient clearance by 43% and decreased SR Ca load by 25% (P < 0.05); these parameters were partially improved after ALT -711 therapy. SERCA2a and RyR2 protein expression was significantly decreased in the myocardium of untreated diabetic rats (by 64 and 36% vs. controls, respectively, P < 0.05), but preserved in the treated diabetic group compared to cont rols. Collectively, our results suggest that, in a model of type 1 diabetes, AGE accumulation primarily impairs SR Ca reuptake in cardiac myocytes and that long -term treatment with an AGE cross -link breaker partially normalized SR Ca handling and improved diabetic cardiomyopathy.
