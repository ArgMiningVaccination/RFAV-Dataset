Follow this checklist to stay healthy and happy during this unlock 1. Push Away Laziness: To stay active and adjust to your new routine, it is important for you to reverse the damage caused by decreased physical activity. Pick up a morning workout routine. Set aside 30 mins in the morning to go for a walk or run, you can also do yoga or any high-intensity workout. Try walking more throughout the day - take the stairs, walk short distances, etc. 2. Don't binge-watch or binge eat: When you binge-watch, you also tend to binge-eat, but with the quarantine gradually getting over it's time to change your habits. Plan your meals and make them with unprocessed ingredients at home. Start your day with a protein-rich breakfast and reduce the number of carbs you eat at night.

Manage your mental and emotional well-being with mind-calming practices like yoga and meditation. You can even practice meditation during work hours on your desk. 4. Take precautions for your health: Follow the safety guidelines set by the government and private organizations like- - Wear a mask whenever you step out and carry a sanitizer at all times. - Continue social distancing, even at your workplace. - Avoid large gatherings and crowded places. - Avoid traveling within the country or abroad. - Follow safety measures at malls, saloons, etc. and cooperate with the employees there. - Take a bath as soon as you reach home. - Encourage house help and people around you to wear masks and follow safety measures. - Eat home-cooked meals and snacks.
