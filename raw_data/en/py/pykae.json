The programme provides vaccination against eight lifethreatening diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) causing pneumonia and meningitis, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis, measles and hepatitis B) in the entire country. In addition, vaccination against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is provided in the selected endemic districts/states of the country. Recently, rotavirus vaccine (RVV) has been introduced in the four selected states (Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Odisha). In spite of all positive changes, there are ongoing challenges and shortcomings in the national immunization programme. Despite being operational for the past more than 30 years, only 65% of children in India receive all vaccines during their first year of life, thus contributing to continued high burden of morbidity and mortality in children from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Based on full immunization estimated from routine immunization monitoring and Mission Indradhanush data, it is estimated that annually, more than 70 lakh (7 million) children in the country do not receive all vaccines that are available under the UIP\u2014the highest number compared with any other country in the world. This is majorly due to suboptimal data recording and reporting, as well as the dire need to improve disease surveillance system. It is critical to identify the districts where focussed efforts, systematic immunization drive and additional resources will be required for reaching all children with all available life saving vaccines. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (MoHFWGoI) is committed to rapidly address the inequity in immunization coverage and consolidate the health systems strengthening efforts. To strengthen routine immunization planning and delivery mechanism, the MoHFW, GoI, launched its flagship programme \"Mission Indradhanush\" in December 2014 to achieve more than 90% full immunization coverage in the country. As part of this, the country has implemented two phases of Mission Indradhanush in 2015 through eight rounds in high focus districts. Based on risk prioritization, the country was categorized into high, medium and low focus districts. Phase I of Mission Indradhanush targeted 201 highfocus districts, with four rounds of activity between April and July 2015. Phase II targeted 352 districts (73 districts repeated from phase I), with four rounds of activity conducted between October 2015 and January 2016. BACKGROUND Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization 4 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization This equitybased programme builds on polio strategies, tools, techniques and manpower to focus specific attention on identified highrisk populations with traditionally low coverage, such as slum dwellers, nomadic populations and migrant families living in brick kilns and construction sites. The mission also targets the 400,000 high risk areas identified in the polio programme as well as other underserved areas with inadequate health services (vacant health subcentres, etc.), migrant populations, recent measles/diphtheria outbreaks or high dropout rates. Leveraging special strategies developed by the polio teams to access high risk, hardtoreach and underserved communities, Mission Indradhanush brought in communities that previously had only been reached for polio vaccination but with limited access to routine immunization services. Microplanning for Mission Indradhanush focused on improving coverage and addressing equity issues in access to immunization. Riding on the success and learnings from Mission Indradhanush in 2015 wherein more than 37 lakh children were fully immunized and about 37 lakh pregnant women were vaccinated, the GoI has decided to continue with this initiative. The main objective is to accelerate the momentum by planning to target 50% of estimated 70 lakh partially vaccinated or completely unvaccinated (missed) children in the next wave of Mission Indradhanush (Phase III) in 2016. The plan is to reach out to the 216 high focus districts across 27 states/union territories for achieving 90% coverage earlier than 2020. 5 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Figure 1. Phase III: Highfocus districts, 2016 Evidence shows that unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children are most susceptible to childhood diseases and disability, and run a three to six times higher risk of death as compared with fully immunized children. There are wide variations in the proportion of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children within states and districts. Recent evaluations have indicated that the major reasons for inability to reach with all vaccines to children in the entire country are lack of awareness among parents about the benefits of vaccination, fear of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and operational reasons such as nonavailability of vaccines or vaccinators during vaccination sessions. It is critical to identify the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children and address programmatic issues with focussed microplanning, provision of additional financial resources and systematic immunization drives to reach these children with all available life saving vaccines. 2.1 What is Mission Indradhanush? The MoHFW, GoI, launched Mission Indradhanush in December 2014 as a special drive to vaccinate all unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children under UIP. The Mission focuses on interventions to improve full immunization coverage for children in India from 65% in 2014 to at least 90% earlier than 2020, this will be done through special catchup drives. Under Mission Indradhanush, the government has identified 216 high focus districts across the country. The states of Uttar Pradesh (55 high focus districts) and Bihar (19 high focus districts) account for 38% and 10%, respectively, of the total missed children. The states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Assam, with a total of 61 high focus districts, account for 30% of the total missed children. Figure 1 illustrates 216 highfocus districts identified by the government). Phase III of Mission Indradhanush will target 216 highfocus districts. (A list of 216 highfocus districts has been provided in Annexure 1). RATIONALE FOR MISSION INDRADHANUSH 6 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The main objective of Mission Indradhanush is to ensure high coverage of children and pregnant women with all available vaccines throughout the country, with emphasis on the identified 216 high focus districts during phase III. 3.1 Specific objectives With the launch of Mission Indradhanush, the government aims at: Generating a high demand for immunization services by addressing communication challenges; Enhancing political, administrative and financial commitment through advocacy with key stakeholders; and Ensuring that the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children are fully immunized as per the national immunization schedule (Annexure 2). 3.2 Areas under focus for Mission Indradhanush Phase III Mission Indradhanush will be a nationwide drive, with focus on 216 identified high focus districts. The key areas to be reached through Mission Indradhanush will be: Areas with vacant sub centres - no auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) posted for more than 3 months. Villages/areas with three or more consecutive missed routine immunization sessions - ANMs on long leave or other similar reasons. Highrisk areas (HRAs) identified by the polio eradication programme that are not having independent routine immunization sessions and clubbed with some other routine immunization sessions. These include populations living in areas such as: - urban slums with migration - nomadic sites - brick kilns - construction sites - other migrant settlements (fishermen villages, riverine areas with shifting populations) - underserved and hardtoreach populations (forested and tribal populations, hilly areas, etc.). Areas with low routine immunization coverage identified through measles outbreaks, cases of diphtheria and neonatal tetanus in the last 2 years. OBJECTIVES OF MISSION INDRADHANUSH 7 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Mission Indradhanush will be a nationwide intensified routine immunization drive for ensuring high coverage throughout the country, and will be conducted in 216 high focus districts. A total of four rounds will be conducted under each phase of Mission Indradhanush. Upon completion of each phase, districts must ensure that these sessions are included in regular routine immunization plans. Targeted beneficiaries will be pregnant women and children up to 2 years of age; however, children up to 5 years need to be focussed upon to improve booster dose coverage and if required school campaigns may be conducted. 4.1 Implementation of Mission Indradhanush Mission Indradhanush is a special immunization drive spread over 7 days. These 7 days do not include the routine immunization days planned in that week. Such routine immunization sessions should be held as already planned. All identified areas that require routine immunization strengthening but have no/infrequent routine immunization sessions must be reached through Mission Indradhanush sessions. Planning should be made in such a way that all ANMs in district are involved for 7 working days (in addition to routine immunization days) to visit and cover the areas for maximum immunization coverage. Mission Indradhanush is a drive spread over 7 days. These 7 days do not include the routine immunization days planned in that week Ensure there is a 7 day plan (in addition to routine immunization days) for all ANMs in district. The ANMs should be deployed to other subcentre area within the same or adjoining blocks or urban areas in the same district. The planning for Mission Indradhanush sessions in district should be done in the following ways: o ANMs working in rural areas with less than 7 days of involvement in Mission Indradhanush in their own subcentre areas should be deployed to low STRATEGY FOR MISSION INDRADHANUSH PHASE III The priority for conducting Mission Indradhanush sessions should be areas with weak routine immunization coverage in the district. This will require deployment of ANM to areas outside of her own subcentre and block. All ANMs should be engaged for 7 working days over and above the regular routine immunization days excluding Sundays and holidays for conducting session during Mission Indradhanush. Sub centres having delivery facilities need to plan ANM deployment accordingly. 8 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization performing/coverage areas or vacant sub centers in identified urban areas for Mission Indradhanush. o To cover the unreached/vulnerable population groups with limited human resources availability in urban areas, the DIO and urban nodal officer should coordinate with block medical officers to pull out the required number of ANMs from adjoining blocks to conduct the desired number of Mission Indradhanush sessions in these urban areas. Head count survey is a mandatory activity to be conducted through house to house visits before the first round of Mission Indradhanush. This head count survey will be conducted by ASHA/AWW/mobilizer for estimation of beneficiaries in the catchment area for each of the planned sessions for Mission Indradhanush. Mission Indradhanush sessions should only be held after conducting and enlisting of beneficiaries through head count survey in the catchment area. Enlisting of beneficiaries through head count survey will ensure completeness of due lists and tracking of beneficiaries. The head count survey will be utilized for preparation of namebased due lists for tracking and mobilization of beneficiaries (Targeted beneficiaries will be pregnant women and children up to 2 years of age; however, children up to 5 years need to be focussed upon to improve booster dose coverage). Due lists for subsequent Mission Indradhanush rounds will be updated using name based immunization coverage recorded in Mission Indradhanush tally sheets during each round. Mission Indradhanush will be implemented according to a roster prepared following the planning process. This includes planning meetings at district and block levels, and oversight provided by district task force for immunization (DTFI). Every district should identify urban nodal officer(s) for planning and implementation of activities during Mission Indradhanush and routine immunization. State and district task force to ensure compliance. 9 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The two main components of Mission Indradhanush will be: Operational planning Communication planning 5.1 Operational planning The following two operational mechanisms will be utilized to reach out to unreached or poorly reached beneficiaries. 5.1.1 Fixed and outreach sessions Medical officer incharge (MOIC) for the block/urban planning unit will conduct a detailed planning for the additional sessions to be conducted in the planning unit. In addition, provision for vaccination should be made at health posts, primary health centres (PHCs) and district hospitals on all days of Mission Indradhanush. Sites for vaccination : Primary schools, anganwadi centres, private dispensaries, nongovernment organization (NGO) sites or any other locations that are easily accessible and acceptable to the community can be used as immunization sites. In addition, urban health posts, postpartum centres, family welfare centres and local influencers' premises may be utilized in urban areas. Availability of human resources : All ANMs in district will conduct Mission Indradhanush session for 7 working days in addition to routine immunization days. Other health staff trained for administering injection available from the same or neighbouring community health centre (CHC)/block/PHC/NGOs (LIONS, Rotary, etc.), retired health workers and staff available from other government agencies such as Medical colleges, ANM/nurse training school, Employee's State Insurance Corporation, Central Government Health Scheme, Armed Forces, Railways, District Urban Development Agency (DUDA)/State Urban Development Agency (SUDA) and community based organizations (CBOs) should be utilized to reach the largest number of children. Please note: Under Part C of Programme Implementation Plans (PIP) of NHM, as per norms there is a provision to hire vaccinators for urban slum/marginalized areas. Timings : The activity will be conducted from 09:00 to 16:00. However, sessions should be planned based on availability of the targeted population to maximize the benefits. Team : A team will comprise one vaccinator and two mobilizers, payments to both mobilizers should be made as per financial guidelines (Annexure 7). An additional vaccinator will be included in the team if the estimated injection load is more than 60-70. COMPONENTS OF MISSION INDRADHANUSH 10 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization 5.1.2 Mobile sessions Mobile sessions should be planned at places where routine immunization coverage is weak and the small number of beneficiaries does not warrant an independent session. These places include periurban areas, scattered slums, brick kilns and construction sites. For these sessions, alternate means such as mobile vans should be planned in the format given at Annexure 11. It is important to ensure that the vials of Bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG), Measles, Rotavirus vaccine, and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccines that are opened at one site are not used at the next site. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) department & Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakaram (RBSK) school health teams may support these mobile sessions through supplementary nutrition services that may be provided to beneficiaries in these hardtoreach areas. 5.1.3 Planning considerations Based on evidence and best practices from the polio eradication programme, the following activities will be critical for the planning and successful implementation of Mission Indradhanush: Meticulous planning of immunization sessions at all levels : It is important to plan sessions for identified areas where the reach of immunization programmes is inadequate. Ensure availability of sufficient vaccinators and all vaccines during routine immunization sessions. Effective communication and social mobilization efforts : Generate awareness and demand for immunization services through needbased communication and social mobilization activities (mass media, mid media, interpersonal communication, school and youth networks and corporates). Intensive training of health officials and frontline workers : Build capacity of health officials and workers for routine immunization activities to ensure the highest quality of immunization services delivery to beneficiaries. Establish accountability framework through task forces : Enhance involvement and accountability/ownership of state and district administrative and health officials through state and district task forces for immunization. It is important to use concurrent session monitoring data to plug gaps in implementation. 5.2 Communication planning To meet and sustain coverage goals under Mission Indradhanush, a wellcarved strategic communication plan needs to be in place, reaching out to communities Include all immunization sessions held under Mission Indradhanush (that are not part of routine immunization microplan) into routine immunization microplans. The budgetary support for the same should be reflected in the district health action plan (DHAP) and subsequently in the state PIP. 11 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization residing in rural as well as urban areas, hardtoreach populations and building trust in healthcare services. This calls for identifying communication methods or channels that are the most appropriate for targeted stakeholders, that are liked and used by them and can most effectively reach them with programme messages. The communication plan also needs to take into consideration specific communication activities at different levels of operation. A needbased communication and social mobilization activities should be planned to achieve the following objectives: - Demand generation through increased visibility - Advocacy through media, professional bodies and political leadership - Capacity building of immunization workforce on communication - Social mobilization through interpersonal communication, school and youth networks and corporates - Concurrent monitoring of communication interventions. 5.2.1 National communication plan Communication activities initiated at the national level will focus on mass media channels, their frequency and periodicity, news media outreach and social media activities. The communication activities will include: Launch of Mission Indradhanush Phase III National media outreach and management Airing of TV and Radio spots on national and regional channels Airing of Radio jingles on FM and AIR Newspaper advertisements (in leading English and Hindi dailies) SMS campaigns Social media engagement through Twitter, Facebook and YouTube Consolidated progress report on monitoring of communication interventions 5.2.2 State communication plan Communication plan at the state level will include the following key components. Each component will have specific communication activities to reach out to a range of stakeholders with information and messages on various programme components. Demand generation Capacity building Coordination and convergence Advocacy and social mobilization Media engagement Communication monitoring 12 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The communication plan will be rolled out through the following activities: Development of state communication action plan using the 360 degree communication approach where mass media, mid media and interpersonal communication (IPC) channels would be used. Capacity building - Training of state/district officials on operationalization of communication plan - Capacitybuilding of media spokespersons Advocacy with - Other Line departments ( Panchayat department , Rural Development department , WCD department , Education, WASH) - Development partners - CBO and NGOs ( MNGOs) - Religious institutions (Wakf Mission, BSS, Diocesan Social Service Societies (DSSS), JamaiteulemaeHind, State Haj Committees) - Local political leaders (member of parliament [MPs], member of legislative assembly [MLAs]) - Professional bodies such as Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) Mass media - Airing of TV and radio spots on regional channels - Radio jingles on local FM - Newspaper advertisements in statelevel newspapers (English and Hindi) - SMS campaign Media engagement through - Media orientation - Press briefings - Media tracking and analysis Supportive supervision visits to poor performing districts by state officials 5.2.3. District communication plan The plan details out suggested communication activities and also ways to reach out to specific populations and groups in high priority or geographically hardtoreach areas. A few activities have been suggested for hilly/flood prone/desert/jungle/unrest areas/resistant or underserved pockets/urban slums/tribal areas and mobile/migrant populations. It is left to the discretion of the states to decide the kind of activities they find appropriate. At the district level, dedicated communication plans will be made for the following areas: Highpriority areas Resistant and underserved pockets Urban slums Tribal areas 13 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Migrant/mobile populations This plan describes activities to be undertaken at the district level for components similar to the state plan. Communication activities at the district level will include the following: Development of district communication action plan using the 360 degree communication approach where mass media, mid media and interpersonal communication (IPC) channels would be used. Capacity building - Training of district health officials, line departments, e.g., education, PRI WASH and NGO partners on social mobilization and advocacy - Training of ANMs, ANM supervisors, LHVs, BEEs and community mobilizers , ASHA supervisors on IPC skills - Capacitybuilding of media spokespersons for crisis management in case of AEFIs Advocacy and Social Mobilization - Meetings with key influencers for social mobilization Religious leaders Ward members/councillors Panchayati raj institutions (PRI) Teachers Local doctors, IAP/IMA members Civil society organizations (CSOs), National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Service Scheme (NSS) Local political leaders (MPs, MLAs) Institutionalize a reward and recognition system for well performing ANMs/ASHAs. Districtlevel media management, including media orientation and press briefings (give out updates before and after each round), organize field visits to the media; take them to the areas where Mission Indradhanush is being organized). Mass media - Airing of TV spots on local channels and cable TV - Radio jingles on local FM channels - Newspaper advertisements in local regional dailies in local language - SMS campaign - Printing of IEC materials Develop implementation plan for IEC materials e.g. posters, pamphlets, flipbooks, hoardings, banners, flex boards and balloons. Monthly districtlevel planning and review meetings under chairmanship of DM/ DC with ICDS, PRI and allied departments for intersectoral convergence for coordination in implementation. Monthly and quarterly meetings of interagency communications group. Monitoring of communication activities. 14 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The prototypes for all the communication activities under mass and mid media will be developed at the national level. The open files of the prototypes will be shared with the states and the states will further share the prototypes with the districts for translation, printing and dissemination. The states may also adapt the prototypes according to their local context. The calculation for the printing of the IEC (information, education and communication) materials is based on approximation and the actual figures will depend on the size and the rate at which the activity will be undertaken at the district level. For example, in a district with around 2000 Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), 10 000 posters may be printed @5 posters per ASHA area. This is just an approximation and actual numbers may vary depending upon the number of ASHAs per district and the rate which is charged for the printing of the poster. 5.2.4 Block communication plan This plan describes some indicative communication activities under the different components on a similar pattern as for the state and district level plans. Under demand generation, suggested strategic locations for display and dissemination of mid media materials have also been given for enhanced visibility of messages. The plan also includes proposed activities for interpersonal communication and community mobilization along with capacitybuilding, coordination, and advocacy and social mobilization initiatives. Communication activities at the block level will include the following Capacity building - IPC skills training of frontline functionaries (ANMs, ASHAs and AWWs) - Orientation of nodal school teachers on routine immunization - Orientation of NGO volunteers on routine immunization Advocacy engagements with religious leaders, PRI members, SHG members and key influencers such as teachers, local doctors, CSOs, NCC and NSS Social mobilization - Community meetings - Temple/mosque announcements - Rallies - Miking - Nukkad natak/street plays - Stalls on routine immunization in local gathering (haat, mela, sammelan, urs) - Organize health camps in hardtoreach/underserved areas/resistant pockets - Social mobilization campaigns through community networks such as CBOs, community influencers, religious leaders, NGOs, youth volunteers, SHGs and cooperatives Monthly meetings (or as is considered necessary) with ICDS, PRI and allied departments for intersectoral convergence. 15 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization On the day of immunization, mobilisers should be invited to inaugurate the session. After session inauguration, influencers and mobilisers must visit houses of beneficiaries as per due list and ensure vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries in the area. 5.2.5 Community level communication plan A communication plan should be developed for the sessions planned under Mission Indradhanush. The following activities may be undertaken to enhance community awareness for Mission Indradhanush and acceptance for routine immunization: Local miking on slow moving vehicles Drum beating/munadi Announcements from locally situated religious places Community radio spots Mothers' meetings Selfhelp group meeting Youth clubs Community meetings (with pradhans, ward members, village level influencers) Schools, club rallies Display of banners and posters Home visits by local mobilizers (ASHAs/AWWs) for IPC 5.2.6 Role of the local influencer(s) Doctors, village pradhans or urban ward members, panchayat secretary, ration dealers, religious leaders and teachers play an important role in facilitating vaccine acceptance in community. These influencers play a key role in creating vaccine awareness and clearing doubts regarding vaccination, thereby enhancing vaccination coverage. ANM with support from ASHA, AWW and other mobilisers will identify local influencers for each session site. These influencers should be available to help mobilisers on the day of vaccination and committed to support the team. They may also support mobilisers in organizing rallies, bulawwa tolis as well as announcement from mosques and other places. Names of all identified influencers should be incorporated in microplans. Interface meeting of mobilisers, vaccinators and influencers should be organized at least one week prior to immunization day for sensitizing influencers on Mission Indradhanush, importance of their engagement and sharing beneficiary due list. Responsibility of beneficiary mobilization should be rationally divided among influencers so that they have manageable workload of influencing parents of beneficiaries for vaccination. 16 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The rollout of Mission Indradhanush requires meticulous planning at all levels. Special sessions under Mission Indradhanush should be conducted in areas that are unreached or poorly reached for routine immunization services to ensure maximum improvement in full immunization coverage of states. Prior to conducting these sessions, headcount must be done in such areas for enlisting beneficiaries and preparing due lists. The steps for rolling out Mission Indradhanush have been illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Steps for rollout of Mission Indradhanush STEPS FOR ROLLOUT OF MISSION INDRADHANUSH 17 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Critical activity: Mission Indradhanush preparedness / progress review A video conference by Principal Secretary/Mission Director with Mission Indradhanush districts (DM/CMO/DIO/ Urban Nodal officer/ weak performing Block MO in charges and partners) will help in better understanding the progress in terms of planning and implementation. STFI to closely monitor quality of DTFIs Frequency : at least once before each round The following activities should be undertaken at the state level for the successful implementation of Mission Indradhanush: 7.1 Meeting of State Task Force for Immunization (STFI) The task forces for immunization at state and district levels were constituted on the polio model to critically review the current status of routine immunization, identify programmatic gaps, decide strategic actions to improve the coverage of UIP and monitor the implementation of these actions. This institutional mechanism plays a pivotal role in improving and delivering high quality immunization coverage across all states. Task forces meet periodically to review routine immunization programme performance through a detailed review of administrative and monitoring data, microplanning, training status of frontline workers, and vaccine and cold chain management, with a special focus on high priority areas. They also identify operational constraints and ensure corrective operational steps to improve routine immunization coverage. Chairperson : Principal Secretary, Health Cochair : Mission Director, National Health Mission (MD NHM) Member Secretary : State Immunization Officer (SIO) Responsibility : Director, Family Welfare; SIO Timeline : First meeting within 2 days after receiving official communication from the national level.

CSOs, including professional bodies such as IMA and IAP, should also be involved. Ensure identification of the nodal officer for urban areas in each district. He/she will facilitate microplanning in urban areas of the district. Ensure adequate number of IEC materials (as per prototypes) and updated planning and reporting formats are printed and disseminated to districts in time. Ensure that these materials are printed in local languages if required. Deploy senior statelevel health officials to highfocus districts for monitoring and ensuring accountability framework. They should visit these districts and provide oversight to activities for rollout of Mission Indradhanush, including participation in DTFI meetings and assessment of district preparedness. Track districts for adherence to timelines, including microplanning, indenting of vaccines and logistics, and roll out of Mission Indradhanush. All districts should conduct these drives on a common date. Fix date and time and conduct video conferences with districts and urban local bodies to review and resolve issues related to microplanning, vaccines and logistics, human resources availability, training, waste management, AEFI and IEC/BCC. District participants will include district magistrate, chief medical officer (CMO), district immunization officer (DIO) and nodal officer for the urban area. Review each round of Mission Indradhanush and guide corrective actions. Ensure inclusion of Mission Indradhanush sessions in regular routine immunization plans. Minutes and actions taken report of each meeting should be circulated to officials concerned and communicated to MoHFW, GoI. 7.2 State workshops and review The objective of state workshops is to build capacity of district officials in cascading trainings at district and block levels. The trainee officials will be oriented on conducting planning exercises that emphasize on head count survey and preparation of due list of beneficiaries. These workshops also aim at strengthening social mobilization among communities, and ensuring accountability and effectiveness of government programmes.

What is Mission Indradhanush? Mission Indradhanush is a flagship programme of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. It aims at improving the full immunization coverage in the country from the current 65% to more than 90% through special immunization drives, with special attention to 216 identified highfocus districts. Q2. When will Mission Indradhanush drives be conducted during phase III? Special routine immunization drives under Mission Indradhanush will be conducted across the country in all districts. Each drive will be conducted for up to 7 days, with a gap of at least 4 weeks between the two drives. During phase III, four special drives will be conducted between April and July 2016, with focus on 216 highfocus districts. Q3. What areas will be prioritized for coverage in the identified high/medium focus districts under Mission Indradhanush? The Mission will focus on the following key areas : 1. Areas with vacant subcentres: No ANM posted for more than 3 months. 2. Villages/areas with three or more consecutive missed routine immunization sessions: ANMs on long leave or other similar reasons 3. Highrisk areas identified by the polio eradication programme that are not having independent routine immunization sessions and clubbed with some other routine immunization sessions. 4. These include populations living in areas such as: urban slums with migration nomadic sites brick kilns construction sites other migrant settlements (fisherman villages, riverine areas with shifting populations, etc.) underserved and hardtoreach populations (forested and tribal populations, etc.). 5. Areas with low routine immunization coverage (pockets with recent measles or other VPD outbreaks) 6. Small villages, hamlets, dhanis or purbas clubbed with another village for routine immunization sessions and not having independent routine immunization sessions. Q4. Why has my district been included for Phase III of Mission Indradhanush? A total of 201 highfocus districts were identified for Phase I of Mission Indradhanush based on extensive analysis. Subsequently, phase II was conducted in 352 districts (73 districts repeated from phase I) of the country. High focus (phase I) districts where independent monitoring indicated that more than 90% children had received all due vaccines have been excluded, while Phase II districts where less than 60% of the children had received all due FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FOR MISSION INDRADHANUSH 27 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization vaccines have been included for Phase III. The 216 highfocus districts were identified based on monitoring indicators and feedback from states. Similar method will be followed for district selection in subsequent phases of the Mission Indradhanush. Q5. How will the number of beneficiaries for these drives be estimated? The beneficiaries for Mission Indradhanush will be estimated based on a head count survey that will be conducted by ASHA/AWW/link worker in all areas identified to be covered under Mission Indradhanush. An incentive of Rs 100 is available under NHM for this activity. For details, see financial guidelines (Annexure 7). Q6. Will this head count be conducted in the entire district before phase III of Mission Indradhanush? No, the head count for estimation of beneficiaries will be conducted only in areas where Mission Indradhanush sessions will be planned. An incentive of Rs 100 will be given to ASHA/AWW/link worker for this exercise, once before the first round and once for revision after the second round. Q7. All small hamlets, brick kilns, construction sites, nomadic sites, slums etc. in my sub centre area are tagged to the existing session sites. What is the need to conduct additional sessions in such areas? Despite tagging of HRAs, it is often observed that beneficiaries do not reach the session sites. Planning additional sessions close to residences of targeted beneficiaries in HRAs and other identified areas during Mission Indradhanush rounds provide another opportunity to immunize children, especially the left outs and drop outs. Q8. In Mission Indradhanush, is ANM eligible to claim any TA/DA for working outside her place of posting? Yes, ANM working outside her place of posting during Mission Indradhanush is eligible to claim TA/DA as per the state TA/DA rules. Q9. How will sites like brick kilns or construction sites be covered during these drives? Sites with a small number of beneficiaries that do not require independent sessions can be covered by mobile vaccination teams. More than one site may be covered by a mobile team. However, it must be ensured that vials of BCG, Measles, Rotavirus vaccine (RVV) and JE opened at one site are discarded and not used at the next site. Q10. Will any special training be provided for this drive? Yes, all health workers will be trained on the planning and implementation of Mission Indradhanush. ASHAs/AWWs/link workers will be trained on conducting the head count survey for estimation of beneficiaries and communicating with families of beneficiaries. District/Block level trainers who participated in district Mission Indradhanush workshops will be responsible for training all frontline workers and mobilizers involved in implementation of Mission Indradhanush. 28 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization In addition, training should be provided to data handlers, cold chain handlers and supervisors. Q11. How will immunization sessions be planned during 7 days of the Mission Indradhanush round? All ANMs should be involved in conducting sessions for Mission Indradhanush. They should dedicate 7 working days to Mission Indradhanush sessions, in addition to routine immunization days. The routine immunization sessions planned in between the 7 days of Mission Indradhanush should not be disturbed and should be held as planned. For Mission Indradhanush round, ANM may be deployed within or outside her block in her district of posting for conducting Mission Indradhanush sessions. This mechanism will tackle the existing human resource issues within the district. Q12. What will be the timings of sessions? The session sites will be operational from 09:00 to 16:00. However, flexibility based on the availability of beneficiaries or other local conditions is permitted. Q13. Will all UIP vaccines be provided in Mission Indradhanush rounds? Yes, all vaccines that are being provided under UIP in the state/district as per the national immunization schedule will be made available under Mission Indradhanush. Table 4. National Immunization Schedule Age Immunization Schedule Remarks At birth BCG, OPV0, Hep Bbirth dose (1) BCG vaccine can be given up to 1 year of age. (2) DPT vaccine can be given up to 56 years (not beyond 7 years) of age. (3) Pentavalent vaccine should be given under 1 year of age. In delayed cases , due doses above 1 year of age can be given to a child only if a child has received at least one dose of pentavalent vaccine before his/her first birthday. Due doses should be given at a minimum interval of 4 weeks, at the earliest available opportunity. (4) Measles vaccine can be given up to 5 years of age. (5) JE vaccine can be given up to 15 years of age. (6) IPV* should be given as per immunization schedule upto 1 year of age. single dose of IPV at 14 weeks of age along with OPV3 (in 28 states/UTs) two fractional doses of IPV at 6 & 14 weeks (in 8 states (RVV) should be given at 6, 10 & 14 weeks. It can be given up to 1 year of age. (in four states: Andhra Pradesh , Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and OPV1/Pentavalent1/RVV1 (in selected states) 10 weeks OPV2/Pentavalent2/RVV2 (in selected states) 14 weeks IPV*, OPV3/Pentavalent3/RVV3 (in selected states) 9 months MCV1; JE1 (where applicable) 1624 months MCV2; DPT first booster dose; OPV booster dose; JE2 (where applicable) 56 years DPT second booster dose 10 years TT 16 years TT BCG: Bacillus CalmetteGuerin Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Q14. Will IPV vaccine be provided during these drives in states that have introduced the vaccine? Yes, the states that have introduced IPV vaccine in the immunization schedule will provide the vaccine to beneficiaries. Migrant beneficiaries from other states will also be provided all vaccines being given under UIP. For example, JE vaccines will be given to beneficiaries from other states in a JE endemic district; IPV vaccine will be given to children (as per GoI guidelines) from migrant families when they are availing services in a state that has introduced IPV vaccine. In 28 states/UTs, single dose of IPV will be administered at 14 weeks of age along with OPV3. However, in 8 states given as two fractional intradermal doses at 6 and 14 weeks. Q15. How will all vaccines be delivered to the session sites for Mission Indradhanush? All vaccines and logistics will be delivered to session sites through alternate vaccine delivery mechanism. The same mechanism will be used to return all unused and partially used vaccine vials, along with the session report, to block PHC/urban health post. Q16. Will any different vaccination card be given to the beneficiaries of Mission Indradhanush? No, there is no different vaccination card for Mission Indradhanush. The MCP card with the revised immunization component used under the UIP will be used for Mission Indradhanush. If any beneficiary is getting vaccination for the first time or has lost the previous card, a new card should be issued. Q17. Will open vial policy be applicable in Mission Indradhanush? Yes, open vial policy will be applicable to OPV, IPV, Hepatitis B, DPT, TT and pentavalent vaccines. Open vial policy is not applicable to BCG, Measles, Rotavirus vaccine (RVV) and JE vaccines. Do not forget to write the date and time of opening vial on the label. Q18. Will ice packs used in the vaccine carriers during Mission Indradhanush drives be \"hard frozen\" or \"conditioned\"? Only conditioned ice packs should be used in routine immunization as well as for Mission Indradhanush drives as IPV, DPT, Hepatitis B, pentavalent and TT vaccines are freeze sensitive vaccines. When placed in a vaccine carrier with hard frozen ice packs, these vaccines may freeze and lose their potency. Also, BCG, OPV, measles and JE vaccines can be safely transported with conditioned ice packs. Q19. Will the guidelines for taking out one ice pack during the routine immunization session be valid for Mission Indradhanush drive as well? Yes, the vaccinator should take out one ice pack and place vaccines as shown in picture. 30 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Mission Indradhanush daily and cumulative coverage report should only include the coverage done in Mission Indradhanush sessions. This also means that Mission Indradhanush coverage report should be exclusively for Mission Indradhanush and should not include the coverage done during the routine immunization sessions held in between the Mission Indradhanush drive. Q20. How will these drives be monitored? These drives will be monitored by independent agencies including WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, ITSU, JSI, GHS, CORE and other lead partner agencies of RMNCHA in high priority districts. Besides these agencies, observers from national, state and district levels will also intensively monitor these drives. Feedback will be provided to the state and district task forces for immunization to ensure corrective actions. Based on monitoring and coverage feedback, Mission Indradhanush will closely be reviewed by District Magistrate/Chief Medical Officer at the district level, Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary/Mission Director (NHM) at the state level, and Secretary/Additional Secretary & Mission Director (NHM)/Joint Secretary/Immunization division at the national level. The progress of Mission Indradhanush is being reviewed periodically by the Prime Minister Office (PMO) as part of \"PRAGATI\". Q21. How will the reporting of Mission Indradhanush drive take place from ANM to block to district to state and to national level? For Mission Indradhanush, the reporting from ANM upwards till state is to be done on a daily basis. The state will compile districtlevel reports and share the compiled report with national level on the next day. Q22. Does the district need to include routine immunization coverage report for sessions held during Mission Indradhanush round? Under Mission Indradhanush coverage reporting, the district should not include the coverage of routine immunization sessions that were held during Mission Indradhanush. To explain better, if routine immunization sessions are being held in between the Mission Indradhanush drive, the daily coverage report of Mission Indradhanush district will not include the routine immunization coverage achieved during those days, i.e., only immunization coverage achievement done under Mission Indradhanush session should be forwarded to the next level right up to 31 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Ensure that at the month end Mission Indradhanush coverage should be included as part of the monthly coverage reporting in HMIS national level. Reporting of Mission Indradhanush coverage for every round should be based on the coverage achieved for that day. The final coverage report of Mission Indradhanush will include only the coverage of Mission Indradhanush drive. Q23. Should Mission Indradhanush coverage be reported in the HMIS? Yes, Mission Indradhanush coverage should be included as part of the monthly coverage reporting in HMIS. In other words, it means that the achievement under Mission Indradhanush and routine immunization for that given month should be jointly reported in HMIS as one report. HMIS portal does not have a separate data entry field for reporting Mission Indradhanush achievement. Q24. Should planned Mission Indradhanush sessions become a part of routine immunization microplan? Yes, planned Mission Indradhanush sessions should be incorporated in routine immunization microplanning soon after the completion of mission. Mission Indradhanush microplanning concept is based on potentially weak or priority areas for routine immunization. State should collect data for such inclusion and inform GoI. This revision in routine immunization microplanning must be discussed in DTFI and STFI for effective implementation. Q25. How should we plan for Mission Indradhanush sessions in vacant subcentre areas? All ANMs in the district will be working for 7 days of Mission Indradhanush, in addition to the routine immunization days. The ANMs will be deployed, based on need, to the vacant subcentre areas for conducting immunization sessions. After completion of Phase III of Mission Indradhanush, the additional sessions that are planned in such vacant subcentre areas should be assigned to ANM/s from adjoining subcentres or by deploying hired vaccinators. Some anticipated scenarios related to Mission Indradhanush SCENARIO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO 1. If Mission Indradhanush round start date coincides with routine immunization day in state. What needs to be done in such a case? In such a case, the planned routine immunization sessions will not be disturbed and will be held as planned. As per guidelines, ANM should plan to conduct Mission Indradhanush sessions on 7 working days in addition to routine immunization days, excluding Sundays and government holidays. Coverage data of routine immunization sessions will be reported separately from that of Mission Indradhanush coverage report. At the end of month, the Mission Indradhanush round coverage data and routine immunization data should be added and entered together in the HMIS. 32 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization 2. How Mission Indradhanush sessions should be planned at a sub centre where two ANMs are posted? Coverage area should be well demarcated between two ANMs. Each ANM will plan Mission Indradhanush sessions on 7 working days, excluding routine immunization days, Sundays and government holidays. Subcentres with delivery facilities should plan accordingly. Each of these two ANMs will submit separate Mission Indradhanush coverage reports each day. 33 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Microplanning forms the base for the delivery of routine immunization services to the community. The availability of an updated and complete microplan at a planning unit (urban and rural) demonstrates the preparedness of the unit and directly affects the quality of routine immunization services provided. Microplans developed to make the Mission successful will draw on the lessons learned from polio eradication towards systems strengthening, vaccine cold chain management, regular surveillance and monitoring of the plans to reach all children. Within 23 days of completion of district workshops, the following steps should be undertaken for preparing a complete microplan for Mission Indradhanush sessions: Step 1. First blocklevel microplanning meeting: Identification of areas that require sessions under Mission Indradhanush Facilitators : Two MOs from the block trained at district level, with support from partners including WHO India NPSP, UNICEF and others. Nodal officer will coordinate this activity in urban local bodies. Participants : ANMs/LHVs/health supervisors/key NHM officials at block level Timeline : To be completed within 2-3 days of district workshop Activities to be conducted : Prepare a master list of all villages/hamlets/HRAs etc. using the existing routine immunization microplans, polio microplans, census list of villages/hamlets, list of polio HRAs (slums, nomads, brick kilns, construction sites and other nonmigratory HRAs), list of areas with measles or diphtheria outbreaks in the last two years (with any reported measles death) and monitored areas for routine immunization with suboptimal performance. STEPS FOR PREPARATION OFMICROPLANS FOR MISSION INDRADHANUSH 34 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization ANMs will be provided blank microplanning format 1 (Annexure 8) to list all areas and subsequently identify areas requiring additional sessions under Mission Indradhanush in their own subcentre areas. During the following 23 days, ANMs should list all HRAs (villages, hamlets, slums, nomadic sites, brick kilns, construction sites, other highrisk settlements) on the ANM microplanning format 1 (Annexure 8). Once all areas are listed, ANMs will identify areas where the number of unvaccinated (left outs) and partially vaccinated (drop outs) children up to 2 years of age is high and require additional sessions. Enlisting of beneficiaries will require ASHA/AWW/link worker support for headcount survey. Step 2. Block/Urban health unit microplanning meeting Facilitators : Two MOs from the block trained at district level, with support from partners including WHO India NPSP, UNICEF and others. Nodal officer will coordinate this activity in urban local bodies. Participants : ANMs/LHVs/health supervisors/key NHM officials at block level Timeline : To be completed within 23 days of the first block microplanning meeting Activities to be conducted : ANMs will bring filled microplanning format 1 (Annexure 8) during training at the block level. This will be reviewed by the trainer and amended if required. Block/health post MO IC will identify areas that require additional routine immunization sessions from all subcentres. MO IC will enlist all such areas in microplanning format 2 (Annexure 8) and also determine whether these sites will be covered through outreach sessions or mobile sessions. Each ANM will prepare a roster using microplanning format 3 (Annexure 10) for additional sessions in her own subcentre area in consultation with the Block MO IC. For Mission Indradhanush days, she can be assigned areas outside her subcentre area for a maximum of 7 days of Mission Indradhanush activity. Once the ANM has prepared her roster for areas requiring additional Mission Indradhanush sessions in her own subcentre area, MO IC will identify areas in the block that require an additional session but have not been included in any ANM's roster. This may happen in vacant subcentre areas where the ANM is on long leave or absent for any other reason. MO IC will assign such areas to other ANMs in the block for the remaining days of the Indradhanush round. This assignment should be done keeping in mind the travel time and feasibility of this assignment. These assigned sessions will be included by ANMs concerned in their roster for the round. Such ANMs working in other subcentre areas may be supervised by a different supervisor. 35 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Plan to engage all ANMs during the Mission Indradhanush drive. ASHAs/AWWs/link workers will be assigned to each session in consultation with the block ASHA coordinator. The ASHA manager will ensure that headcount is conducted for estimation of beneficiaries in additional areas assigned to a mobilizer. Ensure that this is a timebound activity (1 week) and its progress is monitored by DTFI. MO IC will monitor and provide oversight to this activity. In urban areas: Identify Nodal officer for immunization activities in urban areas for Mission Indradhanush Nodal officer will demarcate the urban area into the catchment area of available health posts. He/she will then identify the available health manpower (ANMs/public health nurses/health supervisors) in each health post. Considering 2-3 polio team days as one unit, each health post incharge will map and list each such unit in microplanning format 1 (Annexure 8). Once all areas are listed, health post incharges will identify areas where numbers of unvaccinated (left outs) and partially vaccinated (drop outs) beneficiaries require additional sessions (posh colonies/areas with high routine immunization coverage will not be included in this planning). All such areas will be listed in microplanning format 2 (Annexure 9). Step 3. Districtlevel microplan finalization meeting Facilitators : CMO/DIO and trained MO with support from partners including WHO India NPSP, UNICEF and others Participants : Two MOs from each block and urban nodal officers Timeline : To be conducted within 2-3 days of block/urban health unit microplanning meeting Activities to be conducted : Each block medical officerin charge (MO IC) and nodal officer (in urban areas) will carry microplanning Form 2 of his/her block/urban area along with microplanning Form 3 (ANM roster for Mission Indradhanush) for all ANMs in the block. Nodal officer in urban areas will discuss the number of sessions that have not been assigned to any ANM/vaccinator. DIO will assess the number of sessions in each block and all urban areas that have not been assigned to any ANM/vaccinator. He/she will also assess the number of ANM days available with each block/urban area that may be handed over to another block/urban area. 36 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization ANMs with one or more days available during Mission Indradhanush week can be assigned to another block/urban area for conducting routine immunization sessions during this drive. This assignment should be done keeping in mind the travel time and feasibility of this assignment. These assigned sessions will be included in the ANM roster (microplanning Form 3) of ANMs by their MO ICs concerned. Such ANMs working in other subcentre areas may be supervised by a different supervisor. This meeting will also allow the DIO to review the requirement of mobile units for conducting vaccination sessions in blocks/urban areas. DIO will also assess the requirement of hiring vaccinators for conducting sessions during this drive. Step 4. Block meeting with ANMs, ASHAs, AWWs and link workers for microplan distribution Facilitators : Two MOs from the block trained at district level, with support from partners including WHO India NPSP, UNICEF and others. Nodal officer will coordinate this activity in urban local bodies. Participants : ANMs/LHVs/health supervisors/key NHM officials at block level Timeline : To be completed within 2 days of district microplan finalization meeting Activities to be conducted : MO ICs of blocks and urban health posts will conduct this meeting with their ANMs/health workers/hired vaccinators after the districtlevel microplanning meeting. By this time, each ANM roster (Annexure 10) will be filled with the following: o Areas included in ANM's subcentre with weak routine immunization coverage, where she will conduct routine immunization sessions on the two routine immunization days designated by the state (as stated in the example above). Sessions that ANM will conduct in the neighbouring block/urban area on the remaining days of Mission Indradhanush round. During these days, she will be supervised by the supervisor designated for that particular area. The ANM concerned will need to discuss details (how to reach designated area, where to pick up vaccines) with the supervisor of the area. Details of the mobilizer (name and contact number) will be available in the ANM roster for Mission Indradhanush rounds. 37 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Each ANM will send her tally sheet to the block through the alternate vaccine delivery (AVD) mechanism on a daily basis so that reports can be compiled and submitted to the district on a daily basis. Monitoring feedback for the ANM will be shared with the MO IC of the planning unit where she is working for the day. MO will share feedback of the MO IC of the block where the ANM is posted. 38 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization An effective vaccine, logistics and cold chain system is an essential prerequisite for successful running of an immunization programme. It is critical for immunization services to ensure the availability of appropriate equipment and an adequate supply of highquality vaccines and immunization related materials to all levels of the programme. It is important to ensure correct implementation of relevant strategies. The key areas of logistics support include vaccine management and monitoring, cold chain management and immunization safety. If vaccine, logistics and cold chain programme is well managed, it can help save on programme costs in ensuring programme implementation efficiently without sacrificing the quality of service delivery. Poorly managed logistics systems can lead to high and/or unnecessary vaccine wastage rates, stock outs, or improper management of waste, resulting in significant operational programme costs, as well as a negative impact on public health. Vaccine stores at all levels (state, regional, district, primary health centers (PHCs), community health centers, other cold chain storage points) need to forecast their vaccine needs for the stipulated time period to ensure that the right amount of vaccines, logistics and cold chain equipment are available to vaccinate all eligible infants at a given time in a given area. Each of these levels should monitor the stock of vaccine and syringes in order to assess the leadtime and reordering levels. 12.1 Estimating vaccines and syringes needed Logistics including autodisable (AD) syringes and MCP cards available under the existing UIP programme will be used for Mission Indradhanush. As each AD syringe is packed separately, hence, maximum permissible wastage rate for AD syringes equal to vaccine doses supplied including wastage. Estimation of vaccine and logistics requirements should be done on the existing formats, based on the estimation of beneficiaries. VACCINES AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT National switch date is 25 April 2016: Do not use tOPV after the switch date Any new vaccine introduced will be a part of Mission Indradhanush. Figure 3.Vaccine/Diluent reporting for Mission Indradhanush 39 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization PHCs and districts need to forecast their vaccine needs for the stipulated time period to ensure that the right amount of vaccine, AD syringes and cold chain equipment are available to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries in the identified areas at a given time. DIO will be responsible for ensuring availability of required stock of vaccine and logistics for the Indradhanush sessions. Buffer stocks should be maintained as per recommendations. In case of any vaccine or logistic shortage at any session during the Indradhanush week, the ANM will contact the supervisor, who will arrange the required vaccine(s)/logistics from the nearby session or planning unit. Shortage at the block must promptly be replenished from the district level. In case of any shortage at district level, SIO will be informed for necessary action. The monitoring of vaccines and logistics can be done through eVIN in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The reporting chain for vaccines/diluents is given in Figure 3. 12.2 Vaccine wastage The existing open vial policy (OVP) guidelines will be applicable to significantly reduce vaccine wastage. All efforts should be made to minimize vaccine wastage at all levels. The maximum acceptable wastage for vaccines eligible for reuse under the OVP (such as pentavalent vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV), IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine), hepatitis B, diphtheria toxoid (TT) vaccine) is 10%. Summary: Wastage permissible for all vaccines In Routine immunization Vaccine Maximum acceptable wastage BCG 50% and the wastage multiplication factor for calculation is 2.0. RVV, Measles and JE 25% and the calculation is 1.33. IPV, OPV, Pentavalent Hepatitis B, DPT, TT 10%. for all vaccines eligible for reuse under the open vial policy The wastage multiplication factor for calculation is 1.11. 12.3 Cold chain space and inventory The cold chain infrastructure in India is a wide network of cold chain stores consisting of government medical supply depots (GMSD), state, regional/divisional vaccine stores, and district and PHC/CHC vaccine storage points. The cold chain network in the country has been the backbone to ensure that right quantity and right quality of vaccine reaches the target population. In states that have introduced the pentavalent vaccine, cold chain space availability has increased due to the reduced requirement of DPT and hepatitis B vaccines. With this freed capacity, there is no constraint envisaged on the cold chain capacity for storage of IPV. 40 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The cold chain inventory should be regularly reviewed and status of the same should be updated in the National Cold Chain Management Information System (NCCMIS). 12.4 Cold chain monitoring Proper storage of vaccines and maintenance of the cold chain during storage and distribution are essential to prevent the loss of potency. Once a vaccine loses its potency, this cannot be regained. Damaged vaccines should be discarded according to the guidelines. Measures should be taken to protect heat and freeze sensitive vaccines such as pentavalent and IPV because they lose their potency when exposed to temperatures outside the range recommended by the manufacturer. The heat impact on vaccines is cumulative. 12.5 Vaccine storage To ensure efficacy of the vaccines, proper storage and packing are essential. The following are recommended for vaccine storage: In topopening refrigerators (icelined): store freezesensitive vaccines including DPT, TT, Hep B, Pentavalent vaccine and IPV and other on top. Freeze sensitive vaccines could be damaged if placed in direct contact with frozen ice packs that were inadequately conditioned. Therefore, water ice packs should be conditioned before use. 12.6 Conditioning of water ice packs In order to ensure correct storage of vaccines, the following procedures should be followed: Ensure that the insulated vaccine carriers are clean before use and at end of the day. Use a packing table, and remove ice packs from freezer and place on table to defrost. Packs are ready to use when there are physical signs of thawing; no ice but drops of water on surface, and liquid is observed inside. Dry the packs and line the walls of the insulated vaccine carrier with them. Place the vaccines inside and ensure that the container is properly closed. 41 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Allowing ice packs to thaw means that the initial freezing temperature is lost, so the temperature in the insulated carrier does not drop below 0\u00b0C. Properly conditioned water ice packs constitute the best method to maintain the temperature of the insulated carriers and cold boxes. There should be sufficient ice packs to ensure that the vaccines are totally surrounded during transportation. 12.7 Recording and reporting Recording and reporting of vaccination during Mission Indradhanush rounds will be done in the attached formats on a daily basis to the next higher level, i.e., ANM will report to the block PHC in the tally sheet for Mission Indradhanush (Annexure 13a & 13 b), block PHC will report to the district, and so on (Figure 3). Vaccination will also be reported through the existing HMIS and mother and child tracking system (MCTS) portals. Blocks will compile ANM reports (Annexure 14a & 14b) and districts will compile block reports (Annexure 15a & 15b) and submit to the state (Annexure 16a & 16b). Critical indicators that will be derived from these reports are: o total beneficiaries immunized o total children fully immunized o total children completely immunized o total beneficiaries vaccinated antigenwise o total children vaccinated for first time The routine immunization sessions will be held as planned but coverage data of these sessions will not be included in the Mission Indradhanush coverage report. However, at the end of month, the Mission Indradhanush round coverage data and routine immunization data will be entered together in the HMIS. 12.8 Communication materials It is important to revise and distribute IEC materials for creating awareness among the community and caregivers before the Indradhanush rounds. The GoI will share prototypes of IEC materials with all states. The states can adapt these IEC materials as per their requirements. 12.9 Waste disposal Keeping in harmony with the \"Swaach Bharat Abhiyan \" launched by the GoI, each session will ensure clean surroundings and proper segregation and containment of all immunization waste 42 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization generated. The immunization waste will be sent to the PHC for disinfection and finally disposed of as per norms of the Central Pollution Control Board. 12.10 Launch of Mission Indradhanush Mission Indradhanush provides states with an opportunity to reach the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children and pregnant women and improve the full immunization status. A wellpublicized launch ceremony for the Mission should be planned to improve general awareness about the UIP, with a focus on unreached/poorly reached areas as per the criteria described earlier. Successful launch of the Mission will include mass media components as well as onetoone interpersonal contact with beneficiaries to openly respond to queries. To be able to respond comprehensively, other related government departments, local media and NGOs should be briefed and brought on board, so that they may also spread the message and motivate the community to benefit from immunization. The state and district task forces on immunization should steer the planning, coordination, implementation and monitoring of the programme. Recording and reporting formats and communication materials should be prepared in local languages and distributed well in advance to target audiences. Failures in communication commonly occur because the disseminated materials do not reach the intended targets and/or the information is not appropriate for the intended audience. 43 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization The technical and monitoring support of partner agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International and other stakeholders continues to be of significance in strengthening of health systems and programmes in India. States must actively engage these partner agencies in their core areas of strength. WHO WHO India will provide technical support to the government by building sustainable institutional capacity for effective planning and implementation and undertake routine performance monitoring at district/block level for timely delivery of routine immunization services. The following are the key thematic areas of support: Facilitate preparatory meetings for the development of microplans at district and block levels. Develop training materials and build capacity of district trainers for training of health personnel. Track the progress and implementation of the Indradhanush round. Provide monitoring feedback during task force and other review meetings at district, state and national levels. Risk prioritization UNICEF Support state, districts and blocks for social mobilization activities, dissemination of information and their monitoring through its social mobilization network. Provide supportive supervision for cold chain and vaccine management using standardized checklists and sharing feedback at the national, state and district levels. Participate as resource persons in training of health personnel at state and district levels. UNICEF will work collaboratively with Immunization Technical Support Unit (ITSU) to develop the dissemination plan for Mission Indradhanush at the national, state, district and block levels. Strategic communication unit of ITSU will take a lead on communication plan activities. ITSU will formalise the communication plan with inputs and support from UNICEF, Rotary, Global Health Strategies and other partners. Rotary International Advocacy at state and district levels for routine immunization strengthening, specifically for Indradhanush. Supporting the mass awareness campaign through intensified IEC activities and community mobilization interventions. ROLE OF PARTNER AGENCIES 44 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Lead partners for call to action (RMNCH+A) The RMNCH+A state lead partners will assist with implementation of strategies to strengthen the Mission in selected highfocus districts. They will also support monitoring of immunization drives and share feedback at block, district and state levels. Any critical support required by the state may be forwarded to the lead partner agency through the STFI. Professional bodies and CSOs Key state and local bodies such as IMA, IAP and CSOs should be actively involved. These organizations are expected to play a critical role in awareness generation and advocacy, particularly at the local level. They will participate in district and state level meetings. 45 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization A massive framework has been put in place for rigorous monitoring of one of the largest immunization programmes of the world. Oversight of the implementation activities is crucial at all levels. Supervision should focus on bringing the gaps identified through the state and district preparedness assessment checklists. Critical information on preparedness, including quality of task forces for Immunization, deputation of senior officials to priority areas for monitoring, status of trainings at state, district and block levels and status of microplanning activities will be collated by medical officers and field monitors, and information generated will be shared with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India on a weekly basis. Information generated from concurrent monitoring will be utilized at local level during evening debriefing meetings at block and district level to ensure midcourse corrective actions. Data generated from the monitoring formats will be collated in a data tool to generate key indicators that will be shared at all levels with the government. 14.1 Monitoring of operations The Mission Indradhanush rounds will be intensively monitored in the highest priority areas by officials from the national, state and district levels. Using the Mission Indradhanush monitoring formats for session site monitoring and house to house monitoring, all available monitors from national, state and district levels should be deployed to monitor activity in the highest priority blocks/urban areas. The monitoring formats should be compiled and summarized as per normal practices. Nationallevel monitors: Officials from MoHFW, GoI and partner agencies Statelevel monitors: Senior state health officials deployed to the Mission Indradhanush districts by STFI Districtlevel monitors: Senior district health officials deployed to high priority blocks by DTFI Key indicators derived from monitoring are given below. Mission Indradhanush Session monitoring indicators This captures information on vaccine supply and the availability of logistics, functioning of alternate vaccine delivery (AVD) system, injection practices of ANMs, injection safety and MONITORING AND EVALUATION \"Hon'ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has reviewed Mission Indradhanush under 'PRAGATI' - the ICTbased, multimodal platform for ProActive Governance and Timely Implementation\" with Chief Secretaries on 17 February 2016. During the session, he emphasized the need for an organized and aggressive action plan to cover all children for immunization in a specific timeframe. 46 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization waste disposal, record keeping and interpersonal communication of service providers. The following indicators will be monitored: Sessions held as per plan Reasons for sessions not held Percentage of sessions found held among monitored HRAs (can be generated by type of HRAs) ANMs/ASHAs having due list IEC display status Availability of vaccines Reason analysis on nonavailability of any vaccine Indicators on AEFI and implementation of OVP Availability of logistics as per microplan Indicators on safe injection practices Sessions visited by supervisors Caregiver responses regarding proactive mobilization efforts Reason analysis on nonavailability of any vaccinator Dissemination of four key messages to caregivers. ANM days planned/ utilized Percentage of vacant sub centers saturated with ANM Number of Mission Indradhanush sessions held outside the ANM subcenter area/block Mission Indradhanush Housetohouse monitoring indicators Percentage of children due for any vaccine during Indradhanush Percentage of children due in Indradhanush that got vaccinated with vaccine(s) Percentage of children who received vaccines for the first time in Indradhanush Mobilization efforts: percentage awareness by ASHAs/AWWs/ANMs/others. State /District Immunization Officer Have we made any progress towards expanding our microplans after Phase I and Phase II Mission Indradhanush rounds? Have all additional sessions planned during Mission Indradhanush (phase I & II) been included in the regular routine immunization microplans in district/blocks? If yes, have the districts projected their funding requirement accordingly in their project implementation plans (ASHA incentive, AVD, any district specific activity proposed with justification)? 47 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization State/District Immunization Officer Prior to next phase of Mission Indradhanush Critical Microplan Review: Has the district assigned priority blocks to senior officers? Have all areas with vacant subcenters been included? Have all areas where no routine immunization sessions planned due to staff on leave/deputation been included? Are all Polio HRAs with no routine immunization service delivery included? Areas where VPD outbreaks reported; Have all hardto reach areas/areas that are part of routine immunization sessions but with poor mobilization included? Have areas where routine immunization monitoring shows gaps included? How many ANMs have been planned to move to other sub center within the same block or to sub centers outside the block but in the same districts? Have they been informed about their TA/DA support as per state rules? In the areas where Mission Indradhanush sessions planned, has head count survey been conducted? Following head count survey, have the due lists been made to track the beneficiaries? What is the status of IEC material for next phase of Mission Indradhanush? Has the district made a plan for timely funds transfer to mobilizers? 14.2 Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Any community's perception and acceptance of immunization rests on its safety. Any AEFI should therefore be reported, investigated and responded to promptly and adequately as per existing guidelines. All staff should familiarize themselves with these guidelines and reporting formats. The AEFI management centres will have to be identified with contact details mentioned in microplans. 14.3 Monitoring of communication interventions For effective implementation of the communication plan, it is imperative to monitor all activities mentioned in the communication plan. Periodic monitoring (programme and finance) of communication interventions provides the policy/programme managers with: status of all planned IEC/BCC activities mentioned in the state/district communication plan progress of various IEC/BCC activities at a particular time and at a particular implementation level status of capacitybuilding activities as per the training plan 48 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization status of dissemination (achieved against planned) and stock position of IEC material at various levels - state, district, block status of planned initiatives related to advocacy, coordination, convergence, etc. The monitoring plan will comprise a list of measurable and quantitative activities from the final state/district communication plan, previous community needs assessment, data from evaluations/surveys conducted and protocol/guidelines for monitoring plan implementation framework. Additionally, states with a robust management information system will be able to provide accurate, complete and timely data for effective monitoring of IEC/BCC activities based on HMIS. Feedback must be an integral part of the monitoring plan to provide timely feedback to data generating units on quality of data. 14.4 Evaluation methodology A new crosssectional survey called Integrated Child Health and Immunization Survey (INCHIS) was designed to obtain nationally representative data on immunization coverage and child health during phases I and II of Mission Indradhanush. This survey periodically collected data at a national level to measure progress related to immunization coverage, child health and its system determinants. Using an internationally established sampling methodology, information obtained from selected states has been used to evaluate the impact of Mission Indradhanush . 49 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization An equitybased programme, Mission Indradhanush launched in 2015, builds on polio strategies, tools, techniques and manpower to focus specific attention on identified high risk areas with traditionally low coverage, such as slums, and among nomadic populations and migrant families living in brick kilns and construction sites. The mission also targets the 400,000 high risk areas identified in the polio programme as well as other underserved areas where there are insufficient health services (gaps or lack in vaccinators, etc.), migrant populations, recent measles/diphtheria outbreaks or high dropout rates. It uses the special strategies developed by the polio teams to access these high risk, hardtoreach and underserved communities. Government ownership, partnerships and accountability framework Led by the government, a rigorous monitoring framework replicating the polio accountability system was put in place for providing oversight to Mission Indradhanush implementation activities at the state, district and block levels through health experts, officials and various partners. The polio programme and now Mission Indradhanush have the highest levels of political commitment and senior policy makers being involved personally. Task forces for immunization at the state, district and block levels have been established using the polio model for regular planning and review of the routine immunization programme. Monitoring data from the field is fed back to the block, district and state task forces for immediate corrective action and to guide programmatic decisionmaking and actions following the campaigns. The core polio partners - WHO, UNICEF, Rotary, CORE, BMGF, and other partners continue to work closely together with the government on strengthening routine immunization. Microplanning for Mission Indradhanush Detailed district and block microplanning was critical to effective interruption of polio transmission in India. During campaigns, vaccinators used microplans to track vaccination activities in each community, and review by district task forces determined which children were missed and corrective actions taken as part of the accountability and supervisory system. Certain \"highrisk\" areas have been especially difficult to immunize - barriers due to geography, poverty, internal mobility/migration, lack of education, variety of languages cultural diversity and distrust of the government, as well as sheer population density have required creative and persistent efforts. Mission Indradhanush brought in communities that previously had only been reached for polio vaccination but with limited access to RI services. Microplanning for Mission KEY POINTS FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF MISSION INDRADHANUSH PHASE III 50 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Indradhanush focused on improving coverage and addressing equity issues in access to immunization. Additional immunization sites planned under Mission Indradhanush are being included into the government system's Routine Immunization microplans with support from the WHO & UNICEF polio network to ensure completeness of routine immunization service reach. Head count survey and due list preparation Head count process to develop session specific duelist based on head count should be initiated well in advance, and preround validation of head survey should be done for improving coverage. There is a need of regular orientation and supervision of frontline workers for doing head count survey, due list updation and mobilization of children. Capacity building of frontline workers Frontline workers were trained prior to Mission Indradhanush with brief orientation during subsequent campaign. These trainings will improve technical and communication skills of frontline workers. Reorientation of frontline workers on IPC skills should also be conducted on a regular basis. Supervision of activities The STFI and DTFI are essential. Assign national and state level officials for monitoring Mission Indradhanush rounds. District and sub district supervision should also be strengthened. National and State level officials for monitoring Mission Indradhanush have shown improved quality of work. District and sub district supervision was patchy and should be strengthened. Review by MDNHM/Secretary/PS ensures strong ownership at the state/district/block. Feedback loop with utilization of technology (video conference/mobile sms) found effective. Vaccine and cold chain management Urgent attention is needed to improve vaccine upkeep to ensure conditioning of ice packs, maintenance of distribution register, implementation of open vials policy and its records, and adherence to AVD plan. Focus on cold chain management training. Social mobilization Social mobilization was an issue during first two phases; most of the states did not prepared IEC materials. However, as a result of financial clarity and regular follow ups from national level, significant improvement was observed in most of the states. IEC is an important factor in creating awareness in community about the importance of immunization. Therefore, IEC activities should be improved. 51 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization o PRI members, ration dealers and local influencers' involvement should be strengthened. Need of standardization of IEC material is required. Concept of mothers' meeting, Nukkad Natak, videos in the community, etc., should be strengthened. Timing Special catch up rounds should be planned in a way to ensure better coverage of migratory populations and HRG sites. In Mission Indradhanush, day should be fixed and not the date. We should plan from a day in the week rather than date in the month. Financial issues Communication of financial guidelines for IEC activities should be shared well in advance. The financial guidelines have to be released well on time for replication. Ensure timely payments of incentives to motivate ASHAs/mobilizers. Data management Newly designed tally sheet will help in reporting as well as tracking beneficiaries during all rounds. Ensure completeness and quality of data transmission an issue. 52 Mission Indradhanush: Identify, enlist, mobilize, vaccinate and track to achieve full immunization Annexure 1.
