There is a lot of discussion about religious reasons for not getting the [COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/05/31/evangelical-pastors-covid-19-vaccination-approach-requires-balancing-act/5089356001/), but in reality, there are actually very few religions who have documented, doctrinal reasons for not believing in immunizations. Despite the fact that it has been dominating national news, [ evangelical Christianity](https://www.nae.org/what-is-an-evangelical/) isn't one of them. Still, some Christians and other people of faith are citing their religion as a reason why they won't get the COVID-19 vaccine. Common faith perspectives: [Pastors have power when it comes to persuading congregants to get COVID vaccine](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2021/05/31/evangelical-pastors-covid-19-vaccination-approach-requires-balancing-act/5089356001/) White evangelical Protestants are the only religious group that didn't reach a majority when asked in a [Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) ](https://www.prri.org/)and [ Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC) ](https://ifyc.org/)poll if they believe they should get vaccinated because it \"helps protect everyone\" and \"is a way to live out the religious principle of loving my neighbors.\" Only 43% of white evangelical Protestants agreed with those statements, compared to 56% of Black Protestants and 61% of Hispanic Protestants, [according to the survey.](https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/) \"So convenient\": [Columbus community organizations, churches host walk-in COVID-19 vaccine clinics](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/05/05/local-walk-covid-19-vaccine-clinics-offer-access-ease/4893506001/) One way white evangelical Protestants say their faith is against the vaccine is by talking of eternal life, like [ Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves](https://governorreeves.ms.gov/) did in late August. \"When you believe in eternal life \u2014 when you believe that living on this earth is but a blip on the screen \u2014 then you don't have to be so scared of things,\" Reeves said. That belief, that God controls everything, is a core belief of evangelicals, said PRRI Director of Research Natalie Jackson. Most religions don't prohibit vaccines There are many religious arguments for and against the COVID-19 vaccination. Here are some of the major religions' beliefs about it: Catholicism Catholic officials expressed initial concerns about the use of cell lines from aborted fetuses in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but ultimately said Catholics could still get the vaccine if it was the only one available. In a [March statement,](https://www.usccb.org/news/2021/us-bishop-chairmen-doctrine-and-pro-life-address-use-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine) the [United States Conference of Catholic Bishops](https://www.usccb.org/) said \"being vaccinated can be an act of charity that serves the common good.\" \"Puzzling\": [Use of cell lines from aborted fetuses to create vaccine 'serious disappointment' to Columbus Catholic Bishop, others](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2021/03/08/columbus-catholic-bishop-disappointed-j-j-vaccines-use-fetal-cells/4632693001/) Almost 80% of white Catholics were accepting of the vaccine in July, according to a PRRI study, and Hispanic Catholics were one of the religious groups whose vaccine acceptance increased the most. It went from 56% in March to 80% in June, according to PRRI. Other Christians Christians, not including Catholics, were 77% accepting of vaccines, [according to PRRI's release in July.](https://www.prri.org/research/religious-vaccines-covid-vaccination/) COVID quandary: [Retailers grapple with mask use as cases rise again](https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/2021/09/08/retailers-grapple-mask-use-covid-19-cases-rise-again/5771035001/) The vast majority of Christian denominations have no theological opposition to vaccines, including Eastern Orthodox, Amish, Anglican, Baptist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mennonites, Quakers and Pentecostal Christians, according to [Vanderbilt University Medical Center research. ](https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/immunizations-and-religion) Christian denominations with a theological opposition to vaccination The only Christian denominations who cite a theological reason for opposing vaccines are the Dutch Reformed Church and Church of Christ, Scientist, according to Vanderbilt. Some members of the Dutch Reformed Church decline vaccines because it \"interferes with divine providence,\" while others accept it as a gift from God, Vanderbilt research shows.

Denominations that believe in faith healing, or laying hands on people in order to heal their illnesses, also likely don't believe in vaccines. [Church of Christ, Scientist, ](https://www.christianscience.com/)teaches that prayer will alleviate and prevent disease, so members may request vaccine exemptions, the Vanderbilt research shows. The denomination doesn't strictly prohibit vaccination, though. Vaccine mandates: [Ohio State now requiring the COVID-19 vaccine.

These aren't decisions imposed by their church.\" Islam The [ Islamic Society of North America (ISNA)](https://isna.net/) released information [encouraging people to get the vaccine](https://isna.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Press-Release-NMCTF-COVID-Vaccines-12.22.2020.pdf) and to take other precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This is the theological foundation for vaccination.\" Early on during COVID-19 vaccination efforts, there were concerns expressed that pork products \u2014 which the religion forbids followers to consume \u2014 might be in the vaccines. ISNA said in its release that the vaccines don't contain pork products. Judaism Jewish people support vaccination, as one of the most important tenets of the religion is preserving life.
