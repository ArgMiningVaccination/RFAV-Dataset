I recommend it to practitioners and patients alike.\" \u2014Andrew Weil, MD, author of Eight Weeks to Optimum Health and Mind Over Meds International bestselling author Dr. Andreas Michalsen uncovers the natural cures that will transform your health and change your life Sunlight. Forest bathing. Fasting. Cold-water baths. Bloodletting. Leeches. Cupping. These ways of healing have been practiced in different cultures around the world for centuries. But as a cardiologist working with the most high-tech medical tools, Dr. Andreas Michalsen was taught that these practices were medieval and outdated, even dangerous. As he saw surprising results in his patients, however, Dr. Michalsen explored more deeply those seemingly \"outdated\" methods of healing. The more he researched, the more he was convinced by the power of natural medicine--naturopathy--to heal the human body. Over the past few decades, Dr. Michalsen has published the most cutting-edge scientific research on the efficacy of natural medicine. At the prestigious Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Berlin, Dr. Michalsen has successfully treated thousands of patients using elements found in nature--sunlight, water, nourishing foods, medicinal plants and animals. The culmination of years of research and clinical knowledge, The Nature Cure explains how and why naturopathy works. Dr. Michalsen breaks down the science behind natural ways of healing and shows how we can incorporate these methods into our everyday lives to trigger our body's self-healing mechanism. Thoughtfully written and filled with science, history, case studies, and practical guidance, this illuminating book shares knowledge that has changed the lives of thousands of patients, teaching you what your body needs to heal--without medicine riddled with side effects or invasive procedures. Discover methods of healing that don't just cover up your symptoms, but actually address the root cause of illness.
