KIM PEIRANO, DACM, LAC", "date": null, "cleaned_text": "Esoteric Acupuncture, Medical Intuitive Readings, Gateway Energy Healing & Beyond Quantum Healing Past Life Regression Exploration Experience deeper healing through clairvoyant intuitive insight and knowledge. Dr. Kim's healing practice harnesses the healing energies of more than just text book Chinese Medicine and simple acupuncture point prescriptions. All the great masters will tell you that acupuncture is an energetic medicine, our vital life force - Qi - is an energy that can't be measured with medical or electronic devices, but is felt through the patient and practitioner. Due to it's energetic nature, using acupuncture needles to treat patients isn't always a necessary step in the healing process. Dr. Kim offers unique healing offerings for those patients who either wish to experience treatments without needles, or wish to deepen their healing experience with an intuitive guidance session and healing. Her intuitive insight is woven into every treatment, however you are always welcome to invite more of this type of healing if desired! Esoteric Acupuncture for Spiritual Growth & Healing In our journey of spiritual and personal growth it is important to not forget the necessity of the physical body. Not only is the body required to facilitate growth in the human experience, it is also a vessel which is necessary to our growth. We can't do spiritual work without body work, and all body work is also spiritual work, these two are inextricably linked. Alchemy, Acupuncture & Immortality? Acupuncture in the modern world is regarded as a treatment for managing pain, anxiety, stress, even fertility and internal medicine issues, we've broken it down to point prescriptions based on research used to treat the symptom, occasionally the root cause and rarely the entire person as a being. However, the ancient roots of East Asian Medicine weren't in treating pain, per se, but in the prospect of alchemy. Alchemy is the process of transformation, turning lead into gold, and turning mortality into immortality was most often the desire of ancient alchemists. During the age of Mao, alchemy was made illegal, and this aspect of Chinese medicine fell by the wayside, hidden and seldom remembered. As acupuncture became more modernized, particularly with the journey to the west, alchemy fell further and further into the subconscious memory of the practice, yet it still remains. Can acupuncture make you immortal? No, but kind of, depending on your definition of mortality. I think on the surface, mortality is the truth that the body will eventually die, nothing in this reality is permanent in a physical sense, and it is all ever changing. We can't destroy matter but we can transform it. Our consciousness, our existence as a spirit or soul transcends the physical body, and the more we are able to connect and hold true to this aspect of ourselves, we are able to 'transcend' the limitations of the physical world. The body may die, but our consciousness lives on, and by connecting with this aspect of ourselves we may experience a type of immortality in a sense - a simpler release of the physical body and reconnection with our consciousness. The quest for immortality was never about keeping the physical body alive forever, it is about remembering our truth as spirit so strongly that we hardly realize we've left the physical body once it does die. A Treatment to Support Your Spiritual Growth The practice of esoteric acupuncture is far removed from modern day applications of acupuncture, we aren't concerned with current ailments in the sense that this treatment is not a direct treatment for the physical or mental and emotional aspects of ourselves, it is a treatment to help with the alignment of our spiritual higher self and our physical existence in this human body. Treatments are not 'prescribed' by looking at symptoms, tongue and pulse but rather intuitively guided by Dr. Kim. It is essential that the practitioner of this type of medicine is rigorously committed to their own growth work so that they can facilitate this type of healing in the highest way possible. Dr. Kim's personal practice and inner plane work helps to make her an excellent practitioner of esoteric acupuncture, with her keen insight and intuition along with clarity of purpose and service she can help guide you to the most aligned healing space. This work isn't about following a set protocol so much as it is doing what's right in the right timing, by being able to read the energy of her patients, Dr. Kim is able to intuitively see or know which pattern to use, additional treatments to employ and how to guide you in your meditation so that you have the best outcome possible. Esoteric gateway treatments can help with many aspects of our journey on our spiritual growth path. These treatments can help to regulate specific chakras in and out of the body, and to help us build our connection to source, sometimes referred to as the Antahkarana or Rainbow Bridge. Esoteric acupuncture patterns are based not only in traditional Chinese medicine, but also the Hindu Nadi system (a much more complex meridian system of the body), chakras in body and out of body, the Tree of Life and Sacred Geometry. Esoteric Gateway Acupuncture Treatments may help with: Esoteric Gateway Acupuncture Treatments are right for you if: How Esoteric Gateway Acupuncture treatments work: Overall, changes from esoteric acupuncture treatments may be swift and life changing or subtle and slow, there is no 'right' response to a treatment and they will unfold over time. As we embark on a path of spiritual growth it is essential that we also care for our body, maintain health as much as possible and use the body as a vessel to ground our spiritual experience into the physical plane. Esoteric acupuncture treatments are designed to help you do just that - facilitate your personal growth and ground that growth into physical reality. Alchemy, Acupuncture & Immortality?

Everyone evolves on their own unique timeline, and this type of treatment is not a replacement for continued spiritual development and work. How Esoteric Gateway Acupuncture treatments work: - All patients start out as Intuitive Acupuncture patients and Dr. Kim will assess when it is in alignment for you to begin the esoteric work together. - If you are interested in this work please book a new patient appointment to begin - Treatments are suitable to receive once every 3-4 weeks to ensure proper time for full integration - Treatments do not address physical, mental or emotional imbalances directly (but improvement in these areas is often a byproduct), if you are also experiencing these types of imbalances it is recommended to also receive regular acupuncture treatment in conjunction. - Dr. Kim will do a typical intake where you will discuss your intentions for your treatment and anything you would like to address, this section may include a brief meditation and visualization to help hone in on your intention. - Treatments are typically 2 sided - a front and back treatment. You can expect 60-75 minutes of receiving acupuncture treatment in one session. - Once needles are placed Dr. Kim will guide you through a visualization to help activate the treatment and then leave you to rest for a period of time. - Once both sides of the treatment are complete Dr. Kim will help you to re-integrate and tap into the healing you received so that you can experience it after your treatment as well. Overall, changes from esoteric acupuncture treatments may be swift and life changing or subtle and slow, there is no 'right' response to a treatment and they will unfold over time. As we embark on a path of spiritual growth it is essential that we also care for our body, maintain health as much as possible and use the body as a vessel to ground our spiritual experience into the physical plane. Esoteric acupuncture treatments are designed to help you do just that - facilitate your personal growth and ground that growth into physical reality. Medical Intuitive Insight Readings & Gateway Healings As a trained Medical Intuitive and Energetic Healer, Dr. Kim blends her knowledge as a Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine with a more alchemical approach using her intuitive abilities and gifts. With her abilities she is able to energetically 'see' into the body and into the subtle bodies that are the energy bodies that lie outside of our physical form. This information she gathers helps her to understand more fully an aligned treatment approach and guide her in how to help you move forward. With each session Dr. Kim may provide insights to the deeper causes and meaning behind the issues or illness you are working on, take you through a guided visualization or past life regression to help heal the root cause of the current issue. Dr. Kim's guidance refers to her methods of healing as 'Gateway Healing' which is a simple term to encompass the wide breath of what she offers - helping you open the gateway to your potential for healing! The techniques she utilizes are similar to Reiki Healing, where the energy of the body is assessed and healing energy is moved through the body, acupuncture points and meridians or energetic space of the patient. Dr. Kim's medical intuition helps her guide the treatment and her healing, using advanced quantum energy healing techniques and Medical Qi Gong techniques she helps her patients to release stuck energy and helps the body reach a state of alpha-theta brainwave state to initiate the body's own healing potential. Dr. Kim has done much work around death and dying, end of life support, preparation for medical treatment and surgery, recovery for medical treatment and surgery and helping her patients understand the deeper inner workings of their illnesses or circumstance. Her work as a medical intuitive is to help you embrace fully your healing potential which is a very useful tool when working through a chronic illness, terminal diagnosis, fears around medical treatments or unknown disease / illness that is continuously undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Her holistic medical training as an Acupuncturist means that she can understand and help you through complex modern medical treatments and also support you holistically with information, healing, herbs / supplements, meditation and referrals to other medical providers. Empowerment through Truth and confront. This unique offering of intuitive insight and healing sessions are a way to embrace your healing in a deeper space, instigating true change on every layer of the self and spirit. When we receive information channeled to us from our spirit guides through a non-conditional space, this opens up a path for growth, change and opportunity. An intuitive reading is a healing service on it's own, but the depth of these sessions is in the addition of a directed healing which helps solidify this new intention and awareness into the body. We live as spirits in our bodies and it is beneficial for us to 'tune up' both aspects of our Earthly existence so that we can continue to grow and evolve in a way that promotes peace within, by focusing on healing the spirit, mind and body we help to promote this process. A reading provides insight and knowledge, by bringing our truth to light, even when it may be a difficult step, by creating awareness around what needs to shift or change and how to do so, we experience ultimate empowerment through these spiritual truths and confront. Available for established patients, and new patients located within the state of California only Beyond Quantum Healing - Past Life Regression Exploration If you've had curiosity about past lives, or just want to learn more about yourself and why you do the things you do, struggle with specific issues or the possible deeper causes of illness a Beyond Quantum Healing session might be right for you. Beyond Quantum Healing is a modality of past life regression hypnotherapy which builds upon the work of the late Dolores Cannon founder of the Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique. This work is designed to help you witness and heal deeper layers of your spirit, recall fragments, and clear blockages that may block you in your life today. The nature of time and space is a complex experience, while we may experience time in a linear fashion here on Earth as humans, time is much more complex than we can truly understand. There is actually only the 'now' moment, as what we recall from the past is happening now because here we are recalling it now, and planning for the future also happens now because in this now moment we are visualizing it. We have likely had hundreds if not thousands of lives on Earth and other places in the Universe and beyond, perhaps even experienced 'lives' as atoms or even a color. The list of possibilities is vast and inconclusive which makes for very interesting and enlightening BQH sessions! Dr. Kim's intuitive abilities make her an excellent guide into the etheric world of past lives and spirit world between lives. She helps to hold your intention for your session and works through the sessions by watching the energy of your experience, body and verbal cues and also listening to the spiritual guidance that is present along the way. By holding a high vibration and safe container for this work her patients are able to often have quite transformative experiences (even though sometimes it may not seem so in the moment.). BQH sessions often 'unfold' more and more deeply after the session has closed, as you integrate the work that has been done, clarity opens up around decisions, life issues and more. A Beyond Quantum Healing session begins with a thorough intake, from which we hone in and set your intention for the session. Perhaps you have questions about your illness, or where you came from, why you are here on Earth, what your life purpose is, what the purpose of a relationship was, wanting to connect more with your higher self and guidance, whatever the reason is it helps us jump into the BQH session. From here we set the intention then Dr. Kim will guide you into a deep state of hypnosis, a theta-brainwave state where you can access your higher consciousness and past lives. This takes us on a journey through different scenes and experiences, we may gain information, insights, connection and we most importantly experience healing and release. Once the session is complete we will do a brief review, any additional healing work necessary to help with integration and you are offered a recording of the session to review at a later date. Sessions are approximately 3 hours and take place in-person (on-line sessions available for those who do not live within travel distance to San Rafael, CA) Please click the button below to request a session and we will be in contact with you to schedule!
