As an antioxidant that protects cells from the effects of aging, CoQ10 has been used in medicine practices for decades, especially in the case of treating heart problems. One of the most common and thoroughly researched uses of CoQ10 is helping protect the heart and blood vessels from the damaging effects of oxidative stress (also called free radicals). Many people who practice homeopathy in Springfield Missouri turn to CoQ10 supplements to help manage health conditions, including heart arrhythmia, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis and congestive heart failure. Research shows that patients with other inflammatory health conditions, such as breast cancer, diabetes, viruses and infertility, may also find these supplements helpful for both prevention of complications and treatment of symptoms. The name may not sound very natural, but CoQ10 is in fact an essential nutrient that works like an antioxidant in the body. In its active form, it's called ubiquinone or ubiquinol. It's synthesized within the body naturally and used for important functions, such as supplying cells with energy, transporting electrons and regulating blood pressure. The reason it's not considered to be a \"vitamin\" is because all animals, including humans, can make small amounts of coenzymes on their own even without the help of food. CoQ10 is one of Kare Health & Wellness' [ favorite supplements](https://integrativehealthcarespringfieldmo.com/pharmaceutical-grade-supplements-nutritional-supplements-springfield-mo/) due to all of it's amazing benefits. Sustains Natural Energy CoQ10 plays a role in \" [mitochondrial ATP synthesis](https://www.britannica.com/science/metabolism/ATP-synthesis-in-mitochondria),\" which is the conversion of raw energy from foods (carbohydrates and fats) into the form of energy that our cells use called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This conversion process requires the presence of coenzyme Q in the inner mitochondrial membrane. One of its roles is to accept electrons during fatty acid and glucose metabolism and then transfer them to electron acceptors. The process of making ATP has many benefits, from preserving muscle mass to helping regulate appetite and body weight. Reduces Free Radical Damage Oxidative damage (or free radical damage) of cell structures plays an important role in the functional declines that accompany aging and cause disease. As a fat-soluble antioxidant, CoQ10 has been found to inhibit lipid peroxidation, which occurs when cell membranes and low-density lipoproteins are exposed to oxidizing conditions that enter from outside the body. In fact, when LDL is oxidized, CoQ10 is one of the first antioxidants consumed to help offset the effects. Within mitochondria, coenzyme Q10 has been found to protect membrane proteins and DNA from the oxidative damage that accompanies lipid peroxidation and neutralize free radicals directly that contribute to nearly all age-related diseases (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc.). Can Improve Heart Health and Offset Effects of Statin Drugs Although experts feel that additional well-controlled clinical trials are still needed to prove its effects, CoQ10 has strong potential for prevention and treatment of heart ailments by improving cellular bioenergetics, acting as an antioxidant and boosting free radical-scavenging abilities. A 2015 report published in Frontiers in Bioscience referenced earlier stated that \"CoQ10 deficiencies are due to recessive mutations, mitochondrial diseases, aging-related oxidative stress and carcinogenesis processes, and a secondary effect of statin treatment.\" What we do know is that CoQ10 supplementation seems to be useful for those taking statins, since it lowers side effects that they often cause. Statins are used to reduce an enzyme in the liver that not only decreases the production of cholesterol, but also further lowers the natural production of CoQ10. It's now widely accepted that CoQ10 can interact with lipid lowering medications that inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase, a critical enzyme in both cholesterol and coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis. A supplement of CoQ10 is therefore essential to restore natural levels to their optimum and counter the effects of statin drugs. "}
