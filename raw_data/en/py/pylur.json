According to Riat, the latest epidemiological bulletin, updated by August, which gives information about what is happening in medical regions, in the province and in the country, is that \"influenza-type diseases such as influenza, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, tracheobronchitis and All upper respiratory symptoms are grouped under ETIs, which are flu-like illnesses, most of which can be prevented with the flu vaccine.\" Regarding the flu vaccine, he stressed that \"it does not prevent the disease in 100% of cases, but the symptoms that occur do not require hospitalization and patients cope with them at home.\" Referring to the number of cases, Riat explained that according to the epidemiological bulletin, \"between 2014 and 2017, there were many more cases of the three types of respiratory infections\", but \"they dropped to less than 30,000 cases per country during the pandemic because they were from - for covid. As a result of the covid pandemic, 128,000 cases of ILI were reported nationwide last year, and \"as of the same date this year, we reported 120,000 cases\", which means that there has been a decrease in the incidence of influenza or influenza-like illnesses. \u00bb However, he noted that \"the highest peak was in the first two weeks of 2023 with a highly visible outbreak of these influenza-type diseases,\" so the influenza vaccination campaign began early and vaccination schedules were strengthened and completed. pneumococcal (preventing pneumonia), which resulted in \"a decrease in all these diseases of this type of influenza until May, June and the first week of July, where there was a new rise to an emergency level, but without outbreaks.\" This increase, which did not cause an outbreak, \"was seen in all outpatient and hospital consultations,\" adding that the number of cases \"has already fallen to expected levels compared to other years.\" On the contrary, the opposite happened with respect to pneumonia. At the start of the year, pneumonia was virtually non-existent, and in late April, the incidence began to rise, with an outbreak occurring in mid-May, \"and then began to decline until it now reached the level expected for this time of year.\" With regard to samples from hospitalized patients that were sent for etiology to determine the cause, it was confirmed that for bacterial causes caused by pneumococcus, \"the pneumococcal vaccination schedule was not completed,\" he said. On the other hand, influenza cases sent for investigation to the virology of the Rossi hospital in La Plata were found to be caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults. As for bronchiolitis, which \"affects predominantly in children, with the most severe symptoms observed in children under two years of age. Of all those we sent for study, 90% of the cases were respiratory syncytial virus, for which there is no approved vaccine yet, although it has been studied for about a year, so we hope that it will come out soon and, obviously, will appear. must be included in the immunization calendar as mortality from bronchiolitis in young children is high.\" In summary, \"From 2014 to now, this year alone, we are leveling off the percentages of respiratory symptoms that existed before the pandemic,\" the doctor said. Regarding covid protocols, he said that although \"they don't take a swab anymore, when severe respiratory symptoms come in, they always do a quick test to rule out covid, and so far there have been no hospitalizations for this virus, at least in the last month\". Preventive Habits In addition to recognizing the importance of vaccination, Dr. Riat stated that \"ideally, we would continue to adhere to some of the habits that we have acquired during the pandemic, which are the first barrier to prevention, which depends solely and exclusively on our personal responsibility, such as hand hygiene, indoor ventilation, avoiding self-medication without consulting a doctor, and avoiding going to crowded places if you have respiratory symptoms.\" Vaccination Regarding vaccination, he noted that \"there is a very important awareness in our country. In general, as in more developed countries, there are not many anti-vaccine groups here,\" and \"we have a full vaccination schedule.\" Riat recalled that the Vaccination Center is no longer located in the hospital, but is located on San Martin Street, next to the social development offices, and emphasized that \"people have learned to use CAPS because it is close to their home\", and noted that \"None, even in urban centers, is there a shortage of a vaccine. From the vaccination center, we are sending applications from vaccinators, whom I thank for the work done and for taking the time to teach.\" general practitioners Dr. Silvina Riat is a general practitioner and, in her words, \"the priority of a family doctor or a general practitioner is training in primary health care, health promotion and prevention skills, in addition to the fact that he subsequently goes through different areas in turn.\" \"General practitioners are ready to work in CAPS to identify and treat everyday pathologies that can be treated at home, as well as to know the population that surrounds this medical center,\" he said. \"When we talk about well-being or health, I always emphasize that once a year you need to go to the doctor while you are healthy, because this is the time for examinations, interrogations. \"Be healthy once a year. One for being healthy. You need to go to the doctor because the time has come to carry out control measures, that is, an interrogation, a medical examination and, if necessary, some additional research in order to prevent any pathology that is about to develop,\" Riat emphasized. controls In regards to established medical checkups, he noted that \"there is also a schedule and mothers know that babies should have checkups 15 days after birth; after that - once a month until the first year of life. With age, examinations become more scattered, and as adults, including adolescents, they need to be examined every year, always talking about healthy people. "}
