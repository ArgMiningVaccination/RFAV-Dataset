The Mind/Body Connection & Emotional Freedom Technique The mind and body are intimately linked. Everything that happens in the body affects the mind and vise versa. And this is true all the way down to our genes. Picture this: every one of our genes is like a slider switch on a sound board at a music festival. The sliders are constantly in flux, not fixed. Each is constantly adjusting itself depending on what is going on at that moment, physically, mentally, emotionally, and environmentally. A recent case of mine beautifully illustrates this truth with a client who had had her first vaccination for COVID-19. She developed painful stiffness in her neck, pain in the back of her head, pressure in both under-jaw lymph nodes, and painful swallowing. This had been going on for over a week. It is not uncommon for people to experience some uncomfortable post-jab symptoms. In almost every case, these symptoms are temporary and not too severe. In this particular case, her symptoms were reported as quite painful, and they had not subsided after more than a week. Due to her previous history of childhood health issues, the symptoms were evoking a great deal of \"what-if\" type fear. When she came to me as her therapist, her primary issue of concern was a debilitating dread that these symptoms were coming from a blood clot. Intellectually she knew she was likely not in danger, but the deep fear remained. We began with the usual setup shown on my website video, to prepare her for this work. She reported that her fear was at a 7/10. We then began our EFT Tapping, while saying \"part of me is really afraid that my painful, stiff neck, and the pain up the back of my head might be a blood clot.\" We did two long rounds of that and a short round of Eden energy medicine Tapping. At this point, to her amazement, her neck and head pain had disappeared. This took less than 10 minutes. The secondary issue she was reporting was a feeling of pressure in the lymph nodes under her jaws and pain with swallowing. This was creating a 6/10 fear about what might be happening, because her friends hadn't experienced that. She was the only one feeling this particular symptom out of her group of friends. We began the Tapping again and set this up with \"even though I have this fear of what's happening with my lymph nodes, because my friends haven't experienced that, I'm going to accept myself anyway.\" After two rounds of Tapping, her fear was 0/10. Now, not only was the pain in her neck and up the back of her head gone, but the pressure in her right lymph node had also dissipated and that in her left was down to 4/10. By Tapping on \"this remaining pressure in her left lymph node\", it too went to 0/10. No pressure on either side. No pain on swallowing. She got a drink to test this further and after repeated swallows, managed to identify a very slight remaining pressure on the left side only, with no further pain from swallowing. We'd progressed through the appointment quickly at this point and finished with a reminder to her subconscious mind that \"there is no fight here. We are just collaborating.\" We used the setup: \"Even though I'm not yet finished with these old \"health worry\" programs I've held on to for so long, I'm going to accept myself. Including these parts of me that were trying to keep me safe the best way they thought they knew how with the information they had at the time when I was young.\" Once that setup was completed, we carried on going back and forth. \"I'm not yet finished, but I really changed these numbers. But that is crazy right. How is that possible? But things really did change. I'm not yet finished with these old health fear programs but I'm feeling father along than I thought possible.\" When finished, she felt relaxed in the moment because she'd reminded her subconscious \"there's no fight here. We're just figuring out the rest of the story. Did we need that pressure? Did we need that pain?\" Should she have any parts of this return, it would not mean what she had done had not held. They would just be different aspects and she could use the same process we'd just employed on those aspects as well. This was a lovely example of how mind/body connections can hurt or heal. it is reassuring to know that we have that much authority over what happens in our own bodies. We are not helpless passengers in this machine that keeps breaking down. I wish you all joy in this life that we get choose how we live.
