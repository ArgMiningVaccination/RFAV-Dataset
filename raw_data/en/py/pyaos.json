We all know that poor lifestyle choices over time can set the stage for serious health challenges. What if you could learn simple, sustainable lifestyle solutions to prevent disease and/or help you get back into the drivers seat of your health? Our health care system has been on the verge of collapse! Many of our health care workers are burnt out, exhausted and working long hours! Confidence in our health system is at an all-time low. Even though we are in the midst of a global health crisis, we are also in the midst of a self-care, wellness revolution! Many are realising the importance of taking personal responsibility for their health. Subsequently they are becoming more motivated to change their diet/lifestyle and seek natural health solutions. According to Dr Mark Hyman MD, President of the Institute for Functional Medicine \"We now know that diet, lifestyle, and behaviour account for at least 85 percent of the risk of chronic disease, and 90 percent of what determines our lifespan. \" So the choices we make on a daily basis about what we eat and how we live\u2014rather than our genes\u2014are what have the biggest impact on our health and well-being. Personal responsibility isn't a choice any more....it's a necessity! Health is a lifestyle process. It is based in wellness care, instead of just illness treatment. Rather than live in fear of disease and not having access to 'healthcare' why not focus your energy to preparing your body's defences. Every good choice you make with your diet and lifestyle right now is not only taking a step towards taking personal responsibility for your future health. The best news is that natural remedies work! Often better than prescription drugs for many health conditions. This workshop will be choc-a-bloc full of hints and tips to boost your immune, increase your vitality, balance your hormones, address skin conditions and manage stress using a natural health care \"do no harm\" approach. Also, includes the latest research on some of the underlying causes of auto-immune, digestive issues, infertility, depression, asthma, eczema, allergies...and so much more! Join us for this life-changing afternoon of wellness. Includes a demo: How to make FIRE TONIC - a powerful traditional herbal remedy used to support immunity. There will be plenty of time for questions....even 1:1 time with the presenters. You won't want to miss this one off workshop!

FEEDBACK FROM LIVE CLEAN COLLECTIVE EVENTS I came away feeling empowered to make positive changes to create a much healthier lifestyle for me and my family. Cherie (May 2010) I would really like to thank you for arranging to have such a knowledgeable person come and share their wealth of information with us all. This presentation has truly changed my life and for that I will be eternally grateful. Danielle (August 2010) You presented your talk earlier this year at our kindergarten and it was agreed by all who attended that it was the best discussion that we have had at the kindergarten. Personally after listening to you, I changed a number of my purchasing and eating habits and am now much happier, healthier and 15 kilos lighter thanks to those amazing green smoothies for breakfast instead of my normal cereal! Steve, Kindergarten Director (December 2011) Today my twins turn one, and I just wanted to say a big thank you to you Louise, for all of your support, advice and wisdom over the last 18 months. You have made such a big difference in our lives and for our whole family's health. What a blessing to have found you when we did. Amanda (February 2012) I wish to thank you most sincerely for speaking today at the LGMA Women's Network. You are an inspiration to all. They call footballers legends - I don't think they know what a legendary person is. You are a legend and you rock! I have had feedback from some attendees today who have not realised that what they sell in the shops is making the human race sick. Because it is in the shops it must be good they say. Thank you so so much. I will always keep you in mind should someone need assistance with their health or to speak in relation to health. Yvonne Dalwood, Exec Assistant to the Mayor, City of Charles Sturt (June 2012) Louise gave a talk for my group 'The Goddess Within'.' We had around 40 women there and most of the night all I could hear was \"oh\" and \"no!\" She was incredibly clear, concise, filled with amazing information and facts that every person on this planet needs to know about. If we are ever going to change what is happening with our children's health, and ours we HAVE to start listening and who better to listen to than Louise Macartney. Diane McCann, Director, Beyond the Ordinary (July 2012) Ms. Louise Macartney was the guest speaker at a General Meeting of the Natural Health Society (S.A) Tuesday 5th February 2013. Louise spoke to the Society on the topic: 21st Century Health Issues - Addressing the Cause, not the Symptoms. She gave a well structured, engaging and information packed presentation which brought together aspects of nutrition and toxicity, a range of interesting and disturbing statistics relating to health, the importance of eating seasonal food, and key facts about our Gastro Intestinal Tract. The address concluded with a number of useful tips for attaining and maintaining good health, and it provoked a wide range of questions from an enthusiastic audience. It was a pleasure to have such an interesting and inspiring speaker at the Society's meeting. Mark Heard, President Natural Health Society, S.A. Inc. (February 2013) Louise you have done it again. Your A-Z of Child Health Seminar today was amazing. I have picked up so many more things from hearing you again today - and this time a focus on other people's issues they are having with their children. I hope to pass on what I have learned from you and for it to also be a constant reminder to me of why I am making these changes in the lives of my family. Thank you so much I wish every mother and father could hear this presentation. It is truly life altering. Joanne B (March 2013) I would just like to say thank you for coming over to Kangaroo Island. You were very inspiring and have really motivated me to get healthy. I actually felt like i have gotten more answers from you then all the specialist i have been to in the past 6 years. I have slowly started cutting out sugar, dairy and gluten and have actually noticed a difference already with my energy levels. Annemarie (August 2014) I was totally blown away after our \"one on one\" session and your presentation at the Parndana Hotel. Inspiring to say the least. You touched and elaborated on a few things that I knew a little about, then introduced a whole new world to me. Ness (August 2014) Louise Macartney was an energetic speaker who conveyed her message well to our Bowen Therapists. We have had some great feedback on her presentation and she gave members information that they could take straight back to their clinics and use the next day with clients. Her relaxed nature and delivery of information resulted in an easy to follow demonstration of some of the pitfalls of a modern lifestyle. I would highly recommend her presentation to any group interested in health and wellbeing. Deb Hart BTFA CPE Coordinator (July 2014) I started my health journey 3 years ago, I had suffered with so many different symptoms over the years. One day a Mum from school gave me a flier to a seminar on the connection between the gut and the brain. WOW WOW WOW! I spoke with Louise after - I think I was pale and shaky lol, because literally all my questions had been answered! To cut a long story short I changed my diet, and slowly created a 'clean' home. Over the next 3-6 months ALL my symptoms went away, I lost 20kg, I feel great, my kids feel great, my husband feels great. 3 years later and we haven't looked back. Kara (May 2015) I have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (and there has been talk of Fibromyalgia) for over 20 years and until I heard Louise speak a couple of years ago I believed that until they found a cure I would have it for the rest of my life and all I could do is manage symptoms and be as healthy as I could be. What I didn't know until 2 years ago was that I had to power to change my own health. It was in my hands, all I had to do was to give it the right conditions. I now consider myself to be almost recovered from CFS and yesterday chose not to declare it as a disability on an employment form (as it is no longer that for me) - and truly believe that I will achieve 100% recovery. Tracy (June 2016) Louise's presentation at our February Bowen Therapy CPE Training Day provided a solid evidence base as to why all of us need to take personal responsibility for addressing the underlying causes of our dis-ease. Sharing her personal journey about 'creating a better way' to being healthy, Louise's presentation was based on research and current thinking from contemporary science on causes of disease (including epigenetics and the gut health connection). More importantly, the presentation offered valuable insights into harm causing agents and ways we can restore or maintain our body's natural balance when this has been challenged by factors now so common in our modern lives - inflammation, stress, poor diets, toxins, lack of sleep, nutrient deficiencies, trauma, lack of exercise. As a nutrition health coach Louise provides inspiring and motivational background information that is coupled with practical enabling strategies aimed at influencing her audience to both think differently about the causes of disease and then take responsibility for action to 'get to a place of balance' with their own health.' Presentation at Bowen Therapist's Federation of Australia SA CPE Training Day, Barbara Beacham Bowen Therapist (February 2018) I thoroughly enjoyed this talk, Louise has such a passion for health & has done so much of her own research so her talk is very evidence-based. I would highly recommend! Kay Davin, Nutrition and Lifestyle Coach, Ireland (April 2018) Louise you are the reason I'm still breast feeding my little man today, your support and encouragement got me through a very stressful time, you then continued to help us on our health journey. You are always such a strong and positive influence. Recommended highly by my Sister in law, I am thankful I made that call that day, my life changed for the better. Emma (September 2018) Some of the best advice given to me was by Health Coach Louise Macartney - an amazing one at that! I had a health coaching session with her all the way from Australia via Skype. I took her advice and the difference I've noticed has been astounding! I now understand that it was the process of eating a high plant based, organic, phytonutrient rich diet that gave my body what it needed to heal itself! Suzanne D'Arcy, Health Coach , Ireland (Jan 2019) Louise Macartney is a wealth of knowledge and brings this knowledge into a compelling & engaging story on stage. With a deep understanding of human nutrition and wellbeing, Louise outlines the obstacles currently preventing many people from attaining it but also provides the comprehensive solutions we can all use to achieve great health. Kale Brock, Journalist, The Gut Summit, The Gut Movie (Feb 2019) Thank YOU for the other night. You are an amazing presenter and you had us all riveted. Considering it was a lengthy presentation that was no easy task. Your passion shows through and you also look amazing which is obviously a reflection of your lifestyle. I am in awe of you passion and enthusiasm. Really looking forward to catching up. Bronagh (Aug 2019) Your Gut Health seminar last week blew my mind. A lot of it I had semi heard of before but never really thought about it deeply. You gave so much valuable information, I have been raving about it ever since! Shani (Sept 2019) I want to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for the assistance you gave me about a year ago when I first attended your 'No More Misery Guts' session and then had some one on one health coaching from you. The information you gave in your sessions has had a profound impact on me in the last twelve months. I was really struggling and you gave me some really practical strategies to put into practice. Also working alongside an Integrative doctor I recently managed to get off steroids with no return of Rheumatoid symptoms. Mel (Jan 2020) One of the best health seminars I've ever attended. Going to rally up all of my mid-20's mates to come along to see one too. Gemma (Feb 2020) Louise is amazing and her advice is priceless! Over the years I've gained so much knowledge from her and improved my health immensely so if you are in need of advice on health issues and seek a holistic approach you can contact Louise .
