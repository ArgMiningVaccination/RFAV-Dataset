Breger Stanton, MA, OTR/L, CHT, FAOTA Picture yourself walking over hot coals barefoot and considerthis: anyone walking over hotcoals without getting burnedmanifests the power of the mindover the body. Ordinary individ- uals are able to use the power of positive thinking to allow his orher feet not to be burned. Now,consider the patient who comesto you for hand therapy to treatthe wrists she slashed in a suicideattempt. She is depressed, has aflat affect, and sits at the treat- ment table holding out her wrists for treatment as if they are sepa-rate part of her, not connected toher body. Little talk goes on be-tween therapist and patient, andonly if initiated by the therapist.Later on, several months later,this same patient stops by your clinic smiling to tell you ''thank you.'' In another scenario, a therapist is so concerned about followingthe exact protocol for a tendonrepair that he or she may not havelistened to the patient express an issue of concern that might affecthow the protocol is carried out forthat patient. LOOKING BACK TO MOVE FORWARD I was a therapist at the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center, Louisiana for some years, work- ing with the Hansen's Disease,aka Leprosy, patients. My case-load included patients who oftencould not feel their hands due toinsensibility typical of ulnar, me-dian, and radial neuropathiesthat they can develop as a result of the disease. We were forced to consider the effect of the treat-ment both positive and negativethat we were providing, evenmore so, because of this lack ofimportant sensory feedback.More importantly, I was interact- ing with a group of patients whowere essentially discarded and/or ostracized by their families,friends, and the government, tobe forced to live away from the homes they knew, beyond their control. They had a disease thatwas disfiguring and caused fearamong others who might seethem, creating the potential ofhaving lived for years with fee-lings of loss of self-worth, andpotentially, self-respect. Getting to know my patients, who had been at Carville for many years,and had learned to live withintheir own social culture, was ahuge lesson for me in acceptingthe person, the mind, and thebody. A patient with whom I worked at Carville had been in and out of the hospital for treatment asneeded. This person was morefortunate because he was able towork and live outside of Carvillefor years. When he retired hemoved back to live at Carville,and he came to see us for surgical reconstruction of his hands to correct the deformities createdas a result of median and ulnarnerve palsy. He never had time tohave the surgery before, but henow wanted to be able to pursuehis occupation of golf, and to beable to grip his golf clubs. Over a Donna E.

But thereal story is that by the end of hissurgical and rehabilitation care,he was so happy that he not onlycould grip his golf clubs, he wasnow also able to cup his hands to hold water and bring the water to his mouth, something he hadbeen unable to do for years. Healso became my friend because Itreated him with respect as onehuman being to another. Another example I will share is of an Asian woman who came to Carville to undergo opponens- plasty and intrinsic transfer sur-gery followed by therapy. We sawher in hand clinic to discuss herprogress. Despite the pride thehand team felt with the results ofthe surgery and therapy, she wasnot that happy with her hands. It turns out we forgotten to find out something very important abouther functional needs, an impor-tant occupation for her was tofeed herself using chopsticks. As one of the faculty with the occupational therapy program atSamuel Merritt College, we teach with the underlying program theme of the mind ebody model, concurrent with a strong sciencebase emphasizing the medicalmodel. We believe we are sendingout new therapists who are ableto integrate the thinking that goeswith the medical model approach combined with a holistic view. All of these examples of my experiences have brought me torecognize the true impact that weas therapists have on affecting themind and body of our patients aswe apply the science of handtherapy. I speak on this topic today because, in fact, I have heard what sounds like accusa-tions, that hand therapists arepurely mechanistic, and only con-cerned with impairment; thathand therapists do not take thewhole person into account interms of individual clients'occupations and occupational performance. I contend that we are equally concerned about the mindebody in an holistic sense while treating the medical prob-lem, and that to achieve the max-imum treatment benefit requiresus to do so. Hand therapists are ina great position to be able tocombine these important ap- proaches in therapy, to combine the medical model with the ho-listic, mind ebody approach in our usual treatment. Today, I will spend some time to provide a brief review of the his-tory of Eastern medicine, ofWestern medicine and discuss the science of hand therapy. I will discuss how these two para-digms of organistic and mecha-nistic medicine can and shouldcoexist together as we continueto offer our patients the best treat-ment we can provide with thewhole person in mind. Although, there are times it may seem diffi- cult in a busy clinic, and/or wemay have limited evidence to sup-port some of the issues suggestedfrom a mind ebody frame of ref- erence, I hope to show how we, aspractitioners can be more like agardener helping plants grow in- stead of a mechanic fixing ma- chines as suggested by LeShan. 1 MIND AND BODY What Is Mind eBody Theory? It is not new for us to consider the whole person in our treat-ment. 2e7Hand therapy as de- fined by the Hand Therapy Certification Commission, 2002, is ''the art and science of rehabili-tation of the upper quarter of thehuman body'' (p. 49 in Ref. 8). It is a ''merging of occupationaltherapy and physical therapy the-ory and practice that combinescomprehensive knowledge of the upper quarter, body function, and activity'' (p. 49 in Ref. 8). I in- terpret this to mean that handtherapy not only is about the sci- ence of hand therapy, but also emphasizes the importance of the whole person as part of ourtreatment approach. Mind ebody is often related to engaging themind to affect the body throughattitudes about one's health.Those of us in occupational ther-apy are well acquainted with this concept as are physical thera- pists as evidenced by the logo onthe APTA Web site. We all knowthat if the individual has a posi-tive attitude with healthythoughts and great outlook, heor she may have a better opportu-nity to achieve maximum treat- ment benefit compared to the individual who is very negativeabout his or her health situation,has a bleak outlook on life, andas a result, may not heal as easily.We know the importance of treat-ing our patients as wholepersons. Eastern Medicine\u2014 Historical Review Mindebody theory began with Eastern medicine three to five thousand years BC includingAyurvedic medicine of India,Chinese medicine, and Egyptianmedicine as well as NativeAmerican medicine. The impor-tance of the energy of theMeridians, and Chakras 9,10date back to these times as well as in- corporation of the elements andhumors in diagnosis and treat-ment. 11The elements of earth, air, fire, and water are believedto correspond with tempera-ments. Similarly, humors ofblood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile are considered to cor- respond to characteristic disposi-tions of melancholic, choleric,sanguine, or phlegmatic person-alities, respectively. It was be-lieved then, as it is today, thatgood health requires proper bal-ance of these elements and hu- mors. 11e13Practitioners of acupuncture, and shiatsu, for ex-ample, believe that disruption in 92 JOURNAL OF HAND THERAPYthe balance and flow of energy, or ch'i, or prana can cause illness and could lead to disease. The in- terest in magnetic and energyforces on the body are basic tosome of practices we see todaysuch as Acupuncture, Reiki,Touch, and Shiatsu. Eastern medicine practices have increased in popularity and acceptability in the 20th and 21st centuries. Most the medicalschools in the United States offercourses inclusive of study of com-plementary and alternative med-icine. While the literature is full ofinformation and suggestions ofeffectiveness of these methods that are increasingly incorporated in treatment, there remains con-tinued need for well-designedand implemented research to sup-port their evidence and efficacy.At the same time, the popularityof these methods cannot beignored. Western, Allopathic Medicine\u2014Historical Review Western medicine history seems to parallel the history ofEastern medicine beginning withholistic concepts from severalthousands of years BC. BothHippocrates, as early as 400 e300 BC, and Galen, later on, wereproponents of the humoral theo- ries of Eastern medicine and used humoral theory to explain mostthings about a person's character,psychology, medical history,tastes, appearance, and behav-ior. 11e13Hippocrates believed in healing methods that incorpo-rated a mind ebody kind of med- icine concerned with imbalance in the body that leads to illnessor disease. Hippocratic writingsemerged from 460 to 370 BC thatcontained concerns for rationalmedicine using systematic rea-soning and for for medical practi- tioners. Hippocrates is consid- doctor to haveengaged in this ''new'' thinkingin which a connection was made between disease and the exis- tence of germs. 13In the second century AD, medical sciencecredited Galen with his insightsregarding muscular action andits affect on voluntarymovement. 14 During the Middle Ages era (from about the 5th to the 15th centuries), medicine was prac- ticed at home with practitionersincluding midwives, bone-set-ters, and those who were knowl-edgeable in herbs and herbalremedies. Hospitals as medicalinstitutions were nonexistent un-til about the 6th and 7th centuries, and, then they were more a part of the church with no formalizedstudies. It was not until the 12thand 13th centuries that we sawthe development of medicaluniversities. 12 Accurate anatomical knowl- edge through human dissection became a regular part of medical instruction in the 13th and 14thcenturies. 13Leonardo da Vinci, among his multiple creative tal-ents, was also an anatomist inthe 15th century; he dissectedcorpses in his pursuit of becom-ing a master of topographic anat- omy which added to his abilities in his art. Andreas Vesalius inthe 16th century, set the standardfor anatomical illustration, andgave us some incredible workthrough the prolific and detaileddrawings based on his work dis-secting human anatomy. 12,15 With the Scientific Revolution of the 1700s came a big change in thescience of medicine, as we know ittoday. The ''new scientists'' of the17th century began to theorize thatthe mind and the body are sepa-rate. Descartes, a philosopher andscientist, is credited with the con- cepts of Dualism and Cartesian philosophy, 12,13which says that the body was materialand not con-nected to the mind. 16Being influ- enced by Sir Isaac Newton'smechanistic view of physics, he es-sentially moved medicine to amore mechanical, reductionisticview of the body to be understood as a machine, or like a clock (p. 89 in Ref. 11). He is also credited with the growth of ideas sup-ported by scientific investiga-tion. 14Interestingly, Descartes taught that there is ''no fundamen-tal difference between the mindsof men and the minds of women:a mind is just a mind'' and the hall- mark is to be rational (p. 157 in Ref.11). Medical knowledge grew with new knowledge of the nervousstimulus and the understandingthat nerves caused pleasure orcould cause pain (p. 236 inRef. 12). In the 18th century, Galvani found the excitability of the nerves and demonstratedthat electrical forces were associ-ated with contraction of a frog'sleg muscle. 14Soon other known scientists such as Bell andSherrington added to our knowl-edge about the interaction of sen- sory and motor nerves at the level of the spinal cord. 14A significant discovery was made when germscausing anthrax were identifiedand from this event it was theo-rized that for every disease therewas a specific cause. 16This was a breakthrough that brought us into the 20th century with contin- ued medical advancements, toonumerous for this discussionnow. Where are We Now? A Summaryof What We Learned As we have learned, the an- cient medicine practices ofEastern medicine are thousands of years old, but so too, is Western medicine, though not as we knowit today. Until about 300 yearsago, medicine was based on theorganistic theory with emphasison the mind, body, and spirit. Thereductionists arrived and devel-oped medicine as a revolutionary concept incorporating knowl- edge of physics, astronomy, andanatomy to allow more intense January eMarch 2008 93study of the human body, to learn causes of disease, and to find cures for many of them bringing us forward into the 21st century.At the same time, over the pastapproximately 30 years, Easternmedicine has had a resurgence ofpopularity based on practicesdating as far back as 5000 yearsago. I present this very brief his- tory not only because it so inter- esting, but also because it isimportant to understand howfar we have come in a relativelyshort time. We are in a positionnow to incorporate our knowl-edge from these dichotomousparadigms. Psychoneuroimmunology\u2014 Is This the Bridge? A relatively new field of sci- ence became known in the 1980sthat recognizes the role played bythe mind over the body, psycho-neuroimmunology. It is the studyof how our mind can affect ourimmune system and how it helps us to resist illness 12and of how the brain affects the body's im-mune cells and how, this in turn,affects behavior linking themind, brain, and the immune sys-tem. 16Immunologists, such as Candace Pert, found that thebrain was essentially ''talking to the cells of the immune system about emotions'' 16and through the neuropeptides and neuro-transmitters allow us to experi-ence emotions, thoughts, anddrives (p. 130 in Ref. 17). Conscious control can affect phys-iological processes such as that which we experience when incor- porating use of biofeedback, ormeditation in our treatment.How we think and how we feelcan have powerful effects on thebiological functions of our bod-ies. 16,18Think about how you feel when you are anticipating an anxiety-provoking event such as I have been feeling as I pre-pared to give this speech!Why Is This All Important? We can and do treat within the medical model while applyingmindebody theory. These two models, one that is based on mechanistic theory and the one that is based on organistic ap-proach can coexist. One cannotseparate the functionality of thehand from the interdependenceof the brain, the mind from thebody. 14This understanding is what makes us professionals rather than technicians. Do not let others outside of our handtherapy profession try to put atag on us as solely mechanics oftherapy (or doers of protocols). We see patients come to our clinical practices who become de-pressed because of an injury that has become so disabling, or may be upset with the events that leadto the injury. We pay attention tohow the client is addressing his orher own problem or disability aswe try to help guide him or hertoward a return to full functionand occupational performance, addressing the whole person. Business of Therapy and Ambivalence of Combining Mind eBody and Science We know there is ambivalence between the phenomenologicalholistic aspects of practice andthe biomedical mechanistic ap-proach. I am suggesting that ther-apists can operate simultaneouslyfrom both holistic and reduction- istic paradigms. We learned from Hippocrates of his concern for theinterdependence of mind, body,and spirit. 19At the same time, we are challenged with the realities oftime, financial constraints, pres-sures for increased productivityto maintain clinic income, and the dominance of reductionistic biomedical paradigms. We havethe realities to deal with relatedto every day practice and it mayseem easier to shift into automaticdrive of a more mechanisticpractice. Work pressures for see- ing greater numbers of patients per day affect how therapists may be able to incorporate the in-dividuals' needs. With the in-creased focus on insurancereimbursement and increasednumbers of treatments to have afiscally feasible clinic, it is difficultto focus on true individualized care that we prefer to provide. How much therapists are reduc-tionistic or holistic tends to bemore of a strategic choice in thecontext of the biomedical set-ting. 19Yet, we can and must incor- porate our holistic mind ebody paradigm along with focus on im- pairments and disability at the same time. Think about your pa-tient who comes in every daywith his or her every day pres-sures of life added to concernsfor whether his or her handreally is getting better! SCIENCE Science of Hand Therapy Science can be defined either from a theoretical or experimental frame of reference, but it is essen- tially based on ''unprejudiced freeinquiry'' (L. Bodell, personal com-munication, July 2007). The na-ture of science has manymeanings and has evolved overtime. For the purpose of this dis-cussion, I accepted the view that science is a disciplined methodol- ogy and is associated with a par-ticular set of procedures that areusually experimental to explore,confirm or refute theories of be-havior, often applied to any pro-cedure or belief that has rigor,precision, and is objective. 14 As MacDermid discussed in her Nathalie Barr Lecture, 200520: The success of hand therapyhinges on the three core founda-tions of transdisciplinary knowl-edge sharing and collaboration;evidence-based decision making;and patient centeredness. From this model, the mind ebody and 94 JOURNAL OF HAND THERAPYclient-centered approach are part of the core functions along with the science of hand therapy. They complement each other. The roleof the hand therapist assessinghand function using measure-ments that can be easily comparedbetween one treatment and thenext is essential to provide objec-tive data and to identify func- tional abilities, limitations, and activities for an intervention planthat is meaningful and client-cen-tered. But of importance is thevalue of client-centered therapyinvolving the unity of body andmind with the aim to view andtreat clients with consideration of the emotional, cognitive, social, and physical concerns. 19,21This is consistent with looking at the totalperson holistically. We must seeand accept our patients from theirworld and values, with a phe-nomenological perspective, tolearn about their occupations to help each client succeed and reach his or her goals. The late Dr. Paul Brand was an inspiration of my practice. Dr.Brand was a missionary as wellas a hand surgeon, well known inboth arenas. He was an advocatefor the importance of objective measurement; yet, he never lost sight of viewing the whole per-son, at the same time. The mindand the person's attitude andhow these factors contribute andaffect the client were consideredin the treatment. 2Brand believed that ''the idea of including more mind body into your treatment is not a retreat from objectivityin measurement as there is no bet-ter way to know whether the besttreatment is being used'' (p. 145in Ref. 2). He wrote that, ''we must resist our tendency to rejectconsideration of things we cannot quantify''(p. 145 in Ref. 2). To the younger therapists in this audi-ence, I urge you to find his writ-ings, his teachings; study andlearn from them. The science of hand therapy may stem from a reductionisticperspective; and we must adhereto the science of hand therapy, and find the evidence. But we also must adhere to the art of hand therapy that allows us toconsider the mind and body, andoccupations of our patients. I pro-pose it is not a conflict to makethat bridge between the two par-adigms. The importance of com-plex reasoning includes the more subjective experiences that must be acknowledged and that thereis more than just the impairmentmeasures being taken. For exam-ple, in his work with musicians,we learn from neurologist FrankWilson, 16about the emotional concerns of such individuals as musicians, sculptors, artists, woodcarvers, jewelers, and sur-geons when they have a hand in-jury. He wrote of the passion suchindividuals have and how anyphysical change in the workingof the hand can affect such per-sons physically and emotionally if they develop a disabling hand condition such as musician's dys-tonia, or other repetitive straininjuries. From Lundborg, 22we learn that the hand may be re-garded as an extension of thebrain and, to have well-function-ing hands is considered a prereq- uisite for each individual to be able to participate in life's occu-pations that can be done whenwe treat the whole person. Weknow this to be true just by thework we do every day in ourclinics and it is what keeps usthe therapists that we are. We, hand therapists, are fully in- vested in applying science andthe art of caring as we deal withthe complexities and the sur-prises of the mind that are con-nected to the body that we aretreating, everyday. This informa-tion I share with you today is not new, as I have been reminded through my readings duringpreparation of this talk. It is im-portant for us to be remindedagain and again not to let thebusiness of hand therapyinterfere with our holistic ap-proach to patient care.Finally, Exploring to Find the Evidence! Now I am involved with find- ing the evidence for a method weuse in therapy, which to be hon-est, are quite mechanistic studies,but the evidence is needed. I feellike a detective when I get on thesearch engines to look for neededreferences for a particular topic I am searching. It is really fun to start sleuthing to find the back-ground articles for a topic and Ilearn much more because of theprocess I use to do this. Suchmethods can and need to beused not only for the studies weuse about the typical clinical mea- surement, but also to bring us more expert evidence to supportthe client-centered approach.Any one of us can do this, yet itdoes take time, a commitment tomove past your comfort zone,and you need to be willing totake the time. It might mean working after hours at home\u2014 what a thought! Some of us do itall the time. When I started out asa young occupational therapist Iwould never have consideredspending time outside of worklooking up articles, doing someresearch, and trying to systemat- ically review a topic. I challenge you all to be creative, instillmindebody holistic approach into your treatment, and considerthe mind ebody as you reach for the evidence in the art and sci-ence of hand therapy! In closing, let us not forget hand therapy's own important pioneers such as Nathalie Barr,Maude Malick, Evelyn Mackin,Care Deleeuw, Gloria Devore,Kilulu von Prince, Lois Barber,and all of the previous NathalieBarr Award recipients, as well asso many others who have con- tributed to our field, and to our profession. From the past to thepresent, these and so many othersprovided the base for us as handtherapists to incorporate a client-centered approach as we treat thewhole person, and incorporate January eMarch 2008 95the art and science of hand ther- apy. It is an honor to have re- ceived this prestigious award in such incomparable company andto share my thoughts with you,my esteemed colleagues. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I never believed I would be standing here today with thishighest honor from ASHT; thepath bringing me to this pointbeing far different than I ever imagined. My love and thanks go to my friends and mentorsSue Michlovitz, Joy MacDermid,and Jane Bear-Lehman, who hadthe faith in me to deliver thisspeech today! To my continuedrelationships that have floweredover the years with so many hand therapists, many of whom are here in the audience today. Toyou all, Thank you! REFERENCES 1. LeShan L.
