When people ask us \"What is reiki?\" we explain that it's a gentle, light-touch treatment used to accelerate the body's natural ability to relax, release stress, and heal itself on all levels - physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. Reiki healing is completely non-invasive and safe for everyone, including children. It supports the body, mind, and spirit in returning to its natural state of balance and wellbeing.

Why Choose Us? At Body Positive Works, we create treatments around the individual, listening to your needs and developing sessions that empower and celebrate you. Reiki treatments are no exception; your Reiki Master will create an individualized treatment based entirely on your needs. During each treatment, you will be lying down and fully clothed, but you may choose whether the practitioner touches you (lightly) or not at all. If you feel a sensation that you'd like to discuss, please do ask. It's important that you feel relaxed as that, after all, is the point of Reiki. A Reiki session can be used individually or in conjunction with other modalities, such as meditation and breath-work. Each modality supports a reconnection of body, mind, and spirit. This, in turn, encourages a positive change in perspective about your body and your life, empowering you to not only recognize your strengths and purpose but to live fully in the present moment as well. Used in conjunction with psychotherapy, BoPo Reiki NJ can help to reduce stress and anxiety and further benefit the therapeutic process. You will receive instruction on how to take these practices home with you and use them in your everyday life.
