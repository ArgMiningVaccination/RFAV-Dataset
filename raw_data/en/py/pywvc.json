[Quality sleep](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a40548531/how-to-fix-sleep-schedule/), [optimal hydration](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a46956/how-much-water-should-i-drink/) (with good old H2O) and [a balanced diet](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g4357/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan/) are the ultimate tools for improving energy levels in the long run. But many turn to caffeine and energy drinks for a quick fix. Although these beverages won't provide true sustained energy, they can be a convenient boost when needed. [According to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much), for most people, a moderate intake of 400 mg of caffeine per day (the amount found in about four or five cups of coffee) should be okay. But some energy drinks contain more than that, and many are also laden with food colorings, additives and exorbitant amounts of [added sugar](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a26289268/is-sugar-bad-for-you/). If you're looking for a healthier option, the experts in the [Good Housekeeping Institute](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/about-the-institute/a19748212/good-housekeeping-institute-product-reviews/) Nutrition Lab have compiled a list of some of the better energy drink picks that focus on low added sugar counts and prioritize natural [sources of caffeine](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g40395276/coffee-alternatives/) (as opposed to synthetic caffeine). Our experts say it's important to check the caffeine content on the label so you can avoid more than 200 mg of caffeine per drink (the equivalent of two cups of coffee), especially if you are consuming other caffeinated beverages and foods during the day. You'll find that many options are also fortified with B vitamins, which may provide an additional natural boost. Our top picks: You can read more about how we evaluate energy drinks in our Lab \u2014 including the difference between natural and synthetic caffeine \u2014 at the end of this guide. We also address which populations should avoid energy drinks and caffeine altogether. How we evaluate energy drinks Our registered dietitians evaluated over 30 different types of energy drinks, focusing on added-sugar content, ingredient lists and caffeine sources. We selected top picks with lower added-sugar counts and prioritized options with natural sources of caffeine as opposed to synthetic caffeine. We also kept all picks at or below 200 mg of caffeine. Even though these options are better-for-you alternatives, our pros say to still limit consumption to no more than one can a day. Ultimately, energy drinks provide only a temporary burst of energy. For more sustained effects, our experts recommend prioritizing a balanced diet, adequate hydration and [regular physical activity](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/a40035772/how-to-start-lifting-weights-for-beginners/) to optimize energy levels in the long term. What to look for when shopping for the best energy drinks Energy drinks are fairly inexpensive, so there isn't much of a risk buying one to see if you do in fact enjoy the flavor and consistency. But there are a few factors to consider when purchasing the right one for you and your preferences: Caffeine source and level: You'll want to look to see what the source of caffeine is, whether it is synthetic or natural, and also how much caffeine the drink delivers. Be sure to check serving sizes, too, to make sure you're not getting more than you expect. Flavor options: Many of these energy drinks offer variety packs, so our pros suggest trying those first before committing to one case of a single flavor. Sugar counts: Most importantly, try to cap added-sugar counts at 8 g (the equivalent of 2 tsp of sugar) per can, and do not mix energy drinks with alcohol. If an energy drink is zero-sugar or sugar-free, consider what sugar substitutes the drink is utilizing for sweetness. Some may have an aftertaste or cause digestive issues. Who should avoid energy drinks? Energy drinks are not recommended for children and adolescents and should be avoided by these individuals as per the [CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/energy.htm). Adults with caffeine sensitivity should avoid the consumption of energy drinks as well. Since high doses of caffeine may exacerbate cardiac conditions, individuals with a known history of heart disease should avoid energy drinks. Those who are pregnant and breastfeeding should limit energy drink usage as well. What is the difference between natural and synthetic caffeine? Natural and synthetic versions of caffeine are almost identical, chemically speaking. The natural variety is found in the leaves and seeds of many plants and shows up in coffee, tea and chocolate. Some companies add caffeine sourced from coffee or cacao beans or yerba mate leaves to their products. The synthetic kind is made in a lab or pharmaceutical plant and is often added to beverages like soda and energy drinks to enhance the stimulant effects. There is nothing wrong with either version of caffeine, but typically products with synthetic caffeine contain a lot of other additives and sugar. Why trust Good Housekeeping?
