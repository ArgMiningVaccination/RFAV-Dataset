PB | Healthy Together | Fall 2018 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway | RWJBH.ORG/RAHWAY | 3 Rahway_TOC_Winter20_final.indd 3 12/6/19 2:10 PMPrediction: 2020 will be your year, the one in which you get out of any rut you may be in and create new, healthier habits. Your two key tools: movement and food. Exercise improves cardiovascular health and is a known energy booster. Food is fuel, and the right kinds\u2014foods that are rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals\u2014give the body the energy it requires to repair, heal and stay strong. Nutrition and exercise experts at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Rahway and RWJ Rahway Fitness Wellness Center off er the following tips to kick-start your journey. 1START SMALL. \"Th e people who see the best results are those who take small steps,\" says Alyssa Sutherland, Personal Training Manager at the RWJ Rahway Fitness Wellness Center in Scotch Plains. Sutherland recommends using the acronym SMART: Goals should be Specifi c, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic and Timely. \"It's not enough to say, 'I want to lose weight' or I want to be healthier,''' she says. \"Th ink more along the lines of, 'I want to lose 20 pounds by next January by doing X, Y and Z.'\" 2FIND EXERCISE YOU ENJOY. Walking is the easiest exercise to incorporate, says Sutherland, but if you're more inclined to swim, dance, golf or play tennis, get out there and do it. 3CREATE A SUPPORT SYSTEM.Having an exercise buddy makes it easier to keep going, as does using a personal trainer. Trainers are available for one-on-one and small group training at RWJ Rahway Fitness Wellness Centers in Scotch Plains and Carteret, says Sutherland. The centers also offer small group training for people with diabetes, arthritis, cardiac issues and Parkinson's, as well as for bariatrics patients. 4TRY \"HABIT STACKING,\" a process by which you build a new habit by adding it to an existing habit or action, Sutherland suggests. Add exercise to your calendar, as you would any other appointment. Serve yourself vegetables first when you fill your plate. Clip your car keys to a packed gym bag so you'll have it with you for after-work workouts. 5READ THE LABEL. \"When purchasing packaged foods, look for those that are higher in fiber and lower in sugar and fat,\" advises Christina Frescki, RD, Clinical Dietitian at RWJUH Rahway. High-fiber foods make you feel more satisfied so you eat less. 6CHOOSE THE \"GOOD\" SUGAR.Sugar from an orange is benefi cial sugar from an orange candy or soda, not ENHANCE YOUR PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND HEART HEALTH WITH A FEW SIMPLE CHANGES. 9 WAYS TO HAVE MORE ENERGY THIS YEAR Healthy Together | 4 | Winter 2020 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway | RWJBH.ORG/RAHWAY | 5 Rahway_Energy_Winter2020_final.indd 4 12/6/19 rst fuel,\" Frescki explains. \"Our bodies are made to burn fuel. Naturally occurring sugar, such as those found in fruits, is how our bodies expect to receive sugar. Eat them!\" Processed sugar, on the other hand, tends to hang around in the body and turn to fat. 7GO NUTS. Nuts are a great go-to source of protein and healthy fats, which are vital for cellular turnover, hormone synthesis and bowel health. Frescki says that other good sources are sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and flaxseeds, which can be added to yogurt and oatmeal to pump up their value. 8EMBRACE YOUR ROOTS. Root vegetables such as yams, beets, carrots, turnips, rutabagas and parsnips are easy to find this time of year. \"They're perfect for soups, stews and frittatas,\" Frescki says. \"These kinds of recipes are great places to hide a lot of vegetables or to try a vegetable for the first time.\" 9EAT THE RAINBOW. \"Every color of fruit or vegetable has a different nutrient profile,\" says Frescki. \"The more you mix it up, the more your body says thank you!\" RWJ Rahway Fitness & Wellness Centers offer a host of programs on tness and wellness at two locations. Both facilities also provide physical therapy. To arrange a tour of the Carteret facility at 60 Cooke Avenue, www.rwj tnesscarteret.com, call 732.541.2333.

TYPES OF UI Stress incontinence\u2014which is related to physical, not emotional, stress\u2014occurs when a patient loses urine during lifting, sneezing, coughing or laughing. During these activities, the belly squeezes the bladder and causes leakage. In men, this condition commonly occurs after surgical removal of the prostate gland, which weakens muscles around the urethra (the short tube that carries urine out of the body). In women, it is often caused by pregnancy and one or more vaginal deliveries, which stretch the muscles of the pelvic floor. Urge incontinence involves the sudden, intense need to urinate, followed by involuntary urine loss. (An overactive bladder is urgency, usually experienced Few medical issues still carry the social stigma of urinary incontinence (UI), the uncontrolled leakage of urine. UI is a common condition\u2014up to a third of adults are estimated to suffer from it. However, the exact prevalence isn't known, because so many are reluctant to admit the problem. This silence creates its own issues that may seriously impact patients. \"UI can dramatically affect the patient's quality of life,\" says Mark I. Miller, MD, a urologist with Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Rahway. \"Patients are afraid to go out and socialize, THE 'EMBARRASSING' PROBLEM YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT Healthy Together | 6 | Winter 2020 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway | RWJBH.ORG/RAHWAY | 7 Rahway_UrinaryIncontinence_Winter20_final.indd 6 12/6/19 2:11 PMfrequently, with or without urge incontinence.) Urge incontinence may be caused by an infection or by a condition such as stroke, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injuries. When an individual suff ers from both stress and urge symptoms, he or she is diagnosed with mixed incontinence. Another form of the condition, over ow incontinence, happens when small amounts of urine leak from a bladder that can't be emptied su ciently. Diabetes and spinal injuries can cause this, as can an enlarged prostate blocking the urethra. Functional incontinence occurs in many older people. A person may have normal bladder control, but be unable to get to the toilet fast enough because of arthritis or other conditions that make them unable to move quickly. TOOLS FOR TREATMENT At a basic level, options for managing UI include restricting uids, especially before exercise and sleep, and using products like absorbent pads and adult diapers. Other techniques include: Kegel exercises, which focus on strengthening pelvic oor muscles to address both stress and urge incontinence. A physical therapist who has taken the appropriate courses can help both men and women learn to do these. \"Th e principle here is similar to other muscle-strengthening exercises,\" says Linda Bernot, a physical therapist at RWJ Rahway Fitness & Wellness Center in Carteret. \"You isolate a contraction and perform an increasing number of repetitions over time. We educate patients about how to contract muscles properly and set them up with a home program of daily exercises.\" She also provides biofeedback, in which sensors help increase a patient's awareness of the activity in the pelvic musculature. Medicine: To treat urge incontinence, a variety of oral medications can relax the bladder and allow it to store more urine. Botox injections, which paralyze the bladder muscle, are a favorite method of Dr. Miller's. \"I have a number of urge incontinence patients, mostly women, who had tried multiple medications that failed or produced side eff ects,\" he says. \"But aft er a simple Botox injection performed in the o ce, they fi nally found relief.\" Tibial nerve stimulation, an in- o ce procedure that involves providing temporary electrical impulses to the nerves responsible for bladder and pelvic oor function. Th e electrode is placed near the tibial nerve at the ankle. InterStim, a kind of pacemaker for the bladder that calms down erroneous messages from the bladder to the brain. \"Th e procedure involves the implantation of a quarter-size device under the skin,\" says Dr. Keehn. \"In my practice, this has been eff ective for urge incontinence and lasts around 10 years.\" e urethral sling a surgical procedure for both men and women, involves a mesh placed under the urethra to give it support and compress it in order to prevent leakage. An arti cial urinary sphincter a surgical option for men only, involves a cuff placed around the urethra when a button is pressed, the cuff in ates and squeezes the urethra so no urine can pass. No matter what type of UI a patient suff ers from, he or she should not be too embarrassed to ask for help, Bernot insists. \"One of my patients was an elderly woman who was planning to travel across the country to a wedding and room with her granddaughter. She was afraid she'd be getting up during the night and disturb her, so she tried Kegel exercises. Aft er her treatment, she was able to eliminate her nighttime bathroom trips. Age is no barrier to getting help with incontinence.\" To fi nd a rologist at arteret can help with rinary incontinence. all 732.969.8030.ARYEH KEEHN, MD HOW THE BLADDER WORKS About every 10 to 15 seconds, small amounts of urine travel from the kidneys to the bladder by way of two thin, eight-to-10-inch tubes called ureters. The bladder swells into a round shape when it is full. Circular muscles called sphincters operate like rubber bands to keep urine from leaking into the urethra, the tube that allows urine to pass outside the body. Nerves in the bladder signal that it's full and needs to be emptied. When you go to the bathroom, the brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten, squeezing urine out, and the sphincter muscles to relax, allowing urine to exit the bladder.

Stone, MD, Director of the Cardiac Catheterization and Interventional Lab at Community Medical Center in Toms River and a member of the RWJBarnabas Health medical group. \"In a cardiac arrest, the heart stops completely and no blood at all is circulating.\" Death can be instantaneous. Th e two things that determine survival, Dr. Stone explains, are the underlying pathology and the ow of blood to the brain. \"If someone passes out in front of you, take action immediately,\" he urges. \"Th e patient can't aff ord to lose the time that it may take for professional medical help to arrive.\" \u00fbuick action can double or even triple a cardiac arrest victim's chance for survival.HEART ATTACK WHAT IT IS A circulation problem. Blood ow stops because of a blockage in an artery. Th e part of the heart muscle that is deprived of oxygen-rich blood begins to die. SYMPTOMS Th ese may begin hours, days or weeks in advance. Chest pain or feeling of pressure in the chest, possibly spreading to arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach. Feeling sick, sweaty or short of breath. Th e person having a heart attack will usually remain conscious. WHAT TO DO If you are having these symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your doctor or call 911. If someone you are with appears to be having a heart attack, call 911 immediately. Sit the person down and keep them calm while you wait for help.CARDIAC ARREST (CA) WHAT IT IS Usually, an electrical problem that causes the heart to stop pumping. CA can be tri ered by a heart attack but can have other causes, such as an undiagnosed heart abnormality or cocaine or amphetamine use. SYMPTOMS Possibly racing heart or dizziness, but CA may occur without warning. A person suff ering CA will become unconscious and will not breathe normally, or breathe at all. WHAT TO DO Immediately call 911, or have someone else make the call while you perform the steps below. If an AED (automated external defi brillator) is available, begin use, following the prompts. Do CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). If you don't know conventional CPR (see below). HANDS-ONLY CPR Hands-only CPR can be done successfully even by someone who's not a professional. The idea is to push hard and fast in the center of the victim's chest to the beat of a familiar song that has 100 to 120 beats per minute. Think of the song \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees to help keep compressions in a regular rhythm.

TRAUMA OR ED? Hospital EDs take care of emergencies, of course, like heart attacks and breathing problems. EDs also deal with a broad range of noncritical conditions, such as the u or broken bones. A trauma center, however, has a larger scope than an ED. First responders or ED Paramedics are running through the Emergency Department (ED) entrance. Blood is all over. Doctors are shouting, \"Get me a clamp\u2014stat!\" And cut! End scene. Th at chaotic scenario, a staple of medical shows, happens on TV show sets but not in real life, trauma experts say. \"In a true trauma situation, we have quiet, controlled conditions,\" says critical MICHAEL MARANO, MD BRUNO MOLINO, MD RAJAN GUPTA, MD TRAUMA WITHOUT DRAMA Healthy Together | 10 | Winter 2020 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 System_Trauma_Winter20_final.indd 10 12/11/19 2:50 PMphysicians make the decision as to whether a patient needs the services of a trauma center. \"A trauma center is designed to immediately treat critically injured patients who have life- or limb-threatening injuries,\" explains acute care surgeon Bruno Molino, MD, Trauma Director at JCMC and a member of RWJBarnabas Health medical group. \"When seconds count to make the diff erence between life and death, a whole team is waiting around a stretcher even before the patient arrives. \"To be certifi ed as a trauma center, a facility must have extensive resources available to care for severely injured patients at all times,\" says Dr. Molino. \"Neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery\u2014all these specialties and more have to be there at our disposal.\" Th e most common types of injuries seen in trauma centers come from three situations: falls by elderly people, blunt-force assault or penetrating wounds (such as gunshots), and motor-vehicle crashes, says Dr. Gupta. \"Our cars are getting much safer, so traumatic injuries from crashes are decreasing,\" he explains. \"Meanwhile, for the elderly, even a minor fall can result in devastating injuries. As the population ages, this has become an ever-growing issue for health systems.\" Trauma centers also routinely drill to be prepared for mass casualties in a disaster situation. Th is training includes close coordination with other trauma centers in case backup is needed. Th ere are 10 state-certifi ed trauma centers in New Jersey. HELP FOR SEVERE BURNS Trauma centers across the state coordinate closely with Th e Burn Center at SBMC, New Jersey's only state-certifi ed burn-treatment facility. In addition to burns from home accidents, industrial incidents and motor-vehicle crashes, one of the most common injuries the center sees\u2014up to 30 percent of cases\u2014is scalding in children under age 2 who have been splashed accidentally by a hot liquid. Specialists including burn technicians, nurses and respiratory therapists, as well as the most advanced technology, are available at the center at all times. \"If someone comes in with a surface burn, for example, we're able to immediately treat them with hydrotherapy\u2014water piped through special spigots that removes dead skin and bacteria to minimize the chance of infection,\" explains Michael Marano, MD, Medical Director of Th e Burn Center. Th e center has 12 intensive care beds for the most critically injured patients and an 1-bed recovery unit. It also runs Th e Outpatient Center for Wound and Burn Healing, which works with more than 4,00 patients each year. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION In the hope of minimizing the need for their services, the trauma and burn centers put considerable resources into community education, covering the age spectrum from infants and car seats to geriatric fall prevention, as well as pedestrian safety, To learn more about safety education and training at RWJ arnabas Health hospitals, visit www.rwjbh.org/cpr. THE NEED FOR SPEED \"In trauma care, timing is everything,\" says Jim Smith, Vice President, Mobile Health Services and Patient Transport at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). \"The gold standard is to have no more than 60 minutes from the time a patient has a traumatic emergency to the time he or she is in the OR.\" Depending on location and time of day, a trip that takes 45 minutes by road could be done by helicopter in 20 minutes. That's why RWJBH has partnered with Med-Trans aviation to provide a state-of-the-art Airbus 135 helicopter and two dispatch centers for live satellite tracking. Known as LifeFlight, the service includes on-scene and in-air emergency treatment and transportation to the closest appropriate state-certi ed trauma center. The crew includes RWJBH Emergency Medical Services fl ight nurses and paramedics who have had extensive training in emergency, air medical and trauma protocols. In addition to providing time-critical transportation from emergency events, the LifeFlight system transports patients as needed among RWJBH's 11 hospitals (and other health systems as appropriate). \"The service assists with continuity of care within the same network,\" Smith says. \"And although it can seem dramatic and scary for patients to hear they are being transported by helicopter, sometimes the issue is not so much medical acuity as it is timing and traf c.\" In either case, he says, \"It's important for New Jersey residents to know that, barring any weather issues, air medical services in the state are robust and coordinate closely with ground providers. Very few states have the availability of resources and capabilities that we do.\" bicycle safety, sports safety, yard-work safety and distracted driving education. \"I tell my Injury Prevention Coordinator that it's her job to put me out of business,\" says Dr. Gupta. Inevitably, accidents will happen. When they do, New Jersey residents are in the fortunate position of having a nearby trauma center ready and able to serve.From left, fl ight paramedic Michael Brown, FP-C; fl ight nurse Robert Maiullo, CFRN; and lead pilot Joe Gilbert with the RWJBarnabas Health Airbus 135 helicopter. \"In trauma care, timing is everything,\" says Jim Smith, Vice Healthy Together | 10 | Winter 2020 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 11 System_Trauma_Winter20_final.indd 11 12/11/19 feel well,\" said Tara Hansen, 29, of Wanamassa, shortly aft er giving birth to her son in 2011. But her healthcare providers considered her a healthy postpartum patient, and sent her home. Six days later, she died from an infection that occurred during the birth. Pregnancy-related deaths are relatively rare\u2014about 700 occur each year in the U.S.\u2014but are on the rise. So is the rate of delivery-related \"severe maternal morbidity,\" which is defined as significant short- or long-term effects to a woman's health. \"In New Jersey, healthcare systems, community-based organizations and government agencies are tackling this issue head-on,\" says Suzanne Spernal, Vice President of Women's Services for RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). \"We're collectively looking at the entire continuum of healthcare to see what women want and need to be healthy before, during and aft er pregnancy.\" EMPOWERING WOMEN Providing education is a priority. \"Th e majority of maternal adverse events don't happen on the day a woman gives birth,\" Spernal says. \"Th ey occur in the days and weeks that follow the birth, when mom is back at home and the warning signs of a serious complication may not be immediately recognized.\" To increase awareness, Tara's husband, Ryan, partnered with Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, an RWJBH facility, to create the Tara Hansen Foundation's \"Stop.

Healthy Together | 12 | Winter 2020 System_Maternal_Winter20_final.indd 12 12/11/19 2:51 PMOn the afternoon of January ,2019, Olivia Lopes got a frightening phone call: Her mother, nephew and 7-month-old son had been in an accident. While the three were walking home from her nephew's school, a vehicle had jumped the curb and struck them from behind. Olivia's mother and nephew suffered multiple fractures. Infant LJ, who had been in his car seat in a wagon being pulled by his grandmother, suffered the most extensive injuries as the car seat became dislodged and soared 70 feet away. \"When we finally got in to see LJ, he was on life support,\" Olivia recalls. \"He had multiple skull fractures, orbital fractures, severe brain trauma and a broken leg, and was having difficulty moving his right arm.\" LJ spent 21 days in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit before being transferred to the Brain Injury Program at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in New Brunswick. There, a team of specialists developed a customized rehabilitation program to address his medical, physical, cognitive and psychosocial needs. Within a week, however, his family and team realized something wasn't right with LJ. He was transferred to the Emergency Department at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where a CAT scan led to a diagnosis of hydrocephalus. With this condition, excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the ventricles (cavities) of the brain and increases pressure within the head, causing head enlargement, headaches, impaired vision, cognitive difficulties and loss of coordination. A shunt was surgically inserted into a ventricle to drain the excess fluid.SKILLS REGAINED LJ returned to CSH on February 11 to continue his rehabilitation journey. He quickly bonded with his inpatient team, particularly enjoying aquatic therapy. \"Once they got LJ into the pool, there was no stopping him,\" says Olivia. \"He loved it, and the resistance of the water forced him to start using his right arm more.\" LJ spent another two months at Children's Specialized working with physical, occupational, speech-language and recreational therapists. \"The progress he made at Children's Specialized was amazing,\" says Olivia. \"After the accident, he lost all of his muscle memory. The team worked with him day in and day out, helping him to learn how to roll, crawl, stand and walk.\" LJ went home on April . He is now attending outpatient therapy sessions three days a week at the CSH location in Hamilton, working hard to build strength in his right arm and learn how to suck and swallow properly. \"We still keep in touch with the remarkable therapists and care team at Children's Specialized, updating them on LJ's progress,\" Olivia says. \"We're forever grateful for the care that Children's Specialized provided to our son.\" To learn more about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.childrens-specialized.org.LEARNING TO CRAWL AGAIN A BABY REBOUNDS FROM A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WITH THE HELP OF CHILDREN'S SPECIALIZED HOSPITAL.From left to right, LJ Lopes in the at Children's Specialized Hospital; snuggling with his cousin Auggie; getting a boost from visiting Rutgers University football players.

She had been a runner for more than 40 years, but that summer she couldn't run more than a block without having to stop to walk. She had fevers, night sweats and a rash on her back. \"A friend was diagnosed with Lyme disease and her symptoms sounded like mine, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and his phlebotomist took blood samples,\" she recalls. Within 24 hours, the doctor called back to explain that he had sent the blood test results to a hematologist who wanted her in his office that day. \"I think you have leukemia,\" the hematologist told her. \"And I think you need to go to Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick. Today.\" Lael's immune system was so suppressed that she was in a life-threatening situation. Within three days she would be admitted to RWJUH, where she would spend the next seven weeks undergoing chemotherapy. Dr. Patel has been by her side since then, along with a vast team of specialists from both It's a gorgeous day on the boardwalk in Bradley Beach and to look at the two smiling women, you would never guess that they had met in person for the very first time just three days before. They exhibit a strong physical and emotional connection\u2014a bond worth life itself. \"I feel as if I'm with my daughter or my niece,\" Lael McGrath, 68, admits. She owes her life to Wiebke Rudolph, a 21-year-old recent college graduate from Kassel, Germany. Wiebke donated her stem cells anonymously to Lael after the retired second-grade teacher from Toms River was diagnosed with life-threatening acute myeloid leukemia in 2016. Both had looked forward to this meeting for more than two years.A STRANGER'S GIFT Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2020 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 15 System_BMTPatient_Winter20_final.indd 14 12/11/19 2:53 PMRWJUH and Rutgers Cancer Institute. In the hospital, Lael's treatment involved the use of combination chemotherapy designed to get her into remission. \"However, the specific mutations that we identified in her leukemia were high-risk in nature, so we knew that chemotherapy alone would not keep her in remission,\" says Dr. Patel. \"We needed immune therapy in the form of an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\" SEARCHING FOR A DONOR In a bone marrow transplant, cells can be used from your own body, known as an autologous transplant. When cells are taken from a donor, the transplant is called allogeneic. \"In this procedure, the patient's diseased marrow is replaced with a donor's blood stem cells,\" says Dr. Patel. \"It allows for normal blood formation and provides a new immune system to help eliminate the leukemia. It also has the potential for a cure.\" At RWJUH, bone marrow transplant coordinator Mary Kate McGrath, MSN, RN, APN, BMTCN, OCN (no relation to Lael), ran the results of Lael's DNA testing through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) registry. \"Within two months of Lael's diagnosis, we identified three potential matches on the registry\u2014but Wiebke turned out to be the perfect match,\" she explains.Four thousand miles away in Germany, Wiebke was notified that she matched a patient in dire need. \"Not that many people in Germany do this and certainly no one in my family or among my friends,\" she says. \"But when I first heard about this, I said yes, I'm going to do it. I was determined.\" Wiebke underwent peripheral blood stem cell donation, a procedure called apheresis, in which blood is removed through a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that collects only blood-forming cells. (The remaining blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.) The procedure took six hours. All the logistics of harvesting Wiebke's stem cells and then transporting them to the U.S. were handled by NMDP. Meanwhile, Lael's repeat blood transfusions were made possible by the RWJUH Blood Services team. Lael spent weeks in the hospital during the fall and winter of 2016, waiting for the transplant and being closely monitored by her healthcare team. Finally, in December 2016, she was notified that her transplant was imminent. \"On December 16th, it happened,\" she recalls. \"A team walked in carrying a small cooler and within an hour, the transfusion was over. All I actually knew was that the donor was female and 19 years old.\" Lael did so well post-transplant that she was able to go home on New Year's Day 2017. Over in Germany, Wiebke was told that the transplant had gone well. Protocol and confidentiality policies don't permit donors and patients to have direct contact with each other until at least one year has passed. In this case, the wait lasted more than two years, until test results showed that Lael's blood cells were 100 percent \"donor.\" Not all donors and patients meet. But there was never any doubt for either of these two women. In fact, the pair started emailing, texting and then talking to each other on FaceTime right after being given each other's contact information. Recently, at a celebration hosted by RWJUH, both women held bouquets of owers and stood happily alongside one another. \"If it weren't for Wiebke, I don't know what would have happened,\" Lael says. With the breeze blowing off the Atlantic Ocean, these two women look knowingly at one another, smile and agree, \"It was a miracle.\" Opposite page, top, Lael and Wiebke with Vimal Patel, MD; this page, with members of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

It's a common syndrome\u2014thought to affect up to 10 million people in the U.S\u2014known as Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD. \"SAD is a kind of depression that happens at a specific time of year, usually in the winter,\" explains psychiatrist Gabriel Kaplan, MD, Chief Medical Officer of the RWJBarnabas Health Behavioral Health Network. Symptoms of SAD are similar to those of clinical depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, anxiety and problems with appetite. \"A couple of symptoms seem to be more common with SAD, however,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"People with SAD often crave sweets more, and are more tired and sleep more.\" As with regular depression, there is help for those who suffer from SAD. WHY WINTER? While the exact cause of SAD is unknown, two hormones are implicated: melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep, and serotonin, a key hormone for mood stabilization. \"Melatonin tends to be produced when there's no sunlight,\" explains Dr. Kaplan. \"More melatonin means people feel sleepier.\" Conversely, sunlight tends to boost serotonin. A lack of light causes the brain to release less serotonin, which can lead to depression. \"We're not sure what makes some people vulnerable to SAD while others aren't greatly affected by less exposure to sunlight,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"The theory is that people with SAD may have some form of imbalance in the regulation of these two hormones. Genetic factors may play a role in this.\" WHAT TO DO \"If you think you may have SAD, consult with a professional to determine whether your condition relates to that or to something else,\" advises Dr. Kaplan. \"Depression can be due to many different things, so it's better not to self- diagnose and possibly waste time on the wrong treatments.\" Having a healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to improve symptoms of depression. Other possible treatments for SAD include: Light therapy. The patient sits or works near a device called a light therapy box, which gives off a bright light that mimics natural outdoor light. \"For some people, this treatment is very effective, but it's best to consult your physician about the type of device to use,\" says Dr. Kaplan. Cognitive behavioral therapy. This kind of psychotherapy, or \"talk therapy,\" focuses on changing inaccurate or negative thinking in order to create new behaviors. Antidepressant medication. \"Generally speaking, antidepressants don't start working for four to six weeks,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"If your depression is seasonal, you may choose to take them for several months and then go off them when winter is over, or continue to take them for the rest of the year to prevent the reappearance of depression. It's the combined job of the doctor and patient to decide the best course.\" SEASONAL DEPRESSION IS A STRUGGLE, BUT HELP IS AVAILABLE.

She was significantly overweight, with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Lainie embraced good nutrition and regular exercise, and her efforts paid off. She lost close to 0 pounds and became fit through weightlifting and running. So happy was she with her new lifestyle that she became a certified personal trainer and health coach. Then she began to experience pain on her runs. \"I'd grown to love running, but running didn't necessarily love me,\" Lainie says. \"I started to suffer from chronic calf injuries in my left leg.\" A series of injections at her doctor's office provided pain relief and accelerated healing. They helped enough that she was able to return to her normal activities.Fast-forward to this past April, when she entered a 10K race in Newark. \"I felt terrible pain, this time in my right leg,\" Lainie recalls. \"I proceeded to walk, and then at about a quarter of the way through, I couldn't even walk anymore. One of the nurses who'd come to cheer me on ended up having to help cart me off the course.\" NEXT STEPS Lainie consulted a sports medicine doctor, who did an ultrasound and found tears in fibers of the leg muscles. She got more injections, and this time also got a prescription for physical therapy. Enter Kimberly Polimeni, MSPT, DPT, of RWJ Physical Therapy at the RWJ Rahway Fitness Wellness Center in Scotch Plains. \"Having the benefit of the diagnostic ultrasound really helped our team understand how to help Lainie,\" says Polimeni. Lainie adds that the team's efforts to find the right treatment went above and beyond what she expected. \"They really listened to what I told them in terms of where the pain was,\" Lainie says. \"They respected my knowledge of my own body.\" Polimeni started with Instrument- Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization, in which a physical therapist uses specially designed stainless steel tools to lengthen the soft tissue, bring blood ow to the region and help restore normal muscle mechanics. Lainie then progressed to stretching, strengthening and balance work. About two months in, the therapists started having Lainie jog on a treadmill, where they made a crucial discovery. \"We noticed instability in her ankles,\" Polimeni remembers. \"The other problem was that she was training out on roads that are very uneven. Those two factors made her problems worse.\" Ankle stabilization exercises were the key. \"My way of being an athlete had been, as soon as I stopped feeling pain, I went back to doing what I had been doing,\" Lainie says. \"Now, Kim has given me the foundation of knowing what I need to do to protect myself.\"ADVICE FOR RUNNERS \"If you want to avoid injuries from running, a well-rounded approach is crucial,\" advises Kim Polimeni, MSPT, DPT of RWJ Physical Therapy at the RWJ Rahway Fitness & Wellness Center in Scotch Plains and a POSE Method Running Technique Specialist. \"Any repetitive activity can cause injuries, so it's best to incorporate strength training, stretching and balance activities into your routine.

Most cancers can be diagnosed and treated at an early stage, but colorectal cancer\u2014the third most common cancer in the U.S.\u2014can actually be prevented. \"Early screening and timely intervention can prevent cancer in both average-risk populations and high-risk individuals,\" says Pavan Sachan, MD, a gastroenterologist with Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Rahway. That's because screening can detect abnormal cells that have grown into polyps (small lumps of cells that grow on the lining of the colon). It generally takes 10 to 15 years for polyps to develop into cancer, but screening can determine COLORECTAL CANCER: CATCH IT EARLY RWJBarnabas Health and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2014 the state's only NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\u2014 provide close-to-home access to the most advanced treatment options.

Screening can also lead to better cancer outcomes, because it can find the disease when it's small and more easily treated. With more than 145,000 new cases diagnosed each year and more than 50,000 deaths attributed to colorectal cancer annually, the importance of screening can't be stressed enough, experts say. \"The incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining at the rate of 2 percent every year due to screening,\" says Dr. Sachan. Dr. Sachan recommends that patients have an early risk assessment for colorectal cancer by their primary care physician at around age 20. That will help determine whether a patient has high or average risk. After that, he advises a reassessment every five years. Starting about age 40, Dr. Sachan says, everyone should have a yearly digital rectal exam (an examination performed manually by a healthcare provider). Screening tests should begin at age 50 and continue through age 75, he says. HOW SCREENING IS DONE There are a number of ways to screen for colorectal cancer. \"For a healthy average-risk patient, any of the tests can be recommended, but the gold standard test is colonoscopy,\" says Dr. Sachan. In a colonoscopy, a flexible, lighted tube is inserted into the rectum and entire colon while the patient is sedated. Polyps can be removed during this procedure. Other tests may be recommended for people for whom colonoscopy is not an option for physical or medical reasons. These screenings may include: Virtual colonoscopy: An examination of the colon via computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan. Sigmoidoscopy: A flexible, lighted tube is inserted into the rectum to look for polyps, cancer and abnormalities. Fecal occult blood test: A patient's stool samples are tested once a year for traces of blood. Stool DNA test: Stool samples are tested for DNA biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer. WHO'S AT RISK? Some risk factors for colorectal cancer are within a person's control. These factors include smoking; heavy alcohol use; a diet high in red meat or processed meat; being overweight; and being physically inactive. Other factors that put a person at higher risk include: Family history of colon cancer or genetic colon cancer syndromes A personal history of chronic colitis syndromes, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Having had radiation to the abdomen due to childhood cancers Having Type 2 diabetes.\"African-American males are at higher risk and should have early screening,\" says Dr. Sachan. Jews of Eastern European descent and HIV-infected males also have higher risk. POSSIBLE SYMPTOMS Screenings are important because many people in the early stages of colon cancer don't have symptoms. However, patients should be aware of signs that could be possible symptoms. Cancer can be diagnosed only by a physician, of course, but you'll want to speak with your doctor about any of the following: Rectal bleeding Unintended weight loss Chronic abdominal pain Change in bowel movement pattern or quality of stool Iron deficiency anemia Weakness and fatigue.Many of these symptoms are common and occur for reasons not related to cancer. For example, rectal bleeding, often the most worrisome symptom for patients, may be due to hemorrhoids, Unintended weight loss also can be caused by other conditions, including thyroid disorders and uncontrolled diabetes, and so shouldn't be assumed to be caused by cancer. In general, public awareness and availability of colorectal cancer screening should be increased, Dr. Sachan says. \"I'd like to see more employers offer screening for common cancers,\" he says, \"with incentives and paid leaves to encourage participation.\" RWJUH Rahway provides a ll range o screenings or colorectal and other cancers.

When you think about vaccinations, you probably think about the shots children begin to get in the first months of life. But adults also need to get vaccines. Protection from vaccines a person received as a child can wear off over time. In addition, thanks to medical advances, many new vaccines are now available. Nonetheless, every year, many adults don't get their shots, and as a result become seriously ill with preventable diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"There's now a list of 12 types of adult vaccines that are recommended,\" says Thomas Kowalenko, DO, a family practitioner and Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Rahway. \"But the type of vaccine needed, and the timing, can vary from person to person. The topic really deserves a discussion with your doctor.\" AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH \"The lu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone age months and older, with a few exceptions, and you can get that at a pharmacy or community health clinic,\" says Dr. Kowalenko. \"But you should definitely check in with your doctor, because he or she is the one who is going to put the whole schedule of vaccinations together for you.\"GROWN-UPS NEED VACCINES, TOO THOMAS KOWALENKO, DO Healthy Together | 20 | Winter 2020 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway | RWJBH.ORG/RAHWAY | 21 Rahway_AdultVaccines_Winter20_final.indd 20 12/6/19 2:15 PMRecommendations can be tailored to the patient. For example, the CDC recommends the pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccination to those age and older. But the way a person gets the vaccine can vary. Guidelines for the current vaccine require a sequence of Prevnar (PCV13) fi rst, followed by Pneumovax (PPSV) at least one year later. For at-risk patients, however, the one- year waiting period may be shortened to eight weeks. \"Furthermore, certain at-risk patients, such as smokers and diabetics, may be recommended to have the pneumococcal vaccine at a much younger age than \",Dr. Kowalenko says. \"Th e same holds true for someone who has had their spleen removed, and is therefore more susceptible to certain bacterial infections.\" \"CHILDHOOD\" DISEASES The CDC recommends vaccinations for shingles (herpes zoster) for healthy adults ages 0 and over. The risk of getting shingles, a painful rash with blisters that can linger for months, increases as a person ages. Because shingles and chicen po are caused by the same virus, many adults wonder if they may be immune to shingles because they had chicken pox in childhood. Not so, says Dr. Kowalenko. \"Th e fi rst time you are exposed to the virus, you typically get the chicken pox,\" he explains. \"Aft er you recover, the virus stays in your body, dormant in the nerve cells, and can reactivate and recur as shingles. \"So if you have had chicken pox, you should get a shingles vaccination because you already have the virus in your nervous system. But even if you never had chicken pox, you should still get the vaccination because chicken pox is a more serious infection for an adult than for a child.\" Furthermore, even if you have had shingles, you should still get the latest version of the vaccine to increase your immunity and reduce the risk of a second episode. As for measles, the disease had been virtually eliminated by vaccines in the U.S. by the year 2000, but has recently recurred, especially in communities where groups of people are not vaccinated. \"Adults who had the measles as children, but who are concerned about it now, should get a blood test that can tell defi nitively whether they have immunity,\" says Dr. Kowalenko. \"Th is is the only way to know for sure whether you need an additional dose of the vaccine.\" What about ooster shots for vaccines previously received \"Diff erent vaccines have diff erent periods of time that they are eff ective,\" Dr. Kowalenko explains. \"Many vaccines give lifelong immunity, and others, like the tetanus shot, require repeat doses to restimulate the immune system and cause the level of immunity to rise again. \"You or your doctor must check with the manufacturer of each specifi c vaccine and with sources such as the CDC. Recommendations can change over time.\" To fi nd a primary care physician at RWJUH Rahway, call 888.724.7123 or visit www.rwjbh.org/rahway.RECOMMENDED ADULT IMMUNIZATIONS Immunization recommendations for adults age 19 and older can vary based on age, medical conditions and other special situations.

TYPE OF VACCINE WHAT IT'S FOR Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (HepA and HepB)Hepatitis is an infl ammation of the liver; different types can be caught from food and drink, or from infected bodily fl uids. Human Papillomavirus (HPV)HPV is a viral infection spread though skin-to-skin contact that can lead to cancer. Infl uenza (fl u) The fl u is a contagious respiratory illness that can be severe. It's most often caused by viruses spread through droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)Each of these diseases causes fever and can lead to serious complications. Adults should be up to date on their MMR vaccinations, according to the CDC. Meningococcal These bacteria can cause infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, as well as the bloodstream. Pneumococcal There are several types of pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, meningitis, ear infection and blood infection. Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis (Tdap)Protects against bacteria that can cause tetanus, a nerve ailment, often introduced by a cut or wound; diphtheria, an infection in nose and throat membranes; and pertussis, also known as whooping cough.
