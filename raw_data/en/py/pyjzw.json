I am being guided to rediscover my own Celtic/Druidic Roots, and there will be new Meditations being created throughout this year, based on my new and original work with The Tree Essences. There will be 13 of these, based on the Ogham Tree Wisdoms of the Druidic Alphabet. This will not be a turning away from any of the Wisdom Teachings so far shared, but rather a continued interweaving of Wisdoms and Medicine, which also honour my own roots. I am also delighted to let you know that I conducted the very first Honour Full Pink Moon Yoga and Meditation Ceremony in collaboration with Camille of Wildling Yoga Studio with a full house of 13 a week ago. It was a beautiful honouring evening under a clear sky in the full presence of Grandmother Moon. The Essence of Blackthorn was the first to be shared at a Moon Ceremony, offering its protective fire shielding presence as its gift to those in the new Sacred Space. NB: The coming Full Moon Ceremonies are bookable through [Wilding Studio](https://www.wildlingstudio.co.uk/full-moon-meditation) only PAUSE ~ REFLECT ~ DREAM This New Flower Moon falls the day after the beginning of Earthwalk of Beaver/Taurus. The full cycle of this Moon lasts all the way through until the gentle sweetness of the New Strawberry/Mead Moon of Deer/Gemini on 21st May. The coming lunar cycle is informed by The Fourth Clan Mother, Looks Far Woman, who guides us to follow our visions and dreams. This is the second lunar cycle of true Spring. We are still in the time of fresh growth and illumination, coloured by the romantic and fecund energies of May Day! Join us by stepping into Ceremony to honour yourself in this time of tranquillity and release, creating spaciousness into which you may begin to nurture and root down those visions and dreams into reality. RELEASING THE PAST (ALDER) HEALING JOURNEY MEDITATION: This will be the first Meditation in the new series of Tree Essence Meditations. A calming and balancing Meditation, encouraging self-reflection, gentle emotional release and self-forgiveness.Discovering a place of tranquillity within us is itself a treasure which can alter the nature of our own presence in the world. WHAT TO EXPECT: Each Recipient has their own dedicated Rose Quartz Heart (the Crystal of loving mother energy and gentle emotional release), through whom the New Moon Healing is delivered. The \"team\" now consists of 13, one for each of the 13 lunar cycles, so 13 corresponding places are being offered. 1. ZOOM OPTION (All cameras and microphones turned off ~ receiver mode only): I appear on screen at the beginning to say hello and offer a little about working with Moon Energy and, specifically, with the energy of the The Grandmother Moon and Earth Wisdom energies of the month. I teach The Moon Breath Meditation, offer you space in which to release whatever is needful, to reflect on the month's themes, and to offer gratitude for all you have received. In this quietness, a creative space opens into which you may continue to seed your dreams... I will then invite you to make yourself comfortable to enjoy the Alder Tree Essence Meditation whilst you receive the releasing New Moon Reiki Healing. In order to keep your experience as personal and private as possible, all cameras and microphones will be kept turned off, and the session will be viewing and listening only. 2. AN ALTERNATIVE TO ZOOM: If you prefer, you may book your place to receive New Moon Healing, and I will make the Alder Tree Essence Meditation available for you to download from my website. You may then plan your own private Ceremony and still be part of the beautiful energy being generated. I will include you in the New Moon Crystal Healing part of the evening, which will commence at approximately 10.00 pm. 3. DEFERRED OPTION: If you are unable to attend at the time of the Ceremony, you can still choose to be included in the New Moon Healing, and I then send you a recorded version of the evening for you to experience at a time which works for you. Several of my \"regulars\" have chosen this option in the past, and discovered that they still feel the full benefits of the Ceremony. GENERAL INFO: Places available are limited strictly to 13, so please do book in good time to avoid disappointment. The free gift of the Alder Tree Healing Journey Meditation is offered to all.The fee for the New Moon Healing Circle is \u00a333.Whichever way you opt to be part of the Healing Circle, the complete session will last for up to 90 minutes beginning at 9.00 pm. TO BOOK: Send me an email and let me know how you wish to participate. Confirmation of your place is made upon payment of the fee via BACS. I will then send you: 1. Your Zoom Link (if required) 2. Your new Discount Code to download The Alder Tree Essence Meditation to listen to whenever you choose. 3. Suggestions on how to prepare yourself and your space to make the most of the New Flower Moon Healing energies. I do hope you will be able to join me to nurture your dreams and visions in the Growing Time of the New Moon Healing Circle this month. With love Elizabeth xx "}
