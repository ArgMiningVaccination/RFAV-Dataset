Once the countdown ends and the new year begins, now what? If you're wondering how to start the new year, then consider attending a plant medicine retreat in Ecuador. January is often filled with talk of resolutions and new year reset plans. But beyond that, it is an opportunity for reflection and change, which makes it the perfect time to attend a retreat. Read on to learn more about why you should start the year with a detox retreat. Detox A common New Year's resolution is a detox in January. When we talk about a New Year detox, we are referring to your body, mind, and spirit. After all, it is not just your body that accumulates impressions, but your mind and spirit too. Our January retreat will provide tools to help you reset for the year ahead, such as yoga and meditation. Plus, before and during a retreat, you will be on a plant medicine dieta, which is a simple but delicious food plan to support the integration of the plant medicines Ayahuasca and San Pedro safely. The dieta also helps cleanse and protect your energy, including recommendations such as avoiding phone and social media use. You begin to realize in ceremonies how everything makes an impression on you, so simplifying everything can bring clarity, purification, and connection a lot faster. Our January retreat will also include specific foods and drinks tailored to enhance this detoxification process. Renewal and Renovate Attending a plant medicine retreat is a transformational experience that helps you get closer to your true nature. But it is not about creating a 'new' you; it is about remembering, returning to yourself, and reconnecting to the whole. You renew your focus, energy, and sense of self during the retreat, realigning and coming into balance once more. The inner work begins to reflect on your outer space, too, so you can return home with a renewed perspective on your life. You may also notice how your healing and renewal begin to benefit those around you. Plus, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, January can feel more like hibernation time than renewal. Attending a plant medicine retreat in Ecuador will mean you also get to experience the coast during the high season, which usually means sunny days and beautiful sunsets. Close Cycles and Make Space Named after the [Roman God Janus](https://theconversation.com/who-was-janus-the-roman-god-of-beginnings-and-endings-86853), God of new beginnings and endings, January is when many people reflect on everything that has passed and what they want to change. But it can be challenging to start your new year right without direction or a new environment. Our plant medicine retreat in Ecuador gives you the space to let go of what doesn't serve you anymore and make room for the year ahead. All the activities are tailored to help you with this. For example, there are several [sweat lodges](https://www.ayllumedicina.com/another-way-to-clear-the-mind/) (temazcals) throughout the week, which are a chance for purification and rebirth, the perfect new year reset. You will also get the opportunity to learn ways to close cycles throughout the year, such as with our moon wisdom workshops. After all, 365 days is a long time, so learning ways to close cycles throughout the year is invaluable. Set Intentions At Ayllu Medicina, we have the main intention of peace, love, dignity, and joy. You will also have the opportunity to set your own intention for the week and learn more about how you can integrate intentions into your life. Giving yourself the time to go inwards opens space for what your heart truly wants. During plant medicine ceremonies, such as with [Grandmother Ayahuasca](https://www.ayllumedicina.com/7-reasons-why-people-take-ayahuasca/), you will move from your head to your heart, so your intentions may simplify or change. With these intentions in mind, you can then direct your arrows for the year ahead and your life. As our guide Hwaneetah says; To find our purpose in life without finding our true selves first can be very challenging, almost impossible. When you find yourself, you automatically find your purpose. Reflect and Give Thanks The new year is the perfect time to pause, give thanks for everything that has passed, and be ready to receive what is to come. What better way to do this than at a new year's retreat, in a tropical oasis without distractions? Plant medicine retreats offer you the space to pause, let yourself catch up, and be present. You have the time to reflect on your year and everything that has passed without rushing, avoiding, or leaving anything for later. All the activities will aid this reflection and integration, including the plant medicine ceremonies, temazcals, yoga, and art time. Gain a New Community One of the benefits of attending a San Pedro and Ayahuasca retreat in Ecuador is the retreat container and the community you gain. You are in a supportive space catered to help you process, heal, and integrate, even once you leave the space. Many retreat attendees stay in touch, share their adventures, and ask questions that come up once they return home. Some even return one, two, or multiple times for another one of our plant medicine retreats! So, if you are wondering how to start your new year, start by gaining a new community. 'Ayllu' is Kichwa [for family](https://www.kichwa.net/recursos-kichwa/a1-6-ayllu-la-familia/), and everyone who attends sweat lodges, plant medicine ceremonies, and retreats with us becomes part of our supportive Ayllu community. Learn New Wellbeing Tools [Around 64%](https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/most-abandon-new-years-resolutions-in-month/) of people abandon their New Year's resolutions within a month. There are many reasons for this, including not having the tools to implement lasting change. At our detox retreat, you will have the time to pause, return to your center, and gain tools to help you continue your journey. You will start the year with a detox retreat, but you can use what you learn throughout the year. Tools include meditation techniques, yoga, breathwork, moon wisdom, and healthy eating. This way, you can learn how to maintain alignment and wellbeing, even when you return home. Why You Should Start the Year With a Detox Retreat There are many reasons why you should start the year with a detox retreat. You may be interested in connecting to plant medicines, feel stuck as this year comes to a close, or want to start the new year intentionally. Whatever the reason, if you feel the call, then it is time to consider a plant medicine retreat.
