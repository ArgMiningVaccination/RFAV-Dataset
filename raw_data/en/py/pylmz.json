Are you protected from the flu if you got the flu shot last year? How long is the shot effective? The short answer is six months, but the long answer is more complicated than this. Read on and find out what this means for when you should get your next flu shot. When To Get a Flu Shot This Year What Is the Flu? The flu, or influenza, is a contagious infection of your lungs, throat, and nose. It infects millions of people every year. More people get sick at certain times of the year, especially late fall through spring. Symptoms come on fast and can include: CoughRunny or stuffy noseFeeling tiredBody aches or headachesSore throatRunny nose or congestionVomiting and diarrhea (more common in children) People can spread it before they have symptoms and up to five or seven days after they get better (which can also take several days). You get it by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your nose or eye. People who are sick can also spread it when talking, coughing, or sneezing. Who Should Get a Flu Shot? Most national health organizations recommend that anyone six months or older get a flu shot yearly, except in rare cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) especially recommends that you get the flu shot if you are older than 65, pregnant, have had a stroke, or have a chronic condition including (but not limited to): Asthma Diabetes Chronic kidney disease Heart disease How Long Does the Flu Shot Last? In short: The flu shot can last as long as six months. The long answer is a little bit more complicated, partly because everybody is different. Knowing how long the flu shot lasts is essential in determining when to get your flu shot each year. Flu season generally lasts from October to May but peaks from December through February. The CDC recommends getting the flu shot by the end of October. Unfortunately, if you get your flu shot in October of the previous year, you're not covered for the current October (and yes, that can matter since the flu technically exists year-round and only peaks during the flu season). In addition, if you got your shot late in the flu season last year, you're not covered at the end of the calendar year of the current year, even if you're within the six-month range. The flu strains differ yearly and so do the vaccines. 6 Things You Need To Know About Your Immune System How Effective Are Flu Shots? Researchers \"tweak\" vaccines annually to account for changes in circulating strains. Even so, vaccine effectiveness can vary widely from year to year. For instance, the effectiveness of the vaccine was 56% during the 2009-2010 flu season, 60% during the 2010-2011 season, and 36% during the 2021-2022 season. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines, doesn't expect or guarantee the vaccine will entirely prevent the flu. Several studies have also shown that vaccine effectiveness decreases each month after you get it. Still, the vaccine makes severe illness and hospitalization less likely, especially if you have a condition that makes you more vulnerable. It's best to get the flu shot yearly\u2014unless you're severely allergic to the vaccine or are six months of age or younger. While the flu shot isn't 100% effective, it can prevent the flu from becoming fatal. A Quick Review The flu makes millions of people sick each year and is pretty contagious, so health organizations recommend that nearly everyone older than six months get a flu vaccine annually, preferably around the start of flu season. While the shot won't fully protect you, it reduces your odds of getting it or getting very sick, especially if you are in a high-risk group. If you have any questions or concerns about getting a flu shot, reach out to your healthcare provider. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!
