Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute Scientific Highlights As a leader in food allergy research, we have been at the forefront of advances in epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and public education of allergic problems and immunologic disorders. Discovering Epidemiological and Clinical Manifestations of Allergies Our researchers have: - Identified risk factors for anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially fatal allergic reaction. - Described aspects of the natural progression of egg, milk, and peanut allergies. - Found that peanut allergies have more than tripled in children in the United States since the late 1990s. - Discovered that food allergies cause an inflammation of the esophagus called eosinophilic esophagitis. - Characterized and coined the Protein Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome\" (FPIES), a non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal food allergy disorder. Finding Ways to Diagnose Allergies Our researchers have: - Used double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to determine the role of food allergy in atopic dermatitis. - Identified the relationship of blood test results to food allergy outcomes to improve diagnosis, a technique now used worldwide. - Identified important components of multiple allergens for improving diagnosis. Creating Better Allergy Treatments Our researchers have: - Determined that baked forms of milk or egg may be tolerated by most people with such allergies and that ingestion may speed resolution of the allergies. - Conducted studies of novel therapies using ingredients from Traditional Chinese Medicine. - Developed a novel food allergy vaccine made up of mutated proteins. - Ran the first placebo-controlled study of egg oral immunotherapy. - Conducted the first placebo-controlled trial of dual therapy (immunotherapy and anti-IgE). - Administered the first placebo-controlled trial of anti-IgE for food allergy (a form of treatment for allergic conditions). - Conducted multiple studies that led to improved food labeling. - Continued to explore the possibility of peptide-based vaccines. Advancing Allergy Education and Advocacy Our researchers have: - Developed the first validated, publicly accessible educational program for managing childhood food allergies. - Conducted studies emphasizing the effect of food allergies on quality of life and concerns about bullying.
