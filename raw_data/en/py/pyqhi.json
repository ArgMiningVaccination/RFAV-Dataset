You are receiving th is mailing because you are registered as a school with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI), but you do not have an email address on file with DPI. We thank you for your partnership with assessing and ensuring compliance with the Wiscons in student immunization law. You are integral partners in ensuring schools remain healthy environments for learning. As you plan for another school year, we wanted to make you aware of a few items regarding school immunization compliance for the upcoming 2 022-2023 school year. The school booklet materials are also available online. https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/reqs.htm The School Report to Local Health Departments will be submitted electronically. If your school does NOT have access to the internet, a paper report must be sent to your LHD. The reports are in the booklet. This year we will continue to utilize an online p rocess for schools to report to the local health departments and the state. Paper version: https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/f0/f04002.pdf Online survey: https://redcap.wisconsin.gov/surveys/?s=DXK47T9EM8RYCRWH Note that the REDCap survey cannot be comple ted using Internet Explorer. Please use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to complete the survey. Either report will satisfy the reporting required of every school by Wisconsin law (Wis. Admin. Code ch. 144: https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/110/144 ) to subm it the report to the local health department by the deadline (the 40th school day) . It will not be necessary to send a separate paper copy of the form to the local health department. School compliance results from the previous school year are available o nline. Schools and districts should review their compliance results from the previous school year using the links below. Public school districts and private schools with less than 99.00% of students in compliance during the previous school year are require d to exclude noncompliant students during this coming school year. Public districts: https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p02388a.pdf Private schools: https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p02388.pdf A webinar will be held August 21 , 202 3 from 9 :00-10:30 am for school personnel on submitting the school report. DHS and the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) will host a webinar to discuss these changes and the process in more detail. The webinar will be recorded and archived on our website for viewing. The link for the webinar will be sent out closer to the date . We thank you for your continued efforts to ensure all school children in Wisconsin are protected against vaccine -preventable diseases. We look forward to a continued partnership with you. Please let DPI know if you would like to be included in their email distribution list by contacting louise.wilson@dpi.wi.gov . If you have questions, please contact your local health department or your regiona l immunization representative: Local COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 252.04 Immunization program .

P-01442 ( 7/2023) Page 1 of 9 Immunization L aw Clarification Updates to Wisconsin's Administrative Code (Wis. Admin . Code ch. DHS 144) THAT PERTAI N TO SCHOOL IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS Link: https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/dhs/110/144 The following update to DHS 144 will take effect for the 2023- 2024 school year and subsequent years . Students should receive the Tdap (tetanus, diphth eria and acellular pertussis) vaccine before the start of 7 th grade rather than 6th grade. Students who received one dose of Tdap prior to the start of 6th grade under the previous requirement are compliant and do not need to receive an additional dose of Tdap. Compliance Categories: Meets Minimum: Applies to student s with a record containing the dates (month/day/year) of immunizations for every dose of vaccine required for his or her grade level. For students in \"ungraded\" programs, use the requirement for the traditional age- appropriate grade. Does not apply to a child that has any immunization waiver (health, religious, or personal conviction.) In Process: Applies to student s enrolling for the first time in a Wisconsin school (e.g., prekindergarten or kindergarten, out -of-state transfers, and homeschooled children) and to existing students for whom there is a new vaccine requirement. To be considered \"in process,\" the student must provide the immunization dates demonstrating receipt of the first doses of required vaccines within 30 school days of admission. Prior to the 30 th school day, the legal notice should be sent as needed. \"In process\" also applies to the second doses within 90 school days of admission and the third (and fourth doses, if required) within 30 school days of admission the following school year. A student cannot be considered \"in process\" if the missing vaccine is a single- dose vaccine requirement (i.e., Tdap). These children, as well as any other students who fail to meet the deadlines, would be \"behind schedule.\" Behind Schedule: Applies to students who have an immunization record on file but are missing required doses of vaccine, are not in process, and do not have a waiver on file for the vaccine. Because the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law applies to all public and private schools, a transfer student from any school within the state who is \"behind schedule\" enters the new school as \"behind schedule,\" not \"in process.\" No Record: Applies to students who do not have a student immunization record on file and any transfer student for whom a record has not yet been received from the previous school. It Page 2 of 9 also applies to students who have submitted a record with inappropriate information, such as \"all vaccines received,\" \"child up to date ,\" or \"record at doctor's office.\" Waiver: Waivers are available for medical/health, religious , or personal conviction reasons. Children for whom waivers are filed are compliant. However, they may be subject to exclusion from school in the event of an outbreak of diseases against which they are not completely immunized. A history of chickenpox is not a waiver. If a waiver is selected, all vaccines the child has already received should be listed on the Student Immunization Record by the parent or guardian. Although they are compliant with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law, students with a waiver should not be classified in the Meets Minimum category. Compliant Categories: Meet minimum, In Process, Waiver . Noncompliant Categories: Behind Schedule, No Record. Exclusion : Every year schools are required to assess all students' immunization records to determine compliance with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law, as described in the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law Timeline: Actions Required of Schools (P-01442) . Students have until the 30 th school day to provide the appropriate documentation of immunization or a signed waiver. Starting on the 31st school day, noncompliant students in kindergarten through grade 5 must be excluded for up to 10 consecutive school days if one of the following is true about the school : The school is a public school and the school district's compliance level from the previous school year was less than 99 .00%. The school is a private school and the school's compliance level from the previous school year was less than 99.00 %. Exclusion is optional for g rades 6 through 12. Exclusion is optional for schools that met the 99.00 % compliance level in the previous year. STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS Kindergarten: Kindergarten is typically for children ages 5 to 6 and is the grade prior to grade 1. On the School Report to Local Health Department form, F-04002 , results for kindergarten students are reported separately (in left column ) and again combined with all students (in right column) to assess compliance specifically among children at the age of school entry into Kindergarten . Kindergarten is considered the first year of school even if the student attended a pre-K class. 4K Kindergarten, 3K Kindergarten, Early Childhood: The vaccine requirements of the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law are not grade- specific for children enrolled in 4K kindergarten, 3K kindergarten, and early childhood programs. The law requires specific doses of vaccines for children ages 2 through 4. The vaccine requirements and timeline for when they are to be met should begin when the child enters school for the first time. Compliance information for these children should be included in the \"All students enrolled at this school \" section (Column B) of the School Report to the L ocal Health Department form, F-04002 . Exclusion of noncompliant students in 4K, 3K , and early childhood programs is optional. Children 5 years of age and older attending a Pre- K class should be assessed using the requirements for kindergarten through g rade 5. Page 3 of 9 School Assessment vs. Child C are Assessment : The school assessment measures compliance with the Wisconsin Student I mmunization Law among children enrolled in school, including children enrolled in early childhood, 3K , and 4K programs, and kindergarten through grade 12. Students enrolled in early childhood, 3K , or 4K programs within a school should be reported on the School Report to Local Health Department form, F-04002 . The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law also requires that licensed Wisconsin child care centers assess and report the immunization status of children enrolled in licensed child care centers . The assessment of the immunization status of children enrolled in licensed child care centers is separate from th e assessment of children enrolled in school. If a licensed child care center is located in a school, the child care center will be assessed separately from the school by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services . The child care assessment is typically done in late winter or early spring through a separate, direct mailing. It is possible that some children will be assessed twice in the same school year: once as the student in a school and again as an attendee of a licensed child care . Charter Schools: The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law applies equally to all of the following: public schools, private schools, charter schools, and non- charter schools. Homeschooled Children: The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law does not cover homeschooled children unless they enroll in any class or grade in a Wisconsin public or private school. If the child is enrolled for the first time, he or she should be handled li ke any other first -time enrollee and allowed to be \"in process\" if all vaccines have not already been administered. If that child leaves the Wisconsin school and later re- enrolls, that child would be considered \"behind schedule\" if all required vaccines have not been administered. \"Off-campus\" Students: For the purpose of this immunization assessment, s tudents who are officially enrolled in a school but spend time away from that school should be counted in the school where they are officially enrolled. This would include students in group educational settings and alternative school s, or students who take one class at the high school but are enrolled in middle school. Virtual or Online Schools : Wisconsin students who attend virtual or online schools only and do not attend any classes or participate in extracurricular activities at a brick -and-mortar school are not subject to the student immunization law. However, students who attend virtual or online schools , and also attend a brick -and-mortar school for coursework or extracurricular activities are considered admitted to the brick -and-mortar school and subject to the student immunization law requirements. IMMUNIZATION RECORDS Transfer Student Records: For students who transfer from one Wisconsin school to another, schools must transfer the record to the new school within 10 school days of the records request per Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7 DHS 144.07(7) . Foreign Exchange Students Page 4 of 9 Foreign Exchange students need to meet the same i mmunization requirements as any other student when entering into a public or private school . If possible, s chools should provide the Student Immunization Law Age/Grade Requirements, P- 44021 , and the Student Immunization Record form, F-04020L , prior to the student's arrival in Wisconsin. Immunization Record s: Written evidence of immunization can be supplied on either the Student Immunization Record form, F-04020L , or an electronic immunization record, such as a printout from the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) . Parents who choose to waive an immunization are required to sign a waiver on the Student Immunization Record form, F- 04020L, an d list the dates (month, day, year) of all of the vaccines the child has received. Alternatively, if F-04020L is not used, the parent should provide documentation of all of the vaccines received, the dates (month, day, year) the vaccines were received, the specific vaccines that are being waived, the type of waiver, the date of the waiver, and the parent name and signature. Immunization Records Retention: The Student Immunization Record form, F-04020L is part of a student's progress record and, as such, should be maintained for at least five years after the student ceases to be enrolled at the school per Wis. Stat. \u00a7 118.125(3) . WIR Records \u2014Hea lth Care Provider vs. School: The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law requires students to have a minimum number of doses of vaccine. For some vaccines, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ), the committee that makes recommendations for vaccine use in the United States , recommends that children receive more doses than are required by the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law. The school WIR record may indicate that a student is compliant with the law ; however, that same student may need further immunizations based on the WIR record of the student's health care provider, which follows the ACIP recommendations. If a parent asks about further recommended immunizations for their children, they should be referred to their health care provider. A \"refusal of [vaccine name]\" documented in the WIR does not constitute a valid waiver. The school is responsible for obtaining waiver d ocumentation. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act : The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a f ederal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. If you have questions about releasing information, contact your school's legal counsel. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent to release any information from a student's education record (including immunization information) . However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, under certain conditions, including to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena, and to appropriate officials in the event of health and safety emergencies. The following describes the circumstances under which student immunization information can be released to local health departments, district attorneys , and WIR. Released to local health departments : Page 5 of 9 Should the local health department determine that there is a health emergency (i.e., an outbreak of a vaccine- preventable disease) at a school, the local health department may request the names and contact information of students who are not protected from the disease (i.e., students not fully vaccinated agains t the disease) from the school . This determination should inform the school's decision whether a disclosure of the requested information is necessary to protect the health or safety of one or more students or others, consistent with federal law. However, for ensuring compliance only , schools may not share names of noncompliant students with the local health department unless the parent has provided signed consent. Released to district attorneys : If your school is in a jurisdiction where a court order has been issued for schools to provide names of noncompliant students to the county d istrict attorney's office, this disclosure is allowed under FERPA (to comply with the judicial order .) Released to WIR : Schools may not share student immunization information with WIR or with health care providers unless the parent provided signed consent . T he parent signature portion of the Student Immunization Record form, F-04020L , includes a checkbox where parents can give permission for schools to share the student's immunization information with WIR. Schools are encouraged to use this form for all new and transferring students. For existing students, s chools may use the Student Immunization Record form , F-04020L , to obtain consent to release immunization information, or the school may choose to develop some other form to obtain consent for the release. Waivers: The Wisconsin student immunization requirements can be waived for personal conviction, religious , or medical/health reasons. Children for whom waivers are filed are compliant with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law ; however, these children may be subject to exclusion from school in the event of an outbreak of a disease against which they are not completely immunized. Parents who choose to waive an immunization are required to sign a waiver on the Student Immunization Record form, F-04020L , and list the dates (month, day, year) of all of the vaccines the child has already received. Alternatively, if F-04020L is not used, the parent should provide documentation of all of the vaccines received, the dates (month, day, year) the vaccines were received, the vaccines that are being waived, the type of waiver, the date of the waiver, and the parent name and signature. The school is responsible for obtaining waiver documentation. A \"refusal of [vaccine name]\" documented in WIR does not constitute a valid waiver. A history of chickenpox is not a waiver but does exempt a student from the varicella vaccine requirement. Every year schools should review all student waivers for accuracy. Those students' immunization records can be checked in WIR to determine if the student has received the vaccine and therefore the waiver status is no longer necessary. Page 6 of 9 New Vaccines and Waivers: If a waiver is chosen, it applies to a vaccine(s) required at the time a student enrolls into a Wisconsin school for the first time (e.g., a student entering kindergarten or a student transferring from an out -of-state school). Any new vaccines or new dose of an existing vaccine required after enrollment in the Wisconsin school would require a separate waiver for that vaccine. VACCINES AND IMMUNIZATIONS Required Vaccines DT Diphtheria and tetanus vaccine (pediatric) Td Tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (for ages 7 years or older) Tdap Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (adolescents) DTaP Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (pediatric) DTP Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine (no longer available) Hep B Hepatitis B vaccine MMR Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine Polio Polio vaccine Var Varicella (chickenpox vaccine) Vaccine Trade Names: A health care provider might administer a vaccine and provide the parent with a note listing only the vaccine trade name rather than listing the specific type of vaccine received. The following list of commonly used vaccines and their manufacturer trade names is provided to help you determine which vaccines were received. U.S Vaccines Vaccine Trade Name Abbreviation Manufacturer -T) Sanofi GlaxoSmithKline Page 7 of 9 Diphtheria Tenivac\u00ae (Generic) Td Td Doses: Vaccines in a series (when more than one dose is required) are most effective when the doses are administered according to recommended time intervals. However, the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law does not require that vaccines are received at specific time intervals. Therefore, the number of doses received, including those that were received at inappropriate time intervals , can be counted toward compliance with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law. In WIR , doses received at inappropriate time intervals are marked as \"not valid.\" These doses can be counted towards meeting the minimum required doses. The only exceptions to this are as follows. T he first doses of MMR and Varicella vaccine , respectively, must be administered on or after the first birthday ; a second dose of MMR and Varicella vaccines shall be received no sooner than 4 weeks (28 days) after the first dose; one dose of Page 8 of 9 DTaP/DT vaccine should be given on or after the fourth birthday for children entering 5K Kindergarten. Four -day Grace Period: The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law allows a four -day grace period for certain required age- dependent vaccines. The four -day grace period means a student is compliant with the immunization law if the dose of each of these vaccines was received four days or less before the date it was required. See footnotes 2, 3, 5, and 7 on the table describing \"Student Immunization Law Age/Grade Requirements ,\" P-44021 , for descriptions of which vaccines and doses this applies to. DTaP/DTP/DT Vaccine After 4 Y ears of A ge: The Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 144 requires that at least one dose (either the 3 rd, 4th, or 5th dose) of DT aP/DTP/DT is to be received after the 4th birthday. The purpose of this required (and recommended) dose is to boost the level of protection primarily against pertussis (whooping cough .) If the third dose of DT aP/DTP/DT is received after the child's 4th birthday, a fourth dose is not required. Polio Vaccine, Four Doses Required: ACIP recommends a fifth dose of polio vaccine for children who received their fourth dose before their 4th birthday. The Wisconsin Student Immunization Law requires four doses only ; a fifth dose is not required. Children who received their third dose of polio vaccine after their 4th birthday are also compliant with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law . Hepatitis B Vaccine, Two-dose Series: An exception was made in Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 144 for students who receive two doses of a licensed, two-dose hepatitis B vaccine formulation. These students are not required to receive a third dose. The two- dose hepatitis B vaccine is licensed only for children ages 11 through 15 and is given four to six months apart. If the first dose was received by the 30 th school day, the second would be required by the 30th school day of the following school year. This formulation is rarely used at this time. Varicella Vaccine Exemption: All students in kindergarten through grade 12 are required to have two doses of varicella vaccine. Students with a history of chickenpox disease are exempt from the varicella vaccine requirement. If a student received the first dose of varicella vaccine and subsequently developed chickenpox ( \"break through disease\" ,) or if the student has been diagnosed with shingles, the second dose of varicella vaccine is not required. The student's history of having had the disease or laboratory evidence of immunity should be noted on the Student Immunization Record. If the student has been diagnosed with shingles, a history of chickenpox can be noted on the Student Immunization Record since a person cannot develop shingles unless they previously had chickenpox. Tdap Vaccine Exception: Please note that one dose of Tdap vaccine is currently recommended for adolescents and adults. The school requirement for students in g rades 7 through 12 is one dose of Tdap. An exception is made for students who already received a tetanus -containing vaccine, such as Td, TT (tetanus toxoid) , or DTaP, within five years (i.e., a total of five full years) before entering the grade where Tdap is required. These students are compliant with the Tdap requirement, and no further doses are required. For example, if a child received a dose of Td vaccine because of an injury within five years before entering grade 7, that child has met the Tdap requirement (even though s/he has not actually received Tdap vaccine. ) Although , in these circumstances , Tdap is not required for school entry, Tdap Page 9 of 9 vaccination is recommended to boost the student's immunity to pertussis . Pertussis is common among adolescents and other school -aged children , and can result in significant illness for the student, the student's family (especially infants less than 12 months old, ) and can result in many missed days of school and/or work for the student and parent. Division of Public Health P-01438 ( 07/2023) STUDENT IMMUNIZATION LAW AGE/GRADE REQUIREMENTS The following are the minimum required immunizations for each age and grade level according to the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law. These requirements can be wa ived for health, religious, or personal conviction reasons. Additional immunizations may be recommended for your child depending on his or her age.

Children > 5 years of age who are enrolled in a p re-K class should be assessed using the immunization requirements for K through g rade 6 which would normally correspond to the individual's age. 2. D= diphtheria, T= tetanus, P= pertussis vaccine. DTaP/DTP/DT/Td vaccine for all students p re-K through g rade 12: Four doses are required. However, if a student received the third dose after the 4th birthday, further doses are not required. (Note: a dose four days or less before the 4th birthday is also acceptable). 3. DTaP/DTP/DT vaccine for children entering kindergarten: Each student must have received one dose after the 4th birthday (either the third , fourth , or fifth dose) to be compliant. (Note: a dose four days or less before the 4th birthday is also acceptable). 4. Tdap is an adolescent tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine. If a student received a dose of a tetanus - containing vaccine, such as Td, within five years before entering the grade in which Tdap is required, the student is compliant and a dose of Tdap vaccine is not required. School s with only grades 6 and below, enter zeros in these cells. 5. Polio vaccine for students entering k indergarten through grade 12: Four doses are required. However, if a student received the third dose after the 4th birthday, further doses are not required. (Note: a dose four days or less before the 4th birthday is also acceptable). 6. Laboratory evidence of immunity to hepatitis B is also acceptable. 7. MMR is a measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. The first dose of MMR vaccine must have been received on or after the 1st birthday (Note: a dose four days or less before the 1st birthday is also acceptable). Laboratory evidence of immunity to all three diseases (measles , mumps , and rubella) is also acceptable. 8. Varicella vacci ne is chickenpox vaccine. Students who have a reliable history of varicella disease are not required to receive the Varicella vaccine. A parent or guardian may document a reliable history of varicella disease by indicating that the student has had varicella and signing the Student Immunization Form (DHS Form 04020L). F-04002 (0 8/2023) Page 5 of 5 5 Section B Cont'd: Compliance Definitions Meets Minimum Requirements A student is considered meets minimum requirements if the student has a record containing the dates (month/day/year) of immunizations for every dose of vaccine required for their grade level. For students in \"ungraded\" programs (such as pre-k), use the requirement for the traditional age- appropriate grade. A student that has an immunization waiver (health, religious, or personal conviction) should not be counted in this category. In Process A student is considered in process if the student is enrolling for the first time in a Wisconsin school (for example, pre-k, kindergarten, out -of-state transfers, and homeschooled children) and is working towards meeting the vaccine dose requirement. in process may also apply to an existin g student with a new vaccine requirement. To be considered i n process, the student must provide the immunization dates demonstrating receipt of the first doses of required vaccines within 30 school days of admission. A student cannot be considered i n proce ss if the missing vaccine is a single- dose vaccine requirement ( that is , Tdap); this student would be behind schedule . Behind Schedule A student is considered behind schedule if the student has an immunization record , and all the following conditions are met: The student is not m eets minimum requirements with vaccine The student is not in process The student does not have a waiver for the vaccine. Because the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law applies to all public and private schools, a transfer student from any school within the state who is b ehind schedule enters the new school as b ehind schedule and not in process . Waivers: Health, Religious, or Personal Conviction There are three types of waivers : health , religious , and personal conviction . A student may have a waiver for one or more vaccines. Further, a student may have more than one type of waiver (for example, a health waiver for DTaP and a religious waiver for MMR). However, a student should have only one waiver reported per vaccine. If a parent selects more than one waiver for one or all vaccines, please select one waiver to report using the following guidance: health waivers take precedence over religious and personal conviction waivers; religious waivers take precedence over personal conviction waivers. Children for whom waivers are filed are compliant with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law. However, they should not be counted in the m eets m inimum category and may be subject to exclusion from school in the event of an outbreak of disease(s) against which they are not completely immunized. No Record A student is considered to have no record if the student falls into one of the following categor ies: The student does not have an immunization record on file The student is a transfer student and the record has not yet been received from the previous school The student has a record, but the record has inappropriate information, such as \"all vaccines received,\" \"child up to date,\" or \"record at doctor's office.\" No Immunizations A student is counted in this section if he or she received no doses of immunizations and he or she has a waiver for all vaccines.

We encourage you to continue to make vaccination appointments and take your child to these appointments in order to ensure that your child becomes up- to-date with vaccinations for his/her age. Vaccinations are one of the most important methods of protecting our children from diseases and the complications that can occur from these diseases. Vaccinations are especially important for school-aged children because children in school are regularly in close contact with others who may or may not be protected from these diseases. In order to remain in compliance with the Wisconsin Student Immunization Law, please contact your child's health care provider to receive needed vaccinations . Encourage your child's health care provider to use the Wisconsin Immunization Registry and any vaccination records you have for your child to determine which vaccines your child needs to receive. If your child does not have a health care provider, please contact your local health department to determine if your child is eligible to receive vaccinations at the health department.

This means that your child did not have documentation of appropriate vaccination and did not have a vaccination waiver on file. Vaccinations are one of the most important methods of protecting our children from diseases and the complications that can occur from these diseases. Vaccinations are especially important for school-aged children because children in school are regularly in close contact with others who may or may not be protected from these diseases. In the coming months, we encourage you to make an appointment with your child's health care provider to get your child vaccinated. Encourage your child's health care provider to use the Wisconsin Immunization Registry and any vaccination records you have for your child to determine which vaccines your child needs. If your child does not have a health care provider, please contact your local health department to determine if your child is eligible to receive vaccinations at the health department.
