It is fundedfrom a private endowment, which is managedwith long-term stability and growth in mind. Its mission is to foster and promote research with the aim of improving human and animalhealth. Its work covers four areas: Knowledge - improving our understanding of human and animal biology in health anddisease, and of the past and present role ofmedicine in society. Resources - providing exceptional researchers with the infrastructural and careersupport they need to full their potential. Translation - ensuring maximum health benets are gained from biomedical research. Public engagement - raising awareness of the medical, ethical and social implications of biomedical science.Annual Review 2001 The Wellcome Trust Annual Review 1 October 2000 - 30 September 2001Contents One of the great strengths of the Wellcome Trust is its diversity.In any one day at the Trust, we candiscuss issues as diverse as genomesequencing, clinical medicine,interactive science centres and an18th-century Ottoman manuscriptbeing acquired by the WellcomeLibrary.This breadth of interestgives us the chance to invest notonly in stages in the scienticprocess - from 'blue skies' researchthrough to the development ofnew therapeutics that can be takenforward to the market - but also in activities that explore the socialand cultural implications ofscientic research. I use the word invest rather than funding, because I feel it reflects ouractivities more accurately.Throughinvestment in infrastructure, we areputting in place the laboratoriesand equipment our scientists need.Through our personal supportschemes, we are investing inresearchers at all stages of theircareers. And by investing in researchitself, we are laying the foundationsof knowledge that will underpindiscoveries of the future. Continued investment is essential to make use of discoveries and,in this day and age, such investmenton a large scale is essential to driveresearch forward. In 2000/01 , the Trust awarded grants worth nearly \u00a3400 million, backed a new ve- year research programme at theWellcome Trust Sanger Institutewith \u00a3300 million, and launched a new \u00a365million programme in the Health Consequences of PopulationChange, to name just a few examplesthat you will nd described in thisyear's Annual Review . That such investment will bring improvements in healthcare I haveno doubt. But to bring about suchimprovements the Trust must workin close partnership with otherfunding agencies and institutions.Take, for example, the ve new Wellcome Trust Clinical ResearchFacilities, the rst of which openedin Edinburgh in June 2001.These new centres of patient-orientedresearch have come about througha close working relationshipbetween the Trust, the Departmentof Health, the NHS and universities. In other areas,Trust research canbest be taken forward by otherfunders.Take, for example, a newinitiative to control malaria inThailand.The Trust's South-EastAsia unit has developed a newcombination of drugs that cancontrol malaria, and this newtreatment is now being expandedto a large region with a US$4.7 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. A wider perspective In his Nobel address in 1953, Dr Fritz Lipmann described scientiststhus:\"Their purpose often may be none but just to push back the limits of our comprehension.Their ndings mostly have to beexpressed in a scientic languagethat is understood only by a few.We feel nonetheless that the driveand urge to explore nature in all itsfacets is one of the most importantfunctions of humanity.\" Fifty years on from Fritz Lipmann's speech, scientists bring us ever morefascinating insights into the workingsof nature. But more effort must be made to make such discoveriesaccessible and understandable.While major breakthroughs such as the human genome sequencereceived widespread media coverageand explanation, many otheraspects of science remain couchedin a jargonistic language peculiar tothe scientic process. By openingup science to a wider audience -and publications such as our ownWellcome News and the interactive exhibitions at science centresacross the country are just two ofthe ways in which the Trust worksto do so - science can becomepart of society's consciousness.For science should not be conned to ivory towers; it should be anessential part of the culture of thecountry, with everybody able totake an interest in new scienticand medical advances. Is such adream achievable? I would arguethat it has to be, and we have tostrive to make it so. It is essentialthat people feel able to voice anopinion, debate the implications ofnew advances, and feel proud ofthe achievements of scientists whopush back the limits of ourcomprehension.

Here, we present a brief overview of this framework and describe on thefollowing pages how the Trust's activities in the past year are working towards the key aims and objectives of the Trust.7 6 Review of activities The Trust awarded \u00a3388 million of grants in 2000/01 :\u00a3375 million for the support of biomedicalscience and \u00a313million for the Medicine, Society and Historyprogrammes.T otal funding was \u00a3443 million; this includes \u00a355million to subsidiaries such as GenomeResearch Limited (which is awardedthe grants for the Wellcome TrustSanger Institute) and Hinxton HallLimited. Figure 1 shows this year's grants expenditure compared toprevious years (the markedincrease in 1999/2000 was due to the signicant funding throughthe Joint Infrastructure Fund in that year) and Figure 2 shows the breakdown of funding. The Trust received 3893 grant applications in 2000/01 , and 2090 awards were made; Figure 3 shows the award rates.The level of outstanding commitments hasincreased to more than \u00a31billion, as shown in Figure 4 .The graph shows that there is signicant timeThe Trust's investment portfolio During the past 12months, the business and nancialenvironment has proved to beextremely challenging for the Trust's investment portfolio.The threat of world recession,and the terrible human tragedysurrounding the terrorist attacks in the USA have all served to heighten global business andeconomic uncertainty. Nevertheless, the diversity of the Trust's asset base has served to mitigate the worst of the falls in markets, so that neither the day-to-day operation nor the long-term mission of the Trust has been adversely affected. The value of the Trust's portfolio fell from \u00a315billion in September 2000 to just over \u00a312billion by September 2001.While it is disappointing to record thisreduction, the performance of the Trust's portfolio continues to compare favourably against itsown special benchmark and otherinvestment peer groups. Despitethis decline in market value, theinvestment portfolio has stillsupported increased payments of grants committed this year,as shown in Figure 4 .The Trust's investment asset values for the pastve years are shown in Figure 6 , while Figure 7 shows the portfolio by investment classication.lag between a grant award and the subsequent claims for funds by the institutions. Expenditure on the direct activities of the Trust (which include theWellcome Trust Genome Campusand the Wellcome Library) in 2000/01 was approximately \u00a370million, although expenditure at the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute in the rst half of the year was lower than anticipated as sequencing was interrupted for a month. During the year,the Governors agreed to provide \u00a3300 million of funding to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Instituteover the next ve years. The total amount of resources expended during the year by theTrust was \u00a3544 million.The Trust's charitable and other expenditure isanalysed in Figure 5 as a percentage of total resources expended.1997 222 212 1998 354 1999 2000 480 388 2001 5441997 187 5691998 203 7221999 201 9792000 223 10932001 27410.4 1997 10.2 1998 11.7 1999 15.0 2000 12.1 2001Figure 1 Grants awarded (\u00a3m) Figure 5 Resources expended % Grants awarded 72 Direct activities 13 Support and administration costs 8 Investment costs 7 T otal: \u00a3544 millionGrants paid Outstanding grant commitmentsFigure 4 Grants paid and outstanding (\u00a3m) Figure 6 Investment assets (\u00a3b) Figure 2 Breakdown of grants awarded 2000/01 * \u00a3million 63.7 International 46.3 Medicine, Society and History 12.8 Buildings and equipment (other than JIF) 9.1 Other schemes 6.6 Salary supplements minus grants no longer required 19.6 T otal: \u00a3443 millionFigure 3 Award rates 98/99 99/00 00/01 36.539.0 39.346.2 40.7 Figure 7 Investment assets % UK equities 49 Overseas equities 23 Fixed interest securities 8 Unquoted investments 12 Investment property 8 T otal: \u00a312.1 billion (end September 2001)Grants awarded, paid and outstandingGrants awarded in the year ( Figure 1 ) represent the total funds committed to successful applications during theTrust's nancial year.

The Human Genome Project'slandmark sequencing paper waspublished alongside numberof other papers analysing orcommenting on the sequencingdata. Funded by the WellcomeTrust, scientists at the WellcomeTrust Sanger Institute contributedone-third of the total humansequence data. The ten-year Human Genome Project is an internationalcollaboration, involving 20research groups from six countries.All genome sequence produced by the project is released immediately,with free and unrestricted accessto researchers from academia and industry. The scientic papers report the analysis of the 'draft sequence' ofthe human genome, a milestonereached and announced - to well-deserved fanfare - by the collaborators in June 2000. The draft sequence covers 90per cent of the 3.2gigabase human genome, at 99.9per the 'gold standard' nal sequence,full coverage at 99.99 per cent accuracy, is scheduled forcompletion in 2003.The human genome sequence threw up a number of surprisingndings, including the relativelysmall number of genes it appearsto contain - somewhere between 30 000 and 40 000 .This compares with 6000 for a yeast cell, 13 000 for a fly, 18 000 for a worm and 26 000 for a plant.

The Human Genome Project'slandmark sequencing paper waspublished alongside numberof other papers analysing orcommenting on the sequencingdata. Funded by the WellcomeTrust, scientists at the WellcomeTrust Sanger Institute contributedone-third of the total humansequence data. The ten-year Human Genome Project is an internationalcollaboration, involving 20research groups from six countries.All genome sequence produced by the project is released immediately,with free and unrestricted accessto researchers from academia and industry. The scientic papers report the analysis of the 'draft sequence' ofthe human genome, a milestonereached and announced - to well-deserved fanfare - by the collaborators in June 2000. The draft sequence covers 90per cent of the 3.2gigabase human genome, at 99.9per the 'gold standard' nal sequence,full coverage at 99.99 per cent accuracy, is scheduled forcompletion in 2003.The human genome sequence threw up a number of surprisingndings, including the relativelysmall number of genes it appearsto contain - somewhere between 30 000 and 40 000 .This compares with 6000 for a yeast cell, 13 000 for a fly, 18 000 for a worm and 26 000 for a plant.

An individual's risk from ultraviolet radiation ( UVR)is largely determined by his or her geneticallydetermined 'skin type' - whetherthey burn or tan in response torepeated exposure to UVR. With a Wellcome Trust projectgrant, Professor Jonathan Rees and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh are investigating the relationship between themelanocortin 1 receptor gene -often called the 'red hair gene' -and the pigment in skin and hair.They also aim to understand thetanning process - the increase inpigment that occurs with repeatedexposure to UVR. Understanding human pigmentation and the skin's response to UVR is of major clinical and biologicalinterest. Ultraviolet radiation is used increasingly as a therapy for commonskin diseases such as psoriasis,eczema and vitiligo, and ProfessorRees's study will help improve thistreatment.Y et dosing and treatmentregimes remain empirical with littlebiological understanding of the large variation in sensitivity to UVR between people. Although skin is remarkably resilient, constant exposure to chemicalsand UVR from the outside worldcan lead to the development ofcancers.That tumours are kept atbay most of the time is testamentto skin-dwelling T cells, whose roleas andcolleagues at Guy's, King's and StThomas' Medical School, London. The T cells in the skin, close relatives of the T cells that circulate in the blood and lymphready to respond to infections,make a protein called NKG2 d, which can focus in on a target calledRae-1.This protein is produced onthe surface of skin cells that havebegun the transformation intocancer cells but is not produced by normal skin. Once the T cells' NKG2 d protein has engaged with Rae-1, the T cell can kill the tumour cell.14 Beyond blood Responsive funding The UK funding schemes are theprimary route by which the Trustsupports the UK biomedical researchbase, through its response-mode projectand programme grant schemes andother awards.Applications are handledin topic areas and are considered by one of the Trust's four UK fundingPanels - Infection and Immunity,Molecular and Cell, Neurosciences,and Physiology and Pharmacology. See page 48.On the surface Within the bone marrow are blood cell factories, constantlychurning out the nine differenttypes of blood cell.These factories- the blood stem cells - are thesubject of intense researchworldwide, not only because oftheir known clinical importance to major blood diseases such asthalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia,but also because they could possiblyone day be used to repair bodytissues damaged by age, traumaand disease.Two studies funded by the Wellcome Trust during theyear aim to discover whetherblood stem cells can produce verydifferent cell types - liver cells andnerve cells - that make up the body,and which could therefore providereplacements for damaged tissues. At Imperial College School of Medicine, London, Dr MalcolmAlison is investigating cell therapy for the treatment of liver diseases.The liver can be damaged by viruses,such as hepatitis B, drugs or toxins.He has shown that bone marrowcontains cells that can produce livercells, and is now going on toinvestigate how to graft the cells intothe liver and help them differentiateinto hepatocytes - strategies thatcould help support or repair afailing or damaged liver. At the University of Durham, Dr Stefan Przyborski is investigatinga controversial yet exciting possibility- that cells in the bone marrowmight be able to differentiate intonerve cells. He aims to identify thegrowth conditions that could induceneural development, and then test whether these cells have thefunctional and electrophysiologicalcharacteristics of neurons.If successful, his study could helplead to the development oftreatments for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

The T cells in the skin, close relatives of the T cells that circulate in the blood and lymphready to respond to infections,make a protein called NKG2 d, which can focus in on a target calledRae-1.This protein is produced onthe surface of skin cells that havebegun the transformation intocancer cells but is not produced by normal skin. Once the T cells' NKG2 d protein has engaged with Rae-1, the T cell can kill the tumour cell.14 Beyond blood Responsive funding The UK funding schemes are theprimary route by which the Trustsupports the UK biomedical researchbase, through its response-mode projectand programme grant schemes andother awards.Applications are handledin topic areas and are considered by one of the Trust's four UK fundingPanels - Infection and Immunity,Molecular and Cell, Neurosciences,and Physiology and Pharmacology. See page 48.On the surface Within the bone marrow are blood cell factories, constantlychurning out the nine differenttypes of blood cell.These factories- the blood stem cells - are thesubject of intense researchworldwide, not only because oftheir known clinical importance to major blood diseases such asthalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia,but also because they could possiblyone day be used to repair bodytissues damaged by age, traumaand disease.Two studies funded by the Wellcome Trust during theyear aim to discover whetherblood stem cells can produce verydifferent cell types - liver cells andnerve cells - that make up the body,and which could therefore providereplacements for damaged tissues. At Imperial College School of Medicine, London, Dr MalcolmAlison is investigating cell therapy for the treatment of liver diseases.The liver can be damaged by viruses,such as hepatitis B, drugs or toxins.He has shown that bone marrowcontains cells that can produce livercells, and is now going on toinvestigate how to graft the cells intothe liver and help them differentiateinto hepatocytes - strategies thatcould help support or repair afailing or damaged liver. At the University of Durham, Dr Stefan Przyborski is investigatinga controversial yet exciting possibility- that cells in the bone marrowmight be able to differentiate intonerve cells. He aims to identify thegrowth conditions that could induceneural development, and then test whether these cells have thefunctional and electrophysiologicalcharacteristics of neurons.If successful, his study could helplead to the development oftreatments for brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

Classical scholars recognized the capacity of music to heal or harmthrough its control of the passions.They believed the passions of themind were seated in the middlesoul - between the appetites and reason - and bound together body and mind. Disharmony of the passions led to disease,while harmonization restored the patient to health. In medieval times music continued to play a central role in medicine:musical literacy was essential tocourtly life (Henry VIII composedhis own pieces, for example) and was therefore an importantrequirement of physicians who depended on royal patrons. It wasalso a mark of scholarship.The studyof music was a compulsory part of the university arts degree thatwas required before taking thehigher medical degree. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the scientic and mathematicalqualities of music aided physicians'understanding of the mechanics of human biology. Doctors usedmusical notation to express thepulse and their knowledge ofmusical instruments to understandhow human bodily systemsworked. During the Enlightenment,music technologies helped scholarsdetermine the universal lawssupposedly governing physical and human nature. During the ve-year term of her University Award, Professor Goukwill explore the musical literacy of doctors in different Europeancountries in 1500,1600 and 1700. She will then compare the impact their musical knowledgehad on their social position,their explanations of the effect ofmusic on human nature, and theirunderstanding of the workings of the human body and psyche.A research team from the Wellcome Trust Centre for HumanGenetics in Oxford has identiedthe rst gene whose function is thought to be involved in thedevelopment of speech andlanguage in humans. The research team, led by Professor Anthony Monaco (right),a Trust Principal Research Fellow,and colleagues at the Institute of Child Health in London, led byProfessor Vargha-Khadem, found thegene by studying three generationsof a family affected by a rarelanguage impairment.

Although scientists have suspected that there must be a genetic basisto speech and language because itis universal, complex and acquiredalmost instinctively by children at ayoung age, this is the rst evidenceof a particular gene that has beenpinpointed as having a mutationleading to a language disorder. The mutation was found in a gene called SPCH1 (also called FOXP2 ), which the researchers suspect is atranscription factor - whose role is to modulate the activity of othergenes. Hence it is likely that SPCH1 cooperates with other genes andproteins during the development of children's speech and language. Speech and language disorders, which occur in autism and less well-known specic languageimpairment, are present in 4 per cent of the population.Professor Monaco is currentlyinvestigating whether SPCH1 is altered in these other conditions.Music and medicine Gene talking First gene involved in speech and language identied At the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford,Dr Jonathan Flint, a Wellcome TrustSenior Research Fellow in ClinicalScience, is investigating the geneticbasis of psychiatric disorders usingboth mice and humans. Finding thegenes influencing mouse behaviouris extremely difcult, as the genesthat contribute to variation in a behavioural trait are likely to have only small individual effects. The second area of work is to nd genes that influence susceptibilityto depression in people. Finding thesusceptibility genes for psychiatricdisorders is a demanding taskbecause the intensive interviewingnecessary for reliable diagnosis hasmade it very difcult to collect thelarge number of samples neededto detect relatively small geneticeffects. Dr Flint and colleagues areusing an alternative strategy:to map neuroticism - a personalitytrait that is a major geneticmediator of depression.

Despite profoundchanges in the political and socialclimate, the region continues toproduce many outstanding scientists -a number of whom have already beenfunded by the Trust through its collaborative grant schemes.International fellows The Wellcome Trust's International Senior Research Fellowship (ISRF)scheme was set up in 1984 to encourage the return of high- quality scientists who are currentlyworking abroad and to provide anincentive for leading scientists toremain committed to their homeresearch base. Launched in Australia and New Zealand, the scheme has broughtback a cadre of excellent scientiststo the region, and has helped toinvigorate the biomedical researchenvironment.The high calibre ofthese scientists is reflected in thefact that over 25per cent of awards in the Howard Hughes Initiative inInfectious and Parasitic Disease wentto Australia, and one-third of thesewere to Trust-funded scientists. In the light of these developments, the Trust has decided that it is timelyto evaluate and refocus the Trust'sactivities, and the ISRFscheme in Australia and New Zealand isbeing brought to a close at the end of the 2001/02 funding year. The Trust is now considering newforms of support in the region. In 1992, the ISRFscheme was extended to South Africa and in 1998 to India.There are currently eight Senior Research Fellows inSouth Africa and 20in India, studying a diverse range of topicsthat include infectious diseases,porphyria, protein structure andneuroscience.Common diseases such as asthma, diabetes and obesity are thought tobe caused by a number of geneticand environmental factors.

The new laboratories will enable over 150scientists in the University's anatomy, biochemistry,pharmacology and physiologydepartments to collaborate moreeffectively in research into thecommunication or 'signalling'within and between cells at themolecular level. The development was made possible by a refurbishment grantfrom the Joint Infrastructure Fund.The University also put in over \u00a31million from its own resources. The successor to the Joint Infrastructure Fund, the ScienceResearch Investment Fund, has also made a major award to Bristol:part funding for an \u00a318million project to build state-of-the-artfacilities for the University's ResearchCentre for Neuroendocrinology. Research in the new laboratories,led by Professor Stafford Lightman,will provide radical approaches to the treatment of stress-relateddisorders, hormonal and psychiatricdisease, and Alzheimer's disease. Through the Science Research Investment Fund, the WellcomeTrust awarded over \u00a38million for the project, and the Universityhas committed a further \u00a310million from its own resources. The laboratories will be housed in purpose-built premises adjacentto the Bristol Royal Inrmary,called the Dorothy HodgkinBuilding after the University's NobelPrize-winning fth Chancellor. The University of Bristol already has an international reputation inthe eld of neuroendocrinology,but its scientists are working incramped conditions and arescattered across a number ofbuildings that offer no scope forexpansion.The new developmentwill allow research teams to join forces on a single site with the space they need and sharedfacilities of a high standard.Work on the ve-storey building is expected to be completed byMarch 2003.New labs for Bristol Joint Infrastructure Fund The \u00a3750 million Joint InfrastructureFund (JIF), to which the Wellcome Trustcontributed \u00a3300 million, completed its nal rounds of funding in 2001.In all, 25 institutions received fundingfrom the Wellcome Trust through JIF.The smallest award was for just under\u00a31 million, the largest project \u00a358 million (\u00a330 million from JIF coffers).Wellcome Trust funds supportedsignicant buildings - in excess of \u00a318 million - in Birmingham, Cambridge and Shefeld.

The successor to the Joint Infrastructure Fund, the ScienceResearch Investment Fund, has also made a major award to Bristol:part funding for an \u00a318million project to build state-of-the-artfacilities for the University's ResearchCentre for Neuroendocrinology. Research in the new laboratories,led by Professor Stafford Lightman,will provide radical approaches to the treatment of stress-relateddisorders, hormonal and psychiatricdisease, and Alzheimer's disease. Through the Science Research Investment Fund, the WellcomeTrust awarded over \u00a38million for the project, and the Universityhas committed a further \u00a310million from its own resources. The laboratories will be housed in purpose-built premises adjacentto the Bristol Royal Inrmary,called the Dorothy HodgkinBuilding after the University's NobelPrize-winning fth Chancellor. The University of Bristol already has an international reputation inthe eld of neuroendocrinology,but its scientists are working incramped conditions and arescattered across a number ofbuildings that offer no scope forexpansion.The new developmentwill allow research teams to join forces on a single site with the space they need and sharedfacilities of a high standard.Work on the ve-storey building is expected to be completed byMarch 2003.New labs for Bristol Joint Infrastructure Fund The \u00a3750 million Joint InfrastructureFund (JIF), to which the Wellcome Trustcontributed \u00a3300 million, completed its nal rounds of funding in 2001.In all, 25 institutions received fundingfrom the Wellcome Trust through JIF.The smallest award was for just under\u00a31 million, the largest project \u00a358 million (\u00a330 million from JIF coffers).Wellcome Trust funds supportedsignicant buildings - in excess of \u00a318 million - in Birmingham, Cambridge and Shefeld. Science Research Investment Fund The \u00a31.1 billion Science ResearchInvestment Fund (SRIF), to which theWellcome Trust has contributed \u00a3225 million, was established toprovide further infrastructure funding;\u00a3150 million of the Trust's contributionwas allocated to support highly rankedbut unfunded applications to JIF,particularly those that aimed to improve otherwise poor working conditions. Career Development The Wellcome Trust's CareerDevelopment Programmes provideopportunities, through fellowships andscholarships, for promising scientists to develop into highly skilled andindependent research workers whomake important contributions to theadvance of biomedical knowledge. The portfolio of personal award schemes provides salary as well asresearch support for individuals at keystages of their research career fromthe early (PhD) through to senior(professorial) academic level. Separateportfolios of schemes exist for basicscientists, and for medical and dentalgraduates.Veterinary graduates areaccommodated in either portfolio,depending on the nature of theirresearch and clinical activity.

The facility is housed in a newthree-storey building and is jointlyfunded by the Wellcome Trust(with an initial \u00a34.7million grant for construction and equipmentcosts), the Chief Scientist Ofce (Scottish Executive), the University of Edinburgh, Lothian UniversityHospital NHS Trust and the Lothian Primary Care NHS Trust. Under the leadership of its Director, Professor Peter Hayes,the facility will act as a central site for patient-oriented researchwithin the Edinburgh area, andoffer a supportive environmentfor investigators developing theirresearch or undertaking trainingin clinical research.The Edinburgh facility has ve scientically themed core areas -for epidemiology and statistics,genetics, image analysis, integrativephysiology and mass spectrometry- as well as consulting and in-patient rooms, an intensive studiesroom, and a research ward.Research projects include studiesof the causes of bowel cancer;complications following livertransplantation; diabetes andinsulin sensitivity in obesity;the genetics and psychology of major mental illness; vascularmalfunction; whether aspirin canreduce the risk of future heartdisease, and cognitive decline. Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facilities In an \u00a318 million venture, the Wellcome T rust has funded the capital costs of ve new Clinical Research Facilities, partnerships between the Trust, the NHS and universityresearchers.These new centres will provide major sites for patient-oriented research,helping to ensure that advances in biomedical research feed through intoimprovements in healthcare. The Clinical Research Facilities are linked to local hospitals and biomedical research departments in universities, and have been kitted out with modern, state-of-the-artequipment. Patients will be studied in newly built or refurbished wards, consultationrooms, day clinics and laboratory facilities which are dedicated to clinical research. The Clinical Research Facilities have been set up in Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester and Southampton.

However, while oral rehydration solution correctsdehydration, it does not reduce thediarrhoea itself. It has thereforebeen assumed in some communitiesto be ineffective, which militatesagainst its widespread use. Between 1957 and 1990, the Trust funded an overseas unit based at the Christian Medical Collegeand Hospital in Vellore, India.One of its staff, Professor SiddarthaRamakrishna, is now pr incipal applicant on a trilateral programme, funded through the WellcomeTrust-Burroughs Wellcome Fund Infectious Diseases Initiative,to improve oral rehydrationtherapy for diarrhoea.Professor Ramakrishna, Professor Henry Binder of Yale UniversitySchool of Medicine and ProfessorMichael Farthing of the Universityof Glasgow Faculty of Medicine aretaking advantage of recent scienticadvances in the physiology of theintestine to try and overcome theperceived limitations of oralrehydration therapy. Professors Binder and Ramakrishna have discovered that short chainfatty acids stimulate fluid absorptionfrom parts of the colon, and thatresistant starch, a substrate for shortchain fatty acids, reduces diarrhoeaand shortens illness oralrehydration solutions are particularlyeffective in noncholera diarrhoea in children. The researchers will combine these two advances to create a new oral rehydration solution that bothrehydrates and reduces diarrhoea.They hope that the enhanced antidiarrhoea action of the newsolution will produce a moredirectly tangible effect for patientsand their carers, and thus provideboth a more effective - and amore acceptable - version of thislife-saving treatment.

It will be formally known asECSITE-UK, the Science and DiscoveryCentre Network, and will beadministered by the British Associationfor the Advancement of Science. www.ecsite-uk.net38 T wo major science centres in Glasgow and Birmingham openedin 2001, part of a network of science centres supported by the Wellcome Trust and otherfunders.The science centres arenot only bringing science to thepeople, but are also contributingto the economic regeneration of areas in these cities. The Glasgow Science Centre was ofcially opened by HM The Queen on 5 July 2001. Built on reclaimed dockland at Pacic Quayin the heart of Glasgow, an arealargely derelict since the 1960s, the site consists of three mainbuildings: the IMAX Theatre, the Science Mall, and the GlasgowT ower.All three are unique: therst two are the rst buildings in the UKand only the second in Europe to be clad in titanium,while the T ower is the only suchstructure in the world capable of revolving 360degrees from the ground up. Four floors househundreds of interactive exhibitson science and technology,aimed at entertaining and the andinnovation', and in Birmingham opened on 29September 2001. A combination of museum, sciencecentre and visitor attraction,Thinktank has ten themed galleriesset on four floors of purpose-builtspace. Exhibitions include 'Things About Me', which giveschildren the chance to nd outmore about how the human body works, and 'Medicine Matters',which explores the science behindmodern medicine and some of the ethical challenges it brings.The centre is part of MillenniumPoint, England's largest Millenniumproject outside London.

A meeting on Salmonella genome projects was held at Hinxton HallConference Centre in November 2000, as part of a series of Trust-funded pathogen genomemeetings, which provide a forum for the debate and dissemination ofresearch data and information relatedto pathogen genome sequencing. Physiology and Pharmacology The Physiology and PharmacologyPanel funded \u00a315.6 million of project and programme grants,including seven new programmegrants and one University Award. Grants awarded included three related to studies of the heart:Professor Charles McCollum at theUniversity of Manchester received a project grant to investigate thecauses of cardiovascular death in young people; Dr Douglas Coreldat Imperial College, London,received a project grant to examinethe interactions between respiratoryand cerebrovascular regulationduring sleep; and Professor MichaelMarber at St Thomas' Hospital,London, received a project grant to identify genes that protect theheart from ischaemia (damagecaused by lack of oxygen). Molecular and Cell The Molecular and Cell Panel awarded \u00a323.4 million of project and programme grants, includingten new programme grants. Four grants relating to the structural analysis of DNA and the interaction of proteins with DNA were awarded: Professor SimonPhillips at the University of Leedsreceived a programme grant tostudy the structure and function of proteins that recognize unusualbranched DNA structures; at the University of Bristol, ProfessorStephen Halford was awarded a programme grant to study therole of proteins in DNA looping; Professor Ernest Laue at theUniversity of Cambridge received a programme grant to carry outstructural studies of proteinsinvolved in the control of chromatinstructure; and Professor RobertLloyd at the University of Nottinghamwas awarded a project grant toinvestigate genome dynamics andthe interplay between DNA replication, transcription and repair.Showcase A review of the Showcase schemeindicated it had been successful insupporting innovative, high-riskprojects, the majority of which would not otherwise have receivedfunding, and therefore occupied aneglected niche in UKbiomedical science funding. An importantfeature of the scheme was that it enabled young postdoctoralresearchers to be principal grantholders. However, the use of peerreview slowed the decision-makingprocess, and the 18-month funding period for initial Showcase projectswas often insufcient to inv estigate novel concepts adequately. The scheme was relaunched for a further ve years in October 2001, with a few signicant changes: external peer review has beenremoved so that applicants shouldnow receive a decision within threemonths; and awards will be madefor two years, providing support of up to \u00a3125 Bioarchaeology Fellowship,and two University Awards were funded.Neurosciences The Neurosciences Panel awarded \u00a326.6 million of project and programme grants, including sevennew programme grants, and veUniversity Awards. A cluster of Neurosciences grants awarded focused on the cognitiveprocesses involved in variousneuropsychiatric conditions.

A meeting on Salmonella genome projects was held at Hinxton HallConference Centre in November 2000, as part of a series of Trust-funded pathogen genomemeetings, which provide a forum for the debate and dissemination ofresearch data and information relatedto pathogen genome sequencing. Physiology and Pharmacology The Physiology and PharmacologyPanel funded \u00a315.6 million of project and programme grants,including seven new programmegrants and one University Award. Grants awarded included three related to studies of the heart:Professor Charles McCollum at theUniversity of Manchester received a project grant to investigate thecauses of cardiovascular death in young people; Dr Douglas Coreldat Imperial College, London,received a project grant to examinethe interactions between respiratoryand cerebrovascular regulationduring sleep; and Professor MichaelMarber at St Thomas' Hospital,London, received a project grant to identify genes that protect theheart from ischaemia (damagecaused by lack of oxygen). Molecular and Cell The Molecular and Cell Panel awarded \u00a323.4 million of project and programme grants, includingten new programme grants. Four grants relating to the structural analysis of DNA and the interaction of proteins with DNA were awarded: Professor SimonPhillips at the University of Leedsreceived a programme grant tostudy the structure and function of proteins that recognize unusualbranched DNA structures; at the University of Bristol, ProfessorStephen Halford was awarded a programme grant to study therole of proteins in DNA looping; Professor Ernest Laue at theUniversity of Cambridge received a programme grant to carry outstructural studies of proteinsinvolved in the control of chromatinstructure; and Professor RobertLloyd at the University of Nottinghamwas awarded a project grant toinvestigate genome dynamics andthe interplay between DNA replication, transcription and repair.Showcase A review of the Showcase schemeindicated it had been successful insupporting innovative, high-riskprojects, the majority of which would not otherwise have receivedfunding, and therefore occupied aneglected niche in UKbiomedical science funding. An importantfeature of the scheme was that it enabled young postdoctoralresearchers to be principal grantholders. However, the use of peerreview slowed the decision-makingprocess, and the 18-month funding period for initial Showcase projectswas often insufcient to inv estigate novel concepts adequately. The scheme was relaunched for a further ve years in October 2001, with a few signicant changes: external peer review has beenremoved so that applicants shouldnow receive a decision within threemonths; and awards will be madefor two years, providing support of up to \u00a3125 Bioarchaeology Fellowship,and two University Awards were funded.Neurosciences The Neurosciences Panel awarded \u00a326.6 million of project and programme grants, including sevennew programme grants, and veUniversity Awards.

The work of the Africa Centre isunderpinned by a \u00a35million demographic study to understandthe structure and dynamics of thepopulation. See page 12.Functional Genomics The Functional Genomics Development Initiative's thematicprogrammes scheme - which aims to build multidisciplinarycollaborations in functional genomicstechnologies focusing on a singlebiological question - was launchedwith a budget of \u00a345million. From the 37preliminary applications considered in May 2001,11full applications were invited forconsideration in January 2002. It is expected that awards will be in the region of \u00a35million each. In June 2001, the Wellcome Trust announced core funding for the AvonLongitudinal Study of Parents andChildren ( ALSPAC ).See page 19. In 2000/01 the Functional Genomics Development Initiativecommitted \u00a312.6 million on grants, including funding for sevenbioinformatics grants and tenbiological collections grants. Centres In the light of the new WellcomeTrust Corporate Plan, published in December 2000, the Centres programme is being reviewed and no new applications are beingaccepted at this time.T o date,Centre status has been awarded to six research groupings: Wellcome Centre for MolecularParasitology at the University of Glasgow; Wellcome Trust Centre for CellBiology at the University of Edinburgh;Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research at the University of Manchester; Wellcome Trust-Cancer ResearchUK Institute of Cancer andDevelopmental Biology at theUniversity of Cambridge; Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics at theUniversity of Oxford; and Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine atUniversity College London. The Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology in Edinburgh was awarded full Centre status in October 2001, receiving core funding of \u00a33.4million for ve years.Three members of staff - Professors JeanBeggs, David T ollervey and AdrianBird - were also coapplicants on asuccessful JIFbid for the Edinburgh Protein Interaction Centre,to be based in the ChemistryDepartment (the principal applicantwas Professor Peter Sadler). Special initiatives In November 2000, the Wellcome Trust and the Juvenile DiabetesResearch Foundation International ( JDRF)provided a joint major award of \u00a320million, over ve years, to set up a new Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory at theUniversity of Cambr idge. Led by Professor John T odd, one of theworld's leading researchers on thegenetic causes of type 1 diabetes,the new laboratory is situated in the new Wellcome Trust- MRC Building, which was opened by HRH The Princess Royal on 30October 2000. The former Wellcome Trust Centre for Molecular Mechanisms in Diseaseat the University of Cambridgebecame a 'Strategic Initiative inClinical Sciences' and gained fundingfor a further ve years. JIF/SRIF The fourth and fth rounds of the \u00a3750 million Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF)were completed, bringing the initiative to a close.The WellcomeTrust contributed \u00a3300 million to the initiative, providing funding to 25institutions. The nal Joint Executive Committee at which the remainder of the funds were allocated was held inMarch 2001. Eight JIFconstruction projects were completed during the year inLondon, Bristol, Strathclyde, Dundee,Edinburgh, Newcastle and Liverpool.A further 17were in progress. The rst four awards under the \u00a3150 million Science Research Investment Fund were made by the Trust.These awards, worth \u00a325million, were made to the Institute of Cancer Research, theUniversity of Bristol, the Universityof Aberdeen, and the ImperialCollege of Science ,Technology and Medicine in London.SNP Consortium The SNPConsortium is a \u00a330million collaboration between the Trust, 13 pharmaceutical andtechnological companies and leadingacademic centres, in which theWellcome Trust invested \u00a39million. It vastly exceeded its original goalto identify 300 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs )in the human genome. By September 2001, the Consortium had identied 1 255 326 SNP s, all of which had been mapped onto theworking draft of the humangenome. The information gathered by the SNPConsortium is publicly available to researchers on the Internet, and should help in the development of treatmentsspecically tailored to individuals. The Consortium is currently considering its future role and the potential for future funding of other scientic projects. Mouse Consortium In October 2000, the USNational Institutes of Health, the WellcomeTrust and three private companiesannounced that they had formed a US$58 million ( \u00a340million) public-private consortium tosequence 2001, Mouse Sequencing Consortium announcedthat it had completed the rstphase of reading the mouse genome(covering an estimated 94per cent of the genome), reaching its goal on time and within budget.

During the course of the year, some 60outline Development Fund proposals were considered,of which 12were worked up and evaluated in full and nine were approved for funding by the Development Fund AppraisalBoard. This brought the totalnumber of approved awards as of 30September 2001 to 21 (total committed funds \u00a37.1million; the average award was \u00a3360 000 ). The new Business Plan provides for Development Fund awards todrive forward translational researchwithin the framework of start-upcompanies, as well as withinacademic institutions as previously.During the course of the year,approval was (see page 35 ), in line with the new business model. During the year, the outputs of two Development Fund projectswere transferred into the start-upsector - to Paradigm Therapeuticsin Cambridge, and OxxonPharmaccines in Oxford - for further development, in addition to the three direct start-up awards outlined above. A total of \u00a31.7million worth of equity in start-up companies was receivedduring the year. Other partnerships and negotiations Some 23agreements were concluded during the year.As well as shareholdings in start-up companies worth about \u00a31.7million, about \u00a3170 000 of revenues were generated fromlicensing and enabling technologydeals, milestones and royalties. \u00a320million venture funds were leveraged to advance translationalresearch and development during 2000/01 . Catalyst also led discussions with commercial companies that enabledWellcome Trust researchers to usetechnology developed by industryto further their research.Revised strategy A new Business Plan refocusingCatalyst's activities in line with theCorporate Plan, was approved byCatalyst's Board of Directors andthe Trust's Board of Governors in June 2001.The Plan has two main aims: T o increase the flow of science intohealthcare innovations, emphasizingthe translation of innovative buthigh-risk science for which theventure and industry sectors havelimited interest or capacity. T o ensure a fair economic returnfor all parties involved (institutions,academics, local technology transfer groups, Catalyst and theWellcome Trust). Priority areas The revised Plan focuses onprogrammes of strategicsignicance for Catalyst and theTrust, including the DevelopmentFund, the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute and other prioritizedCentres and Initiatives. During theyear, activity at key centres led forexample to conclusion of signicantcollaboration and licence deals at the Diabetes and InflammationLaboratory in Cambridge,and the generation of a plan forthe structuring and nancing of a start-up company to developthe outputs of the CancerGenome Project.Catalyst BioMedica Ltd, the business subsidiary of the Wellcome Trust, was set up to take forward promisingresearch that is at too early a stage or too high risk to attractventure capital or be taken up by industry. Ultimately,the aim is to make research available to the commercialsector, which has the skills and resources necessary to develop it into new therapies that will benet patients. Catalyst BioMedica Ltd 59 58 Professor Michael Morgan from City University in London won the 2001 Wellcome Trust Book Prize, scooping \u00a325 000 to write a popular science book.

HISTORY OF MEDICINE Priority areas The History of Medicine Programme identied seven areas that it isparticularly keen to support: global networks of health and medicine; medical markets and healthcare systems; health, medicine and environment; comparative medical history; 20th- and 21st-century biomedicalscience and genetics; medical technologies; ethics and law. New public engagement outreach activities The Governors agreed a budget of \u00a3250 000 to bring the history of medicine to wider audiencesthrough television, radio, exhibitions,theatre, websites, educationalresources, lectures and debates.Projects which look at the past toshed light on, and stimulate informeddebate around, current issues suchas animal experimentation, genetics,cloning, abortion and stem-cellresearch are particularly encouraged.

New projects In February 2001, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundationannounced an award of US$20 million over ve years to the Lymphatic Filariasis EliminationProgramme - a worldwidecollaboration to eliminate thedisease. Professor David Molyneuxat the Liverpool School of TropicalMedicine received a portion of the award, in part to develop a lymphatic lariasis CD-ROM in collaboration with TMR for distribution in Africa, India andSouth America. (www.lariasis.org.uk) TMR is undertaking a two-year collaborative project with Dr Janet Browne and colleagues at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine atUniversity College London toproduce Medicine in Literature . This CD-ROM , aimed at introducing second-year medical students to the history of medicine, looks at the representation of medicine and disease in ction, drama andpoetry ranging from Homer tocontemporary science ction.Above Human chromosomes in a living breast cancer cellthat is about to divide.The Development Fund A major focus of Catalyst's activities is the Development Fund, whichaims to support focused, milestone-driven research to drive forwardthe translation process. During the course of the year, some 60outline Development Fund proposals were considered,of which 12were worked up and evaluated in full and nine were approved for funding by the Development Fund AppraisalBoard. This brought the totalnumber of approved awards as of 30September 2001 to 21 (total committed funds \u00a37.1million; the average award was \u00a3360 000 ). The new Business Plan provides for Development Fund awards todrive forward translational researchwithin the framework of start-upcompanies, as well as withinacademic institutions as previously.During the course of the year,approval was (see page 35 ), in line with the new business model. During the year, the outputs of two Development Fund projectswere transferred into the start-upsector - to Paradigm Therapeuticsin Cambridge, and OxxonPharmaccines in Oxford - for further development, in addition to the three direct start-up awards outlined above. A total of \u00a31.7million worth of equity in start-up companies was receivedduring the year. Other partnerships and negotiations Some 23agreements were concluded during the year.As well as shareholdings in start-up companies worth about \u00a31.7million, about \u00a3170 000 of revenues were generated fromlicensing and enabling technologydeals, milestones and royalties. \u00a320million venture funds were leveraged to advance translationalresearch and development during 2000/01 . Catalyst also led discussions with commercial companies that enabledWellcome Trust researchers to usetechnology developed by industryto further their research.Revised strategy A new Business Plan refocusingCatalyst's activities in line with theCorporate Plan, was approved byCatalyst's Board of Directors andthe Trust's Board of Governors in June 2001.The Plan has two main aims: T o increase the flow of science intohealthcare innovations, emphasizingthe translation of innovative buthigh-risk science for which theventure and industry sectors havelimited interest or capacity. T o ensure a fair economic returnfor all parties involved (institutions,academics, local technology transfer groups, Catalyst and theWellcome Trust). Priority areas The revised Plan focuses onprogrammes of strategicsignicance for Catalyst and theTrust, including the DevelopmentFund, the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute and other prioritizedCentres and Initiatives. During theyear, activity at key centres led forexample to conclusion of signicantcollaboration and licence deals at the Diabetes and InflammationLaboratory in Cambridge,and the generation of a plan forthe structuring and nancing of a start-up company to developthe outputs of the CancerGenome Project.Catalyst BioMedica Ltd, the business subsidiary of the Wellcome Trust, was set up to take forward promisingresearch that is at too early a stage or too high risk to attractventure capital or be taken up by industry. Ultimately,the aim is to make research available to the commercialsector, which has the skills and resources necessary to develop it into new therapies that will benet patients. Catalyst BioMedica Ltd 59 58 Professor Michael Morgan from City University in London won the 2001 Wellcome Trust Book Prize, scooping \u00a325 000 to write a popular science book.
