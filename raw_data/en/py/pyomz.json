A Q-MLR-0003 -in-Chieflisa.henderson@ubm.com Follow Lisa on T witter: @trialsonline THIS WAS THE FIRST GATHERING OF Pharmaceutical Executive 's Editorial Advisory Board since rst speaking with them when I took over the reins in January 2017. Over the next months, I met with them in-person, or over the phone, to gain insights into the industry , speci c hot topics, and about the Pharmaceutical Executive mission. Having the opportunity to have those who could make it all in one room last month was both an honor and a learning experience. And, as in other years, the editorial staff was there to hear rst-hand from these experts. And before you know it, we'll be on another teleconference to go over our hot topics and ideas for 2019 editori al coverage. Suf ce to say, it' s going to continue on the path of providing the \"bio\" in biopharma. B oard members shared some information from their areas of expertise. Kenneth Kaitin, Director and Professor for the T ufts University Center for the Study of Drug Development, shared remotely what the Center is currently seeing in the industry . The challenges include the continued lack of eff -ciency in the clinical research enterprise, which contributes to the high costs of developing a drug; the industry shift from high volume/low margin compounds to low volume/high margin products, which contributes to the landscape of high unsustainable pricing; and an increased, more formalized partnering between academia and pharma. Peter Young, of Young and Partners, provid-ed an overview of industry investments, with an eye toward an anticipated increase in biotech ac- quisition for 2018. Young also pointed to China as a robust area for life sciences, which led to discussion around investments and f nancing in that country , as well as reverse activity with Chi-na pharma conducting trials in the US. The EAB and staff also discussed the Phar-maceutical Ex ecutive magazine and website. The insights ranged from ideas on how to grow our younger audiences, gain visibility into the bio-tech audience, and offer information that may help the C-suite jump-start its innovation trans- fer . Like any other business, we are a balance of resources and ideas; prof t and sustainability; short-term decisions and long-term strategies. But with all of those decisions, the editorial staff strives to keep the reader in mind. We rou-tinely send out readership surveys; keep an eye on audience involvement in our social media; know the number of people who are listening to our new podcast; and we monitor our website traff c daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly to f nd out what you're reading and what' s not resonat-ing. Keep in mind, you can always drop me an email about what you like, or don't like. We re-ceivied one recently about our April issue, which praised us for our \"particularly enlightening\" variety of articles. A win for you, is a win for us!

T rump pledged to take on the \"tangled web of special inter -ests\" that drive up drug prices and chided supply chain mid- dlemen for getting \"very rich\" under the current system. T he lack of specif cs, though, pro duced a general shrug from i ndustry and the investment c ommunity and visible disap-p ointment from public health a ctivists. The administration's \" American Patients First\" blue-pr int (see https://bit.ly/2rC3h-JQ ), unveiled at a May 11 Rose G arden speech, blasts \"global f reeloading\" by industrial na-t ions and proposes major chang-e s in Medicare and Medicaid d rug coverage policies, but stops shor t of authorizing the federal go vernment to directly negotiate M edicare drug prices and or to p ermit \"safe\" importation of pre scription drugs from other c ountries, as sought by Demo-c rats and consumer advocates. Moving Medicare I n further highlighting the im-p ortant changes to come under t he Trump plan, Health and Hu-m an Services (HHS) Secretary A lex Azar blasted the Democrats' a pproaches as ineffective and un-w orkable. He emphasized how, in stead, the blueprint will achieve such goals by updating Medicare P art B drug coverage and Part D p rotected classes. This may in-v olve shifting some or all Part B d rugs to Part D or revising the P art B payment formula to ref ect t he wider range of alternative t herapies now available in many t reatment categories, such as au-toi mmune disease and inf amma-tor y conditions, as well as cancer, a nd open the door to Part B price ne gotiation under new rules. The C enters for Medicare and Med-ic aid Services (CMS) also may r evive the Competitive Acquisi-t ion Program (CAP), designed to g ive physicians an alternative m eans for reimbursement on Part B d rugs.H HS also is reviewing strate-g ies to gain leverage over prices o f drugs covered by Part D, par-t icularly those in the six Part D p rotected drug classes that ac-c ount for $30 billion a year in Med icare drug outlays. Proposals i nclude dropping from protected cl asses those drugs that raise pric-e s too often or too much; permit-t ing coverage of fewer drugs in e ach class; and authorizing great-e r utilization management for c overed drugs to encourage pa-t ient use of less costly medicines. L ess controversial are initia-t ives to make greater use of val-u e-based payment contracts in M edicare and Medicaid, includ-i ng a review of whether the Med-ic aid Best Price reporting require-m ent blocks such agreements. R eimbursement could vary for additional indications of a drug, a nd there's interest in long-term f nancing arrangements for high-c ost treatments that promise im-p ortant benef ts over many years. A s a f rst step towards more price t ransparency, CMS recently ex-p anded its \"Drug Spending Dash-b oards\" for Medicare and Med-ic aid to highlight information on d rugs with high price tags or ex-p eriencing notable rate increases. Rethinking rebates T he administration also is tak-i ng a hard look at how the cur-ren t system of rebates negotiated by ph armacy benef t managers ( PBMs) and manufacturers cre-a tes perverse incentives for high-er l ist prices. Secretary Azar c omplained that because PBMs re ceive a cut of paid rebates, they g ain from higher list prices, and t hat this may encourage plans to m anage formularies to gain heft-i er rebates, rather than to lower ne t drug costs.H HS wants to examine how b enef ciaries are negatively im-pac ted by such arrangements and ho w Part D plans could block pa yments or rebates from manu-fac turers to PBMs. Related ques-t ions are whether PBMs should re ceive any remuneration from m anufacturers and how such c hanges would affect manufac-t urer pricing behavior and insur-a nce and benef t design. A shift t o fixed-price discounts, Azar s aid, may be needed to \"end the c orrupt bargain that keeps driv-i ng list prices skyward.\" F DA Commissioner Scott G ottlieb previewed this discus-sion i n a speech at the May an-n ual conference of the Food and Dr ug Law Institute, where he c ited drug rebates for driving up d rug prices to \"unaffordable lev-el s for some patients.\" He sug-US Maps Strategy eform Drug PricingJIL L WECHSLER isPharmaceutical Executive 'sW ashingtonCorrespondent.

More competition T he blueprint continues to call for more c ompetitive pharmaceu-t ical markets that can put pres-su re on brand prices by speeding more ge neric drugs and biosimi-l ars to market. Trump reiterated F DA criticism of brands that b lock generics makers from ac-c ess to innovator products needed for bio equivalence testing or sty-m ie negotiations of shared Risk E valuation & Mitigation Strate-g ies (REMS) required to market c ompeting products. To gain m ore transparency around these prac tices, FDA has posted a new d atabase listing about 50 drugs t hat have received complaints f rom generics f rms about hurdles in obtaining needed test supplies or in REMS participation. The a gency also is offering waivers t hat permit generics f rms to cre-a te their own REMS if needed. Adde d competition, moreover, co uld come from more stream-l ined approval of over-the-count-er d rugs and additional FDA gui dance to facilitate the devel-opm ent of biosimilars. Mo ves to enhance market c ompetition at home and to over-h aul Medicare drug reimburse-m ent are more likely to alter drug pr icing than Trump's call for ot her industrial nations to pay more for i nnovative medicines a nd end the \"global freeloading.\" Th e Commerce Department w ould identify the \"unfair dis-p arity\" between drug prices in t he US and other developed coun-t ries, and the US trade represen-tative would address this \"injus-ti ce\" in talks with trading pa rtners. However, even if the a dministration could persuade G ermany or Canada to increase ra tes that their citizens pay for m edicines, there's little assurance t hat pharma companies then w ould cut prices in the US. A zar acknowledged that it will take time to make the kinds o f \"fundamental structural c hange\" in a system of \"en-t renched market players\" that th e administration envisions. But h e emphasized that President T rump is focused on drug pricing refor m and that he expects a vis-i ble response from the White H ouse to \"the next company that t akes a price increase not justi-f ied by inflation or change in cl inical benef t.\" A shift to xed-price discounts, Azar sa id, may be needed to \"end the c orrupt bargain that keeps driving list price s skyward\"D TC disclosure?U nder the heading of increased price transparency is an \"American Patients First\" blueprint prop osal to require pharma marketers to include drug cost information in DTC broadcast ads. With a ll the time consumers spend watching drug company ads on TV, Health and Human Services ( HHS) Secretary Alex Azar suggested that for \"a real market for drugs, why not have them disclose thei r prices in the ads?\" Patients hearing about a new wonder drug, Azar explained, should know whether it co sts $100 or $50,000. An FD A working group is examining strategies for requiring marketers to advertise list prices, G ottlieb noted at a brie ng, and whether such a requirement could fall under \"fair balance\" rules. Howe ver, there's uncertainty over how useful it would be to post list prices that no one pays, and if r equiring price information disclosure would be challenged as unconstitutional \"compelled speech.\"W hile FDA proceeds, Azar proposed that drug companies start disclosing prices on their own. Ma nufacturers should let people know \"which drug companies are gouging consumers and which one s are being good actors for our community.\" The C enters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) further is instructing Part D plans to d rop \"gag rules\" that prevent pharmacists from steering customers to less costly products and ma y encourage doctors to inform patients of the out-of-pocket costs for drugs they prescribe.ES1059729_PE0618_009.pgs .PHARMEXEC.COMPHARMACEUTICAL EXECUTIVE JUNE 2018N ow Donald Trump has a t last made his pitch t o tackle the challenge o f paying for drugs i n the US, speculation is rife a bout what the impact could be a round the world\u2014and health-c are payers in Europe are comb-i ng through his 44-page blue-pr int to see if any of his ideas m ight be worth a try locally.T hat's no surprise. The pres-s ures on health authorities are pre tty similar everywhere: how to m eet the growing cost of d rugs without bankrupting the s ystem. Do Trump's ideas have a ny relevance for Europe? Is t here any value in a transatlantic t ransfer of thinking?T he heavily-branded propos-a l\u2014\"American Patients First: The T rump Administration Blueprint to L ower Drug Prices and Reduce Ou t-of-PocketCosts\"\u2014is prefaced by a c haracteristically assertive q uote from the President, but one t hat is bound to ring some bells in E urope too: \"I have directed my A dministration to make f xing the i njustice of high drug prices one o f our top priorities. Prices will c ome down.\"T rump has hitched that fa-m iliar accusation of unjust drug pr ices to his own populist ap-pro ach, so as to present himself a s the defender of the victims of dru g industry injustice.H is senior health official f aithfully follows the same line in h is introduction to the propos-a l\u2014and also sounds some notes that are frequently heard in Eu-rop e too. Alex Azar, newly re-c ruited from Eli Lilly as secretary o f the US's Health and Human S ervices (HHS), echoes the criti-c isms of the system he was a part o f until only weeks ago: \"Too o ften, this system has not put A merican patients f rst. We have a ccess to the greatest medicines i n the world, but access is mean-i ngless without affordability.\"And some of the top challenges that the proposal identif es are also habitual elements of the narrative in Europe: high list prices for drugs, payers ill-equipped to negotiate, and \"a new era of high-cost drugs lacking competition. \" The pharma industry stands accused by Trump and his administration of \"shifting its attention to high-cost drugs that face little to no competition, be-cause they offer the freedom to set high launch prices and increase them over time. \"Shared sentiments I n view of the overlaps between t he American and European di-a gnoses, the remedies canvassed i nevitably display some superf -c ial common points. The Trump a genda includes promoting the a vailability and use of generics a nd biosimilars\u2014through \"edu-ca ting clinicians, patients, and about biosimilar and in-ter changeable products.\" In sim-i lar vein to European health a uthorities, it speaks warmly of boost ing \"physician and patient c onf dence in biosimilar and in-terchangeable products\" to in-cr ease market acceptance.T he Trump agenda envisions i mproving the accuracy of d rug-spending data, including t hrough tighter requirements on m anufacturers to report their pr ices. And closely linked to the pr icing system, the blueprint hi ghlights preventing manufac-t urers from \"gaming of regula-tor y processes\" and the need \"to add ress abusive drug pricing by man ufacturers\"\u2014all well-re-he arsed ideas in Europe.B ut it is in the area of tackling h igh-cost drugs that the ostensible s imilarities are most evident. The bl ueprint notes that regulations go verning the price of prescription d rugs \"have not kept pace with t he availability of new types of dru gs, particularly higher-cost c urative therapies intended for use b y fewer patients.\" This mirrors clo sely the spirit of the views ex-p ressed by health ministers\u2014no tably in mid-2016\u2014that new m edicines \"pose new challenges to i ndividuals patients and public h ealth systems, in particular re-g arding the assessment of their add ed value, the consequences for pr icing and reimbursement, the f nancial sustainability of health s ystems, their postmarket surveil-l ance, and patient access and af-f ordability.\" The same concerns h ave emerged repeatedly and in-si stently across a swath of EU pol-ic y pronouncements since then.M atching many of the EU sug-g estions for responding to these c hallenges, the blueprint lists a s eries of possible actions to obtain g reater control over drug spend-in g. They range from indica-t ion-based pricing to models.R ef some of the cur-r ent EU discussions of hori-Can Trump Plan Serve as M odel for What Ails Europe?W eighing the crossover effect new pricing may be ch allenged when a new high-cost d rug unexpectedly becomes a vailable in the benef t year.\"C models are pro-p osed to help states, insurers, and c onsumers pay for high-cost treat-m ents by spreading payments over m ultiple years.\" It also buys into th e still-embryonic European dis-c ussion of value-based healthcare, a nd focuses on \"improving price t ransparency\" as \"an important p art of achieving this aim.\"Dissimilar interests N ot all of the blueprint is so clo sely aligned to the concerns pre valent in the EU. The pro-f oundly different nature of the U S healthcare system means mu ch of the blueprint's discus-s ion is irrelevant\u2014on issues such a s requirements to include list p rices in advertising, or adjust-m ents to Medicare accessibility.A nd even where the diagno-s es appear to coincide, the pro-p osed remedies spring from very d ifferent contexts\u2014most obvi-ou sly because the US boasts one h ealth authority with executive p ower over an entire country, in co ntrast to 28 distinct govern-m ents with national sovereignty o ver drug pricing, and a Europe-an -level authority with virtually n o powers in the health arena. I n addition, the level of detail in t he blueprint's recommendations i s not always adequate to judge on their feasibility or relevance to t he European market.H owever, two other factors s et the US approach so far apart f rom the situation in Europe that co mparison becomes almost me aningless.O ne is the curious contention t hat US drug prices are too high because prices elsewhere in the w orld are too low\u2014based on the b elief that \"foreign governments a re free-riding off of America in vestment in innovation.\" \"Oth-er c ountries are not paying an a ppropriate share of the neces-s ary research and development t o bring innovative drugs to the ma rket,\" says the blueprint\u2014and t he loosely-argued justif cation for t his belief invokes an amal-g am of \"foreign government t hreats of compulsory licensing o r IP theft,\" \"austerity measures i n most European countries,\" \" price disparities in the interna-t ional market,\" \"the growing use o f external reference pricing,\" a nd \"threats of market lockout.\"T he f aws in both the reason-i ng and the ambition have rapid-l y been pounced on by many c ommentators, who have point-e d out that it is far from clear h ow much leverage the US might h ave in obliging other countries to ra ise drug prices, or even how clo se the causal link is between th e prices that drug companies c an get abroad the prices they c harge in the US. And as James L ove, the American consumer g uru who is no fan of the drug i ndustry, also observed: \"The h igher foreign prices are, and the h arder it is to obtain low-cost ge nerics outside the United S tates, the easier it will be to c harge higher prices in the Unit-ed States.\"T he other major differentiat-i ng factor, that stands in stark c ontrast to the European situa-tion is the level of animosity, even h ostility, directed at the pharma i ndustry in the par-t icularly the drug i ndustry in his remarks. \"I've b een a drug company execu-ti ve\u2014I know the tired talking p oints: the idea that if one penny di sappears from pharma prof t m argins, American innovation w ill grind to a halt. I'm not inter-e sted in hearing those talking p oints anymore, and neither is t he President.\" In his new posi-t ion, Azar seems determined to s ettle scores in pursuit of the pop-u list agenda set by his new boss i n the White House: \"If industry i sn't willing to work with us to l ower prices, President Trump a nd his administration will keep t urning up the pressure\u2014until t he system f nally puts American p atients f rst,\" he said.S uch personalized animus and s uch coarsely-phrased ultima-t ums are alien to European off -cia ls, even when they express conc erns over drug industry per-for mance. Nor does it seem par-t icularly effective, even in the US. D rug company shares rose sharp-l y in reaction to the Trump plan. R ight now, the US approach con-t ains little that might be directly a pplicable in Europe's bid to keep a hold on d rug spending.P aradoxically, the worst that E uropean drug f rms may fear as spi llover from the blueprint could t urn out to be some off cial pres-su re to raise rather than to lower t heir prices!

Fi rst, they tend to be rather general and not tailored a round the unique prof les of C-level positions. Sec-ond , old methods are myopic. They may do a fairly go od job of selecting leaders able to meet the current d emands of an organization and its market, but t hey are less successful in selecting those able to g row and adapt to the inevitable and rapid changes.

The c apacity to be bold and decisive is certainly critical to ef fective leadership, but equally necessary is a s et of \"quiet\" attributes\u2014the subtle competencies, l ike emotional sensitivity and humility.

An analysis of various le vels of leadership shows that the size of the span i ncreases as the level of leadership responsibility g rows. For example, C-suite leaders exhibit a sig-n if cantly wider span than global executives, whose sp an is wider than those of mid-level managers.D emystifying the personalities of pharma C-su ite leadershipA cross industries, the correlation between span a nd leadership level is quite clear, but what does t his phenomenon look like for pharmaceutical exe cutives in particular? To explore this question, Ru ssell Reynolds used industry-wide data as a b enchmark and then compared pharma-specif c re sults in the following two ways. C-suite pharma executives vs. o ther pharma leadersA cross industries, C-suite leaders possess a larger sp an than other professionals do. That is, leaders a t the highest levels score higher in both competing tr aits along all four dimensions than lower- and m id-level professionals. Our research f nds that this i s true in pharma as well, but with one exception. O n the Setting Strategy dimension, the span for C -suite executives is not signif cantly different than it i s for pharma VPs and directors (see Figure 2).W e measured individuals in two groups\u2014ph arma C-suite and pharma VPs/directors\u2014on th e competing characteristics within each of the fou r dimensions. We then looked at who was rated e ither \"above average\" or \"high\" for both charac-t eristics within each dimension. For example, a long the dimension of Executing for Results , a bout 24% of VPs and directors in pharma rated a bove average or high in terms of risk-taking and Figure 1: \"Competing competencies\" are at the core of C-suite performance.F igure 2: The analysis found that pharma C-suite individuals had a wider leadership span than pharma VPs and directors.S ource Whereas, 31% of C -suite executives scored well on t hese traits. For the dimensions of Leading Teams and Relation-sh ips and Influence , there, C -suite executives score higher t han other leaders in pharma o rganizations as well. It is only in the Setting Strategy dimen-s ion that the two groups score a bout the same. MethodologyT o evaluate the degree to which leaders are likely to display the critical competencies of the Leadership Span TM model, data from the core Hogan assessment approaches were synthesized using a custom meta-an- alytic algorithm generated from Hogan Assessments data archive. This approach leverages Hogan' s gold standard methodol-ogy for assessing leadership potential and predicting leadership effectiveness. Results for pharma executives were aggregated and compared with the senior executive populations. In addition, the strongest traits among these aggregated scores were identi ed as distinctive of this pharma executive population. Figure 3: Within pharma, C-suite individuals have a larger span, except around pragmatism.Fi gure 4: Looking across industries, we found that pharma C-suite individuals differed from benchmark C-suite ser look at scores for the individual char-ac teristics within each dimension is revealing. In F igure 3 (see page 21), we have mapped out each o f the dimensions as an axis on a spider chart. The c ompeting traits are mapped on opposite ends of t he line. An individual with a larger span across t he dimensions will have a larger circle.L ooking at the results, we see that in general, C -suite executives in pharma have a larger span th an VPs and directors, in that the red circle is l arger than the yellow one. Surprisingly though, we s ee that scores for one characteristic within Set ting Strategy depart from the pattern and lead to t he two cohorts having similar spans in that d imension. While pharma C-suite executives are m ore \"disruptive\" than their more junior col-le agues, they score about the same in measure-m ents of how \"pragmatic\" they are.W e will return to why we believe this effect is h appening after the second cohort comparison.C-suite pharma vs. C-suite benchmarkE xamining the data to compare C-suite executives i n pharma to their counterparts across other i ndustries further emphasizes pharma's unique-n ess. In this analysis, it is also the Setting Strategy p ersonality dimension that is the source of the d ifference, with C-suite leaders in pharma having a n arrower span along this dimension than the b enchmark group of C-suite executives (see Figure 4 on p age 21). A lthough pharma C-suite executives are similar to ot her industry C-suite leaders along the other t hree dimensions, there is a signif cant difference a long the f rst dimension of Setting Strategy. Once a gain, if we look specif cally at the two traits of t his dimension, we f nd that pragmatism is the cul-pr it, with C-suite executives in pharma scoring just a s high on the \"disruptive\" trait as their counter-p arts in other industries, but being signif cantly le ss \"pragmatic\" (see Figure 5). I n a nutshell, pharma C-suite executives tend to b e less pragmatic than C-suite executives in ot her industries, and unlike their counterparts in ot her sectors, they are not more pragmatic than t heir VPs and directors. In addition, the C-suite s eems to be selecting and grooming directors and V Ps with similar traits, as is evidenced by \"prag-m atism\" being the characteristic in which pharma's j unior leaders also score the lowest. It is the combination of both loud and q uiet leadership competencies that h elps ensure a C-suite executive's long-t erm effectiveness and impactFigure 5: Pharma C-suite seems to be less pragmatic and in their characteristics.ES1060228_PE0618_022.pgs 06.01.2018 20:20 ADV black yellowmagentacyan23WWW .PHARMEXEC.COMJUNE 2018 PHARMACEUTICAL EXECUTIVEPha rma 50A s pressure builds, pragmatic leadership become s more importantT o examine the \"span gap\" in pharma, it is import-a nt to understand the industry's historical context. Ph arma has enjoyed traditionally high margins, a nd as an industry it has been relatively safe from s ome of the market pressures faced by, for example, ele ctronics or consumer goods. Specif cally, phar-m a's 15-year development timelines and 20-year p ost-invention patent protections have created a ra ther protected commercial model with high hur-d les to entry. Given pharma's level of immunity to m arket threats thus far, it makes sense that prag-matism may not be fostered as an important trait i n a C-suite executive.L ooking ahead, however, pharma's commercial mo del may not continue to enjoy protections, and p ressure will likely mount. Disaggregation of the ph arma value chain, regulatory compliance, digi-t ization, and value-based reimbursement models a re among the trends that are making management i ssues less static. As pressure grows, pragmatism w ill become an increasingly important trait of the C -suite pharma executive, and leaders will need to b e chosen who demonstrate strength in this trait a s well as in the seven others. Tale of Two LeadersFictive examples of the wide and contrasting span of traits exhibited by C-suite leaders. DIEGO is the CEO of a small pharma company. He has an MBA from a prestigious Ivy League school and watches over a pipeline of about four marketed antibiotics with about $1 billion in revenue. His Board has been pushing him to expand into new therapeutics areas, but he does not see this as a realistic goal for the company . He sees that the antibiotics market has become commoditized. He also recognizes that the Board is making a more passion-based decision rather an achievable strat- egy , since it would be dif cult for his sales force to sell products from other therapeutic areas. In addition, given the increased pressure from payers, he understands that he can not stand on the prior achievements of the company . He is aware of the company' s and his own strengths and limitations, and so would like to implement continuous im- provements rather than an overarching change in strategy . He is looking to set an achievable strategy where he can supplement his pipeline with other anti-infectives, for example, anti-fungals, which his sales force can sell more easily . He then plans to use his considerable charisma and zeal to convince his team and Board to align around this vision. This is a pragmatic leader as he is creating real-istic goals and marshaling resources well. Although he is reluctant and exercises caution in taking risks, he shows strength in pushing back against passion-based decision-making by exercising a healthy degree of cynicism. He demonstrates his vulnerable qualities by being self-aware and increasing standards of the organization. This is a rare quality and should not be mistaken for weak- ness. He also recognizes that once the strategy is established he can be galvanizing to bring together the troops and align follower around the mission. PRIYA is the CEO of an oncology biotech startup.

She would like to take on more risks given the complex and uncertain environment, but she nds that her people have become exhausted by the changes that the organization is making. T o ensure their alignment with the vision, she has decided to let others take on the spotlight of the achievements when presenting to the Board and is thinking about ways to pro le the next generation of leaders. This is a disruptive leader. She is a permanent source of ideas and pushes innovation through the exploitation of opportunities. She is willing to be heroic in her leadership and displays resilience and grit, which commands respect from her team. She is risk-taking and is comfortable with adapting nimbly to situations. She recognizes that to keep her team motivated and engaged she needs to be connecting individuals together, so that they are engaged beyond the energy she provides, and, instead, to the greater purpose of the organization.

When you dig in to the numbers, there's actual-ly 1 0 times less capital to support E uropean companies developing t hese assets. We felt that created a n opportunity. W e set out to bring a really g reat team together, located in a nd initially focused in Europe. W e wanted to be a commercial-i zation business from the start. T he way we would get over the ac cess-to-capital issue would be to ac cess the public markets here i n Europe faster than you might or dinarily do in the US. In terms o f the strategy of that business, t he one thing that I've learned in 2 0 years in this industry, both on t he investment side and on the op erational side, is that if you fo cus on areas of really high un-m et medical need, that's the best pl ace to be for patients, because y ou're developing drugs that pa-t ients really need. O f the 7,000-plus rare diseas-e s known in the world, there's on ly approximately 600 or so d rugs available to treat them. Rar e disease patients are in des-p erate need of therapy, as often t here's no therapy available for t hem at all. This also applies for ph ysicians for the same reasons, a nd for investors and sharehold-er s because there is higher likeli-ho od of success when there are n o other drugs. That's particular-ly t rue in rare and orphan diseas-e s. So we decided to focus on that.PE: What were the challenges and advantages of building a compa- ny that avoids early stage R&D? Did setting up a different type of pharma company lead to any ob- stacles? WILEY: We made that strategic c hoice quite deliberately. We de-c ided early on that we didn't wa nt to be a discovery company. A s you know, in the pharmaceu-t ical industry, the average cost of dev eloping drugs keeps increas-i ng; it's now certainly north of a b illion dollars. That doesn't m ean it costs a billion to develop a pro duct, but it factors in the ver y high failure rate. Second is th e length of time that it takes to d evelop a drug, an average 14 ye ars to get a drug from discov-er y to the market. We didn't w ant to take that path, because th at's incredibly long, incredibly c apitally intensive, and very hard for sh areholders to see a return o n their investment in a time-fr ame that would be appropriate for p articularly accessing public ma rkets. W e felt that because there wa s an opportunity to build a g reat team with a commercial fo cus, that would be our core a nd our niche, and we would be able to identify those assets in E urope and successfully com-m ercialize them and bring them to p atients in need. And we've b een very successful in doing t hat from a standing start. In D ecember 2016, we in-licensed L ojuxta, which we leveraged to t hen build out our commercial i nfrastructure across Europe and ac ross the Middle East, which c onstitute the main part of our li censed territories. U nder our stewardship, we've g rown the product very signif -c antly. Most recently, we in li-c ensed a gene therapy platform for t he treatment of a rare dis-e ase called epidermolysis bullosa ( EB), which gives us a high-tech pi peline as a platform and poten-t ial to create a number of further pro ducts.

O ur topical wound care pro duct for EB, AP101, is in a Ph ase III trial that is being con-d ucted in Europe, South Ameri-c a, Asia, and Australia. It is the l argest global Phase III trial ever c onducted in EB (a group of in-h erited connective tissue diseas-e s that cause blisters in the skin a nd mucosal membranes). We an ticipate f ling an [investiga-t ional new drug application] w ith the FDA to enable the open-i ng of US trial sites in Q3 2018. A P101 is a topical product t hat we gained from acquiring a G erman business and works by ac celerating wound healing. EB i s a dreadful disease. It's a defect i n the gene that codes for the prot ein that holds your skin to-g ether. Children born with this di sease are called Butterf y Chil-dr en because their skin is likened to the fragility of a butterf y's w ings. Even pulling on socks can c ause the skin to break. And t here's nothing to treat the dis-e ase; no drug has ever been ap-pro ved. O ur product has shown prom ise in a proof-of-concept s tudy in EB and has successfully c ompleted three positive Phase I II studies in broader indica-t ions, which in fact led to the a pproval of that product by the E MA in partial thickness w ounds in adults. This is a s lightly unusual situation in that t he product is actually approved i n Europe, but has a very broad l abel. Our vision and our raison d' etre is, however, to focus on th e rare disease with the really h igh unmet need, such as treat-in g patients with the more severe for ms of EB, both children and ad ults. While it's a very large m arket opportunity for us, it is a lso feasible to reach as a small c ompany.PE: If we could touch on the in-li-censing of Lojuxta, how important was that for Amryt's early devel-opment? WI LEY: As I mentioned, from t he outset, we wanted to be a c ommercial business and Lojux-t a has enabled that. This is a pro duct that we were able to i n-license, which had been l aunched in Europe in 2013. We s aw an opportunity to grow that pro duct, and build out our com-m ercial infrastructure on the s trength of that deal. It trans-for med us from a development s tage business to a commercial b usiness overnight. And, impor-t antly, because of how that deal wa s structured, it allowed us to bu ild out that commercial infra-s tructure through investing on t he back of revenues generated f rom this product. The revenues o f the product actually paid for t he roll-out of our commercial infr astructure.

That works for us as a s mall company. Clearly, we can't l aunch a primary-care drug where we w ould have to visit ev-er y general practitioner in every c ountry. But in rare and orphan d iseases, we can. We've signed f ve new distribution agreements i n the last few months, with key p artners in the territories for wh ich we have the license. PE: Can you talk about how you a ssembled the f rst management team and the importance of all their experience in getting the company off the ground? WI LEY: I was very fortunate in t hat, from the very outset, I was w orking with a tremendous part-ner a nd CFO, Rory Nealon. Rory a nd I have very complementary sk ill sets. We're both very trans-ac tional. In his previous career, I b elieve Rory did 12 acquisitions i n 14 years at Trinity Biotech, wh ich was another business that g rew through acquisition. And for m any years, I worked in the ve nture capital industry, investing in many companies in this area. W e were also blessed to have H arry Stratford on board from t he early stages, advising us on ho w he built his company, Shire, a nd later ProStrakan, from the g round up. We brought in Mark S umeray, who has vast experi-e nce, fairly soon after we had d one our f rst two acquisitions. D avid Allmond joined us as chief co mmercial off cer, from Aege-rion, and he has been very suc-c essful at building out our com-m ercial team. S omebody said to me that, c ombined, we have 170 years of e xperience in the industry. A cross the leadership team, we h ave a great breadth and depth o f experience across multiple t herapeutic areas and geogra-ph ies across the globe.PE: What is your vision for the next three to f ve years? Are you con-cerned that you can keep a track on all that expertise as you grow? WI LEY: A lot of people say that we 've built a company that lo oks and feels and operates like a m uch larger company. That's a ref ection of that senior team a nd it f ows through the rest of t he business. We have a manu-fac turing facility, we've put the q uality systems in place, we h ave the necessary infrastruc-t ure. We are able to leverage t hat now into a growth trajec-tor y. Our core strategy is to l aunch our product that's in Ph ase III ourselves in our core m arkets. We see our core mar-ke ts as Europe and the US, so we 'll build out our commercial infr astructure in the US on the su ccess of our EB product and w e'll launch that in the US. I n the meantime, we would l ike to bring more products into o ur existing infrastructure, and le verage the infrastructure we've put i n place, because then we w ill take advantage of economies o f scale. Our strategy is to build a nd create a sustainable, Euro-pean-based business for our sh areholders and the stakehold-e rs that will grow into the future. PE: Talking of Europe brings us to the obligatory question about Brexit. What are your views on that, with Europe being a major part of your plans and your cur -rent operation? WI LEY: So far, I would say that t he impact has been minimal. Obv iously, there's a concern, for su re. We're a UK plc operating i n a global environment with a pa n-European commercial busi-n ess. So how that separation will w ork out is of concern. T here are two points, specif-ic ally. One is access to talent. We r eally hope that there will still b e ongoing access to the top tal-e nt, because right now we are a ble to access that across Eu-rop e. The second area of con-c ern for us is the unknown, spe-c ifically, what will happen re garding the regulatory envi-ron ment? How that will look p ost-Brexit. Currently, EMA is i n the process of transitioning f rom a London base to an Am-ste rdam base. I n rare and orphan diseases, pro ducts are approved through t he centralized process, which m eans that you have a seamless re gulatory process to get prod-u cts approved across the whole E uropean Union. What Brexit w ill mean for that remains to be s een. We hope and anticipate t hat the UK will remain in har-m ony with this process in the fu ture.

The frustration and anger was palpable and di- rected at everybody: the phar -macist, her doctor, the drug com-pany , her insurance company, Congress, and the President. Had she known about pharmacy ben- e f t managers (PBMs), she would have blamed them, too.T he pharmaceutical industry, PB Ms, and insurers have vacillat-e d between justifying high costs d ue to innovation (noting their o wn programs to lower prices in t he process) and pointing f ngers a t each other in search for the t rue culprit deserving the blame. W hile none of the f nger-pointing i s productive, all of these points h ave elements of truth.F DA Commissioner Scott G ottlieb has repeatedly voiced his fru stration with increasing drug pr ices and the lack of competition. A nd consumer surveys have re-p eatedly pointed out that pricing i s the number one priority of con-su mers across the US. Congress h as channeled the voice of voters when decrying the fact that the US go vernment invests more than $ 30 billion a year in the National I nstitutes of Health, yet patients c ontinue to face high drug prices. Me anwhile, in response, President T rump laid out his blueprint for l owering drug prices (see page 8) l ast month\u2014a long list of policy id eas without specif c timelines of i mplementation. T o begin to address this mul-tif actorial problem, Congress and re gulators believe they would h ave to enact a range of sys-t em-wide policy reforms that will s pur incentives for both innova-t ion and price competition. As t he November midterm elections a pproach, Congress has a limited w indow\u2014between now and the e nd of July\u2014in which to pass leg-i slation. Once the window closes, t he next real opportunity for leg-i slation won't arise until a year f rom now. For complex solutions to w ork, they require thorough an alysis, wise implementation, c areful evaluation, and subse-q uent evolution. Little of this s eems likely, but progress is often ma de when policymakers start w ith the \"gettable good\" instead o f the \"ephemeral perfect.\"Why eye midterm elections? E lections can serve as forcing f unctions. They may sharpen the focus of politicians as they are e ying potential accomplishments on wh ich to run, making the spr ing and summer before an ele ction a potentially productive le gislative period. If no legisla-t ion is passed before the election, t he results of the Midterms, no m atter which direction they go, a re likely not going to provide cle ar outcomes any time soon. Y et, Congress could enact im-p ortant limited reforms that con verge over time to bring a bout regulatory, market, and c ultural shifts required to per-m anently affect drug pricing. G etting started on the good i s better than waiting indef nite-ly for t he perfect. What limited ac tions could be the f rst steps on t he long road to lowering drug pr ices? Two areas of opportuni-t y are generics and price trans-pa rency.I ncreased generic competition af ter patent expirationA t the end of their patent life, ev ery brand-name drug could, in t heory, face competition from one or more ge neric equivalents. B ringing generics to market q uickly would increase competi-t ion and decrease prices. In fact, a vailable low-cost generics may h ave generated more than $1.6 trilli on in US healthcare savings o ver the past decade. But as the c hart on the facing page illus-t rates, we need at least three ge-n erics for each brand-name drug to sig nif cantly impact prices. Th e challenges: (1) Pharma c ompanies are incentivized to a void competition from generics a nd place barriers to their entry; ( 2) Complex generics and bio-si milars face cultural resistance f rom large parts of the patient p opulation, who prefer brand-na me drugs. Prescription Price Policy:T argets for Legislative Lift T here is no magic bullet that will dramatically impact d rug pricing to everybody's liking\u2014patients, industry, and g overnment. But a stepwise approach involving a series of c hanges, including taking advantage of the next midterm e lections, could point the path toward a solutionMarket AccessES1060187_PE0618_028.pgs 06.01.2018 19:37 ADV black magentacyan29WWW .PHARMEXEC.COMJUNE 2018 PHARMACEUTICAL EXECUTIVE Vigorous competition lowers pr ices. In the case of drugs, com-pe tition ought to increase once pa tent protections have lapsed. Ho wever, some brand-name d rugmakers have gamed the sys-t em and prevented generics from e ntering the market. For exam-ple , for a generic to be approved, t he FDA requires studies showing t hat it achieves the same blood l evels at a particular dosage as the b rand-name drug. Yet, as Gottli-eb p ointed out in a recent inter-v iew, generic companies fre-q uently cannot get access to do ses of a branded company's d rug, even if they purchase the d rug as a regular customer. In ot her cases, companies have c laimed intellectual property on p ackage slips, or moved produc-t ion plants to a new location. T hese actions block generics from t he market place and keep prices h igh even after patent protection has ended. C ultural barriers remain for u ptake of biosimilars. Biologic d rugs, which are complex l arge-molecule drugs grown f rom tissue, comprise more than 2 5% of prescription drug spend-i ng, yet as of December 2017, th ere were only nine biosimilars on t he US market. In contrast, E urope has approved 33. What's more , the available biosimilars ha ve not been granted \"inter-c hangeable\" status by the FDA, pre venting pharmacists from s ubstituting brand-name drugs wi th biosimilars when filling pre scriptions. The underlying c ause for this difference is most l ikely two-fold: a lack of both t rust and incentive. Culturally, t here has been a widespread be-l ief that, because biosimilars are s lightly different, they are not goi ng to have the same positive tr eatment effect as their brand-name equivalents. Furthermore, t here's no incentive for critically ill patients to enter a clinical tri-a l for a biosimilar (or any gener-i c), if the brand-name drug is w idely available and works. W ith these cultural and regula-t ory hurdles, it's not always eco-n omically attractive to invest in bio similars. T he solutions: The FDA has s ome ability to affect drug pric-i ng through increased competi-t ion and address regulatory lo opholes that can be used to subver t the system. Congress can provide legislation to drive this more q uickly. There is also an o pportunity to learn from how E urope has tackled the biosimi-l ars issue and make it culturally an d economically attractive to i ncrease the number of biosimi-l ars on the market. T he FDA could require compa-n ies to provide dose details and pre vent brand-name companies f rom self-imposing Risk Evalua-ti on and Mitigation Strategies (R EMS) restrictions.

Congressional sup-p ort would help progress this. F rom a regulatory perspective, w e need instructions on how bio-si milars can gain \"interchange-a ble\" status in the US and address t he issue of large-scale clinical t rials for drugs whose brand-name e quivalents already exist. A f nal F DA guidance on how to reach i nterchangeable status is currently i n the works and expected to be c ompleted in 2019. In addition, the p ath to approval could be s moothed and accelerated by im-pl ementing regulatory harmoniza-t ion for biosimilars across coun-t ries, or limit the scope of clinical t rials in some other form, as is done for a my riad other substanc-e s, including biodefense molecules. C ongress can promote these cally reimbursement V alue-based and outcomes-based pr icing has been proposed to ma ke expensive, innovative d rugs more affordable. Further-more , increased transparency on dru g pricing, including rebates, w ould allow payers to optimize ne gotiation and hold manufac-t urers and providers accountable for t he prices they charge. It w ould also help reattribute in-cu rred expenses to the right link i n the provider chain. T he challenges: (1) To bring do wn the cost of treatments with big pr ice tags, we need to create fair and appropriate reimburse-m ent models that maximize t reatment benef ts per unit cost. ( 2) Drug pricing transparency will require manufacturers, PB Ms, and providers to release d etailed pricing information. T he solutions: Tying prescrip-t ion drug pricing to the value the t reatment brings to patients may hel p price drugs more appropri-a tely while providing the returns t hat incentivize shareholder in-ve stments toward innovative d rugs. In addition, states may i mplement laws that require man-u facturers to report cost informa-t ion, price increases, and patient ass istance programs. T he Centers for Medicare & M edicaid Services (CMS) is cur-r ently developing new payment m odels to curb the cost of high-l y-priced breakthrough medical t reatments. In one considered mo del, patients would pay de-p ending on treatment success ra tes for certain conditions, c harging extra for a drug that t reats one condition more effec-t ively than another. While CMS do esn't negotiate prices or pur-c hase drugs, it can set ground r ules for the care companies and s tate Medicaid agencies that are e ngaged in price negotiations. Ag ain, these models can be c hampioned by legislation. F air reimbursement models and p ricing transparency could be ac hieved by incremental changes t hat piggyback on other reforms. For ex ample, every three to four ye ars we see reforms to Medicare. Future reforms may provide an opp ortunity for piloting pro-p osed changes in individual s tates. If not championed volun-t arily by manufacturers, other s tates could follow Oregon's foot-s teps, whose new drug price tr ansparency law requires manu-f acturers to report certain pricing a nd patient assistance informa-ti on for each prescription drug t hat costs $100 or more for a 30-d ay supply or for treatments last-i ng less than a month. What' s to come?S olving my mom's problem is not goi ng to happen with one policy c hange. There is no single measure th at, with the stroke of a pen, will d ramatically affect drug pricing. Onl y a collection of measures will e ventually bring down drug prices a nd create a large enough market i ncentive for drugmakers to re-pr ice their healthcare products. T his will require some amount of ex perimentation. Anyone claim-i ng to know exactly how to solve t his multifactorial problem is get-t ing ahead of the facts. H owever, given the impor-t ance of the problem and the l imited time to effect signif cant c hange before the midterm elec-t ions, it makes sense to start wi th goals that are attainable b efore August this year and aim for b etter, if not perfect, solu-t ions next year.

Increasingly, it's no longer enough to deliver every patient who has asthma, or arthritis, or cancer , the same blanket treatment regimen of care and prescriptions. Rather, personal-ized medicine is about treating the particular patient in front of you for his or her particular illness and how it is manifest- ing\u2014this means different cock- tails of drugs or different bio- logics, such as immunotherapy vaccines; depending on genetic mutations; biomarkers; stage of disease, and more.A nd while personalized m edicine has opened up a world o f treatment options for pa-t ients that have extended and i mproved the quality of life in m any cases, this customized ap-pro ach has made the job of ph armaceutical sales and mar-k eting teams much more diff -c ult. In a world where blanket t reatment plans are no longer a ppropriate, blanket marketing a nd sales strategies won't work ei ther.Lab data takes center stage A nother change in this new are-n a of personalized medicine is t he value and the role of labora-tor y data. Lab testing is, of course, something clinicians h ave done for many generations a s part of the diagnosis process. A s personalized medicine has adv anced, however, so has lab t esting. Now, lab data can show not on ly a positive or negative re sult, but can also reveal each p atient's genetic mutations and biom arkers, pinpointing exactly wh ich therapy will work based on t he patient's specif c genetic m akeup and test results.I t was only in October of last y ear, for example, that research-er s discovered 65 previously unkn own gene mutations that c ontribute to the risk of devel-opi ng breast cancer. As re-s earchers continue to learn more a bout the underlying caus-e s of disease, lab testing will n eed to keep up with the curve to a ide in diagnoses, and phar-m aceutical and biotech compa-n ies will need to meet demand for i ncreasingly tailored prod-u cts that treat ever more specif-ic m utations and variations of d isease. In this way, medical re search, lab testing, and phar-m a are interdependent. And ph arma sales teams must be able to show value as these new m edications are being devel-op ed.T iming is everythingT es deploy teams and d evelop messaging based on hi storical claims data and pre-vi ous prescription information. T hey use this data to determine wh ich physicians have previ-ou sly treated patients in a com-p any's target market, and plan s ales strategies and deployment a ccordingly. In a world of per-s onalized medicine, however, t he old ways fall short.L ooking at prescription data t ells a pharma sales team where t he patient has already been, and c onditions a physician has al-re ady treated for. However, with l ab data, drug manufacturers c an gain insight earlier in the p atient journey\u2014at the time of d iagnosis\u2014and tailor sales mes-s aging and deployment based on wh at is going to happen next. A l ab test that shows a new diabe-t es or hepatitis C diagnosis, for ex ample, allows the pharma c ompany to reach physicians be-fore t hey've made their initial p rescribing decisions. Operating o n insight, rather than hind-sig ht, can benef t the patient as wel l as the drugmaker by getting t he patient on the medicine that i s right for their specif c circum-s tance. I n addition to new diagnoses, l ab data can also often show whe n a patient is not reacting w ell to a particular drug, or if a c ondition is uncontrolled or pro-g ressing. For example, a patient t aking one type of statin for h igh cholesterol may show ele-v ated liver enzymes, prompting a ph ysician to recommend alter-i ng the dose or switching to a Leveraging Lab Data in Advent of Personalized MarketingM ELISSA LEONHAUSER is General Manager , Alert & T argeting Portfolio, Life Sciences, Prognos Laboratory testing has become a critical access point for sales t eams in the age of personalized medicineCommercial Strategy Si milarly, multiple myeloma pa-ti ents are monitored using lab t ests. An increase in or a return-i ng M-spike\u2014a measure of mon oclonal protein\u2014would in dicate that treatment is not w orking or that the disease is pro gressing. The patient's doc-tor w ould likely consider chang-i ng If pharma sales t eams have the same informa-t ion, they can be present for and e ducate the physician before the m oment of decision. It's the u nique ability of lab data to pro-vi de this insight earlier in the p atient journey that allows sales t eams to make proactive, rather t han reactive, decisions (see c hart).Optimize resources and market share U sing lab data in a sales strategy i s also a good way to prevent wa sted resources. For example, i f a drug is intended to treat only t hose patients who f t a particu-l ar prof le, the most logical strat-e gy from a business perspective i s to focus the time and resourc-e s of the sales team on reaching on ly those patients. A keen mar-k eting strategy in any industry i s not to cast a broader net, but to c ast the net in the right place f rom the start.A ccess to timely lab data in-sig hts can also help sales teams in both gaining and retaining m arket share. When a company l aunches a new drug, knowing wh ich physicians (and, there-fore , which patients) to target b ased on lab data allows manu-fac turers to ensure their new pro duct reaches the target pop-u lation as soon as it hits the m arket. Similarly, using lab data to t arget physicians whose pa-t ients might benef t from an ad-j usted dose could help retain m arket share and prevent clini-c ians from unnecessarily switch-i ng to a competitor product.I n rare diseases in particu-l ar\u2014where the target popula-t ion is 500 patients as opposed t o f ve million\u2014overcoming the ch allenges of reaching the right a udience, at the right time, with t he right medication is critical for t he lifecycle of the drug and f or the lives of the patients with t hese often serious conditions. H ence, in the rare disease space, l ab data becomes more import-an t than ever. Aligning prioritiesL ab data, used to its full poten-t ial, can point pharma sales t eams to the patients that are b est served by their brand, and to t he treating physicians. No l onger must manufacturers rely o n data from the past to predict t he future; now, sales interven-t ions can happen right at the p oint of care, before treatment d ecisions are made. Whether a p atient is newly diagnosed, re-l apsing, or their condition is p oorly managed; whether they a re on f rst-line therapy or their d isease is progressing; lab data i s what physicians are using to m ake real-time care decisions. S ales teams should be looking at t he same information.A s the future of personalized m edicine continues to take shape b efore our eyes, it's crucial that s ales and marketing strategies e volve at the same pace. Lab data i s the missing evolutionary link th at will get us there\u2014one pa-t ient at a time. Commercial StrategyA l ab test that shows a new diabetes or h epatitis C diagnosis, for example, a llows the pharma company to reach p hysicians before the life sciences industri- alization. Others are re-ferring to it as a pharma- ceutical renaissance or revolution. No matter what you label it, the pharma industry is going through a transition and those who manu- facture\u2014or work with specialty pharmaceuticals\u2014are feeling the pain that usually comes before a big breakthrough. During Asembia' s Specialty Pharmacy Summit in Las Vegas last month, it was very clear that leaders realize the pharma industry needs an overhaul when it comes to certain areas of the business; but they were also very blunt about the reality of making some of those changes happen. One such area was drug pric- ing. As one executive put it, \"We have hit the breaking point and passed it ... the problem is that we don' t have a f x.\" The reason for that, as it was explained, is that the current US healthcare system is fundamentally not set up to sustain one-time, high-cost treatments that have the potential to cure a disease. In some cases, the science and technology has outpaced the healthcare system. Take the role of artif cial intelligence (AI), robotics, and technology , particularly as it relates to patient adherence, as an example. Cory Kidd, founder and CEO of Catalia Health, showed off Mabu, an intelligent, socially inter-active robot whose conversations are tailored to each patient that she works with. Mabu is designed to be friendly and approachable, can make eye contact while carrying on a conversation, and is capable of simple gestures with her head and eyes. She holds a tablet-like screen to convey additional information during conversations. Mabu was f rst introduced in 2015 after more than a decade of development. Yet, the robot, which Kidd says has shown in testing with patients the potential to transform drug adherence, is not widely avail-able. One of the roadblocks comes down to a simple question, he ad-mitted: Who is going to pay for it?Kidd says when his company meets with executives, the first question at the end of almost every presentation is, \"When does your patent expire?\" Catalia Health is currently in the process of working with an insurance company to pos- sibly include Mabu in their risk- based contracting talks. W ith popular AI technologies already becoming mainstream in other areas of a patient' s life, such as the use of Amazon's Alexa, the pharma industry must step outside of its comfort zone and start treat- ing patients also as consumers. Albert Thigpen, president and chief operating off cer of CastiaRx, believes that pharma needs to look to other industries such as hospi- tality and banking to glean ideas on being more user -friendly. First, is the integration of services. \"W e can f ll your MS drug, but you need to go somewhere else to get your drugs for depression f lled,\" Thigpen cited as an exam-ple of pharma' s lack of consumer product integration and how that trickles down to impact everything from patient adherence to rising healthcare costs. A simple in theory but still fu- turistic scenario, Thigpen proposed, what if every prescription automat- ically came with a programmed Alexa? Think about this: Alexa could remind people every morning to take their medication, could keep track of their doctor' s ap-pointments, could alert patients when their prescriptions are getting low\u2014it could provide a whole suite of services tailored to the individu- al and their treatment program. Admittedly , a great idea on pa-per , but how would it be imple-mented? How do HIP AA laws play into the situation if, for example, other people are within ear shot of Alexa? Who would pay for it? Who would program it and what infor -mation would be programmed? What if the patient has more than one health concern that spans mul- tiple doctors and pharmacies? These questions are ones that Thigpen said need to start being seriously addressed and f gured out by pharma, because as consumers start paying more for their health- care out of pocket, as seen with high deductible plans, they are going to want the same consumer benef ts they see in other areas of their life. So, how do all of these issues get solved\u2014and the system move for -ward? \"That's the $64,000 ques-tion, \" is how many speakers at the Asembia conference answered a version of that query when asked during Q&A at an educational session. But during a more serious conversation about the topic at the general session, which brought to-gether a number of top thought leaders, one powerhouse trifecta kept coming up. \"J .P. Morgan, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway are going to get together and f gure out how to buy healthcare, \" said Kent Rogers, senior vice president of industry relations for OptumRx. \"That may be the catalyst that will force change. \" User-Friendly UrgencyMICHELLE MASKAL Y is Pharm Exec's Senior Editor .
