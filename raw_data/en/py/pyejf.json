The online companion to this print version can be found by visiting www.mcphs.edu/report . You will find additional donor lists and other information related to philanthropic support for MCPHS University during fiscal year 2013. I am pleased to report that donor support during fiscal year 2013 registered significant and inspiring gains. More than 2,300 donors contributed to MC pHS with new gifts and pledges, representing a greater than 12% increase in all charitable giving from the total number of donors during fiscal year 2012. n ot surprisingly, the total number of new gifts and pledges across all giving categories also grew by more than 12% to 2,736.MaRGueRite C. Jo HnSon BSP '61, PharmM '79, MBA Senior Vice President and Chief of StaffGreetin Gs to Growth in financial support was widespread. Support for student scholarship funds totaled more than $1.275 million; and donors established nine new scholarship funds. As a result, during academic year 2012-2013, more than 300 externally funded student scholarship awards, collectively valued in excess of $305,000, were distributed to worthy students. The number of Annual Fund donors grew by an impressive 15.4 percent relative to the number of donors during FY 2012. The number of MCPHS alumni donors grew by 18 percent and the number of parent donors increased by more than 16 percent. More than 400 donors who made gifts through the Reunion Class Gift program, in its fifth year as a student need-focused initiative, contributed a record $112,000 to support diverse objectives, which among others ranged from Center for Professional Career Development internship stipends to acquisition of new technology in the Esther M. Wilkins Forsyth Dental Hygiene Clinic to staging the annual student Wellness Fair focused upon stress reduction, behavioral relaxation interventions, community health resources, depression awareness, and healthy relationship education. The MCPHS University Mission, \"To prepare students for successful careers in healthcare through excellence in teaching, scholarship, research, professional service, and community engagement,\" may sound uncomplicated and straightforward. Yet, clearly our donors know something different. Their charitable contributions, directed to support an ever- widening array of diverse student learning and career preparation programs, services, and initiatives, speak to the complexity of healthcare professions education in the 21st century. As student enrollment grows and diversifies, as academic programs multiply, and as need for learning and teaching resources expands, charitable gifts provide the financial support that helps MCPHS University deliver an evermore demanding, yet ultimately career-rewarding, educational experience for our students. Engaged alumni and friends who care deeply about this very special institution, and who support it through their philanthropic gestures, help to ensure that MCPHS students benefit from a world-class academic experience in preparation for leading-edge careers in healthcare.

Our D OnOrs Our D OnOrs cO mplete r epOrt On Givin G www.mcphs.edu/rep Ort Frank Bullock had his career mapped out in eighth grade. He planned to turn his father's retail business into a pharmacy after he graduated from pharmacy school. Then, in the early 1950s a wrecking ball intervened when, as Frank reports, \"The area where my father's business was located was razed for urban renewal. So, joining his business was the best thing I ever didn't do.\" Instead, Frank embarked on a career path that spanned 40 years and worked with a half dozen Nobel prize winners in the fields of new drug discovery and biotechnology. From his early days with Arthur D. Little as principal scientific investigator until retirement from independent consulting in 2003, Frank credits MCPHS University educators for awakening a passion for chemistry that led to a master's and doctorate degree from Harvard University, and a fascination with research that resulted in senior positions with Schering Plough, Abbott Laboratories, and others. But it wasn't just MCPHS faculty who inspired. \"The curriculum...produced an integrated, multi-disciplinary view of therapeutics. This proved to be a major advantage at every stage of my career.\" It may be why he remains a staunch MCPHS financial supporter. \"My father achieved only an eighth grade education because he needed to leave school for work...I have done considerably better through hard work, the help of good and generous mentors, an expanded economy, and some good luck. I merely hope that others can have the same chance.\" \"Others\" include his granddaughter Laura Dalcomine PharmD '18, who projects to graduate from MCPHS 60 years after Frank graduated from what she calls \"Grandpa's school.\" Although he no longer works full time nor consults with pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, and has ceased flying his own airplane after a 40-year career in private aviation, Frank Bullock has found pursuits in Chatham, Massachusetts on Cape Cod to fill the next phase of his life. He spends three days a week studying research literature in the fields of new drug discovery, drug development, and emerging new science; plays a 30-game schedule in the Cape Cod Old Timer's Softball League; and enjoys walking the beaches and byways of Chatham, especially when visited by his children and five grandchildren. nTHe Be ST THinG He ever didn' T do Fran CiS J. BulloC k BSP '58, a .M., P Hd\"I wish I could be a student again!\" That's how fondly MCPHS Trustee Laura Chan DH '74 recalls her student years at the Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists. Of course, Laura had already worked as a teenager in her dentist's office, become certified as a dental assistant, and worked in the Harvard Post Graduate Orthodontic Dental Program at the Forsyth Institute. You could say that oral health was part of her DNA. That's probably why Louise Hord, Dean of the Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists, recruited her to become a dental hygiene student. Ultimately, Laura's passion for oral health and her Forsyth education would serve as the basis for her work as a dental hygienist for more than a dozen years. Yet, in addition to her dental hygiene practice education, Laura remembers, \"Forsyth opened my eyes and my imagination as to what I could do with professional training as a dental hygienist and beyond.\" She never blinked when the South Cove Health Center, located in Boston's Chinatown neighborhood, needed someone to start a dental program. She ordered supplies, set up procedures, created patient record forms, and hired assistants. In essence, she says, \"I spent many years as the face of dental hygiene doing patient education workshops for community groups, especially elementary school children and working with dentists to improve patients' dental health...It was really a great period in my dental life.\" After 12 years, Laura transitioned her career following completion of a bachelor's degree program in health science and receipt of a certificate in accounting. She joined the Massachusetts Department of Revenue as a tax examiner and eventually rose to the position of director of audit before retiring this past spring. So what's the connection between careers in dental hygiene and finance? They converge at the MCPHS Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene where Laura established both endowed and restricted scholarship funds for dental hygiene students. She says that financial support provided by others \"made a difference in my career path, and I wanted to do the same.\" Moreover, she hopes that her actions will \"encourage other Forsyth alums to come forward.\" As the only dental hygienist on the MCPHS Board of Trustees, Laura has watched her alma mater flourish with MCPHS. She adds with a smile, \"Since the program has expanded to Worcester, more exciting times are ahead.\" n oral Heal TH in Her dna laura C Han dH '74 \"Financial support provided by others made a difference in my career path, and I wanted to do the same.\" \"My father achieved only an eighth grade education...I have done considerably better...I merely hope that others can have the same chance.\" 4 5atie Jacob lived and learned through an extraordinary period of change and growth at MCPHS University. During her formative years in Boston, student enrollment doubled, academic programs multiplied, and technological innovation soared. Katie points out, \"The name change is a testament to the great leaps that MCPHS has made, and I'm glad to have been a part of it during a period of strong leadership and financial growth. However, just as older alumni call MCPHS, 'MCP,' it will forever be 'The College' to me, no matter how the name changes.\" At only 24 years of age, Katie has an affinity for MCPHS University that is unusually deep and powerful for an alumna of such youth. Yet, her devotion seems to have been almost predestined from the time that she selected her college. \"MCPHS seemed like the perfect fit for me. It felt like home as soon as I walked in.\" It's safe to say that Katie made the most of her collegiate experience, tackling a rigorous academic workload while also working with the Student Government Association, Student Alumni Association, and the Office of Development. \"I loved my job on campus \u2014 working in the Development Office helped me to sharpen my networking skills and to learn more about life as a pharmacist before I became one.\" She now works as a staff pharmacist at both Walgreens Pharmacy and a Community Health Center in New Haven, Connecticut. Katie's student experiences included working for six years as a caller for the Annual Fund phonathon. Those experiences fostered profound appreciation for the important role that alumni play in supporting their alma mater. \"If you earned a scholarship award, received a loan, or had a work-study job while at MCPHS, you were assisted by a network of MCPHS supporters. I want my future co-workers to have the same solid background that MCPHS gave me \u2014 so I support the College that I credit for my accomplishments as a 'new' pharmacist,\" not many years removed from the time when she first realized her perfect fit with MCPHS University...err, The College. nFor someone who built his professional reputation upon getting involved, Lesley Walls also knows how to get far, far away. Dr. Walls, founding dean of the MCPHS University School of Optometry and MCPHS trustee, hikes the rugged and physically challenging 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail in big chunks of 100-150 miles at a time. \"I hike with my original roommates from my junior year in undergraduate college,\" he reports, \"and we have completed 1,850 miles...We carry approximately 35 pounds and often go six or more days without even cell phone coverage, as in many places the trail is so remote and deep in the mountains.\" You could say that Les Walls loves a challenge. In fact, \"challenge\" would describe a standard of practice throughout his distinguished career in optometry and medicine. Specifically, he says, \"I love starting new programs and teaching.\" He sure does, having developed medical and academic programs in Oklahoma, presided as a college president in Oregon and California, practiced family medicine in Ohio, and served as the founding dean of the MCPHS School of Optometry. Why MCPHS University? Les says, \"I was asked to perform an optometry feasibility study for MCPHS. I immediately fell in love with the institution and greatly admired its leadership team.\" The MCPHS School of Optometry obtained initial accreditation in early 2012 and admitted its first cohort of students later that September. He says that the challenges were daunting, especially \"recruiting the core faculty and then getting applicants to have the faith needed to come to a new program.\" However, he reflects, \"The greatest reward is to watch the program grow and mature into an outstanding professional program that is highly regarded and envied by the rest of the health professions educational world.\" Les and his wife, Mary Ann (also an optometrist), created the \"Overcoming Adversity\" restricted and endowed scholarship funds soon after establishing their relationship with MCPHS. The funds benefit students who have overcome severe adversity in their lives to be able to pursue the postgraduate Doctor of Optometry degree at MCPHS. Why? Les notes, \"Because it is destined to be an outstanding School of Optometry, I am the founding dean and we are in a position to give back to the profession we love.\" n see Our cO mplete r epOrt On Givin G www.mcphs.edu/rep Ortan eye For a CHallen Ge leSley l.
