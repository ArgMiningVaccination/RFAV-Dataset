[Appointments and CancellatiON](/health/appointments) Types of Massage Therapy at UNH - TRADITIONAL MASSAGE is the most common form of massage therapy in the United States. It is a very relaxing form of massage that uses long, gentle kneading strokes to improve circulation and to reduce stress. - STONE MASSAGE is a form of massage that uses heated stones placed on the body to warm the body and loosen tight muscles. Stone Massage is often used for muscle tension, back pain, stress-relief and insomnia. You should let the therapist know if the stones are too warm. If you are pregnant, have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or are under a clinical practitioner's care, we recommend that you consult your practitioner before receiving a hot stone massage. If you are booking your first massage, we recommend that you book a traditional massage. "}
