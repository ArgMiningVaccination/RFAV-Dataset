Temperature ranges for storage and transport may be the same o r different; they are determined by the product manufacturer based on stability data14 Vaccine: A vaccine contains an active component (the antigen). A vaccine is an immunogen, the adminis tration of which is intended to stimulate the immune system to result in the prevention, amelioration or therapy of any disease or infection2 Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVM): Chemical -indicator labels placed on vaccine vials, ampoules, tubes or other types o f primary containers by the vaccine manufacturer. A vaccine vial monitor shows the cumulative heat exposure that an individual container of vaccine has received through a gradual and irreversible colour change14 Viral I nactivation: A process of enhancing viral safety in which the virus is intentionally killed8 Viral R emoval: A process of enhancing viral safety by removing or separating the virus from the protein(s) of interest8 Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 9 1. INTRODUCTION Vaccines are biological products used mainly in the prophylaxis and in some instances, treatment of disease. They are largely used in healthy population including healthy babies and young children. Because of their inherently complex and variable nature, major consequences may arise due to de leterious effect such as reversion to virulence/toxicity or loss of immunogenicity. Problems regarding vaccine quality have a direct impact on the public acceptance of immunization programmes, thus potentially compromising public health strategies6. Plasm a-Derived Medicinal Products (PDMPs) are prepared from human plasma and include products such as albumin, coagulation factors and immunoglobulins, which are life -saving for several chronic and acute life -threatening diseases. They are complex in nature and their quality and safety rely heavily on source materials as well as subsequent manufacturing processes including infectious marker testing and viral removal and inactivation. In addition to manufacturing complexity inherent to biological products, prop er storage condition and efficient supply chain management must be ensured to preserve the sensitivity and limited shelf life properties of these products. For the reasons as stipulated above, a careful independent review of manufacturing and quality cont rol data on every lot of product as stated is therefore necessary before use. Lot release programme will enable N ational Regulatory Authority (NRA) to ascertain the safety and effectiveness of every lot of these products. 1.1 General Overvie w of Lot Relea se The lot release of biological products by regulatory authority is part of the regulation of these products and involves independent assessment of each lot before it is released on to the market. As per WHO g uidelines6, for self -procured biologicals, independent assessments may be based on: a) as a minimum, review of manufacturers' summary protocol s Supplemented with the followings: b) recognition/acceptance of release certificate from responsible NRA or national control laboratory (NCL) c) testing that is indep endent of manufacturers' quality control testing These approaches are not mutually exclusive and may be product specific . Where appropriate, strategy for each product shall be established by taking into consideration aspects such as nature of the product and post -marketing experience including production history and safety profile. Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 10 1.2 Scientific Guideline Applicable to Biological Products Lot Releas e Guidelines for implementation of lot release on biological products are as follows: a) Guidelines for Indep endent Lot Release of Vaccines by Regulatory Authorities an d Technical Report Series (TRS), available at WHO website: https://www.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/en/ b) Guidelines on Quality Assurance and Safety: Blood Product and Related Biologicals , available at WHO website: https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/en/ 2. GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS LOT RELEASE IN MALAYSIA 2.1 Scope The scope of this guideline includes the following registered biological products for human use: a) Vaccine (for prophylaxis and treatment) b) Plasma derived medicinal product This document is intended to provide guidance to PRHs, importers and wholesalers of the above products. The content of this guideline will be reviewed and amended accordingly in the future for local ly produced products. 2.2 Lot Release in Malaysia This guideline is largely based on the recommendation outlined in the Guidelines for Independent Lot Release of Vaccines by Regulatory Authorities6 and Assessment Criteria for National Blood Regulatory Systems7. The lot release approaches for registered imported vaccines and plasma derived medicinal products in Malaysia will include all the following : - a) Review of manufacturer's summary protocol based on product dossier which has been approved by NPRA during product registration b) Review of r ecognis ed LRC from National Regulatory Agency (NRA) of Country of Origin c) Inspection upon arrival in the warehouses d) Test conducted on t he products (refer to section 5) PRHs are fully responsible to ensure the products comply with the product registration information. If there are any changes to the products, PRHs are expected to obtain approval for variatio n prior to submission of documents. Please refer to the Malaysian Variation Guideline for Biologics (MVGB) for further details.

Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 16 4.0 GUIDANCE ON TEMPERATURE MONITORING Deviation of tempera ture or incorrect storage condition may affect the quality, efficacy and subsequently the safety of the product. Hence, it is recommended that all products are always transported and stored in their respective recommended condition with continuous monitori ng. Transportation of these products can be done by either active or passive packaging systems 4.1 Types of Packaging Systems (a) Active System Actively powered systems employ electricity or other fuel source to maintain a temperature - controlled environme nt inside an insulated enclosur e under thermostatic regulation3. An active packaging system can range from parcel size to full trailer load. The larger systems resemble transportable refrigerators and feature cooling and heating units that circulate air ar ound the product space. (b) Passive System Passive systems on the other hand maintain a temperature -controlled environment inside an insulated enclosure, with or without thermostatic regulation, using a finite amount of pre - conditioned coolant such as fr ozen gel packs, phase change materials or dry ice3. These systems comprise the product surrounded by thermal media, which is prepared to specific temperatures and encapsulated within an insulation material. The choice of packaging system for the internat ional shipment of temperature -sensitive products is at the discretion of the manufacturer and product registration holder. 4.2 Temperature Monitoring Devices Temperature indicators such as electronic data logging monitor (EDLM) and vaccine vial monitors ( VVM) serve as a quick reference to help recipient countries determine whether the shipment has been exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range9. EDLM records data digitally over time or in relation to location either with a build -in or external instrument or sensor9. EDLM is the preferred temperature indicators as they provide the most reliable and accurate record of temperature conditions for active and passive packaging systems. It is mandatory to have at least one EDLM in each and every intern ational shipping carton or pallet3-5. EDLM used for monitoring temperature should have the following functions: 1) A \"start\" function to activate the device at the time the carton is being loaded9 2) A \"stop\" function to allow the recipient to stop the recordin g when the product arrives at its destination9 Manufacturers shall only include WHO Prequalified Temperature Monitoring Devices for transportation and shipping of their products. Kindly refer to the following link for more information on these devices: http://apps.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/pqs_catalogue Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 17 The use of cold chain monitor card s (CCM), vaccine vial monitors (VVM ) and/or freeze indicators (FI) solely or together for international shipments are no longer recommended9. They may be use d to supplement EDLM included in the shipment. However, in the event of a discrepancy in temperature data recorded by EDLM and CCM/ VVM/ FI, the temperature recorded by the electronic device is the one referred to9. Assessment of temperature data recorded by EDLM shall be done to confirm that the temperature throughout transportation of the products does not exceed the requirements as stated in the following guidelines: a) WHO Guidelines on the International Packaging and Shipping of Vaccines, December 2005 (WHO/IVB/05.23) b) WHO Temperature S ensitivity of Vaccines, August 2006 (WHO/IVB/06.10) c) WHO Guidelines on Proper Handling of Diluent, October 2015 (WHO/IVB/15.08) Batteries for electronic devices do not perform under extremely cold temperatures, such as when products are transported with dry ice. All manufacturers are encouraged to validate their Class A and B packaging with frozen ice packs in order to phase out the use of dry ice. In exceptional cases - where dry ice continues to be used - WHO recommen ds the inclusion of one cold chain monitor card per shipping carton instead of an electronic device9. 4.3 Pack aging and Shipping Validation Before a product is transported to Malaysia or if changes are introduced either in the current packaging or shipmen t procedures, manufacturer is required to submit packaging and shipping validation documents to NPRA. The validation data submitted must be sufficient to prove that the product remains stable at the recommended storage condition . 'Validation ' is the confi rmation that temperatures inside the shipping containers of every temperature -sensitive product shipment remains within the defined temperature range for a period of 48 hours9. Validation should be performed under highly controlled -conditions to demonstrat e that processes, methods and systems consistently produced results meeting predetermined criteria3. Manufacturers must document the validation of their packaging. Validation data should be produced for 3 successful consecutive tests at the defined ambient temperatures minimum 48 hours9. If changes are introduced either in the packaging or the shipment procedures, the shipment must be validated again9. Documents to be submitted to NPRA for assessment are as listed below: 1) Cover letter stating the mode of tr ansportation. 2) The v alidation report should include: a) Standard operating procedure or test protocol u sed for validation of packaging b) The start date, end date and time of at leas t 3 consecutive validation runs c) Detailed information of the mode of transportatio n, i.e. external and internal dimensions of the insulated container, packaging materials, weight empty and weight fully loaded (total weight) d) Detailed temperature history for all tests in tabular format (for all internal and external ambient channels) e) Validation report has to be embossed with the company's official seal in order to showcase certification and be signed by authorised personnel who prepared and Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 18 approved the document. Signature indicates agreement with content and its accuracy and its alignment with applicable guidelines, policies and procedures governing qualification and Good Distribution Practices (GDPs). 3) All the documents shall be written in Bahasa Malaysia or English only . If validation documents are prepared in a foreign language, the repo rt must be translated to English and stamped with company's official seal to signify authentication. As guidance, m anufacturer may also refer to WHO Guidelines on the International Packaging and Shipping of Vaccines, December 2005 (WHO/IVB/05.23) . 4.4 Transport of Diluent Diluent is a diluting agent (e.g. a liquid) added to reconstitute l yophilis ed product before administration. Some diluents may be sensitive to heat or freezing, and may require transportation and storage in the cold chain. There are d ifferent types of diluent, and each is specific to the product that it accompanies. The most comment diluent is pharmacologically inactive aqueous solution (Sodium Chloride; NaCl) or water for injection; this type of diluent is used to reconstitute a l yoph ilised product such as B CG v accine (BCG), or Human Coagulation Factor (II, IX, VIII) which is administered by injection. It is also used to make up an oral vaccine such as Cholera vaccine. On other hand, some liquid diluents are pharmacologically active that contain live vaccine and thus must be kept in the refrigerator16. These include liquid vaccines that are used to reconstitute a l yophilis ed component of a polyvalent vaccine (such as liquid DT aP-IPV) vaccine that is used to reconstitute a l yophilis ed Hib vaccine). Thus, manufacturer's guidance for specific temperature requirements shall be followed to ensure diluent is transported and handled in recommended storage condition. All diluents shall not be frozen, not even during transport. Diluent that ha s been frozen should not be used because of the risk of crack in the vial /ampoule that may cause contamination. In addition, if diluent contains an active ingredient, the diluent may be damaged by freezing14. If diluents are found to be frozen, an appropri ate action should be taken to isolate and dispose the vials according to decision by NPRA. 4.5 Handling of Temperature Excursion Any temperature reading outside the ranges specified by the manufacturers is considered a temperature excursion. Manufacture r as well as the PRH should clearly understand what the consequences of temperature excursions are during products storage and transport from manufacturing site to Malaysia. It is the r esponsibility of manufacturer and PRH to assess if the available stabil ity data are sufficient to address the potential temperature excursions. Additional studies shall be considered in the case where stability data is lacking. Stability data is crucial and contribute to support the release decision in c ase of temperature exc ursions. Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 19 5. GUIDANCE ON PRODUCT TESTING NRA has been recommended by WHO to conduct independent testing to monitor key products parameters, consistency of production and to verify test results of the manufacturer. Therefore, assessment of appearance , solubility and particulate contamination in products will be conducted as part of independent testing by N PRA. This assessment will be carried out according to relevant guidance documents and pharmacopeia . Test conducted on the product should comply with the latest approved produc t specification provided by PRH . 5.1 Guidance on sample submission PRH shall provide an appropriate number of finished products with diluents (if applicable), not less than 3 containers/ vials/ ampoules/ pre -filled syringes and com plete sample submission application form (please refer to Appendix 2) to NPRA. All products shall be submitted within 1 working day (warehouse within Klang Valley) or within 2 working days (warehouse out of Klang Valley) from the date of cold chain inspect ion. Products can be delivered by hand by PRH or via courier service. PRH shall make sure that products submitted for testing adhere to the approved storage temperature requirements. Appropriate temperature monitoring devices or indicators shall be attac hed together with the products in order to monitor temperature during transportation. NPRA has the absolute right to reject any product that do es not comply with the latest approved storage temperature. Testing will be conducted for the first shipment of the same lot of products. However, if temperature excursion is detected during cold chain inspection for the same lot which has passed the testing previously, testing will be carried out again. Type of testing conducted depends on the dosage form of th e finished products. a) Solution/ liquid: Appearance test Particulate contamination (visible particles) test b) Freeze dried/ lyophili sed: Appearance test Solubility test Particulate contamination (visible particles) test on reconstituted finished product Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 20 6. CRITERIA FOR REQUESTING ADDITIONAL DATA NPRA shall request additional data from PRH under conditions including but not limited to: a) Insufficient information b) Deviation of information from the approved product specification c) Deviation of information fr om the approved product label d) Unreliable data e) Out of trend during trend analysis 7. GUIDANCE ON EXCEPTIONAL CASE This guidance shall only apply to the emergence of crisis such as a pandemic, an epidemic, a shortage of product on the market or an urgent need e.g. due to changes in national health policy recommendations , life-threatening situations . Exceptional case application shall be supported by related documents. It is not applicable as an alternative plan to support improper supply planning and handl ing of stock by PRH . For other situations in which product need to be released immediately, it will be handled on a case -to-case basis. General Procedure for Exceptional Case: i. PRH sends a requisition to Director of NPRA with accompanying justification f or exemption. ii. If the request is accepted, PRH submits application form (refer to Appendix 1) and documents (refer to section 3) via email to NPRA (vaccinecqc@npra.gov.my) iii. NPRA will respond to the email by providing confirmation on the amount of fee to be paid. Please refer to section 10 of the guidelines for further details on fees. iv. Before product arrival, PRH makes payment to NPRA. v. Priority review on all the documents submitted will be conducted. vi. Upon the arrival of products at warehouse, NPRA shall conduc t cold chain inspection. vii. Soon after arrival of products at warehouse, PRH are expected to send the samples to NPRA for test ing (physical appearance, solubility and particulate contamination tests) viii. NPRA will issue lot release certificates immediately after test completed, if all the requirements have been fulfilled ix. If one of the requirements is not met, NPRA will issue notification of non -compliance to reject the product. x. In the event of non -compliance, it is the sole responsibility of the PRH to ensure prop er and safe disposal of the product. A copy of collection for disposal documentation shall be sent to NPRA within 30 days after issuance of rejection and a copy of disposal documentation shall be sent to NPRA within 90 days after the collection date. xi. The p roduct with the same lot number which has been previously imported, will not be repeated in evaluation and testing xii. For cases stated in (x i), PRH will only submit the application form, import packing list, air waybill and make payment for cold chain inspec tion Guidance Document for Biological Lot Release in Malaysia National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) December 2019 21 The Process Flow 2 diagram (below) illustrates the process of lot release under exceptional case.
