The Workshop was divided into four topical areas: Mineralogical Aspects, theRelationships Between Chemical and Physical Properties andHealth Effects, Analytical Methods, and Regulatory Aspects. The format oftheWorkshop included presentations oftechnical papers byinvited experts, followed byverbal discussions. ofeach session was ageneral discussion ofthematerial presented. Thegeneral discussions served todefine those factors forwhich there is general agreement, what points ofcontroversy exist, andto identify additional research that isrequired toresolve the remaining problems. Thefollowing protocol wasemployed forthepreparation of proceedings. Each author/speaker submitted manuscript onandcontaining thematerial given inthe oral presentation. Thequestions, answers, andcomments which followed each talk have been transcribed from the tape recordings made ofthe Workshop, edited both toremove extraneous material andtoimprove readability, butwithout themeaning. These discussion sections areprinted immediately following themanuscript. Thegeneral discussions which followed each session have been similarly transcribed, edited, andprinted atthe end ofeach topic section.

Theother byssolite ani crocidolite, were decades ofthe20th century when asbestos became amajor industrial material. Th industrially useful properties ofasbestos obtained from certain deposits differed somewha from that ofothers, andonthebasis ofthat someasbestos were given Africa). The use ofthes distinct mineral names, ofcourse, provided some promotional advantages. Themajority o these commercial mineral names never gotintomineralogy text books, andthose fewwhich asbestos minerals were tobeidentical with ofcompositional lyequivalent major minerals because theearly natural historians believed that asbestos wasactually a vegetable. Mineralogists from the18th century ondidnotspecifically state that theterm fiber isused because ofitsresemblance with organic fiber. However, that reasoning is ofasbestos fibers rock- cotton, mountain cork, rock-wood. Jones [38] provided extensive ofanumber ofotherwise unrelated minerals. Parallel with the mineralogical terminology asbestos also became anindustrial term for acategory ofmineral products containing asbestiform varieties ofsilicates. However, some commercial with and(b)the percentage recognized users ofasbestos aswell asbymineralogists.

Subsequently, cases ofpulmonary fibrosis following Factory Inspectorate employed for20years ormore had x-ray evidence ofasbestos disease. This finding stimulated theFactory Inspectorate to require theintroduction ofextensive environmental control technology intheindustry and theestablishment ofanongoing medical surveillance program. Conditions intheUnited States notimproved significantly until the1960's andin recent years theprevalence ofabnormal x-rays among workers with 20ormore years of occupational exposure toasbestos hasbeen high.

High Exposure Effects The full spectrum ofdisease from asbestos exposure isbest manifest inthedata of Selikoff, Hammond, 2shows andobserved deaths among this group ofworkers from January 1,1967, through December 31,1976. Among those individuals whohave died, one toasbestosis, thedisease first characterized seven decades earlier andwished away times subsequently. Thedata onthemortality experience ofthis group ofworkmen arealso sufficient tosuggest atsites other than those mentioned above mayalso beincreased from asbestos exposure. Here, however, themalignancies are less common.

Virtually alloftherest, however, were inindividuals who had, decades before, simply lived orworked inanarea ofcrocidolite asbestos mining (one lived along aroadway inwhich asbestos fibers were shipped). This germinal observation demonstrated that asbestos exposure oflimited intensity, often intermittent, could cause mesothelioma. Thehazard wasfurther pointed bythefindings ofNewhouse[l1],whoshowed that mesothelioma could occur among people whose potential asbestos exposure consisted of their having resided near anasbestos factory orinthehouseholds ofasbestos workers. Twenty and School ofMedicine [22]. Ina clinical survey of489family contacts offormer factory workers, itwasfound that the x-rays of36.2 percent ofthese individuals showed abnormalities ofasbestos parents. While almost allwere currently asymptomatic, andwhile most would perhaps suffer noimpairment from their past exposure, others maybestricken with anasbestos-related cancer asaresult ofpast household asbestos ofdeaths, mesothelioma hadbeen identified inthis group offamily contacts. 78 Asbestos Fiber Types :Relation toDisease Canadian asbestos mine workers bytheMcGill group hasalready been mentioned earlier inthese proceedings. Inthe initial publication oftheir mortality study [23], a favorable mortality experience wasreported with lung cancer andgastrointestinal cancer being found inexcess only inthehigher exposure categories. While this study was comprised of11,788 individuals, itshould benoted that nearly half (4,818) were (virtually noexposure) orhadbeen employed inthemines andmills forless than oneyear. Further, many would have hadrelatively recent employment. Thus, thepotential fordilution ofasbestos-related health effects exists. Aconcomitant study ofx-ray changes among mine andmill employees maysuffer even more from thedis- advantage ofshort-term periods ofobservation [24]. Overall, 12.5 percent of11,207 individuals were found tohave abnormal x-rays.

Summary Accumulated human health data indicate that allmajor commercial varieties ofasbestos, chrysotile, amosite, andcrocidolite, produce significant disease. Lung cancer, asbestosis, mesothelioma, andgastrointestinal cancer are insignificant excess among factory workers andinsulators, while lung cancer andasbestosis aredominant causes ofdeath among mine andmill employees. Further, evidence exists that environmental exposures, such asinthe homes ofworkers orinthevicinity ofmines andfactories, have been toasbestos intheir work, asshipyard workers, canbeatsignificant risk. Currently nodata exist that would indicate athreshold forasbestos related cancers. Prudence would suggest that exposures toallasbestos fibers bereduced totheminimum commensurate with feasible environmental controls. Considerable data exist that most work environments canmaintain concentrations well below thecurrent asbestos standard. I believe theissue isnotthat reduction ofstandards aswassuggested earlier inthis symposium, butthat reduction in standards, with feasible control measures, will allow ustousethesurface oftheearth safely. 82 References [1]Murray, (1960). of death ofasbestos-associated disease among intheUnited States, INORGANIC FIBERS Current Status oftheAsbestos Problem Part Iofthiscontribution discusses essential elements andfactors related toasbestos fiber exposure andassociated human disease. Thehistorical perspective presented, in conjunction with recent data, mayhelp define theemerging problem area concerned with the biological potential specifically carcinoma ofthelung [2-5]. This effect was notanticipated, and was overlooked forextraordinarily long time periods.

This would essentially ignore short-term, high-level exposures which evidently carry significant disease potential.

Theterm fiber indicates, bydefinition, that themineral species grew with this morphology. Italso indicates, that surfaces which define theexternal symmetry ofthemineral arecrystal faces resulting! from growth. Asbestos fiber ofintergrown mechanical treatment, grinding, single crystal fiber, produces acicular cleavage fragments. Thesurfaces so' formed arecleavage planes rather than crystal faces. Itisgenerally considered that the majority ofcleavage surfaces normally follow crystal facemorphological development, inthat both tend however, that there maybesignificant physical-chemical differences between crystal faces andcleavage planes (see T.Zoltai, this Conference). Ifso,such i differences between crystal faces andcleavage planes mayresult indifferent biological activities ofthese materials. This fundamental difference prevents direct extrapolation from asbestos fiber (bound bycrystal faces) tofibrous (bound mayexist aswell. Asbestos minerals possess physical-chemical properties which are unique. Some ofthese properties, such ashigh fiber tensile strength andflexibility, are notobserved inother mineral orsynthetic fibers. These properties have been described anumber ofrecent documents [26,27]; their mineralogical character (see, e.g., M.Ross, T.Zoltai, A.Goodwin). Itisofvery great importance to note that asbestos fiber andother silicate fibers arebased onmega scopic properties, that is,those determined onbulk samples. The question arises astowhether ornotthese characteristics which distinguish asbestos from non-asbestos mineral fibers arederived from molecular properties (e.g., twinning).

Although these latter forms cannot beeasily distinguished from each other, studies have indicated that these common contaminants ofindustrial grade talcs aretheagents responsible asbestos bodies inlung tissues with interstitial lung scarring, and that there arebiologically active fibers contaminating industrial grade talcs. This might also carry with it,with some caution, that crystal faces andcleavage planes have thesame biological potential in terms ofproducing human 70years todefine ofdefining thehuman hazards associated with exposure tofibrous minerals, other than asbestos, will require at least asmuch effort andtime.

Proceedings oftheWorkshop on Asbestos: Definitions andMeasurement Methods held atNBS, Gaithersburg, Inc. Berkeley, California 94704 Abstract There isepidemiologic evidence toindicate that alltypes of commercial asbestos, i.e., chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, 1ite been malignant mesothelial tumors. There isalso strong evidence Clear-cut fiber Themost pressing need istodetermine thepathogenicity ofultrafine fibers in theelectron-microscope size range, and forfibers shorter than 5 micrometers, whether inhaled oringested. Itissuggested that there be expanded epidemiologic studies ofpopulations which have beenexposed to such fibers, without thepresence oflong fibers. This will probably occur where theexposures areincidental tooperations other than commercial asbestos production. Itisalso recommended that there be systematic study ofthefiber content recognized ago, solely fromcommercially-produced asbestos. Most andpractical importance ofdetermining whether allthese types of asbestos were equally hazardous became apparent. Oneofthefirst recommendations made by theWorking Group onAsbestos andCancer, under theauspices 1964, inman, however, shows there areclear differences type offibre andnature theCommittee's stated all ofasbestos except isgreatest with crocidolite, and apparently less with chrysotile.

Fiber diameter, length, andshape arehighly interrelated with asbestos type andmaybemore important than chemical andcrystal structure. Theconsensus that crocidolite isthemost itsearly associa- tion three times aslong astheNorthwest Cape fibers, both samples hadmany fibers ineandHenderson [9]compared theexperience of workers making asbestos cement pipe, where both crocidolite andchrysotile were used, with that ofothers exposed only tochrysotile. Those whose exposures included crocidolite had 6.1times theexpected number ofdeaths duetolung cancer, while those exposed thenumber expected. Weill etal.[10] carried outcomparative studies oftwopopulations ofworkers, one making asbestos shingles chrysotile, making shingles, flooring, andasbestos-cement pipe andexposed toboth chrysotile hadmore small irregular opacities byx-ray, more pleural thickening, and significantly greater reduction inpulmonary function. Despite theconsensus that crocidolite isprobably themost hazardous type of commercial asbestos, theevidence does notappear strong enough tosupport a10-fold stricter standard for atime-weighted average, ora60-fold stricter standard 10- minute exposures, mesothelioma, inapopulation of230menwhohadbeen previously oneof thefewopportunities intheUnited States tostudy workers without exposures. The high rates ofasbestosis, lung cancer, andmesothelioma inasbestos insulation workers have inSouth Africa. Webster [6] states that of232confirmed cases of mesothelioma diagnosed inSouth Africa between 1956 and1972, 78hadbeen inminers, but practically all hadbeen exposed toCape Blue only twohaving had exposures only toamosite. Aspointed outearlier, thefact that shared with Transvaal crocidolite theproperty ofbeing thicker andlonger than Cape crocidolite rated onthebasis ofrelatively fewstudies inwhich exposures were limited tothis have been inworkers described inasbestos workers intheUnited Kingdom orinU.S. have been criticized formethodologic flaws, but itwould nowappear that they reflected alower risk in chrysotile miners. More recent studies ofQuebec byMcDonald inthehighest exposure group. Only 5deaths from mesothelioma were found among 3,270 deaths. Amore recent estimate by McDonald [15] gives theproportion ofmesothelioma deaths as8outof4,000 deaths. This isfar insulation manufacturing chrysotile products, and who worked oneyear ormore. The Standard Mortality Ratio (SMR) forlung cancer wasonly 0.93. bySelikoff .[17] inan asbestos insulation material producing plant, comparison ofgroups with similar intervals from first exposure toendofoperation indicated asignificantly lower lung cancer risk intheWeiss study. These reports, combined with those ofWeill etal.[10] andEnterline andHenderson [9]previously reported, suggest oramosite. But, asTimbrel 1[8]haspointed than chemical composition perse. Theevidence onanthophyl 1iteasbestos comes almost entirely from Finland, where this form ofasbestos wascommercially developed until recently, andwhere there have been widespread non-occupational exposures. The extraordinary incidence of pleural calcification associated they 12.6were expected; nomesotheliomas were reported. Studies ofworkers exposed totremolite asbestos without associated exposures to other fibers arenotsufficiently well documented topermit placing them inagradient of response with other commercial types ofasbestos. The same istrue foractinolite asbestos. Other Asbestiform Minerals What istheevidence forthepathogenicity other than thetypes of asbestos commercially exploited? Itisalmost non-existent because, intheabsence of commercial development andoccupational exposures, contacts have been incidental toother operations andhave been poorly documented andusually ofless magnitude. Thebest of such studies have been associated with commercial talc operations. Thepresence of tremolite asbestos, anthophyllite asbestos, andchrysotile pleural plaques, but intheright size ranges there have been exposures toamphibole fibers, described aspredominantly inthegrunerite series similar tothose found 100years. Unfortunately, identified bythePublic study. However, amore recent report byMcDonald etal.(1977) covering deaths between 1937 and 1973 in1,321 employees ofthe same mine whowere members ofthe Homestake Veterans Club, andhadworked 21years ormore, showed noexcess lung cancer deaths. There were 660 deaths for analysis. There was anexcess ofdeaths from pneumoconiosis and pulmonary tuberculosis. This, and the excess ofnon-malignant respiratory disease deaths reported byGillam etal .isnotsurprising, since 39percent quartz hadbeen demonstrated insettled dust. Records kept bythemines since 1937 showed dust concentrations ranging from 11to25.5 million particles percubic foot (mppcf) before 1952, greatly exceeding forfree cancer mine, notbejustified andconcurrent certainly cannot responsible deaths from non-malignant respiratory disease, counts to1937 which that that mayestablish themortality patterns with more certainty andhopefully will permit more accurate estimates ofpast exposures. Influence ofFiber Dimensions Throughout consideration oftypes ofasbestos, itisapparent that type cannot be separated from shape andsize. This istrue even when exposures arecharacterized solely onthebasis offibers inthelight microscopic range (i.e., with diameters than 0.4-0.5 pm)andthose greater than 5pminlength. Ithasbeen demonstrated inrecent years, instandard asbestos [26], norinairandwater samples, nor size range. Furthermore, asPooley [27] hasshown, even chrysotile miners and millers contain most within species ofcommercially used asbestos, orintheasbestiform varieties of minerals notused commercially, there isrelatively little toreport. There issuggestive butnotconclusive evidence from South relatively andfine aremore likely toproduce mesotheliomas than andthicker fibers, butthese are within the range oflight microscopy and longer than 5micrometers. There are no conclusive studies inman tosupport thestrong evidence from animal studies that very (under 5pm)arenon-pathogenic. Inconsidering theinfluence isdefined asonebelow level microscope, astrong inverse relationship tofalling speed, sosuch fibers remain airborne for long periods and arehighly respirable, although their capture andretention will vary notonly butalsowith length; 2) exposures, butseldom to theexclusion fibers 3) they have been found tobewidespread incommunity air [29] and in association with thequarrying [30]; 4) they are notincluded infibers counted currently recommended formonitoring work environments, andarenotcovered current standards; 5) data arenotbeing systematically collected onthenumbers ofultrafine fibers inthe air nor how their concentrations relate tothe concentrations oflarger fibers found invarious occupational and environmental situations. arenoepidemiologic inwhich ultrafine fibers areanisolated variable. Allstudies ofpopulations exposed tocommercial asbestos have involved heavy exposures within thelight microscope range, i.e., tofibers larger than 0.5pmindiameter, sothe contribution ofultrafine fibers cannot bedetermined. Ontheevidence from studies in animals, itislikely that such fibers, when longer than 5or10pm,would bepathogenic. 126 Theproblem ofthevery short fiber collected near taconite mining operations inMinnesota, andassociated with crushed rock inMontgomery County, Maryland, arepredominantly short fibers [30]; 5) since current monitoring methods for theoccupational environment exclude fibers shorter than 5pm,data arenotbeing systematically collected. themedian diameter was0.13 pm,andthemedian length was 1.1 pm. For reasons pointed out earlier, these exposures, which were described as consisting largely ofgrunerite with some fibrous cummingtonite and hornblende, are inconclusive. Neither the actual mortality experience northepast exposures arewell enough tohave had large numbers of ultrafine, short fibers inhislungs cannot initself establish acausal relationship, products plant andwhose lungs showed enormous numbers ofsubmicroscopic talc particles (non-fibrous). Both reports suggest that overwhelming concentrations ofareactive dust may insome individuals produce generalized interstitial fibrosis. ushowoften occur, with malignancy. Theessentially negative evidence astohealth effects from theairborne fibers associated with taconite mining operations inMinnesota, andthenegative evidence from Duluth (Masson etal.)[33] with respect totheingestion ofultrafine, short fibers in Lake Superior water arereassuring, but itistoosoon torule outeffects with long latent periods, i.e. ormore. Insummary, nopopulations whose exposures have been short fibers, orfibers which defined orstudied theconcentrations offibers inlung tissue with pathologic changes. That ofAshcroft andHepplestone (1973) [34] was limited to35 individuals with asbestos bodies detected inhistological sections, andallbutonehad definite orprobable histories ofoccupational exposure. Theauthors found that from 12 to30percent ofthefibers were optically visible, therest being detectable only by electron microscopy. (They did not describe fiber lengths.) There was ageneral correlation between fiber concentration and asbestosis, uptothe level ofmoderate asbestosis. Another study, byDoniach etal .[35], byPooley of 127 individuals with asbestosis whohadbeen employed inthechrysotile mining industry in Canada, and in30individuals whodied with mesothelioma, provided valuable information on therelative proportions ofchrysotile andamphibole fibers andonthelarge numbers Itsmost that inanimals, testing various types of asbestos andasbestiform varieties ofother minerals inappropriate size ranges, must be done. Itisnotlikely that further study ofindividuals whomine, mill, process, oruse commercial asbestos will domore than tune more finely what wealready know. Even though this isdesirable andnecessary, itisnotlikely toanswer questions about very fine or very short fibers, since thenature ofcommercial asbestos issuch that long fibers are always present. Only ifdust control measures preferentially increase very greatly the proportion ofshort fibers intheelectron microscope range would studies incommercial asbestos operations provide useful information regarding fiber size. Wemust turn toother populations, where exposures have been incidental tonon- asbestos industrial operations butwhich liberate ordisperse asbestiform varieties of minerals intheelectron microscope mine has hand, anabsence ofserious risk would be highly reassuring, ifpast exposures were found tohave been high. Other populations which might bestudied are those inassociation with taconite mining andmilling operations, where, arepresent andhave been present periods oftime. Careful search should bemade forareas patterns known asbestos deposits, needs tobe refined toconcentrate oncensus tracts contiguous tooperations which actually increase fiber concentrations intheairorwater. Asecond approach which should beexpanded isthelarge scale study ofthefiber content ofhuman lungs andother tissues, with determination offiber concentrations and fiber dimensions, forcomparison with causes ofdeath. This has been periodically suggested butnever actively pursued. [37] evident. Unlike most carcinogens, fibers that areathreat are sufficiently durable toremain inthetissues from which cancers are derived. Since carcinogenic hasbeen accomplished inassessing large, protein-coated fibers inhuman lungs, surprisingly little hasbeen done inassessing the size distribution andtotal quantity ofallfibers inhuman tissues. This involving ultrafine and ultrashort asbestos fibers ortheasbestiform varieties ofother minerals will continue on avery uncertain andoften emotional basis.

FIBERS Leonard Bruckman AirCompliance Unit -Engineering Connecticut Department ofEnvironmental Protection Hartford, Connecticut 06115 Abstract Thefollowing discussion bytheConnecticut AirCompliance Unit forthepurposes ofstudying thedanger topublic health inlieu ofEPA's qualitative asbestos regulations. Anambient airasbestos survey indicated that asbestos concentrations contiguous tomanufacturing sources ofasbestos emissions exceed Connecticut's proposed standard. Furthermore, asbestos levels adjacent totoll plazas were also elevated relative tolevels removed from manufacturing sources, implicating vehicle brake lining decomposition asasignificant source ofairborne asbestos fibers. In addition totheaforementioned airasbestos survey, apreliminary study ofmesothelioma wasconducted. There were 133Connecticut residents diagnosed with mesothelioma between 1935 and1972. Although subject to diagnostic error, available statistics suggest that thecombined sex age-adjusted mesothelioma incidence rate (AAR) per100,000 Connecticut population hasexhibited apossible 10-fold increase since 1935, rising from 0.02 during 1940 to0.25 from 1960 to1969. Thetrends forboth men andwomen also showed sharp increases over thesame timeperiod (1940 to 1970). Therapid rise inConnecticut's mesothelioma incidence rate closely follows the increase inthe State's cumulative asbestos consumption andsuggests alinearly increasing airquality standard does notprovide theState's residents with an adequate degree ofprotection from this carcinogenic substance. Inaddition, Connecticut asbestos standard, theAirCompliance conducted anambient with astudy of asbestos-induced mesothelioma incidence bytheConnecticut AirCompliance Unit forthepuuposes ofstudying thedanger to public health associated with excessive airborne asbestos fiber concentrations. Sources ofAirborne Asbestos Fibers inConnecticut Outdoors, theprincipal source ofairborne asbestos fibers that almost 10tons ofasbestos fibers might bereleased into the Connecticut atmosphere annually as aresult ofmanufacturing operations, assuming reasonably efficient (i.e., 95%asbestos removal efficiency orgreater) control equipment isemployed. Another major source ofairborne asbestos fibers istheerosion ofasbestos- containing brake linings and clutch facings. This accounts for approximately two additional tons ofairborne asbestos fibers each year [3,4]. Notwithstanding EPA's current regulations covering thedemolition ofasbestos containing structures, perhaps the largest potential future source ofasbestos emissions might bethedemolition ofbuildings which have been insulated and/or fireproofed with asbestos materials. Theportion ofthe NESHAPS regulation pertaining tothedemolition ofasbestos-containing structures does not clearly state what requirements ademolition operator must meet inorder toascertain abuilding contains any asbestos materials, and theassociated costs involved inremoving such materials if present, necessitate some type offormalized testing procedure. Briefly, such atest might entail taking samples from thewalls, the insulation covering load-supporting structural members and the floor andceiling tile, from atleast onefloor ofthe candidate structure, inaddition totheinsulation covering theboiler composite sample could then becreated andanalyzed todetermine itsasbestos content using relatively inexpensive techniques (x-ray Itisimportant that the asbestos content offloor andceiling tiles beascertained these non-friable asbestos materials might bepulverized during thedemolition ofastructure creating a potentially serious asbestos known as \"explosive demolition\" isused. structure isunknown atthis andshould thus bequantified assoon aspossible. Indoors, many do-it-yourself home projects create asbestos dust duetothemixing of dry, loose asbestos with water andsubsequent application ofsuch mixtures forthe purposes ofinsulating and/or fireproofing boilers, pipes, etc..., andthecutting and sawing ofasbestos-containing wallboard, ceiling, and floor tile. Perhaps themost serious public health hazard posed atthis time byexcessive asbestos fiber exposure has been created bytherelease ofasbestos fibers from asbestos-containing surface coatings, which were applied indoors towalls, ceilings, exposed structural steel, airducts, plenums, return airspaces, forinsulating, andfireproofing purposes fibers may bereleased into deteriorates, andfinally, when thebuilding isdemolished. Theasbestos fibers resulting from the spraying operation itself, aswell asthose released from thecoating over aperiod of time beofprimary Atleast onestate (i.e., NewJersey) andonelocal municipality (i.e.. NewHaven, Connecticut) have promulgated regulations forthepurposes ofcontrolling and/or prohibiting thefuture use ofspray-on asbestos surface coatings indoors. NESHAPS currently prohibits | asbestos-containing notbeexceeded made such toostrict. Setting standards should beviewed asadynamic inthat any value must bereviewed and revised periodically asadditional pertinent information becomes available. Even apreliminary airquality standard isvaluable because it provides some quantitative idea astowhat health risk isassociated with varying pollutant levels. Such astandard can beespecially useful indeveloping aset of priorities forcorrecting environmental problems created bycertain pollutants. For example, areas which arewell below thestandard need noimmediate attention, while areas well above thestandard require that some sort ofcorrective action betaken assoon as possible. Such anapproach isparticularly needed fortoxic multi-media environmental pollutants, such asasbestos. Inthis manner limited resources can beeffectively directed atsolving themore serious aspects oftheproblem and, atthesame time, based solely onemotional decisions bypoorly informed administrators canbeminimized. Connecticut's proposed asbestos standard light; i.e., standard isafirst attempt atquantifying theadverse health effects posed tothegeneral public byexcessive airborne asbestos fibers. Hopefully, anyquestions raised bythe rationale used indeveloping this standard will beanswered byfuture studies using varied approaches. difficult torelate agiven case ofbronchiogenic carcinoma toasbestos exposure with the high degree ofprobability that exists for mesothel ioma. Some investigators suggest that thesmaller asbestos fibers (i.e., those less than 5pinlength) most likely encountered intheambient airmay beincapable ofinducing lung cancer, however, ithas not been demonstrated that these shorter asbestos fibers are incapable of producing mesothelioma. Most oftheinformation available ontheadverse health effects caused byexcessive asbestos fiber exposure collected environments [n] 74.4 0.1 Shipyards 3000 0.73 [11], [14] 8.7 0.3 Construction 632 0.63 [11], [15] 7.1 0.9 Textile plants 716 Concentrations forNIOSH document [18]. 181 Unfortunately, quantitative dose-response relationships concerning environmental asbestos exposures andmesothelioma incidence indifferent industrial settings arenotavailable. In 1973, theNational Institute forOccupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) concentrations inanumber environments [18]. While these short-term fiber concentrations are ofrecent origin and, therefore, cannot bedirectly related to epidemiological incidence, they canbeused toobtain anestimate of therange likely settings. Forexample, andco-workers reported that forworkers intheconstruction industry (followed 0.63 percent contracted mesothelioma [15]. The variation inasbestos fiber exposure fortheconstruction industry from theNIOSH study ranged from 0.1to29.9fibers/cc which corresponds toahypothetical probability ofcontrac- ting mesothelioma of63/10,000 (i.e., 0.63%). Inalike manner, occupational mesothelioma (provided bystudies appearing intheopen andcorresponsing estimates oftherange ofasbestos bytheaforementioned NIOSH report) used toconstruct afirst generation occupational asbestos fiber exposure-mesothel ioma incidence envelope 1).

Ambient chrysotile asbestos levels removed from asbestos emission sources inboth urban andrural location were below 10r\\g/m^. However, chrysotile asbestos concentrations above the 30qg/m^ proposed standard were measured near each oftheindustrial users ofasbestos (i.e.,32qg/m^ atapublic works building located near thefriction products manufacturer; 33r]g/m^ ata junior high ofthesubject point sources are incompliance with NESHAPS andother existing state andfederal airquality regulations. Ambient asbestos levels tothethree toll plazas on1-95were also elevated (inthe 10r\\g/m^ to25qg/m^ range), implicating asbestos emissions from vehicle brake lining decomposition as asignificant source ofairborne asbestos fibers. Asbestos concentrations atthe rural toll plaza (11,000 eastbound areno known industrial users ofasbestos near this rural toll station.

Theratio ofthemaximum asbestos concentration measured atthefirst urban toll plaza tothat attherural toll station was approximately equal totheratio ofthenumber ofcars/day passing through each toll plaza (i.e., 1.8versus 2.3) during thesampling interval. Alloftheaforementioned measured asbestos levels were 30-day average values, except the 41r\\g/m^ concentration, which was approximately a20-day average value (due toasampler malfunction). Inaddition totheambient airasbestos survey described above, asbestos levels were also measured indoors attheboy's swimming pool located intheUniversity ofConnecticut's field house. Theceiling later. Chunks ofthis coating have been falling from this exposed ceiling forsome twoyears. Analyses ofabulk sample oftheceiling material bytheConnecticut State Department ofHealth revealed evidence of asbestos fibers (between 10-30%) within fiberglass andbinding material. Subsequent electron microscopic analyses oftheceiling material bytheBattelle-Columbus Laboratories indicated that theasbestos was oftheamphibole variety. Four (4)long-term (i.e., 30-day) air samples were collected atvarious locations atthepool. Identical sampling techniques were used forboth theindoor andoutdoor airasbestos surveys. These indoor samples are being using transmission electron ofapotential health hazard posed byairborne asbestos fibers which warrants further investigation. Firstly, additional ambient asbestos monitoring should beperformed assoon aspossible to: 1) define themonth-to-month variations inambient asbestos levels at various locations, primarily indensely populated areas contiguous tomanufacturing sources ofasbestos emissions andespecially those locations which already exhibited asbestos concentrations inexcess ofConnecticut's standard, 2) further quantify, asbestos levels near toll stations, therelation- ship between traffic counts andambient asbestos concentrations, anddetermine howasbestos levels decline with increasing distance from atol 1plaza, 3) define ambient asbestos concentrations contiguous todifferent types ofdemolition operations and howrapidly these levels approach background concentrations after thedemolition activity is completed, and 4) quantify thehazard posed byasbestos concentration indoors where itissuspected materials are fraying andflaking. 188 Secondly, therelationship between asbestos consumption andmesothelioma incidence in Connecticut should beinvestigated detail. with asbestos fiber exposure. Aprospective study ofschool children exposed toasbestos fibers indoors asa result ofasbestos-containing ofasbestos levels should beinitiated assoon as possible. The resulting measured concentrations (along with exposed) should to bethemost logical waytoobjectively determine howbest toallocate thepeople's money in implementing ways ofcontrolling contamination byairborne asbestos fibers.

Regulatory procedures were adopted from those used inGreat Britain. Theindustrial- hygiene identification procedures were acceptable toindustry, health, andregulatory organizations because the concern was restricted toseveral mineral products known collectively asasbestos. Although light optical microscopic procedures counted only the larger particles collected ontheairfilters, theprocedure observed. Exact definitions forasbestos-related mineralogical terms were essential since all three groups (industry, health, and regulatory) clearly understood what wasbeing counted andregulated. Thelight optical microscopic procedures andsmall fibers in this size range are not visible with the conventional light optical microscopic procedures. Therefore, theidentif icaiton procedures currently used forregulating the U.S.mineral byitscrystal andbyits definite composition orrange Therefore, system ofmineral identification should bebased principally oncrystal structure andchemical criteria.

Flexible fibers bend readily andonly break across the fibers into distinct pieces with some difficulty. Structurally, theasbestiform minerals arelimited, incommon practice, totheserpentine andamphibole silicates; theterm \"hydroxyl ated\" is preferred over \"hydrated\" because these minerals contain OHions rather than water of crystallization. The serpentines contain approximately water; the amphiboles, water.

Both transmission andscanning electron microscopy have been used extensively formineral fiber identification, sizing andcounting, andboth types ofinstruments andtheir related characterization techniques havetheir place. Thetransmission electron microscope (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) isconsidered the most widely applicable instrument, although ithas some disadvantages which will bediscussed. This technique requires that theimage forming electrons travel through thesample andtherefore thesample matrix kinetic energy about 100KeV) electrons. SAED requires electron microscopy (SEM) images areformed ly,usually bysecondary electrons produced bya focused electron beam inthe sample. The technique usually employed for species identification isenergy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) which determines theenergy ofx-rays thesample. This emitted x-ray energy spectrum electron beam with theadvantages ofboth is thescanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). This instrument hasbeen used bya number oflaboratories, most ofwhich have procured itspecifically for asbestos microfiber counting and identification. Essentially itisatransmission electron microscope equipped with focused should produce abrighter SAED pattern forparticle identification than inthe TEM, and ifanelemental analysis isdesired this may be obtained from thesame particle without transferring thespecimen toanother electron beam instrument. 222 There isanother type ofelectron microscope which hasbeen used only sparsely for asbestos mineral fiber analysis. This instrument isanSEMwith anelectron detector below thespecimen fortransmission imaging. This image to beformed might becalled Needless tosay, [3]. mayhave a3:1length-to- ratio.

AnEDXS detector placed intheelectron microscope sample chamber close tothespecimen converts byadjacent oradhering particles, from instrumental uncertainties indetermining the exact chemical composition ofaparticle [9], orfrom thefact many mineral particles that areoften associated with asbestos materials which show a3:1length-to-width ratio andgive EDXS spectra that cannot bedistinguished from theasbestos Figure anexample ofSEM-EDXS minerals cangive x-ray spectra that usually arecharacteristic enough, when combined with fiber morphology, toallow their mineral identification [6,7,12]. Visual observation ofthesemi-quantitative fiber x-ray spectrum istheusual method of fiber identification; however, three-component diagrams have been used after subtracting the continuous background from the semi-quantitative x-ray spectrum for further extrapolation ofthedata [6].

Thepossibility that some species ofnon-asbestos with anenergy dispersive x-ray detector are available which allow simultaneous observation ofmorphology, crystal structure andelemental composition. These microscope systems have been used tostudy fibers asbestos expensive and fewlaboratories will beso equipped inthenear future. However, ofthepatterns thesurface directly with anelectrical conducting material, e.g. gold, silver, carbon orsilicon monoxide [5]. More complicated methods have been used forSEMpreparation ofsamples collected onMillipore [9]. These filters with their rough arenotgenerally suitable coating forSEMbecause small ofabout 100KeVenergy. This requires that thefiltrate (particles) bemounted upon electron microscope grids with very thin, ontheorder of100Angstroms, carbon or metallic substrates and the filter material dissolved away. Several dissolution techniques areused, including theJaffe wick andcondensation washing. Generally these techniques arerelatively simple andmaintain theoriginal particle size distribution and relative particle location. Some investigators have reported particle losses ashigh as 60percent with thecondensation washing technique compared with less than 10percent with theJaffe wick method [20]. Coating ofthecondensation washer canreduce filtrate loss tomuch less than 10 percent. Most laboratories apply asecond carbon, metallic orsilicon monoxide coating to thefiltrate after filter dissolution toreduce theprobability ofparticle loss. The choice ofconduction coating isvaried; however, many laboratories have been considering fine grained metallic coatings because ofsuperior contrast andthefact that areference pattern asthelast fewsteps. This includes ashing ofthesample which andsubsequent covered byanother author inthis publication. Ashing can beperformed inalow temperature analyst; however, itisalways highly desirable toprocess control specimens, i.e., 230 blanks, when preparing samples forfiber counting andanalysis. These blanks confirm a clean preparation environment orbearwitness tolaboratory contamination. Another preparation technique which hasbeen technique. This wasused and has been applied bytheMount Sinai group [22]. High particle losses and the idestruction ofthetrue particle size distribution toproduce only amass concentration arecited asdisadvantages with this technique. Other techniques have also been cited as viable, including that inarecent EPAreport [5]. However, most have been discarded in favor ofthedirect transfer method alone orpreceded byashing onlywhen necessary. Theadded Ibeen cited asaserious disadvantage toTEM, STEM andTSEM analysis. However, experienced laboratories have developed preparation routines andtechniques which make particle losses, contamination and labor time negligible. The usual amount oftime lag in preparation ofatransmitted electron sample isabout four hours. Analysis Cost The amount ofelectron microscope time necessary for ananalysis isthemajor consideration affecting cost, and isdependent upon many factors, nottheleast ofwhich isthesample from which ofdistribution arejust STEM oronphotomicrographs produced byanelectron microscope. Direct computer image analysis isalso possible with suitably modified imaging devices mounted into TEM's. This technique cangreatly reduce theamount ofmicroscope time required for microfiber searches but isprone tocertain errors, especially where high concentrations jofmicrofibers andother particles arepresent. j The application ofmicrofiber identification techniques affects the microscope time aswell asimaging. The TEM image isessentially instantaneous, whereas an SEMimage must beacquired with time analysis is100ormore seconds. Asaconse- quence most analysts working with SEM and STEM only obtain analyses from selected microfibers, not all ofthose found. SAED microscopists preparation analysis exactly aremarkedly different. However, over thepast three years anumber oflaboratories have markedly improved their analytical reliability in ispite oftheoverwhelming statistical uncertainties.

The principal analytical method used forstudies ofasbestiform minerals in talc bulk samples andairborne dust samples isanalytical transmission electron microscopy utilizing selected area electron diffraction and microchemical analysis forfiber identification. This presentation includes ofanalysis being used byNIOSH and comparisons ofresults ofanalysis with other analytical techniques. Also included are results ofNIOSH industrial hygiene studies in asbestiform talc operations and comparisons ofairborne fiber characteristics (fiber length, diameter, aspect ratios, etc.) inthese operations with other industrial processes using asbestos fibers.

These studies include both epidemiological studies of exposed worker populations todetermine health effects which maybeattributed tooccupa- tional exposures anddetailed industrial hygiene studies tocharacterize thevarious towhich workers have been exposed. Figures inbrackets indicate theliterature references attheendofthis paper. 313 Since many talc deposits contain asbestiform amphiboles and insome cases chrysotile (aserpentine), alarge portion oftheNIOSH environmental studies isdirected toward determining mineral fiber exposure patterns andcharacteristics. Forsuch studies, the primary method used isanalytical transmission electron This report includes adescription mine and mill producing talcs containing asbestiform amphibole minerals. Also discussed arecom- ofwhat constitutes asbestos andtherelationship ofthese definitions toobserved industrial asbestos exposure characteristics. Analytical Methods \\ Equipment Anumber ofmethods areavailable and have been used toidentify andquantitate asbestos concentrations inenvironmental samples. These methods include x-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, phase contrast and bright field optical microscopy, petrographic microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Each ofthese methods have certain advantages anddisadvantages [4,5]. However, many researchers today consider analytical electron ofchoice forstudies ofoccupational andenvironmental asbestos talc exposures, analytical transmission electron microscopy isemployed along with standard mineralogical microscopy. Theanalytical system consists ofacombination transmission-scanning with aside entry stage equipped with anenergy dispersive x-ray detector which isfitted through resolution ofless than 170electron volts, and spatial resolutions ofless than 0.5 micrometers are easily realized. This combination ofanalytical instrumentation permits visual characterization ofparticulate morphology such asfiber shape, length, anddiameter aswell microchemical analysis. Inaddition, surface topography maybefurther studied with this instrument byuseofthescanning mode ofoperation using secondary electron images.

Theacetone vapors destroy themicroporous structure ofthefilter byslow dissolution, receives a fairly heavy (^-200 A)carbon coat. This carbon coat aids inretaining particles during subsequent filter dissolution andalso provides forgreater thermal stability during microscopic examination. 4.Thefinal step isdissolution ofthemembrane filter anddeposition ofthe particles onto electron microscope grids. Amodified Jaffe Wick method is used whereby four Whatman filter papers aresaturated with acetone. Two- hundred mesh carbon filmed grids areused andthecoated filters areplaced sample side down onthem.

Using this counting criterion for atypical 90minute sample collected at2 liters per minute, the lower limit ofdetection isestimated tobeless than 0.1 fibers/cc. Precision andaccuracy estimates from studies oftheNIOSH phase contrast method [7] are considered generally applicable with acoefficient ofvariation of approximately \u00b125percent formost samples. Environmental Studies mentioned, alarge portion oftheNIOSH industry-wide study ofthetalc industry involves industrial hygiene studies ofworker exposures, including exposures to asbestiform minerals. One such operation recently studied involved amine and mill producing industrial talcs certified bythemining concern tobefree ofasbestos.

Weoffer general comments onthethree properties (chemical composition, morphology, structure). Chemical Composition Itiswell known that every mineral has aspecific chemical composition, andthat each mineral has anideal theoretical chemical formula (configuration). Unfortunately, many investigators overlook the fundamental point that chemical composition does not identify aspecific mineral. Asimple example will bring yet each will beidentified ascalcium carbonate. That istosay, chemical analyses will identify them allasthesame substance, where everyone knows that apearl isnotapiece ofchalk.

There arehosts ofminerals indifferent mineral classes whose particles have thesame shape.

For example, chrysotile asbestos is classified with thesheet silicates because ofitscrystal structure arrangement, structure Thermal Analysis X-ray Diffraction Diffraction Ingeneral then, nosingle property method which depends ononeproperty canidentify aspecific diffraction methods require some additional discussion primarily because they have received widespread attention byindustry andgovernment laboratories aspossible monitoring techniques.

Incontrast, current optical methods infederal regulatory proposals relating to asbestos presume that asbestos ispresent inthefirst place. Theanalyst then merely observes themineral particle forsize/shape.

Themethod inuseatJohns-Manville used of recovery was byradioactivity assumed tobehave asdidthegold standard [5]. Themethod Sinai Laboratories involved grinding with aglass andspiking thesamples with starting with aportion ofaparticulate matter sample taken ona cellulose acetate with a20nm 356 layer ofcarbon, thefilter substrate removed with acetone, andthecarbon film placed ona200mesh copper electron microscope support grid. Thesample isexamined at 20,000 Xwith atransmitting electron microscope (TEM), obtained from aworking curve constructed from data derived bycounting samples containing known amounts ofadded chrysotile. Synthetic standards were made byaddition ofknown quantities ofpulverized seasand, particulate matter andwater. Thesamples soprepared obtained byplotting count versus mass ofknown chrysotile added maybederived satisfactorily byadding weighed known chrysotile towater alone. Asbestos obtained from commercial supplies ofmineralogical samples included chrysotile, amosite (which constitutes almost allofthenon-chrysotile asbestos used in the U.S. commercially), andcrocidolite. Thechrysotile used inthedevelopmental work was a\"respirable pure\" white chrysotile Manville.

Although than that proposed byAmpian [6], itwould seem that lies inthehealth effects ofmineral fibers ofdifferent size and aspect ratio. Although health effects data will prove difficult toobtain, itseemed prudent tousethismoreconservative approach. 366 andprecautions were included inthemethod. Asbestos is, in Pact, aspecial type ofparticulate matter exhibiting arange ofparticle sizes, and should becollected and furnished totheanalytical laboratory. \\lthough each approach has advantages, itwas considered that the possibility of :ontamination, thepotential for loss from thefilter paper, andthegeneral lack of step were overriding disadvantages offiltration followed bydirect microscopic identification and leasurement oftheasbestos fibers. Because asbestos fiber diameters are below the range ofoptical microscopy techniques, electron microscopic methods must beemployed. Although scanning electron licroscopy (SEM) hasbeen suggested tobeapplicable [8], those laboratories that have ;ompared transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with SEMhave concluded that TEM isthe superior tool [1,4,9]. TEM allows examination atlow ('^'200x) and high ('^20,000x) magnification andgives excellent brightness andcontrast. Furthermore, most modern TEM instruments readily allow selected area electron diffraction (SAED) tobecarried outon individual ofpreparing step inthe analysis aminimum ofmovement. This goal becomes very difficult toachieve, largely because theasbestos fibers are in thecolloidal size range; movement apparently cantakeplace very easily. Twoapproaches acceptable forTEMsample preparation are: a.The condensation washer method, which isused when aMillipore filter is employed. b.TheJaffe Wick method, which isusedwith aNuclepore filter. Inthecondensation washing technique [1,3], acetone vapors arecondensed ina special reflux condenser attheposition just below theTEMgrids. Successful operation requires thedelicate introduction ofsufficient vapor todissolve orwash-off ofthedeposited fibers. Asaresult, close control and flow isrequired. McCrone [1]andLishka, .[3]claim study ofthecondensation washing technique, found, under hisexperimental conditions, amphibole fiber losses ranging from 37to60percent. Chrysotile fibers apparently areless mobile, forBeaman found losses ranging ofthecondensation step intheEPAprocedure. IntheNuclepore-Jaf feWick technique, theNuclepore filter iscarbon-coated ina vacuum before attempting thefilter from thegrid. Fixed bythecarbon toloss. material isdissolved away byasimple wicking action that can beobtained from several layers offilter paper inacovered Petri dish containing chloroform. The dissolving time, although longer than that for the condensation washer, canusually beaccomplished overnight. TheNuclepore filter iswell adapted tocarbon structure inthe grid film. Incontrast, theMillipore filter contains a fibrous-like structure that, when replicated, interferes with theTEMexamination. Cook [5]attheDuluth Environmental Research Laboratory, Nicholson andchemists atourlaboratory results with theJaffe Wick preparation Anadvantage ofthis that fiber replicas are rarely ifever observed gives substance totheconclusion that nosignificant loss or movement takes place during thepreparation process. Counting ofFibers Theprepared TEMgrid holding theasbestos examined atlowmagnification (300x-1000x) inorder todetermine whether the 368 broken carbon films, anewpreparation isrequired. Forthose natural waters that contain sufficient organic matter toobscure other particulates, the filtered material must besubjected tolow temperature ashing, resuspension, and fiItration. Theanalytical procedure 10,000-20 ,000x determining thenumber, dimensions, forthese Inthis method, several conversion andcount grid become important. Inthe EPAmethod, preparations inthis fixed area arecounted when thefiber concentrations Each and itstendency toform bundles ofsingle fibers makes it readily identifiable. For anunequivocal identification, however, aselected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ofchrysotile gives aunique line and atriple setofdouble spots onthesecond layer line. UICC standard asbestos fiber isalmost impossible ininterpreting theSAED pattern. Some amphibole fibers show only partial patterns that are notsufficiently beam, theelemental x-ray intensities are afunction of width. This variation with particle size can bepartially overcome, however, by determining x-ray intensity ratios. Butthese ratios, because ofdifferential absorption, are also afunction ofparticle size. Because ofthe difficulty ofspecifying quantitative procedures based upon x-ray intensities, theEPAmethod arelative standard deviation ofonly about 10percent canbeexpected. Inactual practice, from \u00b120percent if deviation ofanalyses ofthesame water sample inthesame laboratory will increase because ofsample preparation errors, and arelative standard deviation ofabout \u00b120-30 percent canbeachieved.

Many minerals have very essentially similar pattern ofchrysotile isnot strongly dependent onorientation analysis, foractinolite, isthat isalso ~5A.Because ofdifferences infragmentation ofthe two grunerite, occur different crystal lographic planes, sothepatterns areusually different. i389 Thecharacteristic growth habit ofamosite asbestos gives rise toafiber with the largest face on(100) which will then lieflat onelectron-microscope grids percent oftheamosite particles hadb*vectors within 10\u00b0ofthenormal totheelectron beam, thus indicating they Only 18percent ofthegrunerite particles hadthis ofamosite andgrunerite revealed that fiber formation by\"delamination\" andfragment formation bycleavage arealso evident inbulk samples, figure and Grunerite fibers.

Very large variability between laboratories has been reported [8], inpart due toproblems with sample preparation methods, particulate losses, contamination, casual identifications, subjective definition of3:1aspect ratio, andinherent statistical limitations. Particularly large variations canoccur forconditions ofrelatively high dust loadings. Inthis case theairsample andthecorresponding scale factor large.

However, this method will notwork onambient-air samples, which could contain alarge number of minerals orchemical compounds. Finally, automatic image-analysis facilities toprocess scanning electron-microscope images arecoming into use. Effective methods ofutilizing these devices are being developed toexpedite analysis ofairandwater samples by eliminating manual data logging andparticle counting andmeasurement. Physical Characteristics ofMineral Fragments Aside inidentifying andcounting amphibole andother mineral fragments, thevery pronounced distinctions physical characteristics and those ofasbestos must berecognized. Inaddition toobvious differences inparticle size and shape, more subtle features such ascrystal structure, face orientation, surface chemistry, associated impurities, lattice imperfections, andconcentration could well be important inthebiological response tosmall particles.

Several years ago, electron-microscope studies revealed that chrysotile fibers areactually hollow tubes [12]. Recently, high-resolution studies ofcross-sections ofcrocidolite the using electron optical methods iftheprocedures reviewed inthis report are followed. The most important precautions are: 1. Loss ofparticles orchanges intheir dimensions during specimen preparation must beavoided. 2. Crystal fragments must betilted into azone-axis orientation before areaelectron-diffraction with computed patterns foranyminerals that could occur inthesample. 400 4. X-ray emission spectral data from overlapping orclosely adjacent particles must bediscarded, effects ofparticle size online intensities must be recognized, anddata must becompared with well characterized reference standards. 5. Appropriate statistical criteria must beused tointerpret thesignificance of apparent particle concentrations. Inour view, adefinition ofafiber, incorporating thefollowing points, would resolve most analytical difficulties andremain compatible with allknown facts concerning health effects. 1.Aspect incount various laboratories.

Sum Thesample preparation isconsidered easier time-consuming than TEM, which requires preparation offilmed specimen grids for sample mounting. Additionally, andmost significant isthefact that bySEMscreening ofmagnitude greater than TEMmethods (0.1 mgvs.<0.01 mg). This difference becomes a major factor when investigating talc samples fortrace fiber content (<1000 ppm.). Transmission Electron Microscopy technique iscapable offurnishing acombination ofmorpho- logical and crystal structure data ofsmall single fibers which canresult invery conclusive identification. However, this method requires agood deal andaccuracy data, provides apositive identification. Wehave observed, however, many cases where workers have identified minerals through using only partial diffraction patterns; that istosay, only thehigh angle reflections (low numerical spacings). These spacings are very similar between silicate minerals making absolute identification impossible without themore conclusive lowangle reflections (high numerical spacings). Additionally, duetotheunique possibilities ofunusual mineral which are inmineralogy, themorphology ofafiber does not, andshould notindicate asbestos. Along these lines, some examples ofunexpected trace mineral fibers which have been encountered andsubsequently identified inspecific talc samples ordeposits are: bydefinition. All oftheindicated fibers have similar d-spacings inthehigh angle allows positive andundisputed identification ofmineral fibers, only under specific conditions are SAED patterns considered positive identification.

Preferred accuracy isobtained byshadowing thespecimen preparation with a gold oraluminum metal which thecamera constant tobe calculated directly ontheSAED pattern andacts asaninternal angles. 3.Where applicable, unit cell parameters should also beused to supplement fiber identification.

Wedonothave conclusive information onthecost ofsuch analyses counting andanalyses costs, theindustrial hygienist collecting thesamples can, under average conditions, obtain reliable samples foronly about five employees inoneday. This maygotoashigh astenemployees under good circumstances, but inother MESA Denver Technical Support Center iscurrently developing an innovative sampling pump which operates intermittently toobtain atime-weighted average exposure along with aconventional changing filters during theshift, inthenext issuccessful then slightly over thecost ofthe electron microscopic analysis. Since asingle filter would besufficient tomeasure the total time-weighted phase- contrast method, are factors which must beconsidered. However, there are noknown technical problems with this approach. There areseveral other practical problems with sampling andcounting asbestos using the membrane filter method and phase contrast microscopy. One ofthese isthe non-uniformity inthedeposition isnon-uniformity inthefilter manufacture. Figure 1 illustrates apattern ofdeposition onsome filter samples which were collected ata mining operation.

Hence, mineral identification byoptical microscope will only be applicable ingeneral toparticles with dimensions greater than themicroscope resolution. Atpresent wedonotdoanymineral analyses using optical microscopic techniques. Most oftheanalyses that wehave required have been done byDr.Clay Ruud whodiscussed his methods earlier during this conference. Thus far, Ihave discussed some methodological andtechnical considerations inherent inmesa's enforcement ofitsasbestos fiber standard. Now Iwould like toaddress what I believe tobeamore fundamental issue, ofthestandard itself. TheMining Enforcement andSafety Administration's current andproposed (revised) asbestos standard covers six minerals. Atleast four ofthese have definitely been associated with increased cancer incidence inhumans. These arecrocidolite, chrysotile, amosite, andanthophyl 1iteasbestos. Wealso know that these four minerals produce tumors inexperimental animals. Furthermore, weknow that other mineral fibers, whatever their mineralogical nature, produce similar tumors inexperimental animals, asreported inthis conference byDr.Mearl Stanton. Asaresult phase contrast, membrane filter method forevaluation. Using the animal experiments toextrapolate from known human carcinogens toother substances inasimilar class seems tometheprudent thing todo.This course notonly further reduce human orpetrographic analysis todetermine themineral species offibers. There isgreat concern among mine operators that such ageneral mineral fiber standard would impact upon every mining operation. Allminerals arelikely tohave fragments that meet than 5micrometers indiameter. Obviously theimpact of aregulation would seem tobeamore appropriate specification than anaspect ratio andminimum These seem tobethetwocritical parameters inanimal studies forinduction oftumors. Ina\"true\" asbestos mining and milling operation, reasonable variation inthese parameters will notgreatly affect the fiber count. However, inaniron mine orastone quarry, variations inthese parameters could properties areduetochemical orphysical properties. This isacrucial issue with the mining industry and isthecause fortheir great concern that the\"asbestos\" regulations will this information. To simply set allcarcinogens totheir lowest detectable limit does notmake sense. Itis easy berelatively uncontrolled.

As Isathere this morning andsawtheelectron Ibelieve isvery ourcurrent regulation. However, Iamalso looking forfuture revisions toourregulations, both the exposure levels and, more importantly, arewelooking atthecorrect minerals andthe correct particles? Forthose andnotwider industry.

The Commission has recently voted topropose bans ontheuseoffree-form asbestos inconsumer patching compounds and inartificial fireplace ash oremberizing materials under Section 8oftheConsumer Product Safety Act. The broad regulatory provisions under CPSA, aswell asthose under the Federal Hazardous hasreported levels ofairborne asbestos fibers exceeding theoccupational exposure levels. Direct evidence exists ofasbestos inhalation innon-occupational ly exposed individuals from autopsy findings ofasbestos fibers inlung tissue and indirect evidence ofasbestos-related cancers innon- lyexposed fromepidemiological studies. Arisk assessment hasbeen made ofthepotential increase oflung cancer deaths resulting from consumer exposure toasbestos containing patching compounds. Key Words: Artificial fireplace ash; consumer exposure; Consumer Product Safety Act Consumer several Acts tohelp itmarshal itsresources toreduce unreasonable risk ofinjury associated with consumer products. When risks ofinjury resulting from reasonable orreasonably foreseeable use of consumer products arebrought totheCommission's attention, either through petitions or through findings from in-house orexternally-sponsored studies, theregulatory mechanism which canmost free-form asbestos intwoconsumer products (consumer patching compounds andartificial under Section 8oftheConsumer Product Safety Act(CPSA) [16]^. ofthis comment. Inissuing itmust make special risk ofinjury, commence proceedings to develop safety addressed risk. Ifit appears that nofeasible standard canadequately protect thepublic, the Commission could declare that itisabanned hazardous product (Sec. 8 CPSA). Where theCommission concludes that aproduct presents an imminent andunreasonable ofdeath, serious illness, orsevere personal injury, theCommission mayfile inaU.S. district court an action isanimminent hazard ofthelong latency injuries appear inadequate forchronic hazard evaluation andregulation. Chronic hazard information most frequently comes from retrospective epidemiological occupational studies, case reports, andanimal studies. Chronic hazards arethemost silent type ofhazards because theconsumer isunknowingly exposed tochemical products which have hitherto assumed safe. Apartial list ofchronic hazards onwhich products. TheCommission hasconsidered onthecomplaint. Subsequently, inJuly 1976 1977, twopetitions were received seeking patching compounds. TheCommission thenproceeded toinvestigate: (a)what withmaximum compliance andminimum step wastodecide whether consumers could beexposed toasbestos. Direct andindirect evidence exists that individuals, other than those working directly with asbestos minerals, arebeing exposed toasbestos. Forexample, asbestos fibers whowere notoccupational lyexposed [6,7,14,23]. Substantial evidence also exists that human lungs mayharbor thousands of fibers, some ofwhich arechrysotile. However, thenumber ofasbestiform fibers found in non-occupational with thenumbers from emergency rooms were notsuitable forourneeds, other data were sought. Indirect evidence ofasbestos-caused adverse health effects was provided by epidemiological studies which showed malignant mesotheliomas, rare inthe general population, with 42diagnosed mesothelioma cases was conducted insoutheastern Pennsylvania. Ofthese, 8were neighborhood exposures and 10hadquestionable exposure. Among this group was a14year old boywhoalledgedly helped hisfather replace plasterboard Ithasalso been suggested that inhalation ofsmall numbers ofasbestos fibers over a long period oftime could result infocal concentrations atthelung bases, possibly reaching fibrogenic concentrations to thematrix orareencapsulated. Apotential health risk occurs when asbestos fibers become airborne, such asbymixing, sanding, orcleanup operations when using asbestos- containing patching tothepublic health, factory workers andasbestos insulation workers [20]. Measurements ofasbestos fibers longer than 5microns from work with wall-taping compounds were taken from data provided byRohl,Langer, Selikoff, andNicholson, [17]. Projections ofconsumer useand exposure were death rates from respiratory cancer based onthe 1970-71 vital statistics oftheUnited States were utilized. Theassumptions used intheriskassessment model arepresented below: (a) Thedose-response relationship between asbestos and lung cancer is linear [4]. This hypothesis assumes nothreshold. (b) deviation (Enterline andHenderson, 1976, risks ofdeath forthefirst 40years following exposure are considered tobenormal. (d) Risk caused death after thefirst figures were derived isgiven below.

Also, byassumption (b)thelognormal distribution shows that forthe28 years offollow-up used intheSelikoff paper only 24.4 percent ofthese deaths would have occurred.

With thepublication oftheOSHA Asbestos \"asbestos\" as years. OSHA wrote itsownmineralogical dictionary andmost other agencies merely followed suit.

These regulations, aspointed outbythechairman ofthis session, were proposed and promulgated under intense public andpolitical pressure inapanic situation without, I'm sure, of Itwasonly after anerroneous definition waspromulgated that theindustry gradually became aware that what they knew tobecommon rock- forming minerals present in essentially allmining operations hadsuddenly become \"Government Asbestos.\" Reaction tothis problem hasbeen slow incoming, because ofthegreat immediate pressure topour vast amounts oftime andmoney into complying with other government regulations regarding air andwater effluents, changes inequipment and material handling procedures, etc. Another reason for aslow reaction, however, hasbeen thegeneral belief that theregulatory agencies, once informed oftheir error, would immediately seek proper mineralogical information andmake thenecessary corrections to limit their regulations todeal with theknown hazards oftrue asbestos. This action not only hasn't taken place, buttheagencies have continued topropose and/or promulgate regulations aimed atboth lowering thepermissible level of\"government asbestos\" and 465 including more andmore mineral particles which bear noresemblance totrue asbestos, but which meet thesolecriteria forafiber (three times longer than they arewide). Inthefive years since theissuance oftheOSHA Asbestos Standard wehave with such constantly changing requirements.

Theoverall economic impact ofenforcement ofthepresent asbestos regulations using thepresent \"asbestos\" definitions covers such abroad range ofmining/milling activities that itwould beimpossible toeven mention them all areconfronted with this task. Inthose cases ofindustrial mineral operations where there arenotailings, since thetotal material mined becomes theproduct, theimpact ofasbestos more complex andacute.

It's scientific method they canfind fibers are. A.LANGER: Mr.Chairman, Iagree with thethrust insuggesting that wemay bedealing with different substances which mayhave different biological activities. This concept ismore than just recognized intheUnited Kingdom where they have twodifferent asbestos standards: One is forcrocidolite, which is0.2fiber arange ofproperties andsubsequent biological potential. Mr. Swents remarked that smokers have much greater lung cancer risk. That is absolutely correct. There isasynergism between cigarette smoking andasbestos fiber contribute tothehealth andprotection oftheir workers ifthey were toinsist that they don't smoke. That would mean that even ifthese particles were aspotent asasbestos composition, aword ofcaution isinorder. Inthepast they certainly have been formulated using PCB's (polychlorinatedbiphenols). From various studies ithas been observed that these materials arecarcinogenic inanimals; they cause birth defects in animals, andfurther that they areabsorbable through the skin. Now arereformulated andPCB I'mnotfamiliar with this aspect, but Ipresume they have quite low volatility. Oneofthegreater problems would presumably behandling, ifyougetiton your hands.

This opinion isnotaccepted byallthose concerned insome tothe Theagency does seek high risk industries ingeneral, andperhaps mayexert some effort outoftheordinary where it isdeemed that this industry isassociated with high risks. Butwehave notgone into any one ofthose industries for the last 18months andchosen aparticular conclusion. howto\"see\" asbestos fibers Theonly requirement isthat thesample becarbon coated rather than heavy metal coated toprevent specimen charging.

Wereally need some type ofinteragency committee on asbestos, however youwant todefine \"asbestos,\" let's usetheterm asbestos. Asbestos needs approach; Youcantalk topeople in industry, andthis isoneofthethings usually brought up. This agency says onething and OSHA comes inandsays this: Well, interagency approach might beneeded with asbestos and Iwould suggest very quickly that it: 1)come upwith some type offormal definitions that studies ArtLanger could tell usabout. They Itisnotthat easy, and Ithink that this type ofinter- agency group could come upwith some kind ofaprotocol list ofpriorities where weneed further research. Tomyknowledge this thing isagood example ofthis. Whether it's rational ornotthey get scared and they get very emotional. Ithink this issomething that's gottobedealt with. Youcannot that's just andother people have suggested also put inagood plug fortheneeded cooperation between these agencies. Gentlemen, notbeen cooperation particularly between theregulatory agencies arrayed here, OSHA, MESA, EPA, FDA, CPSC. Then youhave NIEHS andNIOSH, andsometimes what theright hand isdoing andwearetalking about something that kills people. So Iammaking avery strong plea foraninteragency task force, and Ithink wehave got thepeople inthis room you. J.LEINEWEBER: Iwould like tocomment ontheremarks that were just made. There areselected industry groups that have addressed themselves totheneeds forresearch and other work inthese areas. For example, theAsbestos Cement Pipe Industry has had workshops very similar tothis (perhaps onasmaller scale) toconsider theneeds oftheir particular industry Insulation Manufacturer's Association isconducting studies onsocalled man-made mineral fibers and their biological effects. Industry itself isdoing this. Ifthere aregovernment agencies that wish todothis, these agencies should also include industry inthese types ofstudies. Iwould suggest that instudying problems ofthis type weforget theword asbestos for awhile. Let's talk about biologically active fibers. Let's move away from \"Isthisasbestos orisitnot?\" Let's ask\"Isitabiologically active fiber?\" alot, regarding smoking andtheallowance ofsmoking by workers. Ithasbeen agreed here that itseems capital intheuseofthe word andintheproposed regulatory procedures. Ithasbeen shown that commercial asbestos canhave serious biological effects, but there islittle ornoevidence tocommercial asbestos youneed toknow the risk factor.
