She was joined by other experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, to discuss the incredible race for a COVID vaccine.

Attended by all faculty and select staff members, this annual retreat allows for discussion and strategic planning in regards to items such as faculty development, course offerings, graduate programs, etc. Facilitated by Peihua Qiu, PhD, MS, all attendees were encouraged to contribute to the conversation in an open dialogue format. Dr. Qiu took the opportunity and gave a brief history of the department, highlighting many accomplishments during his almost 8 years as founding chair, encouraging continued growth and new ideas. At the end of the day, several action items were generated from the day's discussions. These items will take priority over the next few months and will help to improve many aspects of the department.

Bisesi and Martyniuk Receive NIH Grant Joseph Bisesi, PhD, MS, and Chris Martyniuk, PhD, MS, have received a grant to study the effects of brominated flame retardants on thyroid hormone synthesis negative feedback loops. Environmental chemical exposures can disrupt hormones in the body, causing adverse health outcomes. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are chemicals that are used as flame retardants on clothing and furniture. These chemicals are persistent environmental contaminants and can be detected in human blood and urine. One major target of exposure is the thyroid hormone system in animals and humans, but the mechanisms are unclear as to how these chemicals induce hyper or hypothyroidism in animal models and humans. This NIH sponsored project focuses on a specific thyroid receptor called thyroid receptor beta 2 which is involved in regulating thyroid production in the central nervous system.

Of the 32 abstracts submitted in the Public Health category, 19 were authored by Epidemiology PhD and MSE students. Epidemiology students also took home all three awards in the Public Health category! First-year PhD student Anna Wang ( [Substance Use group](https://research.phhp.ufl.edu/group-3a-substance-use/)) third place; first-year PhD Fitzgerald ( [Modeling and and third-year PhD student Sara Nutley ( [Health and Wellness group](https://research.phhp.ufl.edu/group-3b-health-and-wellness/)) tied for first place. Congratulations to the winners and to all 19 Epidemiology students who presented at Research Day!

This three-year collaborative project with Moffitt Cancer Center and University of Miami will build a comprehensive research infrastructure with standardized collection of epidemiologic data and urine, stool, and breast tissue samples for future breast cancer prevention research. The unique resources assembled through this initiative have the potential to yield valuable new findings with rapid impact for breast cancer prevention in Florida and beyond.

Despite significantly lower weight among 'normal weight' adults compared to those receiving bariatric surgery, significant differences were not observed between the two groups for cardiometabolic measures, suggesting substantial normalization of cardio metabolic risk after bariatric surgery among US adults.

Submitted by Lance Jackson | | Dr. Mainous' Study Suggests Single Provider Patients Prescribed Unnecessary Tests Having a personal physician has a number of health benefits and carries a particular trust between a patient and their health care provider. Although there are many pros, there may be a hidden concern associated with seeing one primary care physician. Arch Mainous, PhD, MA, along with a UF research team, performed a study to discover the link between single provider care and unnecessary medical testing. This study is the first to explore whether continuity of care will lead patients to accept low value or harmful care based on recommendations from their primary care provider. The ultimate goal is to ensure that health care providers are giving the best quality care for their patients.

Following the presentation, UFOT held a session titled \"DEI Conversations\" where we discussed the implications of the presentation on OT in general and OTD students in particular. In March, faculty members and students in our department contributed to PHHP-DEI week by leading two workshops and presenting six posters.
