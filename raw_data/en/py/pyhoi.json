The Doctor of Acupuncture program is designed to educate and develop graduates to meet the growing need and opportunities for well-trained Chinese medical practitioners to serve in numerous types of integrative medicine settings across the country. It builds on the outcomes and competencies of the Master of Acupuncture toward achieving full clinical competency, with the addition of 28 doctoral-specific competencies in the domains of research literacy, advanced diagnostic studies, systems-based medicine, and professional development, along with an enhanced clinical training. The program prepares graduates to work in a multitude of clinical environments, including integrative healthcare settings alongside practitioners in allopathic and other complementary health fields. As a graduate of this program, you will be recognized as a doctor, both professionally and publicly, and will be prepared to work as a vital part of multidisciplinary healthcare team. The Doctor of Acupuncture program is designed for individuals who wish to become an acupuncturist, apply research literacy to an evidence-based approach, and work in conventional medical and healthcare settings as well as private practice. Alumni of MUIH's Master's level acupuncture program who are interested in a doctoral program in acupuncture (with or without a Chinese herbal medicine specialization) should visit the [ acupuncture doctoral completion webpage](https://muih.edu/academics/acupuncture/doctoral-completion-programs/). MUIH offers four master's and doctoral programs in acupuncture and herbal medicine: Master of Acupuncture , Master of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization, Doctor of Acupuncture , and Doctor of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization. All four programs prepare students to achieve full clinical competency in acupuncture and to become highly skilled, integrative acupuncturists. Each program has unique characteristics that prepare students for different career tracks and aspirations. All of MUIH's master's and doctoral programs in acupuncture and herbal medicine blend acupuncture approaches from two healing traditions, Constitutional Five Element Acupuncture (CFEA) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with contemporary science as the basis for treating the whole person. The programs provide a comprehensive understanding of the classical and theoretical foundations of the field of acupuncture and introduce students to biomedicine from an integrative and holistic perspective. They emphasize self-cultivation and healership through a curriculum that is rigorous, transformative, and relationship centered. By drawing upon ancient wisdom and the gifts of nature students will learn to choose their words and actions intentionally in order to be a healing presence that supports their patients. These programs develop highly skillful and compassionate practitioners who offer acupuncture as a catalyst for healing and wellness, as well as for increased self-awareness and personal transformation. Additionally, the programs provide a solid foundation in career development, practice management, and the business skills necessary to build a practice or enter the workforce and participate in today's growing healthcare field. All four programs share these highlights: The Doctor of Acupuncture program has the following specific characteristics, in addition to the above highlights shared by all programs: [Click here to view](https://muih.edu/academics/acupuncture-oriental-medicine/#comparativeSummary) an expanded description of the program highlights, learning outcomes, and curriculum of the Doctor of Acupuncture program, and how it differs from the Doctor of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization, Master of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization, and Master of Acupuncture degrees. |Trimester of Entry:||Fall, Spring| |Application Deadlines:|| | Complete Essay Questions in application: Additional English language proficiency requirements apply for [international students](https://muih.edu/admissions/admission-requirements-by-program/international-students/).

Each state, including Maryland, has specific licensure or registration procedures that must be met. Governmental laws, regulations, legal opinions, and requirements differ from country to country and state to state. MUIH cannot provide assurance that completion of the program will qualify a graduate to be registered or accepted under a state law other than Maryland. However, the University's Doctor of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization program is designed to provide basic, solid competence in traditional acupuncture. There may be a waiting period between the completion of the program and the legal recognition allowing the graduate to begin practice. Until a graduate receives official notification of legal recognition to begin practice, she or he may continue to practice only under faculty supervision. Students who wish to continue to practice in Maryland after graduating, but prior to being licensed, must enroll in MUIH's Trainee Program. Most states require successful completion of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine exam. For more information, refer to [nccaom.org](http://nccaom.org). Graduates wishing to practice in Maryland may be licensed by applying to the Maryland Board of Acupuncture. MUIH is approved by the Maryland Higher Education Commission to award a Doctor of Acupuncture Medicine degree, and the program conforms to Maryland laws and regulations regarding the practice of acupuncture. For requirements for licensure in Maryland, contact: Maryland Board of Acupuncture, 4201 Patterson Avenue, Room 311 Baltimore, MD 21215; phone 410-764-4766 or 800-530-2481; or online at [health.maryland.gov/bacc/](http://health.maryland.gov/bacc/). For eligibility to apply for licensure, other states may stipulate additional requirements, such as completion of a course in Chinese herbs or clinical hours beyond what is required by MUIH. Individuals who wish to practice in a state other than Maryland are advised to check the licensing requirements of that state by contacting the medical or acupuncture regulating agency in each state. Additional information regarding licensure is available in the State Licensure Determination document on MUIH's [Student Consumer Information webpage](https://muih.edu/admissions/financial-aid/policies/student-consumer-information/) and in the [Academic Catalog](https://muih.edu/academics/academic-catalog). The following programs offered by Maryland University of Integrative Health are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine (ACAHM): (2) [Master of Acupuncture with a Chinese herbal medicine specialization](https://muih.edu/academics/acupuncture/master-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/) (4) [Doctor of Acupuncture with a Chinese herbal medicine specialization ](https://muih.edu/academics/acupuncture/doctor-acupuncture-chinese-medicine/) (5) [Certificate in Chinese herbal medicine](https://muih.edu/academics/acupuncture/post-baccalaureate-certificate-in-chinese-herbal-medicine/) [currently named Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Chinese Herbs] Accreditation status and notes may be viewed on the [ACAHM Directory](https://acahm.org/directory-menu/directory/). ACAHM is recognized by the United States Department of Education as the specialized accreditation agency for institutions/programs preparing acupuncture practitioners. ACAHM does not accredit any programs at the undergraduate/bachelor level. ACAHM is located at 500 Lake Street, Suite 204, Excelsior, MN 55331; phone 952/212-2434; [www.acahm.org](https://acaom.org/). Graduates of MUIH's acupuncture and herbal medicine programs are employed in a variety of settings including private practice; integrative group practices; health care systems; hospitals; wellness centers; pain management centers; addiction treatment centers; behavioral and mental health centers; fertility centers; veterans and military organizations and agencies; state and local health departments; and colleges and universities. Many graduates chose to have a portfolio career in which they have multiple positions and employers within one or more profession, rather than one full-time job. A portfolio career provides such individuals with variety in their work life and the opportunity to develop a wide and varied professional network. The career outlook for acupuncture and herbal medicine (AHM) practitioners is strong, and national statistics indicate that individuals pursuing such careers successfully earn income and either establish a solo practice or are hired into a number of different healthcare settings. The AHM career track has been categorized as a \"BrightOutlook\" occupation by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicating that this occupation is predicted to experience rapid growth during the years 2018-2028. BLS predicts a much faster than average (11%) employment growth for AHM practitioners during this time period. The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) reports that approximately 72% of acupuncture and herbal medicine practitioners are actively working in clinical practice with a majority of those practitioners reporting a solo practice being their primary practice setting. NCCAOM also reports that there has been a significant increase in employment in hospital and integrative care settings; the percentage of acupuncturists employed or contracted in these settings grew from 6% in 2008 to 10% in 2015. NCCAOM job analysis statistics indicate that 36% of AHM practitioners reported a total gross income (before taxes) of $40,000-$100,000 with 11% reporting gross incomes of $100,000 and above; the BLS reports the median average salary for AHM practitioners in 2017 was $73,830.
