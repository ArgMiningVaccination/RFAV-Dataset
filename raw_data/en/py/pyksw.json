Her products supposedly are more effective \u2014 they gain more \"vitality\" \u2014 because she [puts them near crystals](/wiki/Crystal_woo), and [chants to them](/wiki/Faith_healing), and [plays music to them](/wiki/Sound_healing). There's no evidence for this, but it sure does market well. History[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] de Mamiel originally worked in finance, until the death of her boss. In 1998, she was diagnosed with [cancer](/wiki/Cancer). To reduce the effects of chemotherapy on her skin, and [because she felt that chemotherapy was \"unnatural\"](/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), she began creating her own natural skin products. She later studied [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine), [acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture), [aromatherapy](/wiki/Aromatherapy), and [chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic) which are considered [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). She appears to actively practice acupuncture and TCM in London.

[[15]](#cite_note-15) Production process[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] \"\"Maybe *this* is why my cosmetics company failed. See, when I blended the ingredients I'd say things like \"Fuck you, oil! You're worthless!\", flower essence!\" |\u2014\"Space Cadet\"| de Mamiel describes her production process as follows: - \"We put around [Sound healing](/wiki/Sound_healing)x1) - ( - \"As we add the base oils, we use more music, crystals, and we add the flower essences, they sit out with music, too.\" [[1]](#cite_note-Goop-1) - ( [Sound healing](/wiki/Sound_healing)x3) - ( - \"In the blending room we say blessings of love and grace and gratitude; I add the oils in a certain order, and I chant as I blend them. [....] Each product has \"I like to burn frankincense as I do it, to clear the room\u2014it's sacred, energizing, and such a pure smell.\" [[1]](#cite_note-Goop-1) - [Aromatherapy](/wiki/Aromatherapy)x1) - ( - \"We have added flower essences to each of the oils to work upon the body's [acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture) [meridians](/wiki/Meridians)too.\" [[16]](#cite_note-16) - ( [Acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture)x1) - ( - Once the blend is ready I meditate. Usually three words of intention come up for me in that meditation, and I like to put those on the label.\" [[1]](#cite_note-Goop-1) - ( [Faith healing](/wiki/Faith_healing)x3) macerates for two months.\" [[1]](#cite_note-Goop-1) - (Something that's actually reasonable x1) de Mamiel estimates the process takes six to eight weeks, presumably to give the skin cleansing product time to reflect on its existence and become more positive-minded. Other product problems[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] \"\"Because, as we all know, applying lotion to your body is pointless unless it has been treated with |\u2014| The woo doesn't stop there. \"Holistic\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] de Mamiel promotes her oils as [\"holistic\" or \"syngetistic\"](/wiki/Holistic_medicine). For example: Seasonal Facial Oils offer a new take on ageing by treating skin holistically because what is happening inside and around us will reflect on our faces. I personally select each plant extract in these precious oils and hand blend them so they work synergistically with mind and skin, putting back what nature and our lifestyles take away. [[17]] It is unclear how de Mamiel's mass-marketed skin lotion can be any more \"holistic\" (specific to a patient, and inclusive of the entirety of what ails them) than any other mass-marketed skin lotion. \"Cleanse\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=5)] de Mamiel offers numerous products. [[18]](#cite_note-C1-18) [[19]](#cite_note-C2-19) [[20]](#cite_note-20) Given that most \"cleanse\" products claim to remove a \" [toxin](/wiki/Toxin)\" from the body, yet de Mamiel's products remain on the body (and would eventually move into it), it's unclear what it's cleansing, or how. Spirits[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] She constantly appeals to the human \" [spirit](/wiki/Spirit)\" (yet she simultaneously fails to prove that one exists, or that her cleanses actually impact the soul): My lifeline for a tired body and a spent spirit, I use this rich, glimmering serum in the evenings to bring a sense of calmness, to nourish and deeply moisturise my skin and soul. I added a subtle shimmer to Revitalising Body Serum for a sense of glamour - it is my ultimate mind and body treatment. [[21]] Nature![ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=7)] Above all else, she [glorifies anything \"natural\"](/wiki/Appeal_to_nature), as if it was somehow better: My brand is not just about how to apply the products to your skin, but how to reduce stress in your life. We've cut ourselves off from what mother nature is doing. All the people I treat live in an artificial environment - artificial heat, cold and light. Many people are stressed from this and there's no sense of belonging to natural environments. I create small rituals to help us through that process. [[2]] The ingredients in our products are naturally sourced and blended in small quantities which may result in some slight variations in colour and aroma from time to time. This is one of mother nature's subtleties which we wholeheartedly embrace. [[22]] She does at least warn that nature isn't all-good: One can have a reaction to a natural product as easily as a synthetic one. In fact, essential oils can cause some of the most common allergic reactions, which is why, when working with them, you really need to know what you're doing, not just mix them up and hope for the best! [[23]] Prices[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] \"\"0.34 a mere $44. But take heart: the snake oil is free, and it's glorious. |\u2014Ruth Graham| Selected prices: - Spring Facial appeals to [ancient traditions](/wiki/Appeal_to_ancient_wisdom) \u2014 specifically those of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has no scientific basis: \"\"Spring is the season of the wood element in Chinese medicine, representing new life and growth. It's the perfect time to cleanse and de-congest skin. \"\"I also love anything that is green - in Chinese medicine, green is the colour of energy for the liver. Green food smooths out our body's flow of energy ensuring that we are able to cope with things and not get bogged down and stagnant - so we are feeding our minds as well as our bodies This is one of her most common ways of expressing why what she does works. [[28]](#cite_note-28) [[29]](#cite_note-29) Food woo[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Annee_de_Mamiel&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] She doesn't like She thinks [detoxing](/wiki/Detox) can \"give our digestive systems a rest\", but that diets should be \"balanced\". [[23]](#cite_note-Cal-23) She at least tries to reduce the carbon cost of her products. [[23]](#cite_note-Cal-23) "}
