Mainly only manicures and facials were considered a wellbeing self-care. People turned to holistic practitioners for bad backs, and poor digestion but only a few were looking for increased energy levels. It was something that people were expecting to decline or felt it was not modest to have in high quantity. British stiff upper lip has also reflected in stiff upper chakras! In my first book Energy Secrets, published 20 years ago, I was even encouraging people not to settle for low energy. How time has changed!! Energy has become the hottest currency! Naturally, as a healer, I am thrilled that people started to look for ways to increase their life force. However, this desire is also manipulated by multiple food/supplement companies that promise more energy but peddle highly caffeinated and highly processed \"energy\" drinks and supplements. We have to draw a line between stimulants and energy. It's not the same!! Stimulants give you high but destroy your energy! It does not matter if the source of the caffeine is green tea, some fancy organic coffee bean or an exotic plant. It's a caffeine. Full stop. So many \" energy\" supplements and drinks are full of this. The only thing that they do is exploit your adrenal glands for the release of adrenaline and cortisol and the subsequent rush of high. If you want real energy drinks, it's warm water, broth, vegetable smoothies, fenugreek, ginger or cumin water, etc. Caffeinated, processed, sugar-packed supplements and \" health\" drinks have nothing in common with high energy but instead are life force and cells-destroying hormone manipulators. Make informed choices and protect your energy. "}
