In this particular grid, we will focus on the things that will help strengthen your immune system and help to heal any ailments that you might have (alongside the advice from your health care physician). The geometric shape to get this grid started is the Seed of Life. This plants the seed of health and you can watch it slowly grow over time as you use this grid more and more. The center stone is a very calming Amethyst to boost your immune system and reduce stress. This allows your body to focus on staying healthy. Around the Amethyst is small pieces of Ruby and Blue Kyanite. Ruby is chosen because it helps with your vitality. It works to strengthen your heart and detoxify your body. This has powerful energies to keep your head up and your body healthy. Blue Kyanite is an amazing crystal for health, wellness, and overall energetic revitalization. It works on your metabolism and purifies your body. The next circle of crystals is an energetic Carnelian. This heightens the body's defense and increases the absorption of vitamins that your body needs in order to stay healthy. The outside circle of crystals are Bloodstone. Not only will this crystal help you ward off the cold and flu, but will also help bring your health back to normal after you have suffered from an illness. It helps to purify your blood to keep your immune system nice and strong. To activate this grid and connect the energies of all the crystals together I have chosen a Labradorite wand to help transform your body into a healthy vessel so that you can live your best life.
