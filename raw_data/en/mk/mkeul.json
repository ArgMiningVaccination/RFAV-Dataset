At the time of this submission, UTMB has 959 patient beds across 88 hospital and clinic locations. Galveston The academic and administrative center of UTMB is located at the 81-acre campus in Galveston. This includes over 1.8m gross square feet of patient care, 2.1M GSF of administrative space, 1M GSF Research and 1.1M GSF of academic space. While undergoing major renovations, The Galveston campus currently has 453 total Beds. UTMB's major teaching hospital, the Jennie Sealy Hospital, is a new $438 million inpatient facility featuring 310 patient rooms, with 54 dedicated ICU beds, a 28-bed day surgery unit and 20 state-of-the-art operating suites. Angleton-Danbury In 2014 we acquired a 62-bed hospital in Angleton-Danbury. UTMB Health Angleton Danbury Campus is an acute care hospital serving the communities of Angleton, Danbury, Rosharon, and the surrounding areas. The first trauma-designated facility in Brazoria County, the facility and its care teams serve more than 60,000 lives from throughout southern Brazoria County. The Angleton Danbury Campus provides a variety of quality services including cardiac rehabilitation, cardiology, colorectal surgery, general surgery, neurodiagnostics, neurology, ediatric and adult primary care, plastic surgery, pulmonary and sleep medicine, pulmonary rehabilitation, diabetes care, surgical oncology, thoracic surgery, urology, vascular surgery, women's healthcare as well as a 24 Hour emergency services, an ACR-accredited mammography program, cardiopulmonary clinical laboratory, diagnostic imaging services, and physical therapy. This campus houses 52 total beds, including 16 med-surge, 9 ICU, and 27 LDRP. In March of 2018 UTMB purchased 177 acres to expand the hospital campus. League City We constructed a 90-bed hospital in League City that became fully operational in 2018. The League City Campus offers advanced health care services to patients in a soothing, healing environment designed by patients, families, and staff. Architecture, decor, and design all reflect a healing environment and a hospital that cares for the patient's mind, body and spirit. Each private, state-of-the-art patient room supports a team-based, patient- and family- centered approach to care. Our League City Campus delivers the finest inpatient and outpatient care for a variety of services - from top-notch orthopedic and rehabilitation specialists and advanced imaging and laboratory services. This campus also includes our partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center. Clear Lake We have leased another 250-bed hospital in Clear Lake constructed in 2015 that we opened in March of 2019. We have also constructed multiple primary care and multispecialty clinics in the League City/Clear Lake area, both rapidly growing Houston suburbs. Our Clear Lake hospital includes 24/7 ER, imaging, medical/surgical suites, pediatrics, ICU, Ob/Gyn labor and delivery / post-partum and NICU, ORs, Endo, interventional radiology, and cardiology. UTMB also has an extensive outreach network comprising more than 100 regional clinics in a > 250-mile radius catchment area throughout southeast Texas, serving an ethnically and economically diverse patient population. UTMB Health System is in an unprecedented period of renewal and growth, focused on the mainland communities between Galveston and Houston. These four campuses and over 100 clinics serve as the backbone for our clinical research environment. It provides CTSA research teams access to several million electronic health records, pediatric, geriatric and minority populations. Telemedicine To better serve Texans living in remote areas, The University of Texas System uses a network of technology to increase access to basic and specialized health care. Telemedicine uses specialized video conferencing to enable health care providers to assess and treat patients without being in the same room or even the same building or city. UT institutions already are leaders in this type of care delivery, especially UT Medical Branch in Galveston, which has been practicing telemedicine for more than 20 years, providing care remotely to Texas prison inmates, cruise ship passengers, researchers in Antarctica as well as patients in rural areas. UTMB averaged 158,438 telemedicine encounters in 2018. UTMB has been providing telemedicine services for the United States Antarctic Program for more than a decade, including for the prior Antarctic contractor (RPSC). Under our agreement with Lockheed Martin, UTMB Health established a Center for Polar Medical Operations in Galveston to manage health services at the three stations operated by the U.S. McMurdo Station, Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, and Palmer Station - as well as numerous seasonal field camps and two marine research vessels operated year-round. Clinical experts at UTMB Health are always available via video teleconference, telephone, or radio to assist in challenging clinical management issues. Our Telemedicine technology was used to spin-off the company NuPhysicia which is a health care provider for oil rigs in the South China Sea, the Persian Gulf, Atlantic, and the Caribbean. UTMB also provides healthcare to about 80 percent of Texas prisoners. UTMB has been providing telemedicine in Texas Prisons since 1994. The Virtual Health Network will build on the system's existing capabilities, providing the infrastructure to connect all of UT's health institutions and medical schools under one statewide telemedicine network. The Virtual Health Network initially was established in 2016, when the UT System Board of Regents approved $10.8 million to improve access to underserved areas of Texas, enhance patient care and increase coordination and collaboration among experts systemwide. These funds are used to provide telemedicine technology interoperability between multiple sites. UTMB serves as the major site for the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO)- accredited Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) Correctional Managed Care (CMC) Hospital. The TDCJ serves as a referral site for 13 inpatient infirmaries and 83 ambulatory clinics, responsible for 80% of the TDCJ population (188K admission annually), one of the largest prison populations in the Western world. The UTMB TDCJ Hospital remains the first and only hospital specializing in offender care on the campus of a major medical center and teaching institution. The challenges with physician access in the CMC population have driven the implementation of extensive telemedicine programs that now serve as a model for other states and correctional organizations.
