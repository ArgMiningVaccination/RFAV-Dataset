They contain no biochemical substance but are pure energetic imprints of the source from which they have been extracted. According to Dr Bach, the 37 flowers that are chosen for the remedies as also the spring water for one of the remedies are of \"higher vibration\". It means the frequency at which they vibrate are higher than that of living beings, including human beings, when in negative emotional states. Human emotions resonate with the vibrational frequency that they generate. The higher the vibrational frequency, the greater the expansion and greater the Life Force in our cells. The lower the vibrational frequency, the greater the contraction, and lesser the Life Force in our cells. For example, Enlightenment has the highest frequency of 700+ and the greatest expansion of energy. The vibrational frequency of joy is 540 and is expansive. The vibrational frequency of anger is 150 and is contractive. Over 27 years of research at UCLA by Dr Valerie Hunt clearly associates higher bio-electric fields with greater intelligence, mature emotional balance with less stress, and overall higher states of physical health. The higher frequency with which the essence of Bach Flower remedies vibrates also correspond to positive emotions and a greater overall sense of well-being. When ingested, these remedies harmonize the vibrations of lower frequencies (corresponding to negative emotions) and turn them into positive. Resulting in the generation of nourishing and beneficial neuropeptides in our body which in turn [strengthens our immune system](https://www.thehealthsite.com/fitness/diet/coronavirus-diet-bolster-your-immune-system-with-these-6-healthy-drinks-774468/). For example, the remedy that changes the frequency of fear to the frequency of joy, makes our body quickly switch from releasing adrenalin and cortisol to releasing endorphins, causing blood to flow and nourish the immune system. This approach to enhancing our immunity by strengthening our cellular health through positive emotions has also been discussed and proven in his landmark research with epigenetics by Dr Bruce Lipton, of the Biology of Belief fame. Thus, it is logical to assume that ingesting Bach Flower remedies, or even spraying on our aura, does enhance immunity to [viral infections](https://www.thehealthsite.com/photo-gallery/foods-that-can-improve-your-immune-response-prevent-viral-infections-720510/).
