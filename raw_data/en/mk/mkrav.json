Kulig, RN, DNSc1 Cathy J. Meyer, MSc, DipEd2 Shirley Cathy E. Lichtenberger, BN4 Sharon L. Myck, BN4 ABSTRACT Background: Immunization is a necessary component of well child services within public health. Despite the documented effectiveness of vaccines, some parents choose to refuse or delay immunization for their children. Adherence to different beliefs has affectedimmunization coverage in one Regional Health Authority in Southwest Alberta. Methods: This qualitative study involved exploratory, descriptive open-ended interviews with a sample of 47. The sample included people of Dutch ethnic background, Hutterites, and parents and practitioners who engage in alternative health beliefs and practices. Results: Major findings include: 1) among the Dutch, most noted their decision to refuse to immunize was based on religious beliefs; 2) the Hutterites' decision not to immunize was due to their experiences with adverse reactions but was further supported by their use ofalternative health; and, 3) the alternative health group are more concerned with the safetyof vaccines with regard to the short- and long-term effects on their children's health. Discussion: All three groups conveyed a common concern of child health and safety. Educational initiatives need to be implemented to allay parents' fears. Community development activities with individuals of the groups included here who supportimmunization will increase acceptance of immunization.Immunization is a necessary and effec- tive component of well child serviceswithin public health, but some parents choose to refuse or delay immunization fortheir children. Reasons given for thisinclude concerns with side effects, adher-ence to specific religious beliefs, or a disbe-lief in the effectiveness of the immuniza-tion. 1-3Adherence to such different beliefs has affected immunization coverage in oneRegional Health Authority (RHA) inSouthwest Alberta. The measles rate in thisarea (20/100,000) is 4The 1999-2000 measles outbreak (2,961 cases) in theNetherlands resulted in the deaths of threechildren yet the local Dutch participants inCanada failed to acknowledge measles as aserious disease. When the outbreakoccurred in Southwest Alberta from Dutchvisits (i.e., 28 cases in Canada with17 cases in Southern Alberta), 5most par- ticipants were indignant that their schoolwas closed by the RHA and stringent con-trol measures were taken. 6 In addition to the Dutch population, the RHA identified two other groups (i.e.,the Hutterites and parents and practition-ers who engage in alternative health beliefsand practices) who either refused ordelayed immunization. The findingsreported here were generated from aresearch study conducted with these threegroups to answer the question: What arethe beliefs of persons who choose not toimmunize or to delay immunization fortheir children? METHODS A qualitative study was conducted becausethere was no information available regard-ing immunization beliefs and decisions toimmunize among the Dutch, Hutteritesand alternative health proponents in ourregion. An exploratory, descriptive studywas conducted consisting of open-endedinterviews with a sample size of 47. Thepurpose of the study was to determine theideas and beliefs of the groups noted abovewho advocate for refusal or delay of immu-nization among children. Ethical approvalhad been obtained from the first author'suniversity and the RHA. All of the inter-views were audio-taped and confidentiallytranscribed after informed consent wasobtained and demographic information The translation of the Abstract appears at the end of the article.

MARCH - APRIL 2002 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 109REFUSALS AND DELAY OF IMMUNIZATION collected. A research guide developed by the authors was then used to conduct theinterview and field notes were prepared.There were core questions for each group,but unique questions were developed toensure the full understanding of the con-text of refusing and delaying immunizationamong each of the groups. Despite the sen-sitivity of the issue being studied, adequatesample size was achieved and individualsspoke freely about their beliefs. On averagethe interviews lasted 60 minutes and wereconducted in the participants' homes,except for the practitioners where theywere held in their offices. The analysis con-sisted of frequent reading of the transcriptsto identify themes. Sampling Purposeful sampling was used to obtainthe sample of alternative health practition-ers and therefore the research assistant(RA) identified and telephoned all localalternative health practitioners (30 chiro-practors and 3 naturopaths). Although theCanadian Chiropractic Association advo-cates vaccines as safe and effective, 73 of the chiropractors had strong negative viewson immunization and refused to be inter-viewed. In total, 8 chiropractors and2 naturopaths were selected for interview-ing. If the practitioners were also parents,they were asked further questions regardingimmunization status for their own families. To meet the privacy clauses within the RHA, both the Dutch and alternativehealth parents were contacted by letter andasked to participate in the study. Membersof the advisory committee were also publichealth nurses (PHN); they sent the letters,did telephone follow-up and kept a list ofnames that was passed on to the RA. Thealternative health group (modal age = 33years) consisted of 16 participants (10 pro-fessionals and 6 laypersons) representing13 families having a total of 50 children. Intotal, 21 Dutch participants (modal age =30 years) were interviewed. This included16 families having a total of 70 children. Hutterites are one of the Anabaptist groups who live a communal lifestyle. Thefirst author had a pre-existing professionalrelationship with one of the colonies andthus established first contact through thismeans. As this is a closed society, permissionwas obtained for the first and second authorsto come to the colony and discuss immu-nization with the colony boss. After this ini- tial contact, the RA visited three othercolonies. There were 10 Hutterite partici-pants (modal age = 38 years) representing10 families having a total of 42 children. RESULTS Table I highlights the major findings from all three groups. Note that not all of thecomments about immunization were nega-tive. Of the 10 alternative health care prac-titioners, 3 supported immunization and2 others had neutral stands. The practi-tioners who support immunization see it ascomplementary to their own alternativehealth practice. All of the 6 laypersons hadeither been fully or partially immunized.Among this group, 2 supported immuniza-tions but had delayed vaccinations with2 of their children for specific reasons. Inone case, the child had developed a fear ofneedles, and the other had a reaction afterthe vaccine. Among the Hutterites, inter-views were conducted with the Lehreleut(pro-immunization) and Dariusleut (anti-immunization) sects. The Lehreleut minis-ter who was interviewed for the study con-firmed that he supports the colony mem-bers in receiving vaccinations. OneLehreleut woman who supported immu-nization was also interviewed. The remain-ing 8 participants were all members of theDariusleut sect who indicated that thedecision to immunize rests with the moth-er and not with the church. Major reasons for refusing or delaying immunizationThree of the alternative health practition-ers were firmly anti-immunization and onebelieved immunizations should be delayed. Several shared anti-immunization literaturewith their clients but others would not doso unless specifically asked. Within thealternative health and Dutch groups, therewere concerns expressed about the use ofthe hepatitis B vaccine. Some of the practi-tioners indicated that this vaccine is onlyappropriate if children become drug usersor prostitutes. The parents of both thesegroups shared a similar concern; theybelieved the hepatitis B vaccine was onlyuseful to prevent sexually transmitted dis-eases for which they did not believe theirchildren were at risk. A number of the alternative health pro- ponents did not believe that their childrenwere at risk for diseases such as polio ordiphtheria. Instead, they saw these as affili-ated with third-world countries. The beliefwas that if they did obtain these diseases, itwould provide the person with life-longnatural immunity that would be superiorto any synthetic vaccine. The Dutch noted their religion had an impact on their refusal to immunize, par-ticularly for the members of theNetherlands Reformed Church or theReformed Congregation of NorthAmerica. All indicated that an anti-immunization stance is not discussed dur-ing the formal church service but that areligious interpretation for why they donot immunize is based upon the Psalter. 8 The latter indicates that immunizing chil-dren challenges the will of God. They fur-thermore commented about man's sinfulbehaviour leading ultimately to illness. This group compared the acceptance of immunization to the beliefs surroundingassurance versus insurance.

Despite these comments, some vacci-nations - i.e., rubella for girls and vaccinesto prevent tetanus - were acceptableamong some families. However, youngcouples were reminded by their relativesthat their children should not be immu-nized. Most of the participants' parentswere not immunized and had related sto-ries of adverse reactions to support theirdecision. Some of the Hutterites also explained that it was God's will that determined thehealth status of the children and that hewould care for them even if they were notimmunized. This group noted that othercountries, including those in Europe, haddiscontinued vaccinations with no harmfuleffect on their population. Such informa-tion was derived from magazines obtainedin health food stores that are frequented bythis group. As an alternative to injectablevaccines for diphtheria, pertussis andtetanus, some Hutterites use a liquid \"RxVaccination DPT\" available from a homeo-pathic caregiver in a nearby metropolitancity who sees and prescribes this liquid toboth children and adults. Risks associated with vaccines Among both the alternative health practi-tioners and laypersons, there was a beliefthat a variety of disorders, includingautism and crib death, were attributed tovaccinations. However, their informationsources were non-scientific articles fromalternative health magazines or materialsprepared by individuals with an anti-immunization viewpoint. For some of thisgroup, there was a concern about givingimmunizations to children whose immunesystems were not fully developed.Immunizations were believed to potentiallyweaken the immune system and to causediseases such as asthma or allergies, andhence must be avoided. Most of the Hutterite participants did not believe that the vaccines were effectiveand that in fact they were harmful to theirchildren because booster shots arerequired. One such incident was of a 21-year-old Hutterite male who is crippledand helpless. His current health state isattributed to a vaccination he received atnine months of age. Other stories of the perceived harmful effects of vaccinationsincluded children losing a significantamount of weight or being cranky andhaving a fever. Among the Dutch, there was also con- cern about perceived risks from having thevaccines administered (i.e., fever, cranki-ness, brain damage, cancer). They alsobelieved that vaccines could be overusedand become ineffective. Compared to theother groups, the Dutch felt that they hadreceived minimal explanation from thePHN about the risks of vaccines. However,like the other two groups, the Dutch fre-quented health food stores and accessedthe internet to support their decisions notto immunize. A final area of concern among both the alternative health and Dutch participantswas the actual ingredients of the vaccines.Substances such as mercury, formaldehyde,aluminum, lead and preservatives were list-ed by the participants as being in the vac-cines and were perceived as further endan-gering people's health. DISCUSSION Although three different groups were included in the study, the findings reveal acommon concern about child health andsafety. Participants noted perceived harmfuleffects (i.e., the infant being cranky, run-ning a fever, a decreased appetite) that arenormal reactions for a short period of timeafter the vaccine is given. The safety of thevaccines was also questioned but common adjuvants have been used safely for 70 yearsto help the immune response at the cellularlevel, e.g., aluminum salts found in diph-theria, hepatitis B and tetanus vaccines. Toprevent contamination in vaccines by bac-teria or fungi, a mercury-based compound(Thimerosal) was, but no longer is, com-monly used. Some anti-immunizationgroups promote fear because they do notunderstand that the use of small amountsof adjuvants and preservatives in vaccines isa safe practice. 9-12 Anti-vaccine notoriety has snowballed from a handful of books to a plethora ofweb sites. The lay person is expected todecide but usually is not equipped to sepa-rate fact from fiction, or correlation fromcausality. In addition, when clients' needsare not met, they seek alternative health carewhere these practitioners spend longer timesduring visits and tend to accommodate theirclients' special needs more fully. These prac-titioners might not provide a balanced per-spective regarding immunization. For theDutch participants, their religious view-points do not allow them to accept immu-nization, indicating a need for tolerance foradherence to faith-based decisions. The major limitation of this qualitative study lies in the lack of generalizability ofits findings. Nonetheless, these findings dosuggest directions for future action in theRHA of southern Alberta. Educational initiatives to allay the par- ents' fears of adverse reactions need to be (continues next page) R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 Contexte : Dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 est une composante essentielle des de la vaccination, on favoriserait une plusgrande adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 la vaccination.

This may include working with alternative health practitioners whosupport immunization, the agriculturalsector, and individuals within the threegroups who do immunize to create com-munity development activities that willincrease acceptance of immunization. Theclients of today also need access to moreappropriate web sites that present a morebalanced perspective regarding immuniza-tion. The RHA web site could be devel-oped to address their questions.REFERENCES 1. Etkind P, Leh S, Macdonald P, Silva E, Peppe J.
