Though not required, you may also submit one additional reference from an athletic coach, scout leader, community service coordinator, or work supervisor. Standardized test scores and test-optional admissions We accept both the ACT (Code: 1054) and the SAT (Code 1392), and take the best sub-scores to compile a composite score. You may choose not to submit your scores as part of our test-optional admissions policy. If you make use of this opportunity, you must have a personal interview with an admission counselor. This can be done via phone or in-person and you should take the initiative to set-up this interview as soon as possible. International students are required to submit ACT, SAT, TOEFL, or IELTS scores. Students who ultimately enroll at the College will be asked to submit test scores for advising and College research. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Scores Advanced Placement Students who have successfully completed Advanced Placement courses and the appropriate examinations provided by the College Entrance Examination Board may apply for college credit for this work. Scores of 4 or 5 on the examinations may entitle students to at least one course credit; scores of 1, 2 or, in most cases, 3, are not granted credit.

Transfer Students 16 Eligibility You must be eligible to return to your previous institution. Otherwise, you must wait at least six months before we can consider your application. If you have been dismissed from a college or university more than once, you will not be eligible for admission at Lake Forest College. 17 The College is most likely to recognize a course taken at another accredited institution if Lake Forest offers a comparable course. Courses at other accredited institutions that are in the liberal arts tradition, but do not have comparable counterparts at Lake Forest, may also be granted credit. Lake Forest students are required to receive prior approval from the College before taking coursework at other colleges (see below under \"Credit for Summer Work at another institution.\") You may transfer a maximum of two years of college coursework (up to a maximum of 16 Lake Forest course credits) to Lake Forest College. All transferable coursework up to the maximum, completed with a C- or better, will be accepted toward fulfillment of the bachelor of arts degree. No courses with D grades may be transferred to the College. Plus and minus grades with the exception of grades of A+ earned at another institution will be recorded on the Lake Forest College transcript, but are not counted in the Lake Forest GPA. If you are a recipient of an associate of arts (AA) degree in an applicable liberal-arts field from an accredited community college, you may be granted full junior standing (16 Lake Forest College credits). All coursework completed in the AA degree must be applicable towards a Lake Forest degree and have received a grade of C- or better to be transferable. An official transcript from the issuing institution must be given to the Registrar's Office before any academic work done elsewhere may be accepted for Lake Forest College credit. The Registrar evaluates transcripts and awards transfer course credit; students may appeal decisions to the Academic Appeals Board. How credits transfer The Office of the Registrar makes the official evaluation of transfer credit upon acceptance to the College and receipt of a student's enrollment deposit. Once the Registrar has determined how many transfer courses can be counted toward the Lake Forest College degree, you will be assigned class standing as follows: at least 15 Lake Forest credits equates to junior standing, at least 7 Lake Forest credits to sophomore standing, and fewer than 7 credits to first year standing. Lake Forest College weighs its own courses at four (4) semester hours. Normally, each 15 semester hours of transferrable credit will be considered equivalent to 4 course credits at Lake Forest, with each 3 semester credit hour course transferring as 0.8 Lake Forest course credits. International credits Students seeking to transfer in credits from colleges or universities outside the United States will be required to provide any and all course descriptions, syllabi, or other supplementary materials about the courses for review and evaluation by the Registrar's office. Students may be required to have an evaluation done by WES or ECE. Students will work with faculty advisors and department chairs to determine how transfer courses meet major and minor requirements. How your credits meet our curriculum requirements The Office of the Registrar determines which transferred credits apply to the Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC) at the time of your official transcript evaluation. Individual department chairpersons determine if transferred courses meet major requirements. Below is a brief summary of the FFC requirements. Many courses are designed to fulfill more than one requirement. 1. First Year Studies The Forester Fundamental Curriculum begins with the College's First-Year Studies Program. This also includes a writing requirement Transferring Credits 18 2. Distribution Requirement Students must complete one course in each of five areas: Creative and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, and Social Sciences. 3. Cultural Diversity Requirement Students must complete one course in each of two areas: US Domestic Pluralism and Global Pluralism. 4. Skills Requirement Students must complete at least one course in each of three areas: Writing Intensive, Speaking Intensive, and Technology Intensive. 5. Experiential Learning Requirement The goal of this requirement is to ensure that students integrate their traditional classroom learning with experientially-based work. By connecting theory and practice, students develop new skills and extend their knowledge and training to unfamiliar tasks and situations beyond the classroom environment. The Experiential Learning requirement is fulfilled in two parts: the completion of an appropriate experience or activity and the production of a written reflection. 6. Senior Studies Requirement A senior studies course, also known as a senior \"capstone,\" is a culminating experience in the student's major. The course emphasizes writing and speaking and encourages integration of the methods and content explored in the major. Senior theses, research projects, and creative projects may also be used to fulfill the senior studies requirement. Lake Forest students and credit for summer work at another institution Enrolled students who plan to attend a summer session at a college in the United States other than Lake Forest must obtain prior approval for the proposed program of study. Forms for this purpose may be obtained from the Registrar's Office or are available on my.lakeforest.edu. Transfer credits may not be accepted for students who fail to obtain approval. Upon approval of coursework, credits earned by a student at another college will be converted into Lake Forest College course credits and will be included in the student's total credits toward graduation, but the grades will not be used to calculate the grade point average. Refer to Transfer Credits (above) for specifics on how transfer credits are converted into Lake Forest College course credits. For policies governing the acceptance of transfer credit from approved off-campus program providers, see the Off-Campus Programs website. Advanced Placement Students who have successfully completed Advanced Placement courses and the appropriate examinations provided by the College Entrance Examination Board may apply for college credit for this work. Scores of 4 or 5 on the examinations may entitle students to at least one course credit; scores of 1, 2 or, in most cases, 3, are not granted credit. A score of 4 or better on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics exams is required for one course credit in economics. Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department. Advanced Placement Credit Table (pdf) International Baccalaureate Students who have successfully completed International Baccalaureate courses and taken the higher-level examinations provided by the IB Program may apply for college credit for this work. Grades of 4, 5, 6, or 7 on the examinations entitle students to at least one course credit; grades of 1, 2, and 3 are not granted credit. Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department. 19 Scores from this year If the College's registrar has not yet received your AP or IB test and you wish to take a course in that discipline, you should register for the lower-level course in the department in question. For example, if you took the AP Test in Psychology, you should register for Psychology 110. Once we receive your score and determine that it satisfies our criteria, we will notify you so that you may change your schedule and enroll in the higher-level course - after consulting with your advisor, of course. Be sure to review the general information, prerequisites, and placement tests page, which also provides links to the course schedule and charts for AP and IB credit. Credit by examination Students may apply to pass a regular course by special examination without prior enrollment. Consent of the instructor and approval of the Dean of the Faculty are required. Where appropriate, the instructor may set requirements in addition to the examination itself. For credit to be awarded, a grade of D- or better must be earned on the examination, but the student's transcript will show only a P (Pass). Special examinations are not allowed for courses that are usually part of pre-college curricula (for example, elementary languages or elementary mathematics) and are not normally allowed in courses previously audited or in which a student was enrolled. Students will be charged for course credits they earn by examination. 20 Tuition and Fees 2020 - 2021 Full-time per academic year (3 - 4.5 credits per semester) Fall Semester Spring Semester Year Tuition $24,460 $24,460 $48,920 Activity fee - $159 $159 General - $200 Health Center fee - $167 $167 meal plans) - $3,040 $6,005 Total Tuition and Charges $30,916 $55,576 On Campus Meal Plans & Flex Dollars* Meal Plans Fall Semester (Meal) Spring Semester (Meal) Year Semester (Flex) 20 Meal Plan N/A $3,040 $3,040 $215 15 *Prices subject to change Tuition and Fees 21 Commuter Meal Plans* Meal Plan Total Cost (Semester) 50 Meal Block Plan $460 25 Meal Block Plan $240 Commuter Meal Plans may be purchased at the Lake Forest Dining website here. *Prices subject to change Other Tuition Charges Part-time per academic year (1 - 2 credits per semester) Tuition Per Course (exam credit included) $6,115 Auditor Tuition per course $600 Course Overload Tuition (for more than 4 1/2 credits) Per half-course credit $3,058 Per quarter-course credit $1,530 Community Education Tuition per course $6,115 Degree Candidacy Pending Student Tuition per course $3,390 Billing deposit $200 Dual High School Enrollment Tuition per course $3,390 Master of Arts in Teaching Tuition per course $3,724 Post Graduate Teaching Option Tuition per course $3,724 Masters of Liberal Studies Tuition per course $2,772 Billing deposit $200 22 Additional Costs Student Health Insurance (mandatory unless a waiver is completed and accepted by September 09, 2020) Full-year (12 months) $1,875 Second semester only (Jan - Aug: Spring-semester-only students) $1,215 Orientation Fee $200 Senior Dues $100 Music Lessons (per hour) $58 Description of Fees Deposit A $500 deposit is required of all new students.

See the Director of Off-Campus Programs for the current per-program tuition rate. Regular refund policies apply to study- abroad programs. There is a non-refundable administrative fee of $500 for students who are applying their financial aid to a program through a consortium agreement, in addition to any program fee or deposit required by the selected program. Students will not be charged a fee for credit by examination (for a subject that is not covered by advanced placement tests) if such credit is established during the fall term of the first year. Students will be billed for bookstore charges, library fines, on-campus traffic violations, and any damage they may cause to College property. A student who changes residential status from resident to nonresident for fall semester, and notifies the Office of Student Affairs on or after June 1 and before July 1, will be charged $500. Students notifying the Office of Student Affairs on or after July 1 will be charged $750. For a change of residency status after the first day of fall classes, per diem charges for room and board will be applied to the student's account in addition to the fine. See the Office of Residence Life for more information. 25 There are two topics covered here: 1) withdrawals during the semester and 2) refunds due to over-payments or loan proceeds. The schedule of reduced tuition and fees applies if a student completely withdraws from all courses during the semester. The date of withdrawal is determined by the Office of Student Affairs based on last day of attendance (for tuition) and date moved out of housing (room and board). All withdrawals from the College must be reported through the Office of Student Affairs. Refunds are not issued for withdrawing from individual courses. Refunds will not be issued for dismissal, suspension, or expulsion from the College and no room refunds for removal from campus housing due to judicial sanction. The Business Office will process any funds due after being notified by the Office of Student Affairs and after the Financial Aid Office reviews grant and loan eligibility. Please be aware that scholarships, loans, and grants may not follow the same refund percentages as the College; you should contact the Financial Aid Office for that information. Financial aid recipients who withdraw from the College after registration but still within a refund period are subject to the College's refund policy and federal regulations. The Financial Aid Office and the Business Office will jointly determine the appropriate resulting charges and financial aid. First Semester Second Semester Refund On or before: September 4, 2020 February 13, 2021 90% September 11, 2020 February 19, 2021 80% September 18, 2020 February 26, 2021 70% September 25, 2020 March 05, 2021 60% October 2, 2020 March 12, 2021 50% October 09, 2020 March 19, 2021 40% After: October 09, 2020 March 19, 2021 0% Room and board charges are refunded on a per diem basis up to and including the final date listed on the of Refund Schedule. No refunds will be issued for room or board once 60% of the semester has been completed. Over-Payments Refunds 26 Sometimes a student overpays on his/her account, usually through the receipt of loan funds needed for living expenses or books. In accordance with federal regulations, if the refund is created entirely by federal funds (title iv funds), then the school will process the refund within the time limits of federal law. Otherwise, refunds will be processed after the add/drop date. Refund Policy Refunds are issued in the name of the student and mailed to the home address in most cases. You must notify us if this should be handled differently. Refunds for students on off-campus programs can be directly deposited into a bank account if the student makes arrangements with the Student Accounts Office. Deposits are refunded only if admission is denied or a class is closed or cancelled. 27 Tuition Summer Session tuition for 2020 is $3,300 per course or internship. Each Lake Forest College course is equivalent to 4.0 semester hours. Lake Forest College students behind on credits are eligible to take a course at $600. Lake Forest College students and visiting students are also eligible for a need-based financial grant. Summer Session high-school student tuition is $3,300 per four-credit course. Summer Merit Scholarships are available in award amounts up to $2,300, bringing tuition for award recipients to $1,000. Summer Session community student tuition is $2,950 per four-credit course. The auditor rate is $400. Incoming transfer students who have been accepted and who have made a deposit take any business class that is required or helps fulfill a major requirement (marked by a \"*\" or \"#\" below) for only $600. Registration Deposit Note: a $100 deposit is required for visiting student and high-school student course registration, with deadlines for each term. May Term May 12 - June 5, 2020 (deposit due May 5) June Term June 8 - July 2, 2020 (deposit due June 1) July Term July 6 - July 30, 2020 (deposit due June 29) Deposits are refunded if admission is denied or a class is closed or canceled. The remaining tuition balance is due on the first date of each summer term. Lake Forest College students are not required to make this deposit. Lake Forest College reserves the right to cancel courses for which there is insufficient enrollment. In some instances, students may have the option to work with an instructor in an independent study or tutorial should a course have insufficient enrollment. Refunds No-show policy: Students who enroll in summer sessions courses and fail to show up for the course-without officially withdrawing-are charged a $100 processing fee plus pro-rated tuition. This tuition is calculated based upon the day of written withdrawal notification to the Registrar. See the information below for pro-rated amounts. Students who withdraw before the start of the course are not charged any tuition or processing fee. Day 1 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 1 90% Day 2 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 2 85% Day 3 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 3 80% Day 4 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 4 75% Day 5 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 5 70% Day 6 Withdrawal notification through 4.30 p.m. on Day 6 65% Day 7 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 7 60% Day 8 Withdrawal notification through 4:30 p.m. on Day 8 55% Summer Tuition and Policies 28 Advance withdrawal with notice policy: Students who attend their selected course and choose to withdraw before the end of the change in registration period (the third session of each summer term) will receive a full refund of their tuition. Non-Lake Forest College students in this situation will also have their $100 registration fee returned. Lake Forest College students are not charged this $100 fee in advance, and will therefore also receive a full refund. Withdrawal after add/drop period policy: For any change in registration after 4:30 p.m. on the last day of Add/Drop for each term (the third session of each summer term), students will be charged the following pro-rated tuition until the day of written withdrawal notification to the Registrar. The maximum refund is 55%, according to the information below. There are no refunds under any circumstances after the 8th class session.

This amount is often referred to as the \"expected family contribution\" (EFC) and is determined by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Please note that the EFC reported on your FAFSA is not a literal figure, so it does not reflect the amount you will actually need to pay. The FAFSA is used to apply for need-based aid (grants, loans, work-study) if you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. It allows us to determine if you qualify for aid from the College, federal government and your state. If the amount you pay for college will be a factor in deciding where you enroll, we recommend that you complete the FAFSA even if you do not think you will qualify, and even if you have not yet been admitted. General Notes about the FAFSA: o The web address is www.fafsa.gov. o Our Federal School Code is 001706. o The FAFSA is not required if you are applying only for scholarships . o Applications received late will be accepted, but available funding may be less. If your expected family contribution is less than the cost of one year of college, you have \"financial need\" and may qualify for \"need-based\" financial aid. Here is a simple equation to demonstrate: Cost of School - Family Contribution = Financial Need Need-based financial aid is available in three categories, described below. Other details are found by clicking the link. o Grants - \"Free money\" that does not have to be repaid o Loans - Money borrowed by the student or parent, repaid over several years o Work-Study - Money earned by working part-time during the year, usually on campus Financial Aid 30 A grant is usually awarded based on \"financial need\" and does not need to be repaid. Grants come from several sources including the College, some states, and the federal government. Grants listed below are the most common programs available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. To apply for a grant, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year. Follow the appropriate link for information for students from Canada and other foreign countries. Lake Forest College Grant This grant, provided directly from the College, is available only to full-time students. Most students who qualify for financial aid can expect a substantial amount of their need to be met by a Lake Forest College Grant. While most eligible students receive grants ranging from $1,000 - $20,000 for a year, grants of varying amounts are made based on your individual circumstances, application and eligibility. Lake Forest Founders Grant This grant is awarded to students who show \"financial need\" as determined by the College. Federal Pell Grant This federal grant is awarded to both full- and part-time students with exceptional financial need. Awards range from $650 - $6,100. Must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) This federal grant is awarded to students with exceptional financial need, with most awards going to students who are Pell Grant recipients. At Lake Forest, most awards are in the amount of $1,000 for a year. Illinois Monetary Award Program (MAP) Grant This state grant is awarded to Illinois residents who attend an approved Illinois college/university, and meet the \"need\" requirements. The maximum grant is currently $5,340. The Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) administers this and other state grants. Together with ISAC our Office of Financial Aid determines if you are eligible for the grant. The FAFSA must be submitted before the deadline announced by ISAC to be considered. The following applies to the 2020-2021 academic years: By applying for financial aid and agreeing to share that information with the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (ISAC) you have been considered for the State of Illinois (IL) Monetary Award Program (MAP) Grant. All MAP-approved institutions are required by the State of Illinois to announce MAP Grant awards to students who are enrolled or intending to enroll at their institution. An award amount is included in your financial aid package if you have met the eligibility criteria. The MAP Grant award amount is an estimate made by the financial aid office and is identified as a \"State of IL MAP Grant (Est).\" Please be aware that the number of available MAP Grants is limited by funding levels approved by the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor, and reductions to estimated or actual MAP Grants are possible. There are also limitations to how long you can continue to receive a MAP Grant. Usage is tracked by the number of credit hours for which you've received MAP benefits and is referred to as MAP Paid Credit Hours (MPCHs). The maximum number of MPCHs that can be received is 135, which is equivalent to approximately four and a half years of full-time enrollment. For your reference, and to learn more about MPCH limitations, you may access a record of your MPCHs through the ISAC Student Portal at https://studentportal.isac.org/MPCH. Other State Grant Programs There are currently just a a few states - Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont for example- that offer funds which can be used at an out-of-state college/university. If you are a resident of one of these states, and meet the Grants 31 requirements (set by each state) the funds may be used here at Lake Forest. Since the grants are awarded by the states themselves, contact the higher education agency in your home state to learn more. Outside Sources of Funding Your ability to secure outside funding is always advantageous. For that reason you are encouraged to apply for national, state, and local grant that you may be eligible to receive. Funds are awarded at various levels by businesses, churches, civic organizations, and foundations. Visit our outside scholarships webpage page for examples of funding available. If you do receive assistance from another source, we may be required to reduce other funds you have been offered. Grants and Scholarships from the College usually require full-time enrollment, while federal and state grants may also be used for part-time enrollment. They do not need to be repaid, and will appear on your billing statement without further action after confirming your enrollment. College Grants (and most federal and state grants) may be used in the fall and spring semesters, and may be used for many off-campus programs. An annual application is required. Eligibility continues until graduation requirements have been completed, to a maximum of six years. We make a considerable effort to keep your grant aid at a similar level from one year to the next. There are, however, many factors which determine eligibility for need-based aid, including: the number of people in your household, the number of household members in college, taxable and untaxed income, and any \"special circumstances\" you ask us to consider. Changes in any of these categories from one year to the next may affect the grant aid you receive in subsequent years. Related Links Federal Pell Grant Illinois Grant Programs MAP Grant Rights & Respon's 2020-2021 Pennsylvania Grant Vermont Grant 32 Educational loans are available from a variety of sources, allowing students and/or parents to borrow funds that can pay some or all college costs. Update on COVID-19 and Your Student Loans Loans must be repaid, with interest, usually after graduation. They will appear on your billing statement after your enrollment is confirmed, and you have completed the necessary promissory note and entrance interview. First-time borrowers will be notified of the application process early in the summer, and do not need to complete anything until that time. Loan Types Student Loans Stafford Loans Private Loans Parent Loans PLUS Loans While the \"best\" loans are federal loans based on financial need, and require the annual completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) there are programs for virtually every family, regardless of income. Many loans do not require repayment while the student is enrolled. Interest Rates, 2020-2021 Academic Year 2.75% Undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans 4.30% Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate students 5.30% Parent PLUS loans for parent and graduate students These rates are in effect for all Direct Loans with a first disbursement on or after July 1, 2020 and before July 1, 2021, and remain fixed for the life of the loan. Interest Rates, general information Rates are calculated using a base 10-year Treasury Note Index plus an add-on amount for each loan program\u2014 2.05% for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, 3.60% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate and professional students, and 4.60% for parent and graduate PLUS. Under the current interest rate structure, all Direct Loans except Direct Consolidation Loans will be \"variable-fixed,\" meaning students would receive a new rate with each new loan, but then that rate would be fixed for the life of the loan. There are also interest rate caps at 8.25% for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, 9.50% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate and professional students; and 10.50% for parent and graduate PLUS. Borrow Wisely Wise management of your loan will establish a strong credit history. Borrow only the funds you need. You are not required to borrow the full amount shown on your Award Letter. See How Much to Borrow? Loans 33 If you decide to limit borrowing, consider that - in most cases - the most appealing loan is the subsidized Stafford, followed by the unsubsidized Stafford, followed by the Federal PLUS, followed by a private (non- federal) loan. If you need to borrow to cover special costs, complete the Loan Supplement and return it to the Office of Financial Aid. If you have to borrow an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, PLUS Loan or private (non-federal) loan, try to make at least interest payment while you are enrolled. What's even better? Begin repaying principal and interest. Keep copies of all loan documents in a single, well-marked folder. This will make them easy to find when questions arise. To help insure all payments are made on time, consider setting up an automatic debit from your checking or savings account. 34 \"Work-Study\" is simply an opportunity to have a part-time job while going to school. Jobs are in administrative offices, academic departments, the library, the sports center, campus security, and other campus locations. A Few Basics: While we will try to locate a job for eligible students, placement and earnings are not guaranteed. If \"work-study\" is not shown on your award letter you should not pursue a job on campus without first speaking with the Office of Financial Aid. Maximum of 14 hrs/wk Social Security and Medicare taxes are not deducted during the academic year, effectively increasing your take-home pay by $0.65. Funds earned are paid directly to you , but can be applied to your bill. The Application Students who have been offered work-study funds can access Handshake (login required) to see a list of current job openings. Students may directly contact hiring managers. Before beginning to work for the first time, additional employment forms must be completed (details provided during hiring process). Federal Work-Study This need-based program is funded by the government and the College, and is awarded to eligible U.S. citizens and permanent residents. We offer work-study funds to students who live on campus and qualify for the Federal Pell Grant. Lake Forest College Work-Study This program is primarily need-based and is funded by the College. It is awarded to international students who qualify and hold proper visa status, and (on a limited basis) to students who do not qualify for federal work-study funds. How are students placed? You must have been awarded Federal Work-Study or Lake Forest Work-Study by the Office of Financial Aid in order to work on campus. Priority in placing students may be based on several factors level of financial need as determined by the Office of Financial Aid date of receipt of all applications (admission, financial aid, work-study) date of their deposit made to the College Students must complete employment forms in the Office of Business Affairs before beginning work. Students are expected to treat their position like any other ob. Once a work schedule has been established, students are expected to show up at the agreed-upon times. Students who are unable to work at an assigned time are expected to inform his/her supervisor in advance. Repeated absences and other inappropriate conduct are not acceptable and are grounds for termination. Work-Study 35 How much can be earned? Students who are eligible under either program are normally offered up to $2,500 for the year though the amount is not guaranteed. This equates to approximately 12 hours per week, which is the maximum number of weekly hours a student may work. Once a student earns the amount offered, the College reserves the right to end that student's employment for the year. Students who have not been offered funds from either program are generally not permitted to work on campus. If all eligible students have been placed in jobs and positions remain open, it is possible for others to be offered employment. Students are paid by \"direct deposit\" or check every two weeks, unless different arrangements have been made with the Office of Business Affairs. Where are on-campus jobs available? A current listing of on-campus jobs is posted on Handshake, the College's career platform. Students with Work- Study included on their financial aid award letter have priority for all on-campus positions. Search for Lake Forest College as the employer. Note that, as a general rule, students are limited to two on-campus positions unless granted authorization from the Business Office. Opportunities for off-campus employment Job opportunities exist in the community, although they are not considered \"work-study\" positions. Lake Forest College students have access to part-time jobs through QuadJobs, a free marketplace that connects local families and small businesses with Lake Forest College students seeking part-time employment. Students can find internships in Handshake, Lake Forest's online career portal and job board.

We are excited to announce a new full-tuition scholarship opportunity supported by Horizon Therapeutics plc. This $500,000 investment has been made to support economically disadvantaged and underrepresented students to further their Liberal Arts and Health Professions education. \"\"Thanks to Horizon's generosity, two fortunate students will be able to further their education in the College's Health Professions Program, as well as take advantage of opportunities provided by our partnership with Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science,\" said Stephen Schutt, president, Lake Forest College.\" What is the Horizon Scholarship? Two Horizon Scholars will receive four-year, full-tuition academic scholarships to join the Health Professions Program (HPP). In addition, Horizon will assign a mentor to each scholar and provide professional development and networking opportunities. Who is eligible? Selection will be limited to economically disadvantaged first-year students entering the College in Fall 2021 with an interest in pursuing a career in the healthcare field. Preference will be given to underrepresented students from Lake County or greater Chicago. How do I apply? The application for the incoming Fall 2021 is now closed. A cohort of admission counselors and faculty members will select the first two Horizon Scholars. Scholars will be notified on March 12. 39 Continued eligibility for financial assistance is dependent upon a student maintaining \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" (SAP). At the end of every semester, every federal aid recipient must achieve and maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.00 and must complete at least 67% of the total classes they attempt. Any student not meeting the SAP standards must be placed on \"Financial Aid Warning\" for one semester, but will continue to receive their financial aid. If a student is still not meeting these standards after one semester of warning status, the student must be placed on \"Financial Aid Suspension\" and will not be eligible to receive financial aid until the student meets SAP standards. If extenuating circumstances have made it difficult to meet satisfactory progress, the student can appeal their \"Financial Aid Suspension.\" The appeal must include an academic plan ( approved by the advisor ) on how the student plans to meet this standard within a reasonable time-frame. Students who appeal and are granted an extension of the aid, will be placed on Financial Aid Probation, on a semester-by-semester basis. Satisfactory Academic Progress 40 Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree In order to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree, students are expected to complete 32 credits, fulfill the general education requirements, attain at least a 2.00 overall Lake Forest College grade point average (without rounding up), and complete the requirements of a major. Credit is earned, recorded, and tallied by courses rather than by semester hours. Normally, a student is expected to fulfill graduation requirements within four years. All students, including transfer students, must fulfill these requirements. Undergraduate Curriculum 41 A comprehensive advising and guidance program at the College recognizes the need for supportive counseling in all matters related to a college education. Thus, advising takes place in a variety of settings, with more or less formality depending on the circumstances, and at all stages of progress throughout a college career. New students are assigned a faculty advisor at the outset who assists with overall program planning, course selection, registration, career choices, and any academic difficulties or personal problems as they may arise. First- year students are taught by their advisor in a First-Year Studies seminar during the fall term. These first-year advisors serve in an advisory capacity for the entire first year. During the sophomore year, students may retain their first-year advisor or choose another faculty advisor. Students must select a major field of study by the end of the sophomore year, and, accordingly, choose an advisor from the faculty members in the relevant department or interdisciplinary major. Faculty advisors in the major assist students in drawing up a program of courses in their major field and other academic areas, and provide necessary guidance throughout students' undergraduate careers. Academic Advising 42 All students must fulfill the College's General Education Requirements for graduation. In 2017, the College revised the requirements, now called the Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC). The FFC will apply to transfer students and incoming first-year students who matriculate after the fall of 2018 . 1. The Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC) (for first-year students who entered the College in the fall semester of 2018 or later and transfer students beginning in the fall of 2019) o College-wide Learning Goals o The FFC requirements 2. The previous General Education Curriculum (GEC) (for students who entered the College prior to the fall semester of 2018 and for transfer students entering the College in 2018-19) o The GEC requirements before fall 2018 Forester Fundamental Curriculum 43 To be fulfilled by Incoming First-Year students beginning in the fall of 2018 and incoming Transfer students beginning the fall of 2019. All students must successfully complete the College's General Education Requirements for graduation. The Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC) applies to first-year students matriculating in the fall of 2018 and after. It also applies to incoming transfer students beginning in fall 2019. The FFC is intended to ensure that students will receive breadth, as well as depth, in their education while continuing to allow them considerable latitude in designing their individual programs of study. The FFC also includes requirements for cultural diversity, specific skills (writing, speaking, technology), and experiential learning. The requirements are designed to ensure that all students achieve specific college-wide learning goals. The FFC consists of six main requirements: 1. First Year Studies (including the Writing Requirement) 2. Distribution Requirement 3. Cultural Diversity Requirement 4. Skills Requirement 5. Experiential Learning Requirement 6. Senior Studies Requirement Many courses are designed to fulfill more than one requirement. 1. First Year Studies The General Education Curriculum begins with the College's First-Year Studies Program, which was established to create a special, intellectually engaging atmosphere of close interaction between first-year students and their professors. First-Year Studies instructors also serve as the academic advisors for the students in their First-Year Studies (FIYS) course. These courses have as their principal aim the development of basic skills in writing, critical reading, analysis, and oral communication. The FIYS course is required of all students entering the College with fewer than four credits and does not meet any FFC breadth or cultural diversity requirement. Successful completion of writing assignments and sufficient progress as a college writer in FIYS is one way to satisfy the First-Year Writing requirement. However, students who are evaluated to need additional instruction and practice in college writing skills will be required to successfully complete College Writing 100 in the Spring of the first year. First-Year Writing Requirement The College supports the transition to the College's writing intensive curriculum through First Year Studies. Students write frequently in First Year Studies courses and are provided with substantial feedback on their writing to help them progress. At mid-term, the Director of Writing Programs, in collaboration with First Year Studies professors, will recommend students to take College Writing 100 in the spring semester. While most students will make sufficient progress as writers in their First Year Studies courses to satisfy the First-Year Writing requirement, students who need additional instruction and explicit guidance in writing processes and skills will be required to take College Writing 100 to prepare them to meet the expectations of the writing curriculum at the College. 2. Distribution Requirement Students must complete one course in each of the five areas listed below. Each course must come from a different department or interdisciplinary area (i.e. the requirement must be fulfilled with five courses with five different course prefixes). Courses satisfying this requirement will be tagged with the designation listed below in the course catalog and class schedule. Forester Fundamental Curriculum 44 Distribution Requirement Course Tag Creative and Performing Arts CP Learning Goals Humanities H Natural Sciences NS Quantitative Reasoning QR Social Sciences SS 3.

Experiential Learning Requirement The goal of this requirement is to ensure that students integrate their traditional classroom learning with experientially-based work. By connecting theory and practice, students develop new skills and extend their knowledge and training to unfamiliar tasks and situations beyond the classroom environment. The Experiential Learning requirement is fulfilled in two parts: the completion of an appropriate experience or activity and the production of a written reflection. Experiential Learning Activities (EL) The following activities can be used to satisfy the experiential learning requirement: Approved off-campus study. For-credit internships. Senior theses. Independent research, summer fellowships, 10-week summer Richter program. Courses designated as satisfying the experiential requirement. Such courses are tagged with the designation (EL) in the course catalog and class schedule. Self-designed proposals. Self-designed proposals require the approval of a supervising faculty member and must be submitted to the Forester Fundamental Curriculum Implementation Sub-Committee Chairperson (schappe@lakeforest.edu) for approval. Experiences considered for this option might include career-related summer jobs; on-campus employment; peer teaching or serving as a lab TA, non-credit research; organization, publicity, and performance of a senior recital. 45 Written Reflection In order to satisfy the experiential learning requirement, students must submit a written reflection following the completion of their experiential learning activity. The written reflection should: Evaluate how the experience used classroom skills and added new skills to the student's competencies, and Articulate how the student will describe to a prospective employer, graduate school, or other audience the ways in which this experience contributed to and enhanced their education. 6. Senior Studies Requirement A senior studies course, also known as a senior \"capstone,\" is a culminating experience in the student's major. The course emphasizes writing and speaking and encourages integration of the methods and content explored in the major. Students must fulfill this requirement, for which courses are specially designated within their major department. Senior theses, research projects, and creative projects may also be used to fulfill the senior studies requirement if so designated in the major requirements or with permission of the department chairperson. Students who have more than one major must satisfy the senior studies requirement in each of their majors. 46 In order to be competitive in a variety of career fields, students are required to complete coursework that provides instruction and practice in writing, speaking, and the use of digital technology. Students must complete at least one course in each of the three component areas: Writing-Intensive Courses (W) Upon successful completion of the writing-intensive requirement, students should be able to: Articulate a written argument clearly and support it coherently. Speaking-Intensive Courses (S) Upon successful completion of the speaking-intensive requirement, students should be able to: Compose and deliver effective oral presentations. Technology-Intensive Courses (T) Upon successful completion of the technology-intensive requirement, students should be able to: Use some form of digital technology to solve a problem. Skills Requirement: Learning Goals 47 We believe that all Lake Forest College graduates should be able to: Demonstrate understanding of a broad range of 21st century approaches to knowledge production by engaging with key concepts, theories, and methods across the breadth of the liberal arts: Creative and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, and Social Sciences. Demonstrate a deep understanding of at least one academic field, including its methods of inquiry, technological tools, and traditions of scholarship, through the completion of a major program of study that culminates in a capstone experience integrating content and methods within that field. Locate, synthesize, and evaluate multiple and possibly divergent sources of information, thereby demonstrating the ability to think critically. Communicate clearly and persuasively when writing and speaking. Appreciate differences in social and cultural experience both within the United States and globally. Apply knowledge and skills in a purposeful and reflective way to experiences outside the classroom. College-Wide Learning Goals 48 In order to prepare students to think and act as responsible global citizens in the 21st century and in accordance with the College mission statement (\"we embrace cultural diversity\" and prepare students \"to become responsible citizens of the global community\"), students are required to complete two courses focused on aspects of cultural diversity: one course that addresses issues of domestic pluralism in the United States and one course that explores global perspectives. US Domestic Pluralism (DP) Upon successful completion of the US Domestic Pluralism requirement, students should be able to: Explain how one or more categories of diversity (race, ethnicity, national origin, social class, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity) enhance as well as complicate the U.S. experience, and Demonstrate an awareness of how issues of power, position, and privilege impact the history and experiences of groups and individuals in the U.S. Global Perspectives (GP) Upon successful completion of the Global Perspectives requirement, students should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of one or more aspects of the social, political, cultural, economic, or historical context of at least one region of the world outside the United States. Cultural Diversity Requirement: Learning Goals 49 As a liberal arts institution, the College believes that the depth of specialization that is achieved within a major should be balanced by exposure to a range of knowledge and methods of inquiry, such as that found across the liberal arts. Students will satisfy the distribution requirement by completing one course in each of the five areas listed below. In order to encourage exposure to breadth of content, students must take courses from five different departments or interdisciplinary areas (i.e. the requirement must be fulfilled with five courses with five different course prefixes). Creative and Performing Arts (CP) Upon successful completion of the creative and performing arts requirement, students should be able to: Engage imaginatively with an artistic medium, and Express creative ideas by producing original work or by reinterpreting artistic work made by others. Humanities (H) Upon successful completion of the humanities requirement, students should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of artistic, historical, intellectual, literary, or religious traditions, and Find evidence (textual, artistic, or otherwise), develop arguments from that evidence, and evaluate arguments made by others. Natural Sciences (NS) Upon successful completion of the natural sciences requirement, students should be able to: Explain the principles of scientific experimentation or observation, and Analyze and interpret evidence acquired through experimentation or observation. Quantitative Reasoning (QR) Upon successful completion of the quantitative reasoning requirement, students should be able to: Employ basic notions of arithmetic and coordinate geometry, and Frame and solve problems using quantitative principles. Social Sciences (SS) Upon successful completion of the social sciences requirement, students should be able to: Identify factors affecting human behavior manifested in either individual actions or social systems, and Use evidence to explain the structures and processes of social systems or human behavior. Distribution Requirement: Learning Goals 50 To be fulfilled by students who entered the College prior to the fall semester of 2018 and by transfer students who entered the college in 2018-19 and earlier. All students must successfully complete the General Education Curriculum as a requirement for graduation. The General Education Curriculum (GEC) is intended to ensure that students will receive breadth, as well as depth, in their education while continuing to allow them considerable latitude in designing their individual programs of study. Included also are requirements for writing and for cultural diversity. The GEC consists of three main requirements: 1. First-Year Studies (including the Writing Requirement) 2. GEC Breadth Requirement (Academic Divisions and Cultural Diversity) 3. Senior Studies First-Year Studies The General Education Curriculum begins with the College's First-Year Studies Program, which was established to create a special, intellectually engaging atmosphere of close interaction between first-year students and their professors. First-Year Studies instructors also serve as the academic advisors for the students in their First-Year Studies (FiYS) course. These courses have as their principal aim the development of basic skills in writing, critical reading, analysis, and oral communication. The FiYS course is required of all students entering the College with fewer than four credits and does not meet any GEC breadth or cultural diversity requirement. Successful completion of writing assignments and sufficient progress as a college writer in FIYS is one way to satisfy the First-Year Writing requirement. However, students who are evaluated to need additional instruction and practice in college writing skills will be required to successfully complete College Writing 100 in the Spring of the first year. First-Year Writing The College supports the transition to the College's writing intensive curriculum through First Year Studies. Students write frequently in First Year Studies courses and are provided with substantial feedback on their writing to help them progress. At mid-term, the Director of Writing Programs, in collaboration with First Year Studies professors, will recommend students to take College Writing 100 in the spring semester. While most students will make sufficient progress as writers in their First Year Studies courses to satisfy the First- Year Writing requirement, students who need additional instruction and explicit guidance in writing processes and skills will be required to take College Writing 100 to prepare them to meet the expectations of the writing curriculum at the College. Breadth: Academic Divisions At a minimum, students must complete two credits from each of the three liberal arts areas: humanities, social sciences, and natural and mathematical sciences. Most courses in the departments listed count toward these requirements. Specific Requirements: o Each of these six credits must come from a different department. o These credits must be completed by the end of the junior year. General Education Curriculum 51 Breadth: Cultural Diversity At least two courses from an approved list, must be taken by the end of the junior year; the two cultural diversity courses must come from different departments. (Please note: Only one course may be counted in Modern Languages and Literatures, and First-Year Studies courses do not fulfill this requirement.) Courses that fulfill the Cultural Diversity requirement are marked on each academic year's course schedule. Courses that count for cultural diversity requirements may count toward the GEC Breadth: Academic Divisions Successful completion of approved study-abroad programs will meet the GEC Breadth: Cultural Diversity Requirements. Approved study-abroad courses that count in Lake Forest College academic divisions (as transfer credit or as Lake Forest College Credit) will also count toward the GEC Breadth: Academic Divisions Requirements. GEC Divisions For purposes of the General Education Curriculum breadth requirement, departments are classified into divisions as follows: Humanities Art, Communication, English, Modern Languages and Literatures, History, Music, Philosophy, Religion, Theater Social Sciences Economics and Business, Education, Environmental Studies (only ES 236, 288, 344 and 361 meet the requirement), Politics, Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology, Urban Studies (only URBS 110 meets the requirement) Natural and Mathematical Sciences Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Studies (only ES 108, 116, 120, 203, 204, 205, 220, 222, 282, 316, 350 and 369 meet the requirement), Mathematics and Computer Science (Math 102 and 105 do not satisfy the requirement), Physics Senior Studies A senior studies course, also known as a senior \"capstone,\" is a culminating experience in the student's major. The course emphasizes writing and speaking and encourages integration of the methods and content explored in the major. Students must fulfill this requirement, for which courses are specially designated within their major department. Senior theses, research projects, and creative projects may also be used to fulfill the senior studies requirement, if so designated in the major requirements, or with permission of the department chairperson. Students who have more than one major must satisfy the senior studies requirement in each of their majors. Students may complete two separate senior studies courses or choose from one of the following options: (1) an interdisciplinary two-credit senior thesis that is satisfactory to both departments (the student taking this option should register for one credit in each department) or (2) any two-credit combination of a senior seminar, senior thesis, research project, and/or creative project, with at least one credit in each department. Seniors who do not pass the senior studies requirement(s) may not graduate. Juniors may enroll in a senior studies course and fulfill the requirement with the permission of the instructor. This requirement may be not be completed during the freshman or sophomore year. 52 Major and Minor Programs The College maintains major and minor fields of concentration in both traditional academic departments and interdisciplinary programs. Departmental majors and minors permit depth of study in particular disciplines, while interdisciplinary programs encourage students to draw connections among distinct bodies of knowledge and areas of inquiry. A major represents significant course work leading to substantial knowledge and competence in a given field; a minor entails less course work and is designed to produce basic knowledge and competence in a given field. Students may declare up to two majors and one minor or up to one major and two minors. Students declaring a major and a minor must complete course requirements in both major and minor fields. Students who choose three major/minor areas may not select more than two in the same division. Upon successful completion of a minor, the student will have it recorded on his or her transcript. The Major Students may choose a major from among the many departmental fields or from a number of formal interdisciplinary majors designed by the College and supervised by faculty committees. In all cases, students are expected to declare a major by the end of the sophomore year and to make significant progress toward the completion of that major during the junior year. Every major will also include the culminating senior studies requirement, ordinarily a senior seminar or a senior thesis. Students declaring a double major must complete course requirements in both major fields. It is possible for some courses to be counted toward both majors. However, the second major must consist of at least five separate courses, ones that do not double count, and at least three of these five must be at the 300 or 400 level. Majors may be pursued in the following interdisciplinary programs (noted with an asterisk) and departments. African American Studies * American Studies * Area Studies * Art Asian Studies * Biochemistry and Molecular Biology * Biology Business Chemistry Communication Computer Science Data Science* Economics Education English Environmental Studies Finance French History International Relations * Latin American and Latinx Studies * Mathematics Music Programs 53 Music Education Neuroscience * Philosophy Physics Politics Psychology Religion Self-Designed Major * Sociology and Anthropology Spanish Theater The Minor Students may declare a minor any time before they graduate but are not required to declare a minor for graduation. The minor must consist of at least six courses, including four courses that do not double count in the student's major or other minor. Minors are offered in the following departments and interdisciplinary programs (noted with an asterisk). African American Studies * American Studies * Area Studies * Art Asian Studies * Biology Business Chemistry Chinese Cinema Studies * Classical Studies * Communication Computer Science Data Science* Digital Media Design* Economics Education Educational Studies * English Entrepreneurship and Innovation * Environmental Studies Finance French Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies * History International Relations * Islamic World Studies * Journalism * Latin American Studies * Legal Studies * Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies * Museum Studies * Music Music Education Neuroscience * Philosophy 54 Physics Politics Print and Digital Publishing * Psychology Religion Social Justice * Sociology and Anthropology Spanish Theater Urban Studies * Interdisciplinary Studies The College encourages interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge and supports majors and minors that seek to draw connections among traditional academic disciplines. Many of our majors and minors, listed above, cross disciplines. Self-Designed Major Program Some of our strongest students find that no one traditional major fully meets what they want to study. A student interested in psychoneuroimmunology could major in psychology and biology but still might find his needs aren't entirely met with those two departments alone. Working with a faculty advisor, students accepted into the Self-Designed Major program can develop their own major, culminating in a thesis or creative project. This major is compatible with the pursuit of a second major as well. The Self-Designed Major emphasizes self-determination for its students. The responsibility for initiative lies with students, beginning with presentation of their case for admission to the program. Second-semester sophomores or first-semester juniors are invited to apply and submit a detailed presentation of their proposal. The Self-Designed Major program takes place during the junior and senior years. Admission is determined by the Self-Designed Major Program Committee. 55 Independent Study Independent study, under the guidance and supervision of faculty members, offers challenging opportunities for investigating areas beyond the limits of regular courses. A student may engage in independent study for credit, given the availability and approval of a faculty member knowledgeable in the chosen subject matter. A total of seven independent study credits, including internships, may count toward graduation. Students are expected to arrange each independent study program before the end of the previous semester. A written proposal signed by the relevant faculty member must be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty for review. Proposal forms are available from the Students tab on my.lakeforest.edu. Independent Studies do not have established meeting dates/times. The learning objectives and academic requirements for these courses are determined by the faculty member and the student, with the expectation that the total work completed shall approximate that expected for a regular semester course, except for partial credit tutorials, creative projects, and research projects (see \" Definition of a Lake Forest Credit\"). Students may enroll in half credit independent studies (given the availability and approval of a suitable instructor) on the understanding that the independent study will include half of the expected workload of a full credit tutorial, i.e. half of the typical 160 total hours over 14 weeks, plus suitable work completed as a final exam, paper, project, or performance. Students can complete the independent study over the course of the entire semester or over a shorter period, as approved by the instructor. Students may register for a half credit independent study during the add/drop period using the same process as for a full credit independent study, subject to the approval of the instructor and department chair. If a student wishes to register for a half credit independent study after the end of the add/drop period, the instructor must seek approval on behalf of the student from the Dean of Faculty. Independent studies for other levels of partial credit must be approved by the Dean of Faculty. Instructors must seek this approval on behalf of the student. The following are the four basic types of independent study: tutorial, creative project, research project, and senior thesis. Tutorial A tutorial is a course on a special topic not covered in a regularly offered course. Students meet regularly, usually individually, with their faculty supervisor to discuss the readings and are normally assigned a number of short papers. Recent tutorials have dealt with such topics as advanced Japanese, New Testament Greek, advanced Chinese, mysticism, European industrial revolution, recent bioethical issues, and song writing. Students may take one tutorial a year beginning with the second semester of the first year, for a total of four tutorial credits. Creative Project A creative project is an independent course of work, under faculty supervision, in a creative medium such as painting, fiction, sculpture, poetry, photography, or music. Creative project credits are limited in the same way as tutorials (see above tutorial policy); senior projects in studio art may be approved for a maximum of two course credits. Research Project A research project is more specialized and usually more advanced than a tutorial, requiring greater independence and originality on the part of the student. Students conduct scholarly research with a view to producing substantial work in the form of a term paper or report. Among recent projects undertaken were studies involving ethical issues on intellectual property, weblogs and their implications concerning cultural values and global business, the U.S. Social Security system, and metastable hydrogen atom collisions. Juniors and seniors are eligible to undertake research projects. A maximum of four research project course credits is allowed toward graduation, no more than two in a semester and no more than three in a year. Special Course Work 56 Senior Thesis A senior thesis is original scholarly research undertaken in the student's senior year, usually over two terms. The research culminates in a formal written dissertation and oral examination that is evaluated by a faculty committee. Outstanding theses are awarded distinction at graduation. Senior theses may be undertaken for one or two course credits; normally two course credits will not be awarded in the same semester. 57 Dual-Degree Program in Engineering at Washington University Accelerated Admission at Monterey Institute of International Studies 3+3 BA/JD Program with Vermont Law School 3+3 BA/JD Program with Loyola School of Law 3+3 BA/JD Program with The John Marshall Law School 3+3 BA/JD Program with Chicago-Kent College of Law Dual-Degree Program in Doctor of Pharmacy with RFUMS Dual-Degree Program in Engineering at Washington University Lake Forest cooperates with the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Washington University (St. Louis), in a program designed for students who plan to become professional engineers but who also desire a rigorous liberal arts education. With an enhanced background in the social sciences and humanities, the prospective engineer is better prepared to assume the responsibilities of leadership in contemporary society. The program requires each participating student to complete at least 24 course credits (at least 20 taken at Lake Forest College) before going on to the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Washington University for the final two years of study. Admission to the final two years of the program is at the discretion of Washington University. Students accepted into the engineering dual-degree program must complete an Approved Program Withdrawal form in the Office of Student Affairs before leaving the Lake Forest campus to enter Washington University. Students will receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lake Forest after earning a Bachelor of Science degree from Washington University. The Lake Forest College degree will be a B.A. with no major specified, unless all requirements for the major (including the senior studies requirement) have been met at Lake Forest College. The exact selection, combination, and sequence of courses to be taken at Lake Forest College, both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences and humanities, depends on the type of engineering to be pursued at Washington University. While at the College the student must register as a major in mathematics, computer science, or one of the natural sciences. The chairperson of the major department must certify that the student has completed at least three-fourths of the major requirements at the College. The minimum requirements are a B average, with no transfer of credit for courses with grades lower than C- , and a formal recommendation from Lake Forest College. For further details regarding requirements, options, and course work at Washington University, students should consult with the program advisor at Lake Forest College. Early consultation with the program advisor is vital in order to formulate and undertake the most appropriate course schedule. The recommended core of courses include the following: Math 110, 111, 210, and 214 (Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, and Differential Equations); Chemistry 110, 111 or Chemistry 120, 121 (General Chemistry or Principles of Chemistry and Introduction to Laboratory Research); Physics 120, 121 (General Physics); and Computer Science 112 (Object-Oriented Programming and Design). The Biomedical Engineering program requires Biology 120, 221, and 340 (Organismal Biology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, and Animal Physiology) in addition to those courses listed above. Five courses in the humanities and social sciences, including two in one field, with at least one at the 300 or 400 level and no more than two courses in performance or studio art are required. Accelerated Programs 58 The remaining courses are to be selected from the sciences, humanities, and social sciences at the discretion of the student and the advisor. The GEC and Cultural Diversity requirements must also be completed. Accelerated Admission at Monterey Institute of International Studies The Graduate School of International Policy and Management (GSIPM) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (the Institute) is committed to educating and empowering the next generation of public policy professionals who will address the critical global issues of the 21st Century. Lake Forest College has a global focus and educates intelligent, enthusiastic and mature undergraduates who also have as their goal becoming global public policy professionals. Both the Institute and Lake Forest College believe that young policy professionals are best prepared by emphasizing wide knowledge, professional skills, the ability to apply this knowledge and these skills using a second language, as part of a high level of intercultural competence. With these shared interests, both institutions hereby agree that qualified Lake Forest College students may enter Institute programs with accelerated status. According to this understanding, Lake Forest College students admitted to the Institute with accelerated status need complete only 48 credits to earn their Master's degree, instead of the 60 credits normally required. Both institutions will jointly develop a process for identifying Lake Forest College students who are qualified to apply for accelerated entry. Key selection criteria for such students include: o Academic excellence at Lake Forest College as indicated by overall GPA, GPA in those courses relevant to a specific degree program offered at GSIPM, and other academic work indicating an ability to succeed at the graduate level. o Knowledge and expertise relevant to the degree or program the student will pursue at the Institute. o Advanced second-language capabilities. o Maturity, as indicated by evaluated professional work (e.g., an internship or job), the ability to manage one's time, and demonstrated commitment to effective international policy study and practice after graduation from the Institute. o Motivation to succeed in a rigorous professional education program. o Support from faculty and others at Lake Forest, as well as supervisors of professional experience, in the form of a letter(s) emphasizing the above qualities. Prior to enrollment at GSIPM the selected Lake Forest College students and the GSIPM staff will design a tentative program at GSIPM in which those students are exempted from GSIPM courses previously completed at Lake Forest that which would otherwise be part of the degree curricula at the Institute. Within the 48 credits they must complete for the degree, Lake Forest College students must meet all graduation requirements for the specific degree they pursue, either by taking these courses at MIIS or at Lake Forest. GSIPM requires all of its graduates to take 12 units of a second language. It may be possible that selected Lake Forest College students can waive some of this language requirement, based on an entrance exam. They may also choose to enroll in advanced intensive courses at MIIS or Middlebury College in the summer prior to enrollment and transfer these units for their degree requirements. Students may also get language credit at MIIS in conjunction with professional service assignments where they use their second language. Priority will be given to students in those Programs of Study at Lake Forest which best match the programs offered by GSIPM. The International Relations major is perhaps the most obviously applicable here, but Lake Forest College may recommend students to the GSIPM from Environmental Studies, Economics, Business, Politics, French, Spanish, Asian Studies, Islamic World Studies, or any Lake Forest College major program, including the Independent Scholar major. The Senior Thesis, if applicable, could be a significant part of the selection process. As part of this agreement, students nominated by Lake Forest College and admitted with Accelerated Entry status to the Institute will receive preferential consideration for Monterey Institute Merit Scholarships. MIIS awards range from $7,000 - $15,000 per academic per year and are renewable for a second year, pending 59 good academic performance. Lake Forest applicants will automatically be considered for the scholarship; there is no separate application required. For maximum consideration, students should apply for admission by March 15 for the following fall semester. Students admitted with Accelerated Entry status may choose to defer enrollment for up to one year, for the purpose of gaining professional experience related to their MA program at MIIS. These students will have access to the Career Advising Center at MIIS for the purpose of assistance in placement which maximizes their preparation for their MA at MIIS. For this service, MIIS charges a fee of $500 and the student is not required to reapply for Accelerated Entry. 3+3 BA/JD Program with Vermont Law School Vermont Law School and Lake Forest College have established an accelerated admissions program that allows eligible students to complete a Lake Forest bachelor's degree and a Vermont Law law degree in a total of six years, rather than the usual seven. Under this arrangement, Vermont Law School permits a limited number of exceptionally well-qualified students to enter the Vermont Law School after completing their junior year of undergraduate study at Lake Forest College. Students participating in this accelerated admission program receive the bachelor's degree from Lake Forest College following successful completion of the first year of law school and the law degree (J.D.) from Vermont Law School after successful completion of the required law school curriculum. Before entering Vermont Law School (in other words, by the end of the junior year), accelerated-admission students must complete all requirements of their academic major and earn at least 24 course credits toward the bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of two full semesters of law school, a maximum of 32 Vermont course credits (eight Lake Forest credits) will be applied as elective credit toward the undergraduate degree. Students applying for accelerated admission should complete the application process by February 15 of their junior year. It is preferable for applicants to have taken the LSAT by October of their junior year. Students should contact their pre-law advisor early in the fall semester of sophomore year to discuss the admissions process. At the time of application, students should have completed at least 16 course credits toward the bachelor's degree. Juniors at Lake Forest College applying for admission to this accelerated admission program must take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). Vermont Law School evaluates carefully the quality of the student's academic record, faculty recommendations, and the applicant's LSAT score. Successful applicants for accelerated admission usually have an undergraduate cumulative grade point average of 3.50 or higher and LSAT score of 159 or higher. When an applicant's GPA/LSAT profile is at an acceptable level, other qualifications are considered, including extracurricular activities, involvement in cultural or civic affairs, and work experience. Some preference may be given to Lake Forest College majors in Environmental Studies. Vermont Law School welcomes applications to this accelerated admission program from qualified students belonging to groups under-represented in the legal profession. The applicant's file, from his/her tenure at Lake Forest College and any other academic institution from which credits were earned and/or applied toward the Lake Forest degree, must contain no evidence of character or fitness concerns that would generally disqualify the applicant from admission into Vermont Law School. 3+3 BA/JD Program with Loyola School of Law Loyola University (Chicago) School of Law and Lake Forest College have established an accelerated admissions program that allows eligible students to complete a Lake Forest bachelor's degree and a Loyola law degree in a total of six years, rather than the usual seven.

Chicago-Kent College of Law welcomes applications to this accelerated degree program from qualified students belonging to groups under-represented in the legal profession. Accelerated degree students are guaranteed admission to Chicago-Kent College of Law provided they meet the following criteria: o take the LSAT exam by February of their junior year; o maintain an undergraduate GPA of 3.25 and obtain an LSAT score that it equivalent to or higher than the median score for the Chicago-Kent entering class OR obtain an LSAT score of at least 154 and maintain an undergraduate GPA of at least 3.60; o complete a law school application by April 15 of the third undergraduate year; o fulfill the undergraduate requirements specified by Lake Forest College and complete the required undergraduate courses; o maintain a record that the law school director of admissions determines to be consistent with the character and fitness requirements of the bar examining authorities. Students who participate in the program but who do not meet the academic standards for guaranteed admission are invited to apply through the regular competitive application process for admission to Chicago- Kent College of Law after three years of undergraduate study. In addition to GPA and LSAT profiles, other qualifications are considered, including extracurricular activities, involvement in cultural or civic affairs, and work experience. RFUMS Dual-Degree Program for Doctor of Pharmacy Students admitted to the pharmacy program will spend three years at Lake Forest College and will obtain their biology or neuroscience degree at Lake Forest College after completing their first year in pharmacy school. Thus, students must complete their required coursework in three years. This demanding schedule requires you to know early in your academic career that pharmacy is your desire. However, it will cut your tuition costs! 62 Pre-Pharmacy Core Courses Please note: At Lake Forest College, credit is earned and recorded by courses rather than by semester credit hours. Students receive one credit for each course, regardless of the number of meeting times per week or whether the course has an accompanying lab. Thus, a Statistics course may meet for 3 hours per week and a Chemistry course may meet 3 hours for classroom and 4 hours for lab each week, but students receive one Lake Forest credit for each course. For the purposes of definition of credit, a Lake Forest course is valued at four semester credit hours. However, for the purposes of this agreement, semester hour equivalents are calculated on the basis of actual class meeting time and lab hours.

The ultimate goal of this program is to foster a strong commitment to the intellectual life, and to encourage participating students to consider careers in research and teaching. Academically excellent students with an interest in research are invited to apply for the Richter Scholar Summer Research program in the early spring of their first year. During this time, they work one-on-one with a faculty member, doing independent research in one of a wide variety of fields. As the Richter Scholars live and work together and participate in a weekly colloquium, they become a community of peers, providing encouragement and support for one another's research endeavors. The result is a group of scholars motivated to continue their intellectual achievement in the future. Program Options Lake Forest College is pleased to offer two distinct versions of the Richter Scholar Program for Summer 2020. The two programs deliberately differ in length and scope to provide the most flexibility to our faculty and students so that we attract our most talented faculty scholars to serve as mentors and our most intellectually motivated First-Year students to apply and be selected for this program. During the research period, students do not pay tuition, and residence and dining halls will be available at no cost. All eligible first-year students will receive the online Summer 2020 Richter Scholar Application form once the spring semester gets under way in mid-January. This email will further detail the application and selection process, and will include the 2020 List of Faculty Proposals. To be eligible to receive an invitation to apply for the Richter Program, First-Year students must have completed at least three one-credit courses at Lake Forest College during fall semester 2019, including successful completion of a FIYS course, and achieved a minimum 3.3 GPA. The deadline for submitting applications to the Richter Scholar Program is Friday, January 31, 2020. Faculty letters of recommendation are due by Friday, February 7, 2020. All invited applicants are strongly encouraged to attend the 2020 Richter Scholar Information Session from 4-5 p.m. at McCormick Auditorium (Lillard Hall) on Tuesday, January 21, 2020. Email the Chair of the Richter Scholar Committee (Dr. James Marquardt, marquardt@lakeforest.edu) for all questions. Below are the descriptions of the two programs. RSCH 181: Independent Research Experience I (20-25 students) This award is given to selected students to engage in a 3.5-week research project, beginning immediately after the College's commencement and coinciding with Summer May Term (May 12-June 5). For RSCH 181 (Independent Research Experience I), faculty will offer a targeted research experience that will be focused and intense, with special emphasis on short-term outcomes. This is ideal for projects that are \"ready to go,\" where students can begin researching on day one. Faculty mentoring in this short-term research experience will rely on frequent and direct contact with students. This experience may include off-campus visits to libraries and museums, fieldwork, archival research, content analysis and any other activity that can be realistically worked into a three-week period. Students will not necessarily end this research program with a finished product, but they will engage in a rich, substantive experience and will make substantial progress. Some projects may accommodate multiple students resulting in a research community that may resemble a \"mini\" course - but one that focuses on the research experience. Student Research 67 Students working on independent research projects will also meet as a group under the auspices of the Summer Program faculty advisor, engage in some social activities as a group, and present their research findings at a common forum at the end of the term. Students will receive 0.5 course credit (RSCH181), evaluated on a Pass-Fail basis, at the successful completion of the research period. This credit will count towards overall graduation credits but will not satisfy GEC or major requirements. This independent research project will provide for 75 hours of student work during the first summer session. The recommendation for the distribution of these contact hours is as follows: a minimum 15 hours of direct faculty contact/supervision, 55 hours of independent research work, and five hours of group coordination by the Summer Program faculty advisor. RSCH 182: Independent Research Experience II (10-15 students) This award is given to selected students to engage in a 10-week research project where the research project start date is May 18 and the end date is July 24. Any changes to the start and end dates may only be requested after you have been selected as a Richter Scholar and must be agreed upon by the faculty mentor you have been matched with and by the faculty summer director of the Richter Program, James Marquardt. For RSCH 182 (Independent Research Experience II), long-term projects will start more slowly and develop over time. The longer research period is essential to the nature of the work conducted in these sustained research outcomes. Professorial mentoring is key and the student will work under the direction of a professor, sometimes alongside that professor. Yet these projects will also require more independent work than in RSCH181. Students working on different projects will also meet and engage in some social activities as a group and will present their research findings at a formal symposium at the end of the term. Students will receive one course credit (RSCH182), evaluated on a Pass-Fail basis, at the successful completion of the research period. This credit will count towards overall graduation credits but will not satisfy GEC or major requirements. This session involves 150 hours of work for credit, and 250 hours of work for pay, for a total of 400 hours of student work. The 150 hours devoted to one-course credit comprise a minimum of 25 hours of direct faculty contact/supervision, 100 hours of independent research work, and 25 hours of group coordination by the Summer Program faculty advisor. The student is compensated for the remaining 250 hours, composed of independent research and direct faculty contact/supervision, with a $2,000 stipend. 68 Internships taken for credit at Lake Forest College are off-campus learning experiences integrated into the academic program. Although the specific nature of internship experiences will vary, internships are intended to clarify the relationship between traditional liberal arts study and work in non-academic settings. Guidelines These guidelines are intended as minimum criteria that allow individuals significant latitude. Within these guidelines, departments may establish requirements that are appropriate for the discipline of the specific internship. Any internship agreement that transfers or assigns liability exposure to the College must first be reviewed with the Vice President for Business Affairs and by the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist, the Associate Vice President for Career and Professional Development/Director of Internships. General Policies Internships must apply or expand skills or knowledge learned at Lake Forest College. The bulk of the internship work is to be at the site of the internship, where the intern is gaining experience with organizations, industry and people, and where the intern is under the supervision of one person. Internships are open to juniors or seniors. In special circumstances, to be determined by the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist and the Associate Vice President for Career and Professional Development/Director of Internships, sophomores may be allowed to receive credit for internships. To prevent any potential conflicts of interest, students must disclose any familial relationships with employees of the organization where they wish to intern. No student may intern for a company owned or managed, fully or in part, by a family member. The on-site supervisor may not be a member of the intern's family or anyone working under the supervision of a family member. Continuation of part-time or summer jobs may not serve as internships. A student will not normally receive more than three internship credits toward the total number of credits necessary for graduation (not including foreign internship credit). A maximum of two credits will be awarded for each internship. Any student seeking more than two internship credits must show that not more than two credits will be for internship experiences that are similar in terms of skills or knowledge learned or applied. Students in the \"In the Loop\" Program can earn up to four internship credits, with the fourth credit being taken during the In The Loop Program. For each credit, approximately 150 hours of on-the-job experience will be required. The number of hours may be reduced if the internship involves significantly more written or creative work, as required by the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist. Internships will be graded Pass-Fail. Internship proposals must be approved by the student's academic advisor, the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist, and the Associate Vice President for Career and Professional Development/Director of Internships. Commission-based internships will not be approved for academic credit. Requirements For an internship for credit, a student will be required to do the following: Meet with their Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist during the semester prior to the internship. Read these Guidelines for Internships and complete the Phase One Request for Internship Approval following the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist's advising session and before registration. Complete Phase Two of the internship registration process after the internship is secured and before the end of the drop/add deadline. Materials from the on-site supervisor must also be submitted to the Internships 69 Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist and Career Advancement Center by the end of the drop/add period. Write a list of goals and objectives for the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist's approval. Complete a reflective paper on the internship. This assignment must be submitted to the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist by noon on the first day of finals for that semester. After evaluating this assignment, the Supervisor/Specialist will send it to the Director of Internships by the end of the finals period. Students who fail to turn in the reflective assignment may fail the internship. Assignments should include a description of the duties performed, the relevance of the student's previous academic training to the internship, and the role the internship played in the student's academic program. Complete a substantial paper, a project, or a study on issues related to the internship, as assigned by the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist. Work performed for the employer such as research projects, computer programs, or newspaper articles may form the basis of this requirement. On-Site Supervisor Responsibilities There will be one person designated to serve as the on-site supervisor. The on-site supervisor must understand that interns are earning academic credit and consequently must perform duties that apply or expand skills or knowledge learned at Lake Forest College. The on-site supervisor must submit to the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist/Career Advancement Center a letter or other approved documentation that offers the student an internship and includes a written job description. Letters must be on company letterhead and must be signed by the on-site supervisor. The on-site supervisor must meet regularly with the intern to evaluate the intern's progress and to assess the appropriateness of the intern's duties, reporting this information to the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist at least monthly. At the end of the internship, the on-site supervisor must submit to the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist a written evaluation of the student's performance. The evaluation must include a description of the duties performed by the intern as well as the intern's level of performance and progress during the internship. Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist Responsibilities The Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialist must maintain regular contact with the intern and the intern's on-site supervisor, either in-person, by telephone, or e-mail. The Director of Internships will maintain a master list of the Internship Supervisor/Internship Specialists, the on-site supervisors, and the students assigned to them. Evaluation At the end of each semester, all students who have completed internships for credit will be required to evaluate the experience. Students will be contacted by the Director of Internships two weeks before the end of classes, and advised of the procedure for completing the evaluation form. The evaluation must be completed by the student through the Career Advancement Center no later than noon on the first day of finals for that semester. Students are required to submit an evaluation. A coded label will be used to identify the student. Only the Dean of Faculty Office and the Associate Vice President for Career & Professional Development/Director of Internships will have access to the identity of the evaluator. The evaluations will be kept in the Dean of Faculty Office or in the office of the Director of Internships. Internship Supervisors and chairpersons of the department in which the credit is being awarded may see the evaluations only after the grades have been submitted to the Registrar's office. (Approved by the Faculty, April 11, 1984, amended May 8, 1992, March 3, 1993, April 4, 2001, June 25, 2004, and September 14, 2007) Notice to Students who are not United States Citizens 70 If a qualified non-citizen wishes to receive payment for an internship, he/she must receive employment authorization from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). A qualified non-immigrant applying for permission to accept or continue employment must see Ashley Sinclair, Director of Off-Campus Programs, (x5231 or sinclair@lakeforest.edu) who will file the appropriate forms with the USCIS. 71 Participating in a study abroad program, whether to study, intern, research or volunteer, can be a life-changing experience. At Lake Forest College, we understand that our students have individual learning goals, which is why we have such a robust set of approved study abroad and domestic study away programs \u2014 over 200 options in 70 countries! (And this is just our semester options!) While Lake Forest College continues to be deeply committed to the value of studying abroad, students' health and safety are what guided the College's decision. See the Financial Aid section for more details regarding aid transferability. GEO Applications GEO is only accepting applications for the Spring 2022 term. Applications for the 2022-2023 academic year (Summer, Fall, and Spring) will be available by the Fall 2021 term start date. GEO Application Deadlines: Fall programs - December 1 Spring programs - April 1 Summer programs - Rolling admission Off-Campus Study 72 Eligibility In addition to the requirements set by each specific program, Lake Forest College has its own eligibility requirements. To be eligible to participate in a GEO program: Have good academic and disciplinary standing o A student that will be under probation during any portion of their off-campus program, is not eligible to study off-campus. Maintain a minimum of a 2.5 GPA Have at least 2nd-semester sophomore status (at the time the student participates in the program) o In rare cases, 1st-semester sophomore status is eligible - but not without GEO approval Meet all College deadlines for applications and pre-departure requirements Demonstrate the maturity, independence, and readiness to participate in a program, as shown by approvals from the academic advisor(s) and the Dean's office in Student Affairs. Please note: Students may not participate in a GEO program in their first semester back after a Leave of Absence, Judicial Suspension, or Medical Withdrawal, without an appeal. Being deemed eligible by the College does not guarantee a student will be accepted by a host program or university. Appeal Process Students denied participation on academic or conduct grounds may petition the Academic Appeals Board to consider their case. The Academic Appeals Board is unable to consider cases of students denied by non-Lake Forest program hosts. You must copy the Coordinator of the Global Engagement Office on all emailed appeals. Your academic advisor must also send the AAB a written statement of support. Approval by the Academic Appeals Board (AAB) is required if: You do not meet eligibility and program requirements by the time of participation. (NOTE: Each program may have eligibility requirements beyond the 2.5 required by campus. The AAB cannot overrule requirements by a third party.) You have selected a summer program not LFC's approved summer program list. This will also require GEO Approval. o Approval for a semester program not on the approved list requires an appeal to the Curricular Policies Committee. You will be participating in an off-campus program during your final semester. You intend to participate in more than 2 semester-length GEO programs. You intend to complete more than three total terms off-campus (2 semesters on GEO programs, plus 2 semesters in the Loop). Location Eligibility Programs are reviewed for safety reasons due to their locations and/or government warnings. LFC uses the Department of State's Travel Advisories to help assess a location's safety. Should a certain location have a Travel Advisory Level 3 or 4, the President of the College will review the program to determine if a student will be allowed to participate. Contact the Global Engagement Office for more information on safety concerns. Eligibility 73 Program Participation Limits on Off-Campus Terms Students may participate for credit in a total of two semester-long programs chosen from our list of 200+ programs in 70 countries, but should keep this information in mind: The Lake Forest In the Loop Program is not included in this limitation. Students may go on two semester- long off-campus programs and still remain eligible to participate in one term in Lake Forest In the Loop. Alternately, the student may participate in two semesters in the Loop and one semester on a different approved program. The total amount of programs completed is not to exceed three semesters, with no more than two semesters in a single program. One of the two non-Loop semesters MUST be an Exchange program. If a student has a truly compelling reason to study off campus for a third semester in a program other than Lake Forest College In the Loop, the student may petition the Academic Appeals Board (AAB) for permission. The student's advisor(s) must approve of this plan in order to move the application to the AAB. The College does not favor such petitions, however, and the AAB will very rarely approve one. Outside Programs Students that wish to participate in a program not on our approved list must appeal to the Global Engagement Office. These applications will only be reviewed if allowed by the overall College budget, and the budget of the Global Engagement Office. This is not guaranteed to happen each year, and it is not anticipated that the budget for the 2021-2022 academic year will allow for outside applications. To lodge an appeal, students must currently be in good judicial standing, and meet the current eligibility requirements set by Lake Forest College. The appeal must show that the outside program is fundamentally different than those offered in the current portfolio (i.e. not in a current country/city that is already represented, or offers a completely different type of coursework than currently represented among the entire portfolio), and must outline: Strong academic justification for choosing an outside program versus an existing Lake Forest-approved program Academic rigor and quality of the program Appropriateness of the student's plan to his/her overall academic plan/major Strength of student's preparation at Lake Forest College Level of cultural immersion or integration in the host country, and, where applicable, linguistic immersion Further approval from the College's Curricular Policy Committee may be required, depending on the program sponsor. If added, the student would pay their normal Lake Forest tuition + a program fee, and financial aid would be transferable to the new program. If denied, the student would not be able to transfer their aid or bring credits back for that particular program. Behavior on Off-Campus Programs Students are held to the Lake Forest Student Code of Conduct, as well as any conduct codes of their host program, while off-campus. Students that break rules on their program will face a conduct hearing, either while abroad or upon their return to Lake Forest. Ineligibility to Participate in Off-Campus Programs Students may be declared ineligible in the application process to participate in a study abroad program based on the recommendations of their academic advisor or the Dean of Students Office. Students should note that all approvals to participate in an off-campus program are conditional on the basis that a student must remain in good academic and judicial standing. Should a student go on academic or disciplinary probation at any time before or during their off-campus program, or if the Dean of Students Office believes that the student should no longer participate, any approval will be rescinded. 74 Students declared ineligible to participate in an off-campus program will be removed from the roster. Students will be responsible to their program host(s) for any withdrawal fees, and may lose non-refundable deposits, airfare costs, or other cancellation costs. The College will not refund or reimburse students for these or other costs. Participation in a program without approval from the Global Engagement Office, or while ineligible to study off- campus, will mean that any credits earned on the program will not transfer to Lake Forest, and financial aid will not be applicable to the program. Credits earned while ineligible for off-campus programs will not be posted to the transcript once a student returns to good standing. However, once in good standing, that student may choose to apply for an off-campus program to take place in a future term. Academic Workload Students must remain full-time students while participating in an off-campus semester program, which is the equivalent of 3 Lake Forest credits, up to 4.5 Lake Forest credits. Falling below 3 credits will mean that the student is not eligible to receive aid. Taking more than 4.5 credits will result in additional overload fees. Students should note that they may be taking more or fewer courses than they do on Lake Forest's main campus. This can mean as few as 2 \"tutorials\" at Oxford, or as many as 10+ short courses in Japan. See the Registrar determine the equivalent number of credits for your programs of interest. Pre-Departure Orientation All Lake Forest students participating in an off-campus program must participate in the mandatory pre-departure orientations. One session is done online, and can be completed at any time before the start of finals. The other session is in-person, taking place once per semester. Failure to participate in orientations makes a student ineligible to participate in an off-campus program. Course Approvals All students must get their courses approved before departing on an off-campus program. These must be turned into Off-Campus Programs before the last day of the semester prior to the term abroad. A student's academic advisor must approve all courses so that they can ensure that a student will stay on track to graduate on-time. Advisors may approve courses to count for graduation or general education credit. A department or program chair must sign off on all courses that are to count for a major or minor. Requesting Accommodations Students accepted to study away programs who are requesting accommodations must be registered with either the Student Center for Health and Wellness or Disability Services on Lake Forest's campus. Program Cancellation Certain Lake Forest programs may have a required minimum number of students before the program will run. In most cases, that number is 10 students. Program sponsors such as ISEP, ACM, and others may have their own program minimums. Lake Forest receives daily updates on health and safety concerns around the world. Should a country seem unsafe or have a travel warning issued by the United States Department of State, President Schutt will review the program to determine if a student will be allowed to participate. Generally speaking, students will be allowed to participate in a country that has a Level 1 or Level 2 advisory level from the US Department of State. (Countries may have different levels by region, province or state, and this will be taken into consideration.) Countries with a Level 3 advisory (Reconsider Travel) will require approval from President Schutt. Students may not travel on Lake Forest sponsored or approved programs, whether for credit or non-credit, to countries with a Level 4 advisory (Do Not Travel). The Coordinator of the Global Engagement Office, the Dean of the Faculty, the Dean of Students, and the President may review these standards for individual programs based on information from trusted safety experts and sources. If a program must be cancelled before departure due to failure to meet minimum enrollment or concerns over safety issues abroad, the Global Engagement Office will work with a student to find a suitable alternative. 75 Students should work with their own program provider, if not Lake Forest faculty-led, to determine the cancellation policy to understand what happens if a program is cancelled before a program begins or during a program. Students may want to work with an insurance provider to help with travel costs, and Lake Forest will assist students in obtaining credit, when possible. Credit and Transcripts Students must complete all requirements from the Global Engagement Office, including pre-departure course approvals and returnee surveys, in order to have their grades earned off-campus to appear on their Lake Forest College transcript. Students who fail to do this before the next term starts may find that they do not have enough credits to be eligible to receive financial aid. Program Credit Students will earn Lake Forest credit for all programs included on the College's approved list of affiliated off- campus study programs. For Lake Forest program courses taught by Lake Forest faculty, the grades will appear on the transcript and count toward the GPA. These courses include College faculty-taught courses in the Loop and the Lake Forest College Border Studies program. Students may opt with Lake Forest's Office of the Registrar to take these courses as Pass/Fail. For all other courses/programs on the approved list of affiliated off-campus study programs, the course titles and grades will appear on the transcript, and be considered Lake Forest credit. (EXCEPTION: Chinese Government Scholarship - see below.) However, the grades will not count toward the GPA except for Dean's List and honors calculations. Students may not opt to take these courses as Pass/Fail through the College, but may elect to do so if allowed by their host program. Not all host programs allow Pass/Fail, and students should confirm with their departmental advisor at Lake Forest to determine whether their department will accept Pass/Fail courses toward the major or minor. Participants in any other programs, including summer programs and the semester-long Chinese Government Scholarship, will earn transfer credit for courses completed with grades of C- or better. All programs must be approved by the College before transfer credit can be earned; certain programs may have been pre-approved for transfer credit and students can consult with the Global Engagement Office for details. Course titles and grades earned for transfer credit will appear on the College transcript, but those grades will not be calculated in the GPA except for honors calculations. Transfer credit is not eligible to count for Dean's List. Grading Policy Different host institutions or countries have different grading policies than those at Lake Forest College, and that the College is not able to change your grade. Students cannot choose to withdraw from a course after the grade has been received, nor ask the Registrar to not post one of the courses. The College cannot change student grades received on outside programs to Pass/Fail. Costs and Financial Aid Lake Forest College uses a Home Tuition model for off-campus programs and students are charged their LFC tuition for all LFC-approved semester programs. A student receiving financial aid (scholarship, grant, loan) at Lake Forest may be able to use that aid for an approved semester off-campus program. (See NOTES below regarding tuition remission plans, if applicable.) 76 Students may carry financial aid to a TOTAL of two LFC-approved semester programs, not including Lake Forest College in the Loop. If a student participates in two semesters, one of those semesters MUST be an Exchange. Students who earn credit from an approved off-campus program and whose financial aid has been applied to that program may not drop\u2014in whole or in part\u2014any such credit without also fully reimbursing the College for all aid transferred to that program. Students intending to participate in a semester program that is not an LFC-approved semester program will not be able to transfer their aid. A student may file a petition for a non-affiliated semester program to be granted transferability of credit and/or aid. If approved, the student will pay Lake Forest tuition and a program fee before aid can be transferred. Petitions will only be reviewed if allowed by the overall College and GEO budgets, and are not guaranteed to be granted. THERE IS NO LAKE FOREST FINANCIAL AID FOR ANY SUMMER PROGRAM. Some outside providers or national competitions may provide financial assistance for summer programs. Contact the Global Engagement Office for assistance with your applications. Exceptions If you attend Lake Forest College under the Council of Independent Colleges Tuition Exchange Program (CIC TEP), Tuition Remission Exchange Program (TREP), or the LFC Tuition Benefit, your full tuition benefit will apply only to participation in ISEP Exchange programs and Lake Forest College in the Loop. On average, there are over 150 ISEP Exchange programs offered each semester in locations across the world including London, Tokyo, Johannesburg, Sydney, and Buenos Aires. ISEP Direct programs and other non-exchange programs are not covered by CIC TEP benefits. While in the Loop, students must take Lake Forest faculty-taught courses, either on the Lake Forest campus or taught at the Flats. Courses taught at partner institutions are not covered by your benefits. If students wish to take a course at a partner institution through the Loop program, they would be responsible to pay that institution directly and show evidence of payment to the Center for Chicago Programs before moving into The Flats. Please see the Financial Aid Office to determine your anticipated out-of-pocket costs. Other Non-LFC/ACM College Benefits If you are a dependent of a Lake Forest College employee and believe you are eligible for other non-LFC, non-ACM benefits, please contact the Associate Vice President of Financial Aid, Jerry Cebrzynski [cebrzynski@lakeforest.edu], to verify such eligibility. 77 Definition of a Lake Forest Credit Lake Forest credit is earned, recorded, and tallied by courses rather than by semester credit hours. For the purposes of definition and transfer of credit, a Lake Forest course is valued at four semester credit hours or six quarter credits. A Lake Forest semester lasts 15 weeks (14 weeks of classes plus a 5-day final exam period). The Lake Forest calendar also includes three four-week summer sessions. Regardless of the term, each regular Lake Forest course delivered in person (1.0 Lake Forest credit) includes at a minimum the equivalent of forty-two 50 minute instructional hours per term. Remote and hybrid courses require regular and substantive interaction with the professor during the term to maintain the same rigor, quality, and integrity as fully in-person courses. Students are expected to devote a minimum of three hours of out-of-class work for each hour in class. Courses that include additional class meeting times, laboratories, or discussion sessions may require proportionately less out-of-class work. Semester-length Lake Forest courses carrying 1.0 course credits should require students to devote a minimum of 12 hours of total work per week (in-class time plus out-of-class work). Full-credit courses taught during shorter periods of time (e.g., during summer session) should require an equivalent amount of work as a semester- length course. Courses offered for fractional course credit (e.g., 0.5 or 0.25 course credits) should require an appropriate proportion of the total workload of a full credit semester-length course. Internships : For each credit, approximately 150 hours of on-the-job experience is required. Students are also required to complete a substantial paper, a project, or a study on issues related to the internship as well as a reflective paper on the internship. The number of hours of on-the-job experience may be proportionately reduced if the internship involves significantly more written or creative work, as required by the Internship Supervisor. Practica : a minimum of 40 hours of work is required for 0.25 Lake Forest credit. Independent Studies do not have established meeting dates/times. The learning objectives and academic requirements for these courses are determined by the faculty member and the student, with the expectation that the total work completed will approximate that required for a regular Lake Forest course receiving 1.0 Lake Forest credits (as defined above). Course Load A normal course load for a degree-seeking student is four course credits per semester (the equivalent of 16 semester credits), but a student may choose to take any load between three (the equivalent of 12 semester credits) and four and one-half course credits (the equivalent of 18 semester credits) to be granted full-time status. Students also may be non-degree-seeking students or attend the College part-time, with commensurate charges. Courses in education that are required for certification but not credited toward a degree, private music lessons or music ensembles may be added to the normal course load. Consult with the Registrar for complete information regarding credit for these courses. For the purposes of federal financial aid, full-time status is defined as 3 or more Lake Forest credits (the equivalent of 12 or more semester credits); three quarter time is defined as between 2.1 and 2.99 Lake Forest credits; half-time is 2.0 Lake Forest credits and less than half-time status is fewer than 2.0 Lake Forest credits. See \"Financial Aid\" for further information about federal and state grants An overload is any course load in excess of 4.5 credits in a given semester. With the permission of the advisor, a student may register for an overload if the total is not greater than five course credits in any semester. (See \"Tuition and Fees\" for course overload fee.) A student has full-time status if he or she is registered for at least three course credits (the equivalent of 12 semester hours) per semester. Students must register for a full course load for the entire year, unless they are seniors needing less than a full course load to graduate on time. Credit Distribution Exceptions to the following rules may be granted only by the Academic Appeals Board. Of the 32 credits required for graduation, the following rules apply: Academic Policies 78 At least 8 but no more than 15 must be taken in the student's major field. More than the minimum of 8 may be required. A student may not take more than 15 credits, including internships, in any single discipline (as listed in the College Catalog under the heading Major and Minor Programs) . No more than 16 transfer credits (60 semester hours) may be counted toward Lake Forest College degree requirements. Twelve of the last 16 credits, and 4 of the last 5 credits, earned before degree completion must be Lake Forest College credits. A student may petition the Academic Appeals Board for an exception to either of these rules. Students interested in studying off campus in their last semester should consult with the Director of Off-Campus Programs. Academic Standing and Progress Students are considered in good academic standing if they are not currently on academic suspension or dismissal. Students with fewer than seven completed Lake Forest credits are classified as first-year students. Those with at least seven Lake Forest credits are classified as sophomores, those with at least 15 Lake Forest credits as juniors, and those with at least 24 Lake Forest credits as seniors. Normally, a full-time student who takes four credits each term is expected to fulfill graduation requirements within four years. While students are encouraged to work closely with their academic advisors and to heed the advice of the registrar's Office to make sufficient progress to complete degree requirements, students are ultimately responsible for keeping abreast of their degree requirements. Registration in Courses Enrolled students are allowed to pre-register each spring for the next academic year. Students who have pre- registered by the end of spring term will be given first priority in courses for the coming year. First-year students have an opportunity to register for fall semester during the summer preceding their entrance to the College. The spring registration plans are formally completed during designated registration periods in the fall. Prior to the spring semester, additional days are scheduled for confirming or changing registration plans for that semester. Course Changes and Withdrawals During a designated registration period, a student must make any changes in registration using the online registration system provided on my.lakeforest and have those changes approved by an advisor (also on my.lakeforest). If this procedure is not followed when a student wishes to drop one course in favor of another, a grade of F will be recorded for the course in which the student is officially registered, and the student will not receive credit for the other course. Because the full-time course load is defined as 3 to 4.5 course credits per semester, a full-time student is permitted to reduce his or her registration to fewer than 3 course credits during a semester-in-progress only with prior written approval of his or her faculty advisor and the Dean of Students. Within the first two weeks of the semester, a course withdrawal is regarded simply as a permissible change of registration. Only the courses in which the student remains registered will appear on the transcript. In a regular semester course (15-weeks), the last day for approved withdrawal from a course with an automatic W will be the last day of the ninth week of classes (unless a Medical Withdrawal has been authorized). After the end of the ninth week, withdrawal results in either a W or a WF, depending upon the instructor's evaluation of the student's progress in the course at the time of the withdrawal. A student may not withdraw from a course after the last day of classes (that is, during the reading or examination periods). If a student ceases to attend class and fails to withdraw officially from that course (including physical education) in which the student is officially registered, the student will receive a failing grade for that course. (See \"Withdrawal and Readmission\" for more information) Reduction of load to fewer than 3 courses Full-time students will not normally be permitted to reduce their course load to fewer than three course credits in any semester. A reduction in course load may affect their eligibility for financial aid and their participation in organized 79 sports. The Director of Residence Life has the right to suspend on-campus housing when students reduce their course load to part-time. Exceptions An exception to the usual policies concerning course withdrawals may occur when a student has been brought before the Academic Honesty Judicial Board. The student is permitted to withdraw, through the last day of class, from a course in which a charge of violating the academic honesty policy has occurred. But if the Board determines that a violation has occurred in that course, any penalty imposed will take precedence over the course withdrawal. When a student is penalized with failure of the project, assignment, or paper, the faculty member will record the zero in determining a final course grade. A student withdrawing from a course with a passing course grade (as determined by the faculty member) will earn a W, while a student withdrawing from a course with a failing course grade will earn an F, regardless of when in the semester the withdrawal may have taken place. When a student is penalized with failure of the course, the recorded grade will be F, rather than WF, regardless of when in the semester the withdrawal may have taken place. Refunds for withdrawal from courses Any combination of courses ranging from 3 to 4.5 credits is regarded as a full load and regular full-time tuition applies. There are no refunds for course load changes within this range of credits. Students registering for fewer than 3 credits per term with the permission of the Dean of Students will be charged at a per-course rate. (See \"Refunds\" under \"Tuition and Fees\" for more information.) Attendance Classroom activities are an integral and important part of the learning experience. Therefore, it is expected that students will attend class meetings. Each member of the faculty has the prerogative of establishing specific attendance policies that in his or her opinion are best suited to the course. Faculty members are required to publicize such policies to the class in writing at the beginning of the course. Students who miss class meetings because of participation in a \"College-approved event\" - so designated by the Dean of the Faculty - are officially excused but will be expected to make up any work missed and will be allowed to do so in a manner approved by the faculty member whose class was missed. If, in the judgment of the instructor, making up the work missed is not feasible, the student may not be penalized for the absence from the class. In cases when students miss a class for any reason other than to participate in an event previously designated by the Dean of the Faculty as \"College-approved,\" only the individual professor may \"excuse\" the absence. If a professor has deemed a student absence is \"excusable,\" the Dean of Students' office will document the absence for the professor if necessary. In cases in which the absence is related to a disability, the student is responsible for documenting the disability with the Assistant Dean of Faculty for Learning Support and requesting a reasonable accommodation (See: Services for Students with Disabilities). Auditing of Courses Students who wish to acquaint themselves with a subject without receiving credit may audit a course with the permission of the instructor. Auditors are not subject to the requirements of the course, but they are expected to participate seriously. There is no audit fee for full-time students; part-time students are charged a minimum amount per course. Examination for course credit is not permitted in an audited course. Final Examinations By faculty regulation, no test may be given prior to its originally designated time. Only the Dean of the Faculty may grant exception to this rule and only at the request of the faculty member. 80 A term paper may be assigned in lieu of a final examination in a course, but in such cases students are entitled to have until the end of the scheduled examination time for a course to submit their term papers. If not returned immediately to students, examination papers, particularly final examination papers and term papers, are to be kept by faculty members for at least one term before being destroyed, so as to be available for review by students. Papers from the spring term are to be kept through the fall term. 81 LEAVES, WITHDRAWALS, AND RETURNING TO THE COLLEGE Leaves of Absence A personal or medical leave of absence is granted to a student who needs to take a temporary hiatus from their academic career but intends to return to Lake Forest College as soon as is possible. Students requesting a personal or medical leave must be in good standing with the College (i.e. without an academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal). Academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal takes precedence over a Leave of Absence in determining a student's status and official reason for leaving the College. Any departure from the institution may cause the student's class year to change, which may affect registration, room selection, or other processes. Personal Leave A Personal Leave is a non-academic, one-semester departure from the College. Without exception, a Personal Leave must be requested by the student, in writing, and approved by the Dean of Students Office prior to the first day of class for the semester in which a student is requesting a leave. Only one Personal Leave may be granted to a student in a 12-month period (180 days per federal regulations); on occasion, exceptions for international students with military service obligations can be requested. Students who are currently on Medical Leave, Suspension, Dismissal, or who are Withdrawn from the College cannot be awarded a Personal Leave for the following semester. A student who is granted a Personal Leave is afforded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations: The student remains enrolled at the College and thus may not take courses at other colleges/universities while on a Personal Leave. The student remains in an \"in-school status\" for federal student loan repayment purposes. That is, repayment of a federal student loan would be in deferment. The Lake Forest College financial aid package would continue when the student returns, without re- evaluation. The student should participate in the College's course registration processes to ensure a schedule is established for the following semester. The student will reserve their place in any College courses for which they are registered in the following semester, provided they have completed the necessary pre-requirements for the course(es). The student retains their academic advisor, unless the advisor is unavailable for reasons outside of the College's control. The student retains their Lake Forest College email and must comply with the Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy. If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). The student can register for summer courses at the College. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reserved. The student can participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The hiatus from the College is not listed on the student's transcript unless the student requests the relevant notation from the Office of the Registrar. The student does not need to make a new deposit to return to the College. To request a Personal Leave, the student must email the Dean of Students Office with the reason for the request. The Dean of Students (or designee) may schedule a meeting or phone call to clarify the request before approval. Students requesting a Personal Leave should also: Withdrawal and Readmission 82 1. Check with the Financial Aid Office to protect future eligibility of scholarships, grants, and/or student loans. 2. Clear Business Office account to ensure a smooth return to campus. 3. Return any College keys to Residence Life staff or Facilities Management, as applicable. 4. Resident students must submit a housing cancellation form and - in advance of the upcoming semester residence hall opening - be officially checked out of the residence hall by a member of the Residence Life staff. No storage is available on campus. 5. International students must discuss any proposed leave of absence with the Office of Intercultural Relations prior to the start of the leave. If a Personal Leave is approved, the student will receive email notification from the Dean of Students Office. The student's parents/guardians, academic advisor, and other relevant campus departments will also be notified. If the student does not return for the semester immediately following an approved Personal Leave, the student must either a) request and receive approval for a Medical Leave for the subsequent semester (see \"Medical Leave\" below) or b) the student will automatically be Withdrawn from the College, with the withdrawal date specified as the last day the student attended classes. See below for the characteristics of a Withdrawal and the relevant readmission processes. Medical Leave A student may request a Medical Leave prior to - or during - a semester. The last date for a Medical Leave to be requested during an active semester is the last day of classes (before reading day(s) and the final exam period). A Medical Leave is allowed only where the Dean of Students' designee (typically the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness) judges that serious illness has inhibited the student's ability to continue enrollment in their classes and requires the student to leave the College for proper treatment. Students who are currently on Suspension, Dismissal, or who are Withdrawn from the College cannot be awarded a Medical Leave for the following semester. The Medical Leave is granted by the College when the student intends for the departure to be temporary, with a return to Lake Forest College as soon as is possible (see the process for returning below). However, the federal government classifies a Medical Leave as analogous to a Withdrawal from the College, which means that certain privileges and expectations differ from the Personal Leave outlined above. In contrast to a Personal Leave, a Medical Leave can extend beyond one semester for any duration. A student who is granted a Medical Leave is afforded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations: The student is considered unenrolled from the College. The student must begin repayment of federal student loans immediately. The Lake Forest College financial aid package would continue without re-evaluation, but the student must file a FAFSA per the deadline to maintain federal financial aid (if applicable). The student may apply federal financial aid funds toward courses at other colleges/universities. The student may take courses at other colleges/universities while on Medical Leave, and (with approval) transfer them back in to Lake Forest College. The student cannot hold their place in any College courses for which they are registered in future semesters. The student retains their academic advisor, unless the advisor is unavailable for reasons outside of the College's control. The student retains their Lake Forest College email and must comply with the Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy. If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). The student is eligible to register for summer courses at the College, if the process of requesting to return has been completed and approved in advance. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reserved. The student cannot participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The student cannot participate in the course registration process for the following semester. 83 The hiatus from the College is not listed on the student's transcript unless the student requests the relevant notation from the Office of the Registrar. The student will receive a \"W\" notation on the transcript for any courses in progress at the time of the Medical Leave. The student does not need to make a new deposit to return to the College. To request a Medical Leave, the student should submit a written request to the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness. The letter should explain the reason for Medical Leave, the anticipated treatment that the student will seek while away, and the student's desired date of return, if known at the time of request. Then, the student must meet with the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness for an individualized assessment of the student's request for a Medical Leave. In some instances, the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness will exercise their right to request documentation from a licensed medical provider detailing the reasons for the Medical Leave; all medical documentation is confidential and is kept in a secure file in the Health and Wellness Center. Students requesting a Medical Leave should also: 1. Check with the Financial Aid Office to protect future eligibility of scholarships, grants, and/or student loans. 2. Clear Business Office account. College refund policies apply for departures during the semester and the refund schedule is published online. Resident students will be charged on a pro-rated basis for any room and board usage. 3. Return all College keys to Residence Life staff or Facilities Management, as applicable. 4. Resident students must submit a housing cancellation form and be officially checked out of the residence hall by a member of the Residence Life staff within 48 hours of their leave being processed. No storage is available on campus. 5. International students must discuss any proposed leave of absence with the Office of Intercultural Relations prior to the start of the leave. If a Medical Leave is approved, the student will receive email notification from the Dean of Students Office. The student's parents/guardians, academic advisor, and other relevant campus departments will also be notified. Students who wish to return to the College after a Medical Leave when they are well enough to resume their studies must make a request to return via e-mail to the Dean of Students Office at least four weeks prior to the semester in which the student would like to return. The request to return includes two components: 1. The student should ask their off-campus, licensed, medical provider to provide documentation in support of the student's return to the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness. This medical documentation should answer the following questions: o Is the student able to return to campus and independently manage their condition? o Is the student able to live independently in a residence hall environment? o What recommendations does the medical provider offer with respect to issues such as course load, residence hall assignment, and continued treatment, in order to support the student's successful return to his or her academic program? 2. The student should meet in person or via telephone with the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness in order for the College to conduct an individualized assessment of the student's readiness to return to degree-seeking student status. In some instances, the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness may request additional documentation from a medical professional beyond what has been submitted, and/or ask the student to sign a release to allow communication with the outside provider, in order to make a more informed decision Withdrawals A Withdrawal or an Administrative Withdrawal signifies an official departure from the College. Any student who wishes to return to the college must apply for readmission (see below). 84 In a situation where a student is withdrawing/withdrawn from the College, and is then subject to College action such as an academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal, the suspension or dismissal will take priority over the withdrawal when the College notates a student's status and official reason for leaving the College. Withdrawal A student may choose to Withdraw from the College prior to - or during - a semester. A Withdrawal applies to a student who intends to leave the College due to, for instance, transferring to another college/university or a pause in their academic career. A student who is granted a Withdrawal is afforded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations The student is considered unenrolled from the College. The student must reapply to return to the College. Repayment of Federal Student Loans will begin immediately. The student may apply federal financial aid funds toward courses at other colleges/universities. The student may take courses at other colleges/universities while Withdrawn, and (with approval) transfer them back in, but only if readmitted to the College. The student cannot hold their place in any College courses for which they are registered in future semesters. The student relinquishes their academic advisor. The student relinquishes their Lake Forest College email. If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). If the student wishes to register for summer courses at the College, the student can apply for summer courses in a separate 'special-student' category or the student must apply for - and be approved for - regular readmission in advance of the summer term. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reserved. The student cannot participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The student cannot participate in the course registration process for the following semester. The student will receive a \"W\" for all courses they are passing at the time of the Withdrawal. Students who are failing a course at the time of Withdrawal from the College may receive a grade of \"WF\" in that course (per faculty designation). To request a Withdrawal, a student must: 1. Meet with the Dean of Students Office to discuss their reasons for departure. 2. Complete the Exit Survey online. 3. Visit various campus offices to sign the Withdrawal Form, and submit the completed form to the Dean of Students Office. The official date of withdrawal is usually the last date that the student has attended classes. College refund policies apply for departures during the semester and the refund schedule is published online. Resident students will be charged on a pro-rated basis for any room and board usage. Students approved for a Withdrawal who live on campus must move out and check out of their residence hall within 48 hours. Failure to follow the Withdrawal procedures will result in the student's transcript reflecting the grades earned in enrolled courses (including Fs for failures). Readmission Students who wish to return to the College after a Withdrawal must seek readmission by formally reapplying. Students who seek readmission after two or more consecutive semesters away must comply with the Catalog requirements in effect for the academic term under which they are readmitted. Students who return after fewer than two full semesters have the option of conforming to the Catalog requirements under which they originally matriculated to the College. 85 Applications are expected to be submitted a minimum of four weeks prior to the start of the semester in which the student is applying to return. The reapplication consists of: 1. an application through Slate, the Admission software, indicating the semester for which they hope to return o The reasons and circumstances for the student's departure from Lake Forest College. o A description of the student's activities since leaving the College, focusing on employment and college-level academic work. o A plan for future study at the College, including what changes have occurred since the Withdrawal that have prepared the student to resume their undergraduate program of study. 2. a statement, also submitted through Slate, that addresses: 3. an official transcript of any undergraduate academic work completed during the Withdrawal, sent to the Office of Admissions. Students who are reapplying must pay all accounts in full. Once accepted for readmission, the student must also submit another $500 deposit, and may apply for financial aid, as appropriate. Administrative Withdrawal In rare instances, a student may be Administratively Withdrawn from the College by the Dean of Students if the student is not fulfilling their academic obligations (e.g., not attending classes or completing academic work) and they have ignored institutional efforts toward resolution. A student who is Administratively Withdrawn by the Dean of Students for this reason will receive a WA on the transcript for that semester's courses. WA indicates that the student was involuntarily withdrawn from the College due to abandonment of academic responsibilities. Before an Administrative Withdrawal is assigned, the Dean of Students or designee will encourage the student to apply for a voluntary Withdrawal from the College. In the case of Administrative Withdrawal, typical withdrawal policies will apply (see above). Other Departures from the College Program Leaves A student may enroll during the fall or spring semester for one course at another institution while remaining registered for three courses at Lake Forest for that term. If approved by the student's advisor, the program must be checked with the registrar to assure transferability of the work. If the work is satisfactorily completed with a grade of C- or better in each course, and the credits are transferred to Lake Forest College, the student will be reimbursed for the per-course cost of the tuition at the other institution up to the per-course cost of tuition at Lake Forest College for the same period. Dual Degree Partnerships A student may gain admission to a dual-degree partnership where the student departs Lake Forest College before graduating to enroll at a partner institution in order to earn an advanced degree. The student and their academic advisor must coordinate with the Registrar's Office to pursue and establish this partnership. Academic Suspensions and Dismissals See the section on academic probation, suspension, and dismissal for more information about College-initiated separations from the College for academic reasons. In cases of suspension for academic reasons, students are not eligible for readmission for at least six calendar months. A student may be readmitted only once; a second suspension for academic reasons is known officially as an Academic Dismissal and becomes a permanent separation from the College for academic reasons. Academic probation, suspension, dismissal, and readmission are noted on the student's official academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. Conduct Suspensions and Dismissals See the Student Handbook for more information about College-initiated separations from the College for conduct (disciplinary) reasons, including but not limited to violations of residential policies and the Academic Honesty Policy. In cases of suspension for these or other disciplinary reasons, eligibility for readmission is stated at the time of suspension. A conduct dismissal is a permanent separation from the College. Conduct suspension and dismissal are noted on the student's official academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. 86 87 Students shall be evaluated by their instructors solely on the basis of their academic performance, not on their opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. Grades The College employs an A, B, C, D, F grading system. Faculty may append a plus or minus to all grades A through D, with the exception that there is no grade of A+. The grade of A is awarded for work of outstanding quality. The grade of B indicates good work, C satisfactory work, D marginal work, and F failure. A department may require a minimum grade in courses prerequisite to more advanced work. Pass-Fail Option Students may choose the option of receiving a notation of P (Pass) to indicate a grade of D- or better in any course they take. Under this option, grades of F, W, and WF are recorded on the transcript as usual. Application for this option, or for changing back to regular letter grades, must be made before the last day of the ninth week of classes in a 15-week course or the deadline for withdrawing from classes with an automatic W for other types of courses. Approval of the student's advisor is required. No more than four credits with grades of P based on this policy may appear on a student's transcript at any one time. This excludes credit-bearing activities that are by default graded on a Pass-Fail basis, such as internships and some practica. Students may choose to change a grade of P on their transcript back to a regular letter grade at any time before the final degree audit for graduation by submitting the appropriate form; under no circumstances may letter grades be subsequently changed to P grades. Grade Point Averages The grade point average (GPA) attained for each semester of a student's work, as well as the student's cumulative grade point average, is recorded on the student's official academic record at the end of each semester. It is weighted according to course credit. Grade point averages are computed on the following basis: Grades of P, I, X, MW, W, and RS will not be included. A grade of WF is computed as a failing grade (0.00). The Lake Forest GPA includes grades earned in Lake Forest College courses and for all Lake Forest off-campus programs led by Lake Forest faculty. Incompletes Instructors are authorized to give incomplete grades and may record a grade of I (Incomplete) for a student who is prevented by illness or other reason beyond the control of the student from completing the requirements of a course. The student must complete the appropriate assignments and deliver them to the instructor no later than two weeks after the close of the residence halls for both the fall and spring semesters, respectively. Instructors are required to submit the revised grade to the Registrar within three business days after the expiration of the incomplete. Extensions of the deadlines are possible only with special permission from the Associate Dean of Faculty for Student Success. If the Registrar does not receive a revised grade by the appropriate deadline, a grade of F will be recorded in place of the I. This policy applies only to undergraduate work. Grades and Academic Records 88 Grades of X A grade of X may be assigned at the initiative of an instructor when a student who has been doing at least passing work in a course unexpectedly fails a final assignment. With the instructor's authorization, the student has the same amount of time to redo the assignment, or its equivalent, as is available for an incomplete, but in no case may the final revised grade be higher than a D+. Grades of PR A grade of PR (Progress) is used at the end of the first term of a two-term senior thesis or other independent study project if the student is making satisfactory progress. A final letter grade for both semesters will be entered when the project is completed at the end of the next term. Satisfactory progress is defined as a minimum of a C- grade for the work thus far completed. Accordingly, if a student receives a final grade of D or F in the thesis or other project, the PR grade as replaced cannot be lower than a C-. This policy applies only to undergraduate work. Grades of RS The RS grade, introduced in the fall of 1997, indicates that the requirements have been satisfied in a course without credit. Student Teaching Credit (SCR) The student teaching clinical experience is graded on a basis of SCR (Student Teaching Credit) to indicate a grade of B- or better needed for passing the student teaching course. Under this system, grades of F, W, and WF are recorded on the transcript as usual. This grade is only available to students accepted into the teacher certification program and enrolled in elementary or secondary student teaching. Repeated Courses Any course taken at Lake Forest College, except a First-Year Studies course, in which a student received a grade of C- or lower may be repeated once with replacement of the earlier grade, as long as the repeated course has the same course number as the course whose grade it replaces, and is not repeatable for credit under its catalog description (as are certain topics courses, etc.). This replacement is for the purposes of calculating GPA only: all grades received appear on the Lake Forest College transcript. This policy includes courses from which a student has withdrawn with a WF. A student may only take one First-Year Studies course during her or his time at Lake Forest College. A course may be repeated with replacement of the earlier grade only once. After that, the grades in any further repetition of the course will stand and be counted into the student's GPA along with the grade for the second time he or she took the course. Over the course of his or her Lake Forest College career, a student may repeat no more than two courses for replacement of a grade. Should a student repeat more than two courses over her or his time at the College, the grades earned for the first two of these repeated courses will replace the grades of the previously taken courses of the same number; the grades for any courses beyond that will be included in the student's GPA like any other course. Auditing Courses Students who wish to acquaint themselves with a subject without receiving credit may audit a course with the permission of the instructor. Auditors are not subject to the requirements of the course, but they are expected to participate seriously. There is no audit fee for full-time students; part-time students are charged a minimum amount per course. Examination for course credit is not permitted in an audited course. Semester Grades and Academic Early Alerts Final grades are posted on My.Lakeforest. Academic Early Alerts for all students, in courses where the student's performance is at that point a cause for concern, will be submitted on My.Lakeforest by the first day of the fifth week of both Fall and Spring semesters. After this deadline, students and their advisors will get emails prompting them to check the Academic Early Alert Information box on their My.Lakeforest pages. Students who receive more than one AEA will be required to meet with an academic support specialist to work through a plan to address all related academic problems. 89 The Dean's List recognizes students who have achieved distinguished academic records. It is compiled at the end of each academic year. Only Lake Forest College course credits are counted. To be selected for this honor, a student must have received during the year at least six graded course credits, and must have received no more than two credits with the Pass-Fail option, and must have attained a GPA during the year of at least 3.60 (without rounding up). Repeated courses will be considered in this calculation as long as they have been repeated during the academic year for which the student earned Dean's list status, and follow the policy regarding repetition of courses. See \"Repeated Courses\" under \"Grades and Academic Records.\" In order to reward outstanding academic performance and to provide adequate challenge to the brightest students, those who gain Dean's List distinction are permitted to take a fifth course without additional charge during one semester of the academic year following that distinction. This policy does not apply to applied music lessons, courses offered through off campus programs, and Summer Session courses. Dean's List 90 The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent, official academic record of registered courses for each student, which includes grades, credits, and other pertinent information. Students may request certified copies of their College transcript records. Lake Forest College has authorized Parchment, the industry leader in credential management systems, to manage the ordering, processing and secure delivery of official Lake Forest College transcripts. Parchment provides the ease and convenience of ordering transcripts online for an $8 fee per transcript. Students and alumni have the option of requesting a secure digital transcript as well as a traditional paper transcript. An official transcript can be requested using the Request Transcript link available in the Quicklinks drop-down menu located at the top of all pages on the Lake Forest College website. Transcript requests are processed within 48 hours of receipt. Note: Unofficial transcripts will not be available through Parchment. Transcript requests for students with financial holds will not be processed until the hold is resolved. If a transcript cannot be processed, an email will be sent with additional information and instructions. Transcripts 91 Students who complete degree requirements during the Spring semester, as well as those who have completed their requirements during the previous summer and fall terms, are encouraged to participate in the Commencement ceremony. Others will be allowed to participate only if they have obtained written approval of a proposed summer program at Lake Forest College that will make it possible for them to satisfy their degree requirements by the following August 31. Students who anticipate completing their degree requirements by August 31 and have been approved to participate in the Commencement ceremony will be presented to the faculty and the Board of Trustees in May for provisional conferral of their degrees, subject to completion of remaining requirements by August 31 (as confirmed by the Registrar). A student whose degree is provisionally approved in May but who fails to complete remaining degree requirements by August 31 will not receive her or his degree until all requirements have been satisfied and the faculty and the Board of Trustees have given subsequent approval. Graduation with Honors Graduation with Honors at Lake Forest College may be achieved in two categories: the grade point average (GPA) and the student's major field. General Honors General honors at graduation consist of summa cum laude for GPAs from 3.9 to 4.0, magna cum laude for GPAs from 3.7 up to 3.9, and cum laude for GPAs from 3.4 up to 3.7. In order to achieve honors in one of these categories, a student must have an academic record that satisfies all of the following requirements: At least 14 Lake Forest College courses taken with the full range of the letter grades (A, B, C, D, F, but not CR or P). A Lake Forest GPA equal to or greater than the minimum listed above for the pertinent category. A total GPA, including Lake Forest College courses, Affiliated Off Campus Study courses and transfer courses, that also equals or exceeds the above minimum for the given category. GPAs are not rounded up; for example, a 3.898 is not in the summa cum laude category. The calculation of a GPA includes plus and minus grades. Repeated courses will be considered in this calculation as long as they follow the policies regarding repetition of courses and have been completed prior to graduation from the College (see \"Repeated Courses\"). Grades of all transfer courses acceptable by Lake Forest College for transfer credit will be used in GPA computations. For courses that have been repeated, a maximum of two transfer credit grades can be forgiven. Such forgiveness applies only to courses taken prior to the student's matriculation at Lake Forest College. Forgiveness of transfer credit grades counts toward the maximum of two total forgiven grades before graduation (i.e. students can have two transfer credit grades forgiven after repeating, two LFC credit grades forgiven after repeating, or one from each category). The transfer GPA is combined with the Lake Forest GPA as a weighted average. Transfer grades from colleges or universities with different grading systems are dealt with case by case by the Dean of the Faculty in consultation with the Registrar; where necessary, they will be brought to the Academic Appeals Board. Honors in the Major Honors at graduation in the student's major are based on a clear demonstration of superior mastery of the subject and on the ability to successfully complete a senior thesis. To receive honors in the major, a student must have attained a 3.5 GPA in all courses taken in the major at Lake Forest College, including the final semester. A minimum of six courses must have been taken in the major at the College. A student must be evaluated as having successfully completed a senior thesis. In exceptional circumstances when a senior thesis seems inappropriate, a well-documented senior research project or imaginative creative project brought to fruition in the senior year may be substituted for the senior thesis. The request for such a substitution must be initiated by the project director and Graduation and Commencement 92 requires the unanimous approval of the members of the department(s) involved. As with other theses, the final project will be reviewed by a thesis examining committee consisting of three faculty, at least one from outside the department. Please note that completing a senior seminar will not result in honors in the major. Distinction in Senior Thesis If a student's senior thesis is judged by an examining committee to be an outstanding and original piece of research, Distinction in Senior Thesis is awarded at graduation regardless of whether the student is graduating with honors in his or her major field of study. In exceptional circumstances, a well-documented senior research project or imaginative creative project may substitute for the senior thesis provided members of the departments involved give their unanimous approval. As with other theses, the final project will be reviewed by a thesis examining committee consisting of three faculty, at least one from outside the department. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa, the national honorary scholastic society founded in 1776, is open to undergraduates with outstanding academic records.

Both faculty and students are members of Phi Beta Kappa. It is the faculty membership that each year elects student members on the basis of outstanding academic achievement. Ordinarily these are graduating seniors, but it is possible, in the case of extraordinary achievement, to be elected in the junior year. This is a rare and special honor. New Phi Beta Kappa members are initiated in a special ceremony that takes place in the spring. The criteria for election include sustained academic excellence as reflected in a strong academic record.

Religion The Scott Award in Religion In 1957 Mildred Scott of Cleveland, Ohio, established by endowment \"The Scott Award of Excellence in the Study of Religion.\" The annual cash award honors her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lyman H. Scott. It is given annually at a departmental meeting to that student, usually a junior, who, in the opinion of the faculty in the Department of Religion, has done the most outstanding coursework in the department. The Miller Family Prize This prize was established in 1997 to be presented to the outstanding graduating senior religion student, chosen by the chairperson of the department. The prize is awarded at the Senior Honors Convocation. The Sciences The Fredericka L. Stahl Memorial Awards for Excellence in Science Judge Haas established these annual cash awards for excellence in science in memory of his wife. The recipients of the awards are determined, in consultation with the Dean of the Faculty, by a committee of faculty members and announced at the Senior Honors Convocation. The prizes are awarded to the senior class students who have the best records in the field of natural sciences. Students who major in biology, chemistry, or physics are eligible. Excellence in the natural science courses forms the primary basis for selection. Attitude, habits of work, and spirit of cooperation are all taken into consideration by the committee. Sociology and Anthropology The Leo F. Van Hoey Senior Prize in Sociology and Anthropology This prize was established in 1987 in memory of Professor Van Hoey, who served as chairperson of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology for 15 years. It is presented at the Senior Honors Convocation and is awarded to a senior who is judged by the faculty of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology as the outstanding student majoring in this field. 103 The academic record of every student is reviewed by the Academic Appeals Board of the faculty, the Dean of the Faculty, and the Dean of Students at the end of each term. As a result of such reviews, students may be placed on academic probation by the Dean of Students or the Academic Appeals Board as a warning that they are in danger of academic suspension. Students are placed on academic probation whenever their cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. Students on academic probation are assigned to work with Academic Support Specialists to improve their academic performance. No student on academic probation may be enrolled as less than a full-time student, unless special permission has been given by the Dean of Students. Students on academic probation may continue to participate in co-curricular programs, such as athletics, theater, clubs, and organizations upon review and approval by the Associate Dean for Student Success. First-time first year students who have achieved less than a 1.00 GPA in their first semester at the College will have their academic record reviewed by the Dean of Faculty (or representative), in consultation with others, including; the Dean of Students, Academic Advisor, Academic Support Specialists, etc. After the review is complete, a decision may be made to not suspend the student, but to instead place the student on academic probation. Students who are assigned this status are required to meet with the Associate Dean of Faculty for Student Success before the start of their second semester to create a plan which will outline a set of expectations designed to keep the student accountable and create a blueprint for improved academic success. Students who have completed their second semester and beyond are suspended when their GPA in any term is less than 1.0, even if they have not previously been on academic probation. In addition, students on academic probation are suspended when their GPA for any probationary term is less than 2.0. No student may remain on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters without being suspended. All students who are suspended have the right to appeal. Appeals are considered on a case-by-case basis. Students with a pending appeal of a suspension after spring semester who are taking a course in the first Summer Session term will be permitted to complete the course and, if applicable, remain in student housing regardless of the outcome of the appeal. A student who is suspended for academic reasons is not eligible to apply for readmission for at least six months. A student may be readmitted only once; a second suspension for academic reasons is known officially as an Academic Dismissal and becomes a permanent separation from the College for academic reasons. Suspension or dismissal from the College may also be mandated under conditions set forth under the conduct process. Probation, academic suspension or dismissal, and readmission are noted on the student's official academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. Parents or guardians are notified when a dependent student is placed on probation, suspension, or dismissal. Only in unusual circumstances can exceptions to the rules concerning probation, suspension, and dismissal be considered by the Academic Appeals Board. Academic Appeals Board The Academic Appeals Board is a part of the College's governance system. It considers and acts on cases of academic probation, suspension, or dismissal; on cases in which students appeal the interpretation of faculty rules by a dean; and on cases in which faculty rules are unclear. The Board and the Dean of Students meet at the end of each semester to review the academic records of all students and to take such action as is necessary in cases involving academic probation, suspension, and dismissal. Throughout the academic year, the Board considers appeals involving the academic policies of the College and their interpretation. In extraordinary cases, the Board grants exceptions to faculty rules, but only by a unanimous vote of all three voting members of the Board. Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal 104 Students who wish to appeal an academic decision by a dean or who believe that they deserve an exemption from an academic policy may present a written appeal to the Board. The appeal must clearly describe the decision being appealed or the policy from which the student wishes to be exempted and must state the substantive reasons for the appeal. Each appeal must also have attached a detailed statement from the advisor regarding the appeal. Additional information may be appended to the written appeal if desired. Each appeal must be signed and include the student's mailing address. Appeals may be submitted to the Dean of Students or the chairperson of the Board by email. To request credit for off-campus study, a student must see the Director of Off-Campus Programs. Protection Against Improper Academic Evaluation Students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established by their professors, but they will have protection against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. Students will be informed at the beginning of the course of the evaluative criteria to be used for that course. When a student believes his or her grade in a course has been prejudiced or capricious and has been unable to resolve the matter through interaction with the faculty member involved, the student may call the matter to the attention of the departmental chairperson. Students must contact the chairperson within two calendar weeks following the beginning of classes in the term following the alleged injustice. After the student has submitted a letter specifying the details of the alleged injustice, the chairperson will appoint a committee of the instructor's colleagues to meet with the student and the instructor and hear evidence concerning the alleged injustice. Whenever possible, the committee will consist of three members of the instructor's department. When the department is too small to permit this procedure, the committee may be composed of two colleagues instead of three. When the departmental chairperson is the instructor accused of the alleged injustice, the student may contact the faculty member of highest rank within the department other than the chairperson, who will appoint a review committee. Any student requesting a review is responsible for presenting for review all tests, papers, etc., that enter into a grade and that have been returned to the student. All tests, papers, etc., that enter into a grade and have not been returned to students will be kept on file by instructors for at least one semester following the end of a course. After hearing all available evidence in a particular case, the members of the review committee meet with the instructor (the student not being present) and state their opinions concerning the matter. If there is unanimous agreement among the committee members that a grade should be changed, the instructor is obligated to change the grade accordingly. In the absence of such unanimous agreement, the grade decision rests solely with the instructor. (This policy was approved by the faculty on April 4, 1967, with editorial revisions in July 1977 and June 1993.) 105 Lake Forest College is committed to the highest standards of academic honesty. These standards reflect the core values of our institution and, thus, are reflected in our mission statement. The standards include integrity, respect, conscientiousness, self-discipline, and civility. Such standards are central to the process of intellectual inquiry, the development of individual character, and the maintenance of a civilized community. The integrity of academic life depends on cooperation among students, faculty, and administrators. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to: Procuring in an unauthorized manner the questions or answers of any examination or employing unauthorized aids while taking an examination. Representing any work product as one's own that was done in whole or in part by another person or in collaboration with another person without attribution or proper citation. This includes incorporating the work of other students or of unpublished items. Engaging in any form of conduct or action that violates the letter or spirit of academic honesty, including but not limited to: copying, closely paraphrasing, or using another work without explicit acknowledgement of author and source. Submitting the same paper for credit in more than one course without the written consent of all instructors involved. Falsifying data, citations, or other information for academic work of any sort. Misrepresenting work done, including submitting a report on a performance or exhibit one did not attend, or lab one did not conduct. Aiding another scholar in the violation of the Academic Honesty Policy. Responsibilities of Students Every student is to uphold the ideals of academic honesty and integrity. Other responsibilities of students include: Students are expected to know Lake Forest College's Academic Honesty Policy. Ignorance of the policy shall not be considered an excuse or a mitigating factor in Academic Honesty Judicial Board proceedings. Students are expected to know what constitutes plagiarism. A handout explaining plagiarism is available at the Writing Center, the Learning and Teaching Center, and the reference desk of the library. Students should consult faculty or staff members when they are unsure whether their actions would constitute a violation of Academic Honesty Policy. In addition to the standards regarding academic honesty given in the Student Handbook, students are to heed all expectations regarding academic honesty as stated by their course instructors. Students who are found responsible of academic dishonesty are expected to comply with all sanctions, including participating in individual educational components, such as meeting with the Ethics Center or Writing Center. Students who have previously been found to violate the academic honesty policy, but have not yet complied with any imposed Ethics Center or Writing Center educational components, may not use non-compliance as an excuse in future violations. Student members of the Academic Honesty Judicial Board shall maintain the confidentiality of students accused of violating Academic Honesty Policies. Responsibilities of Faculty Every faculty member is to uphold the ideals of academic honesty and integrity. Other responsibilities of faculty include: Academic Honesty 106 Every faculty member is to be acquainted with Lake Forest College's Academic Honesty Policy as outlined in the Faculty Handbook. Faculty is to maintain the confidentiality of students accused of violating Academic Honesty Policy, consistent with College policy and applicable governmental regulations. Faculty and staff are to exercise caution in the preparation, duplication, and security of examinations. No test may be given prior to its originally designated time. However, faculty may arrange for students with documented disabilities to begin an exam early if the student a) qualifies for extended time on exams and uses proctoring services, and b) has provided the faculty member with an accommodation letter that includes test accommodations as approved accommodations, and c) has a subsequent class or exam that would begin during the usual extended time. In such cases, students may be required to remain with the proctor until the beginning of the scheduled exam for the class. As an alternative, the faculty member may choose to offer an exam at a later time. The Dean of the Faculty may grant other exceptions to this rule at the request of the faculty member Faculty is to take reasonable steps consistent with the physical conditions of the classroom to reduce the possibility of cheating on examinations. Classroom tests are to be proctored with diligence. Faculty who would like to make a formal charge of a violation of academic honesty should consult with the current Academic Honesty Judicial Board (AHJB) Chair. Academic Honesty Judicial Board Composition: The Academic Honesty Judicial Board (AHJB) is composed of a Chair and an available pool of 6-8 faculty members and at least 8 students. The Chair is a faculty member selected cooperatively by the Dean of the Faculty and the Dean of Students. The pool of faculty members is appointed by the Faculty Personnel and Policies Committee; the faculty members should represent diverse divisions. The pool of student members are selected through the Dean of Students' office each fall semester and are also called to serve on the general Conduct Board. The Dean of Students' designee solicits nominations from students, faculty and staff. Next, nominations are vetted by the Dean of Students' office, and nominees must not have violated the College's Academic Honesty Policy nor been found responsible for any student conduct policy violations. The Dean of Students may make exceptions in special cases. The Dean of Students' designee will make final selections of the student pool and provide training. The Dean of Students and the Dean of the Faculty will designate a \"summer chair\" and a \"summer board\" to cover cases arising late in the spring, over the summer, or during the first days of classes before the Board has been established. The summer board may or may not be composed of faculty and students who serve on the regular board. Procedures A faculty member may bring a charge of academic dishonesty against a student if, in his or her judgment, the student has violated the norms of academic honesty and integrity. The faculty member shall inform the student of the allegation in writing along with a recommended sanction. Faculty are encouraged to consult with the current AHJB Chair regarding appropriate sanctions. The faculty member must allow an accused student up to five business days to consider the allegation and submit a statement admitting or denying the allegation and agreeing or disagreeing with the recommended sanction. The faculty member will forward all relevant information and correspondence to the AHJB Chair, who will formally record the case. If the faculty member is unable to contact the student despite making a good faith effort to do so, he or she should submit a formal charge and any other appropriate documentation to the AHJB Chair. In this case, the Chair informs the student of the formal charge, allows them five business days to respond, and instructs the student how to proceed. If an accused student admits to violating the Academic Honesty Policy and agrees with the faculty member's recommended sanction: The faculty member and student submit their respective statements to the AHJB Chair. For a first offense, the AHJB simply records the violation and sanction, notifying all appropriate parties (see \"sanctions\" below). 107 For second and subsequent offenses, the AHJB meets to determine sanction(s). The faculty member and student are invited to address the AHJB before sanctioning, but are not required to do so. If an accused student denies violating the Academic Honesty Policy or disagrees with the faculty member's recommended sanction, the AHJB hears the case according to the following the procedure: The faculty member and student each submit a statement and evidence to the AHJB Chair. The Chair sets a date for the hearing, normally within one week of receiving the student's statement, and notifies the student by email and by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. The hearing date may be postponed at the discretion of the Chair. Cases arising between semesters, during final exam week, or during Summer Session will be heard as soon as the Chair can reasonably convene a Board. The Chair, upon consultation with the faculty member and the student, may summon a reasonable number of relevant witnesses to the hearing. Any party may consult with the Chair at any time. The student has the right to be assisted at the hearing by an advisor drawn from within the campus community. The hearing consists of the Chair (who does not vote) and of a jury of 1 faculty member and 2 student members from the AHJB. This jury of 3 must be present for hearing to proceed. A finding of responsibility requires 2 votes out of the 3 voting members. In the event that the AHJB members agree on the finding of responsibility but are divided on the issue of an appropriate sanction, the AHJB first votes on the most severe of the contemplated sanctions, proceeding through lesser sanctions until a sanction receives at least 2 votes. Evidence must pertain to the charge as determined by the Chair. The Chair notifies the student and faculty member of the AHJB's decisions by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. The process outlined above is intended to provide accused students an opportunity to respond to allegations of academic dishonesty, thereby enabling the AHJB to make an informed decision about responsibility and impose appropriate sanctions. However, if a student fails to respond within five days to the attempt to solicit a plea or schedule a hearing, the AHJB Chair will note that the student has failed to respond and will schedule a hearing. The AHJB Chair will inform the student (by College e-mail) of the date, time, and place of the hearing at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled hearing. If the student does not enter a plea prior to the hearing, a plea of \"not responsible\" will be entered on the student's behalf. If a student fails to attend a scheduled hearing, the Chair may proceed with the hearing without the student and a decision will be rendered based upon available information. Sanctions For first offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignment. The AHJB may choose to impose sanctions other than the expected minimum. The maximum sanction is failure of the course. The sanction should also include one or more educational components, such as informational sessions with library or Ethics Center staff, or repetition of the assignment for no credit. For second offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignment, along with an educational component. Additionally, second offenses lead the AHJB to consider suspension from the College for the following full semester(s) (i.e. fall or spring). If the AHJB recommends suspension from the College, this recommendation is submitted to the President by the Chair along with a recommendation regarding whether the College should accept courses taken at another institution while the student serves his or her suspension. The President then notifies the student and AHJB Chair of his or her decision by email. For third offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignment. Additionally, AHJB votes on whether to recommend dismissal from the College, effective the following semester. The Chair informs the President of the AHJB's recommendation. The President then notifies the student and AHJB Chair of his or her decision by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. Suspensions and dismissals are noted on a student's transcript. 108 Those students who are found responsible for a violation - and are assigned an educational component - will be instructed to complete the educational component within 30 days. For example, those that are required to see Ethics Center will be instructed to make an appointment with the Ethics Center Director within a specified number of days; after their initial meeting with the Director, they will have 30 days to complete an individualized academic honesty education program. Occasionally the Director may refer the student to the Writing Center for additional support. When 30 days are not practical, the student, AHJB chair, and educational component advisor will agree on a reasonable deadline for completion. If the student fails to communicate with the Ethics Center Director or fails to complete the program within 30 days, the case may be referred back to the AHJB Chair for further academic penalties, or the case may be referred to the Dean of Students to be charged with failure to comply with college officials through the behavioral conduct process. The student will notify both the AHJB chair and the educational component advisor via email once the educational component is completed. Non-Lake Forest College students who are found responsible for academic dishonesty will not be required to meet with the Ethics Center or Writing Center. The faculty member, Dean of the Faculty, Dean of Students, Chair of AHJB, and the faculty advisor are notified of any sanctions assessed for Academic Honesty Policy violations. Furthermore, the Registrar is notified of any course failures. Suspensions or dismissals from the College are recorded on students' transcripts and in their permanent files. Withdrawals See the section titled \"Exceptions\" under \"Academic Policies\" regarding withdrawals from courses in which charges of academic dishonesty have been brought. Appeals A student may ask the Dean of the Faculty to consider an appeal on procedural grounds only. Student Evaluations When a faculty member has brought a charge of academic dishonesty against a student, a note indicating that such a charge was made will be included with the student evaluations for that course. 109 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination and mandate the availability of accommodations to ameliorate the impact of the disability to afford equal access to education. Students must meet the statutory definition of disability under federal law. In order to determine whether an individual is entitled to these protections, the Health and Wellness Center and the Learning and Teaching Center require evidence verifying that the individual's condition fits the definition of \"disability.\" The ADA defines disability as: 1. a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 2. a record of having such an impairment, or 3. being regarded as having such an impairment. A condition is considered a disability if it prevents or substantially limits the ability to perform a major life activity or significantly restricts the condition, manner, or duration in performing the major life activity as compared to the average person. The analysis of \"substantially limits\" is a comparative term to the average person in severity, impact, and duration. Generally, a condition must be substantially limiting for more than several months. A condition is not a disability if it results in mild limitations. ADA evidence serves two primary purposes: 1. To establish the right to protection from discrimination. Non-discrimination is an assurance that individuals with disabilities will not be excluded or provided lesser access to programs and activities based on assumptions rooted in stereotype or perception of ability that are not based in fact. Non-discrimination also provides freedom from harassment based on perceptions of disability. Evidence needed for protection from discrimination based on disability without a request for accommodation can be quite brief. A diagnostic statement from an appropriate professional or a past history or recognition as a person with a disability could suffice as the basis for protection from discrimination. 2. To determine the accommodations to which the individual may be entitled. Reasonable accommodations include modifications to policy, procedure, or practice and/or the provision of auxiliary aids and services that are designed to provide equal access to programs and services for qualified individuals with disabilities. Accommodations are reasonable when they do not fundamentally alter the nature of a program or service and do not represent an undue financial or administrative burden. To request appropriate accommodations, a student should contact the Assistant Dean of Faculty for Learning Support. More information can be found on the Services for Students with Disabilities website. Grievance Procedure Lake Forest College does not discriminate on the basis of a disability against any otherwise qualified person by denying him or her participation in, or the benefits of, any College program or activity. Section 504 requires the adoption of a grievance procedure to deal with allegations of discrimination on the basis of a disability. If a member of the student body feels there is reason to believe that discrimination because of disability has occurred under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance should be handled in the following manner: Services for Students with Disabilities 110 Individuals with a grievance should notify the President's Office of their grievances, in writing. It is recommended to do so within seven days of the alleged incident. Failing resolution, individuals should follow appropriate grievance procedures established for sex discrimination. 111 African American Studies American Studies Area Studies Art and Art History Asian Studies Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biology Chemistry Cinema Studies Classical Studies College Studies Communication Data Science Digital Media Design Economics, Business, and Finance Education English Entrepreneurship and Innovation Environmental Studies Ethics Center First-Year Studies Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies History International Relations Islamic World Studies Journalism Latin American and Latinx Studies Legal Studies Mathematics and Computer Science Medieval and Renaissance Studies Modern Languages and Literatures Museum Studies Music Music Education Neuroscience Philosophy Physics Politics Print and Digital Publishing Psychology Religion Self-Designed Major Undergraduate Departments and Programs 112 Social Justice Studies Sociology and Anthropology Theater Urban Studies 113 Faculty Daw-Nay Evans Associate Professor of Philosophy Chair of Philosophy Chair of African American Studies Courtney Joseph Assistant Professor of History and African American Studies RL Watson Assistant Professor of English Major and Minor in African American Studies The Major in African American Studies was introduced and the Minor in African American Studies was redesigned in 2016.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: AMER 101 Philosophy.) From growing up in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn to selling out concerts at Madison Square Garden, JAY-Z has become a global hip-hop icon. Besides being the first rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and holding the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist, JAY-Z's body of work stands as a monumental contribution to American culture. In this course, we explore the poetics and philosophy of JAY-Z's music. As we cultivate an artistic appreciation for JAY-Z's rap skills such as storytelling, wordplay, and delivery, we also treat his music as an opportunity to critically engage topics such as racism, sexism, and economic inequality. Finally, we watch several of JAY-Z's music videos as well as documentaries focused on his life and work. No prerequisites. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: PHIL 120 AFAM 205: Psychology of Prejudice In this course we will explore psychological approaches to understanding stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination--the psychology of prejudice, for short. We will examine research and theory on topics such as historical changes in the nature of intergroup attitudes; the prevalence of prejudice in the U.S. today; the impact of stereotyping and discrimination on members of stigmatized groups; likely causes of prejudice; the psychological processes underlying different forms of prejudice (e.g., based on race, ethnicity, class, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, or appearance); and methods of combating prejudice, encouraging acceptance of diversity, and improving intergroup relations.

The term \"Afrofuturism\" has been used to describe the recent cultural creations of black writers and artists who vividly envision futures of and for people of African descent. Afrofuturism, which aesthetic gained momentum in the work of science fiction authors Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, as well as in the jazz and poetry of musician SunRa, and which can be found thriving in works like Black Panther, is the subject of inquiry for this course. This survey is an introduction to the literary works produced within the movement from its modern manifestations to its present-day expansions. In his landmark essay on the topic, Mark Dery asks, \"Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?\" The wealth of literary and artistic production of works in the aesthetic provides a diverse and emphatic \"yes.\" This course seeks to position Afrofuturism as an alternative means of (re)interpretation, back-talk, and as an avenue for imagining a future in light of (and in spite of) the experiences of the past and present.

As the descendent of African American musical genres (like blues, jazz, soul, and funk), hip hop music and culture embodies the black experience and was born out of the black struggle of the 1960s and 1970s. Topics covered in this course include West Coast/gangsta rap, the Chicago sound, Cash Money and No Limit Records, the rise of Atlanta and the dirty South, international rap, female rappers, and more. How did this regional form of black expression become the international language of cool and controversy it is today? No prerequisites.

AFAM 230: African American History 1500-1865 This course will survey the history of African Americans in the New World, from the first colonial encounter through the sociopolitical changes of the burgeoning United States that led to the Civil War (1861-1865). The history of African Americans in the United States is often defined by the chattel slavery experience. However, the early years of American history that made people of African descent American are much more complex. By centering the actions and voices of the heterogeneous African American community, this course examines topics including the Middle Passage, domestic slavery expansion, free and maroon black communities, various resistance strategies, interracial coalitions, and the role of enslaved people in bringing about their own emancipation.

In 1865, the centuries-old question of where African Americans would fit into the fabric of United States society was finally answered. As newly freed people and full citizens, African Americans learned that the process of citizenship would not be seamless or easy, and that the fight was just beginning. Blacks redefined their status over and over again during this 150-year period, and this course will examine why and how these shifts occurred. No prerequisites.

In this course we examine the role of the hip-hop producer. We learn the origins of hip-hop deejaying and music production and follow its development into sampling, digital collage, and producer-as-hip-hop-auteur. By digging into the sources of various samples, we learn about the history of American popular music production. In addition, we put the music created by hip-hop producers into historic context. There is no such thing as music production separate from identity. Because hip-hop is the dominant musical form of our time, and because it's widely viewed as a form of black music, we study it to flesh out American musical identity. In-class time consists of listening, lectures, discussions, quizzes, and midterms and final exams. Homework consists of readings and listenings. No prerequisites.

We pay special attention to the normative, metaphysical, and conceptual problems and solutions that inform philosophical race theory. Some of the key questions we answer include the following: Is race a natural kind, a social kind, or something else entirely? What does philosophy have to contribute to the study of race and racism? What is the relationship between race and racism? We draw on readings from the history of philosophy, mainstream analytic philosophy, and recent European philosophy. Ultimately, the aim of this course is to provide students with a philosophical toolkit that will allow them to engage in civil and informed critical discussions about the nature and consequences of race talk and the practice of racism.

His films challenge the stereotypes and paternalistic assumptions about African Americans that have become sacrosanct in America's popular imagination. We will explore how the aesthetic representation of race, class, and gender in Spike Lee's filmography have helped create a new genre of film called African American noir. In so doing, we will watch several of Spike Lee's films, documentary projects, and television ads. Ultimately, our goal will be to appreciate Lee's cinematic technique, examine his critique of white supremacy, and consider the cultural and historical events that have shaped his artistic vision.

Students will study how racial injustice continues to pervade the American criminal justice system despite the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. How do so many players, from police officers to judges and juries, fail to protect against racial injustice? Why do courts, when confronted with allegations or proof of racially motivated police misconduct, overwhelmingly cite \"harmless error\" doctrine? To attempt to answer these complicated questions, students will learn legal criminal procedure, study 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th amendment case law, and have an opportunity to listen to and speak with a variety of professionals in the criminal justice field.

This course 121 also asks how such histories shed light on the current Black Lives Matter movement along with popular uprisings in Ferguson, Baltimore, and beyond. The history of black freedom struggles across the diaspora reveals that black people have always been active agents in fighting oppression. This course also encourages students to think about how these struggles were connected and have changed across time and space. No prerequisites.

This course explores the connections between race, class, and gender through the exploration of the intersections between these important components of social structure and ideology. The motivating goal in this course is to show students how social structure and meaning become intertwined elements in how we experience race, class, and gender. An important element in this course will be the emphasis on the identities and positions of relatively less empowered groups in contemporary society. This will be done through a focused consideration of structural and ideological elements of contemporary culture as found in: the media industry, journalism, social constructions of reality, music, film, television, radio, and the internet.

The increasingly popular musical genre and cultural phenomenon is often critiqued for being misogynist and homophobic. This class examines where this critique stems from and subverts this narrative to show the importance of women and gender to hip hop music and culture. Topics covered in this course include female rap pioneers, how discussions of masculinity and femininity have shaped rap lyrics, and the growing gender fluidity in hip hop.

The course uses documentary history, scholarly sources, and personal narratives to explore tensions between the ideals of freedom and equality and the reality of segregation and marginalization in U.S. education. Course content focuses on U.S. public education as a microcosm of equity and social justice issues nationally and internationally. Not open to first-year students.

From the founding of Chicago by a black man to the participation of blacks in the rebuilding of the city following the Great Chicago fire, and into an exploration of Bronzeville, 'a city within a city,' this course will highlight blacks and their contributions to this great city. Study of landmark texts, documentaries, novels, and photography, along with at least one field trip to the Chicago area, will reveal the impact of the Great Migration on the city; contributions of talented musicians, writers, and photographers involved in the Chicago Renaissance; and the origins of the famous black Chicago newspaper, the Chicago Defender, including its regular column by Langston Hughes. .

Critics and audiences have noted that we are in a golden era of black television, with an upsurge of shows over the last few years that display the multiplicity of black life in the United States. And yet, this is not the first time this has happened. Since the 1950s, African Americans have been depicted on the small screen in both regressive and progressive ways. How have these images changed over time? How do these depictions impact the way people see African Americans and how African Americans see themselves? No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly- arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

Until the environmental justice movement rose to prominence over the past few decades and invited a more critical perspective on the connection between race and the environment, popular understanding of the American environmental (and environmentalist) tradition had effectively been whitewashed. But why? This course will work to find answers to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of African American environmental culture in conversation with key moments in African American history--from slavery to sharecropping, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. With a special focus on Chicago's African American environmental culture and a field study to the city's South Side, an interdisciplinary approach will examine sources as diverse as slave narratives, fiction, poetry, songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies, and we will consider African American intellectuals, writers, visual and musical artists, and everyday citizens not always associated with environmental thought, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and the victims of Flint, Michigan's, water crisis.

We will read slave narratives, historical accounts of slavery, and philosophical interpretations of slavery from the black radical tradition and contemporary philosophy. All three approaches will provide us with multiple angles from which to consider the institution of slavery and America's supposed commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On the whole, our aim will be to wrestle with the tortured logic that is the tragic contradiction of American slavery and American freedom.

This course employs a variety of disciplinary perspectives\u2014including history, literature, sociology, political science, and philosophy\u2014to examine the origins and evolution of these social movements worldwide, but especially emphasizes the environmental battles waged by African American, Latinx, and Native American communities in the United States. From climate change's rising seas that threaten developing nations to the toxic waste dumps that threaten the health of communities of color, case studies are used to explore how local struggles help shape a global consciousness about environmental injustices. Chicago-area environmental justice movements are given special attention and are incorporated into field studies. Prerequisites: ES 110 or permission of instructor.

African-American philosophy can be defined in two ways: (1) wide-ranging philosophical work done by Americans of recent black African descent and (2) philosophical work on the lived experience of Americans of recent black African descent. We will primarily read philosophers whose philosophical work emphasizes the African-American experience. Thematically, the course will be guided by one overriding question: Given the historical reality of the Atlantic Slave Trade, the Three-Fifths Compromise, the anti-miscegenation laws, the Fugitive Slave Law, Lynch Law, and the Jim Crow laws, among many other inhumane practices, how does the experience of Africans in America constitute a unique combination of philosophical perspectives? Once we answer this question, we will understand how the African-American experience has created a new tradition in Western philosophy.

Particular emphasis will be given to the differences between the struggle for black equality in the south and its northern counterpart. Taught in a seminar format, the class will be both reading- and writing-intensive. Course readings and paper assignments are designed to help students develop a comparative analytical framework and to illuminate the following lines of inquiry: What caused and what sustained the civil rights movement? What changes took place within the movement over time, particularly at the level of leadership? What underlay the radicalization of the movement and what were the consequences? To what extent did the civil rights movement succeed and how do we measure that success today? Finally, how did the black civil rights movement inspire other groups and minorities in American society to organize? Prerequisite: History 200 or History 201.

Polls indicate that America is, by far, the most religious of industrial democracies and that our contentious political debates are, in large part, due to the religious dimensions of morally evocative issues like abortion and gay marriage, and the firm 130 positions of such constituencies as the Christian Right and new Religious Left. Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage and temperance drew on scholarly and legal interpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We will examine the role of religion in the founding of the American republic, and in contemporary political movements such as Black Lives Matter, the Federation for Immigration Reform, 21st century civil rights organizations with concerns ranging from prison reform to the environment, and the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. .

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K-12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

Beginning with the Constitution and the uncertain legacies of the American Revolution, the course considers the fundamental political, social, and cultural problems that could easily have torn the young Republic apart. Topics and themes include the problems of democracy and popular politics, the limits of citizenship, the formation of a distinctive American culture, the place of America on the world stage, the transition to capitalism and the 'market revolution,' and the figure of Andrew Jackson.

How do so many players, from police officers to judges and juries, fail to protect against racial injustice? Why do courts, when confronted with allegations or proof of racially motivated police misconduct, overwhelmingly cite \"harmless error\" doctrine? To attempt to answer these complicated questions, students will learn legal criminal procedure, study 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th amendment case law, and have an opportunity to listen to and speak with a variety of professionals in the criminal justice field.

More than an escape from everyday life, the games Americans have played and watched have been thick with social, cultural, and political meanings. Athletes and spectators alike have defined and challenged ideas of gender, race, and the body; they have worked out class antagonisms, expressed national identities, and promoted social change. Topics include: the construction of race; definitions of manhood and womanhood; industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of modern spectator sport; media and mass spectacle; fitness and athletic reform movements; collegiate athletics; sports figures and social change. Prerequisite: History 200 or 201, or permission of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: HIST 308 AMER 312: Black Metropolis (Black Metropolis: A Study of Black Life in Chicago). This course is a study of race and urban life in Chicago. From the founding of Chicago by a black man to the participation of blacks in the rebuilding of the city following the Great Chicago fire, and into an exploration of Bronzeville, 'a city within a city,' this course will highlight blacks and their contributions to this great city. Study of landmark texts, documentaries, novels, and photography, along with at least one field trip to the Chicago area, will reveal the impact of the Great Migration on the city; contributions of talented musicians, writers, and photographers involved in the Chicago Renaissance; and the origins of the famous black Chicago newspaper, the Chicago Defender, including its regular column by Langston Hughes. .

This course examines how succeeding immigrant groups have practiced and lived their Catholic faith in different times and places. Religion cannot be separated from the larger social and economic context in which it is embedded, so the course will also pay attention to the ways in which the social and economic conditions that greeted the immigrants on their arrival shaped how they went about praying and working. Finally, the changing leadership of the Catholic Church will be taken into account, since it provided the ecclesiastical framework for the new Catholic arrivals. Prerequisite: HIST 120 or HIST 121 or permission of the instructor. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: HIST 315, RELG 315 AMER 319: Protest and Police in U.S. History This course examines historical instances of policing, inequality, and protest, including mobs in the American Revolution, abolitionist direct actions, the terror of the Klu Klux Klan, sit-ins against Jim Crow, protest against military action, and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly- arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

The course will integrate a discussion of recent historical methodologies concerning moving images, with examples from a variety of forms, including historical epics, documentaries, propaganda, television series, literary adaptations, and biographies. Special emphasis will be placed upon the ambiguities of historical context, including the time of production, the period depicted, and changing audiences over time. Topics include: 'Feudal Codes of Conduct in Democratic Societies,' 'Film as Foundation Myth for Totalitarian Ideologies' and 'Situation Comedy of the 1970s as Social History.'

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: HIST 360, CINE 360 AMER 348: Museums and Exhibitions History is an academic discipline but it also has a public face. 'Public history,' through museum exhibitions, historical sites, the Internet, and other venues, is a growing career field. Students in this class will learn the communication tools necessary to produce an engaging and intellectually sound exhibit, including the techniques of oral history. The class will develop a concept, research in local archives, write label copy, and design and install an exhibit. We may use audio, video, photography, and the web to tell our story. The exhibition will be presented in the Sonnenschein Gallery or a local history museum, such as the Lake County Museum. The course will include field studies to Chicago-area history museums. Prerequisite: Junior or senior standing, or permission of the instructor.

His films, from early transgressive works such as Pink Flamingos (1972) through the commercial success of Hairspray (1988) and its follow-up Broadway musical, explore the American experience of trash culture through the lens of his hometown, Baltimore, MD. Students will examine the making of an American icon by interrogating Waters' engagement with contemporary popular culture, humor, and kitsch/trash culture. More broadly, this class will address how Waters' work may best be interpreted through queer theory, a perspective that examines the dualities of identity and performance, the natural, neutral and social constructions of gender, and how normative standards of sexuality and gender change over time.

Placing the geographic area that would become the United States into a global frame, this course explores patterns of European, Asian, and Latin American migration into a land already inhabited by mobile indigenous populations, the forced migration of enslaved Africans to the U.S. and later migration of black citizens northward, as well as the movement of migrants over the long-contested (and moving) U.S.-Mexico border. We learn about the politics of migration, including the long history of anti-immigrant nativism and xenophobia in the United States, as well as the role of migrants in shaping major U.S. social and political movements. We also examine how ethnic, racial, and national identities - including \"American\"-are not fixed categories, but rather constructed and reconstructed over time. .

This course explores the many ways Americans understood and shaped their diverse local environments during the crisis of the Great Depression. Although the Dust Bowl is perhaps the most iconic of these environmental upheavals during the 1930s, this course examines diverse geographical regions: from the Appalachian mountains to the (de)forested Upper Midwest, from the agricultural South to the Dust Bowl plains and the water-starved West. In each region, we use interdisciplinary approaches (including literary, historical, sociological, and visual media studies methods) to trace the impacts of economic turmoil on the environment and the people who depended on it for their livelihoods, as well as the way economic disaster paved the way for the government's unprecedented intervention in environmental matters.This course fosters critical examination of American subcultures during the Great Depression, including African-Americans, the Southern poor, the Range culture of the American West, and the immigrant experience.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: POLS 361 AMER 361: Civil Rights Movement This course focuses on the origins, development, and accomplishments of the civil rights movement in post-World War II America. Particular emphasis will be given to the differences between the struggle for black equality in the south and its northern counterpart. Taught in a seminar format, the class will be both reading- and writing-intensive. Course readings and paper assignments are designed to help students develop a comparative analytical framework and to illuminate the following lines of inquiry: What caused and what sustained the civil rights movement? What changes took place within the movement over time, particularly at the level of leadership? What underlay the radicalization of the movement and what were the consequences? To what extent did the civil rights movement succeed and how do we measure that success today? Finally, how did the black civil rights movement inspire other groups and minorities in American society to organize? Prerequisite: History 200 or History 201.

Rather than attempt a survey of all 140 the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understandings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contemporary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the tropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' certain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's lives.

One dominant strain of the post-World War II American environmental imagination has been fear of imminent environmental apocalypse, which manifests itself on a spectrum from diffuse anxiety to paralyzing terror. This course explores this culture of fear through a variety of topics in postwar American environmental consciousness, including the specter of atomic annihilation, the anti-eco- toxics and environmental justice movements, food security, and climate change. Texts and methodological approaches are literary, historical, anthropological, and sociological.

AMER 478: The 21st Century World (Dis)Order The international system of states is undergoing a power shift. Though it will remain the dominant world power for some time to come, most scholars agree that American global preeminence is waning. Yet scholars disagree about the effect of this shift on world order. Some see an effort by the United States and its closest allies to prop-up the current American liberal world order of global economic integration and cooperative security. Others envision either a 'post-American' world in which the United States and rising great powers re-negotiate the ground rules of a new liberal order, or a world in which the United States is one of a small number of great powers competing for power and influence in an illiberal world. Each of these possibilities raises compelling questions about war and peace, and cooperation and discord in twenty-first century international politics. Will this power shift jeopardize the liberal world order? Can this world order persist in the absence of American preeminence? How might the United States and its allies extend the current American world order?

Art Courses ART 130: Elements of Design Introduction to basic design problems in various two- and three-dimensional techniques and media. A prerequisite for most other courses in studio art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) 152 ART 131: Studio Art: Drawing This introductory course exposes the student to a variety of drawing tools and techniques. The emphasis is on the development of observational skill and on hand-eye coordination. Students learn the basics of value, line, and composition. The stress is on the development of a visual vocabulary and critical skills to express ideas in extended drawings. While focusing on hand/eye coordination and observational skills, the conceptual aspect of the subject matter centers, in large part, on our place in Nature: the plant/human connection, and the human/animal connection. All drawing will be created through observation of the real three-dimensional world; including plants, animals and animal/human skeletons. Emphasis will be on developing a drawing using preliminary studies and compositional ideas. Students will participate in group critiques, and will be exposed to ideas and techniques (historical and contemporary) through slide lectures. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ART 142: Digital Design Foundations Digital Foundations uses formal exercises of the Bauhaus to teach the Adobe Creative Suite.

ASIA 275: Desire and Discipline: Asian Morals This course offers a focused historical narrative of the development of Asian moral thinking. It shows, at its early phase, how a particular moral philosopher's thinking (such as Mencius and Xun-zi) is largely determined by his thinking on human nature. However, in later periods, particularly after the importation of Buddhism, the debates on human nature are replaced by an intense cognitive and metaphysical interest in the human mind. Moral cultivation begins to focus less on following moral rules but more on cultivating the mind. The effect of this nature-mind shift on Asian moral thinking is both historically profound and theoretically surprising. Readings: Confucius, Mencius, Xun-zi, Lao zi, Zhuang zi, Zhang Zai, Chen Brothers, Zhu Xi and D. T. Suzuki.

This test consists of 20 basic algebra problems and is an established measure of readiness and likelihood of success in introductory Biology and Chemistry courses. A score of 13/20 or better on the test is required for placement into BIOL 120 and CHEM 115: Chemistry I (see sequences below). First-Year Students with scores of 13/20 or above on the science placement assessment may take BIOL 120, CHEM 115, or both in their first semester. We recommend that students who are planning for graduate or professional (e.g. medical) school take both BIOL 120 and CHEM 115 the first semester (see sequence below) to allow time for additional science courses require for these postgraduate programs (see pre-health web page). Students may, however, begin by taking BIOL 120 in the fall semester and delaying CHEM 115 to the following fall, or taking CHEM 115 in the fall semester, followed by BIOL 120 and CHEM 116 in spring. Students with scores of 12/20 or lower on the science placement assessment will be placed into CHEM 114: Foundations of Chemistry in the Spring Semester of the first year (see sequences below), and are strongly encouraged to take additional courses in the first year that will strengthen quantitative skills. Students who begin with CHEM 114 in the spring of their first year will be able to complete the Biology major in their fourth year. However, both BIOL 120 and CHEM 115 must be completed no later than the fall semester of the sophomore year in order for a student to graduate with a Biology major in four years. Consult your advisor or the chair of the Biology Department for further explanation. Major and Minor in Biology Although strongly discouraged , a course grade of \"Pass\" will be allowed for a maximum of one biology course towards the major or minor.

For years, scientists have been able to modify the food we eat, construct better vaccines, and improve cancer treatment through genetic manipulations. However, within the past few years, we have entered an new era where even the genes of our children can be edited, due to a new technique called CRISPR that is incredibly precise, efficient, and relatively inexpensive. This technique may have positive outcomes, like allowing mosquitoes that are malaria-resistant to survive in the wild and enabling us to eat beef or chicken without ever raising an animal. This course explores the molecular basis for how genes are cut and edited; the basis of the CRISPR system which originated as an immune response in bacteria; the myriad potential uses of CRIPSR in current and future research; and the ethical dilemmas that certainly will result. Students have an opportunity to cut bacterial genes themselves in the laboratory. The course includes discussions, lectures, and a special emphasis on student presentations. Prerequisites: BIOL 120 or CHEM 115. No corequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences and Speaking requirements.)

Much of this knowledge is disseminated through scholarly articles in scientific journals. Because scientific papers are often complex, including technical terms and statistical analyses, misunderstandings are common. News and popular media broadcast medical and health findings to the general public, frequently oversimplifying or misinterpreting the science. In this course, students will critique medical journalism and medical research by comparing popular reporting to original scientific sources. Emphasizing reading and understanding of scholarly literature in medicine, students will develop their capacity to recognize, comprehend, and critique medical research. Class activities will include lectures, discussion, student presentations, and written exercises. Prerequisite: BIOL 120.

The Classical Studies minor student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the major epochs of Greek and/or Roman antiquity, including the broad span of either or both of these cultures as distinct and unique cultural- historical entities among other ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean area and Near East, and within specific areas of student disciplinary specialization (e.g. art, history, archaeology, politics, philosophy, religion, sociology, anthropology, museum studies & etc.), and the defining characteristics of ancient Greek and/or Roman civilization in antiquity. 2. Classical Studies minors will demonstrate a familiarity with the principles and practices of archaeology; be able to understand archaeological sites and their schematic representations based on topographical site plans; and relate critical archaeological inquiry to other disciplines and courses of study fundamental to an understanding of ancient Greece or Rome, or, comparatively, other ancient cultures and civilizations. 3. The Classical Studies minor will demonstrate an understanding of the uniqueness, innovations and legacy of Graeco-Roman antiquity in relation to later civilizations (the 'western tradition' and its opponents), including subsequent Greek cultures and modern institutions, styles, principles and values dominant in the West and (where applicable) in non-Western cultures. 227 4. After participation in a study-abroad program in Greece, the Classical Studies minor will be able to demonstrate research skills, critical thinking and writing skills. He or she will be able to make cogent reflections on the experience in another culture as well as connections to her or his on-campus program of studies or other aspects of her or his academic career. Classical Studies Courses CLAS 201: Ancient Greece: Life, Thought, Arts In this course, students gain an understanding of the ancient Greek world, in which so many modern Western humanistic values and ideas found their earliest expression. In particular, we study the story as it is presented by the ancient Greeks themselves\u2014in their literature, written history, philosophy, art, and artifacts. As a prerequisite course for the Lake Forest College Program in Greece (during which students study actual artifacts of the ancient world on site in Greece), this course is interdisciplinary by design, both in what is studied and how it is studied. We, for instance, identify and discuss the importance of various areas on the city plans of ancient Greek polei, learn about the role of women in ancient Sparta vs. their role in ancient Athens, engage in deep literary analysis of Homer's epic poems, and learn the techniques, shapes, and uses appropriate to different Greek vases from the Bronze Age to the Classical period. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) CLAS 202: Greek Civ: Bronze Age to Byzantium The classroom for this course is Greece itself. Students will travel to a variety of archeological sites, museums, and other important and beautiful places across Greece, including several Greek Islands, studying the history, art, and society of Greece from the Bronze Age (roughly 3000-1200 BCE), through the Classical Age (480-300 BCE) to the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire (330-1453 CE). Study sites may include the palace of Knossos on Crete (by legend, the home of the Minotaur), Agamemnon's palace at Mycenae, the Athenian Acropolis and Agora, or the Hagios Demetrios, where the the Patron Saint of Thessaloniki was martyred.

CLAS 211: Roman History This course examines the history of Italy and the Mediterranean world during the thousand-plus years of Roman rule. We begin with Rome's establishment as a small city-state, as recorded in both legend and archaeological evidence. We chart Rome's political development and imperial expansion under the republic, study the career of Augustus and the revolution by which he transformed Rome into an empire, and conclude with that empire's fragmentation into the Byzantine, Latin Christian, and Islamic worlds. The topics studied will include: key political institutions and leaders; war, imperialism, and their consequences, including slavery and social unrest; the work of authors such as Cicero, Vergil, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius; the varied Roman religious scene and the rise of Christianity and Islam; Roman social history, including class, marriage, and slavery.

Everybody eats, and every culture has developed cultural patterns and social norms around the production, preparation, and consumption of food and drink (foodways). This course offers an introduction to Food Studies, the cultural analysis of food and foodways. Students consider the models and methods of studying food, including the major anthropological, folkloristic, and sociological approaches. Since this course is taught in Athens as part of the Lake Forest College in Greece program, it takes Greek food and foodways as the major case study. During the course, students focus on the relationship of food to their areas of interest, such as agritourism, environmental concerns, politics, or religion. 228 Prerequisites: No prerequisites.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 212: Visual Rhetoric We are surrounded by visual communication in our daily lives, yet the ubiquity of visual imagery makes it difficult for us to critically evaluate the images we see. In this course we will approach visual artifacts as texts, paying particular attention to their relationship to the political, social, and economic climate in which they reside. Throughout the semester we will develop a lexicon of visual terms, engage a variety of visual texts, such as monuments, advertisements, photography, typography, and architecture, and practice evaluating visual arguments. Not open to students who have already completed COMM 112 or COMM 370. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 250: Classical Rhetorical Tradition This course is an historical survey of theorizing about the role of public discourse in human affairs from ancient Greece and Rome. We consider how the functions and nature of public discourse is understood, whether its skillful use can be taught, and the relationship between public argument and reaching social consensus about issues of truth and ethics. We will apply these ancient concepts to contemporary ideas in order to explore how concepts from different periods in time can aid us in evaluating contemporary persuasive messages in public life.

We will consider how arguments are created, presented, reframed, and refuted in contexts ranging from interpersonal disagreements to public controversies. In order to recognize how different strategies of argumentation change depending on the context, we will explore the important public dimension of argumentation and advocacy, recognizing skill in advocacy as a fundamental element of effective democracy. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 255: Communication Criticism In this course we consider how texts work rhetorically to persuade audiences. The course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and tools for describing, analyzing, interpreting and evaluating a variety of forms of persuasive discourse communicated through different media. Communication Criticism is designed to provide students with knowledge about the nature, function and effects of persuasive communication, as well as to develop the skills necessary to produce analytical critiques of public discourse. Prerequisite: COMM 110 with a grade of C or better. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 256: Communication Research Methods This course presents students with a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods for doing research in communication, in scholarly and professional contexts. In the course of a semester, this course covers the philosophical rationales undergirding these varied research approaches. With this established, the course gives students a hands-on sense of communication research methods, including: survey research, content analysis, experimental approaches, interviewing, discourse analysis, field research, and historical methods. The course will at all times involve careful attention to how the field of communication requires a heightened sense of circumspection regarding its own methods of study.

COMM 274: Visual Chicago This course is a special adaptation of COMM 212: Visual Rhetoric to be taught in the College's \"In the Loop\" program. In this course we will approach visual artifacts as texts, paying particular attention to their relationship to the political, social, and economic climate in which they reside. Throughout the semester we will develop a lexicon of visual terms, engage a variety of visual texts, such as monuments, advertisements, photography, typography, and architecture, and practice evaluating visual arguments. What makes this course different from COMM 212 is that our visual texts and assignments will focus on Chicago based visual artifacts. Not open to students who have already completed COMM 112, COMM 212, or COMM 370. No prerequisites: (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 281: Media and Society In this course, we examine the major theories and social critiques developed in response to systems of mass media and communication, including film, radio, television, and a national press. These theories and critiques range in concern from the democratic potential of mass media, to their role in manufacturing and mediating cultural values. Students engage with the major schools of thought that have become the foundation for contemporary mass communication and media research, including: early sociological approaches to communication theory, the strong and limited media effects traditions, the technology-oriented theories of the Canadian School, the Frankfurt School, British Cultural Studies, and American Cultural Studies. Students examine how definitions of mass media and 235 communication have changed over time, and how these concepts continue to evolve alongside our interactions with modern media and communication technologies. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 283: Race, Class, Gender, and the Media Race, class, and gender occupy important places in the contemporary study of the media. This course explores the connections between race, class, and gender through the exploration of the intersections between these important components of social structure and ideology. The motivating goal in this course is to show students how social structure and meaning become intertwined elements in how we experience race, class, and gender. An important element in this course will be the emphasis on the identities and positions of relatively less empowered groups in contemporary society. This will be done through a focused consideration of structural and ideological elements of contemporary culture as found in: the media industry, journalism, social constructions of reality, music, film, television, radio, and the internet. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 283 COMM 285: Modern Media History This course provides a broad overview of the history of the media of communication. This is done through use of a chronological treatment of: face-to-face communication, writing, printing, telegraphy, telephony, motion pictures, radio, television, and the internet. Though the course begins with a review of ancient communication media, the focus here is placed on the media in Western society from the 19th through the 21st centuries. The most important goal in this course is to consider how media of communication relate to: culture, social structure, the economy, politics, and knowledge. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 287: Media Systems and Institutions Behind our favorite movies, TV programs, websites, and songs exist powerful media institutions. Disney, Fox, Warner Brothers, Google, and Apple are just a few of the media industry giants upon which we have grown increasingly dependent for our everyday entertainment and information needs. In this course we examine these media institutions, including their historical development, organizational structure, and methods of production and distribution. We also analyze and compare the various types of media systems that exist in the U.S. and worldwide, including commercial, public, and state-controlled media models. Finally, we consider the issues of globalization and digital convergence, and the ways these phenomena are changing the organization and function of modern media industries. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 350: Topics in Communication Intensive study of selected subjects within the field of communications. Topics vary by semester. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) COMM 372: Rhetoric of Economics & the Market In this course we consider the relationship between rhetorical discourse and economics. Do economists merely present empirical conclusions or do they use the techniques of persuasion to create both disciplinary and public understandings of their subject? Is the free market an 'invisible hand' that works to stabilize society or is it a construct of persuasive discourse? Finally we will examine the value of public deliberation regarding complex economic policies. Prerequisite: COMM 255 or permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 373: Cultural Theory and Media Studies In this course students examine a variety of advanced communication theories now current in the field of communication studies, including reception theory, Marxist materialism, political economy, public sphere theory, ritual theory, technological approaches, and production of culture theory. A central goal of this course is to help 236 students contextualize and critique political, social, and economic constructions of culture. Prerequisite: Comm 255, or another 200-level Communication course approved by the Department Chair, or consent of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 374: Rhetorical Chicago The Second City, the City with Big Shoulders, The Windy City, City in the Garden, Hog Butcher to the World, the City that Works: these are just some of the nicknames for the City of Chicago. This seminar examines the City of Chicago as both the site and source of rhetoric by using rhetorical theory and skills to explore art, architecture, geography, emblems, music, theater, sports, holidays, politics, media, museums, controversies and important rhetorical events including William Jennings Bryan's 1896 Cross of Gold speech, FDR's 1932 nomination acceptance, and Obama's 2008 victory speech. This course takes advantage of Lake Forest College's proximity to the City of Chicago in order to explore two key concepts in communication: the discursive construction of place and the impact of place on rhetoric. Prerequisite: Comm 255 or permission of instructor (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 376: Queer Cinema This course will focus on queer cinema--films that not only challenge prevailing sexual norms, but also seek to undermine the categories of gender and sex. Gender and sexual norms are perpetuated and challenged through notions of visibility, a key tactic in the fight for societal acceptance and civil rights. How sexuality is made visible and invisible will serve as a central focus in our analysis of queer film and media, focusing primarily on explicit representations of GLBTQ characters. Through feminist and queer theory, film theory and cultural criticism, we will analyze the contested relationships between spectators and texts, identity and commodities, realism and fantasy, activism and entertainment, desire and politics. Prerequisite: COMM 255, COMM 275, or permission of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: GSWS 376, CINE 376 COMM 381: Hist & Theory Freedom of Expression (History and Theory of Freedom of Expression) This course explores the origins of the concept of free expression and draws out the varying philosophical assumptions that influence the discussion of free expression in the contemporary world. The course compares and contrasts classical liberal and romantic theories of expression. We examine both philosophies as they are reflected in historical examples of debates concerning freedom of expression, with a special emphasis on freedom of the press, but also addressing issues related to censorship, propaganda, pornography, and hate speech. The course culminates with a consideration of how arguments about freedom of expression come to rely on the precepts of these philosophies. Prerequisite: Comm 255, or Jour 320, or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 382: Women's Rhet & Feminist Critique (Women's Rhetoric and the Feminist Critique) Traces the development of women's oratorical tradition and the feminist critique by looking at how U.S. women argued for the right to speak before they had the vote and then how they continue arguing for equality once the right to suffrage had been established. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: GSWS 382 COMM 383: New Media & Society This course offers students a wide array of theoretical lenses for understanding what is often called 'the information society.' The course begins with a sustained consideration of the utopian myths associated with novelty as it relates to technology. After this, the focus moves to different ways to understand how new media (always a treacherous term) relate to: the public and political engagement, journalism, interpersonal communication, popular culture, the forces of political economy, surveillance, consumption, and religion. Prerequisite: Comm 255, or another 200-level Communication course approved by the Department Chair, or consent of the instructor.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 384 COMM 385: The Public Sphere In this course we take up the issue of the 'public sphere' to consider its value and operation in modern society. The classic public sphere concerned public debate that took place in small coffeehouses where locals would meet to discuss the issues of the day. Now, public debate can be found strewn across the media: in entertainment, theater, music, art, schools, and of course in journalism. The course is framed by key questions such as: What counts as 'public' and 'private'? What is the role of the public? What voices are excluded in the public sphere? What are the best ways to be public? What role do journalism, photography, film, literature, and sports have in a public sphere? Prerequisite: Comm 255 or Jour 320 or by permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 386: Reading Popular Culture:Television Focusing on how culturally we are both producers and products of our popular culture we will try to answer the question: 'are we, as a culture, using the potential of television wisely'? (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 386 COMM 387: Rhetoric of Law This course will introduce students to the idea that the US legal system is rhetorical in that it shapes and is shaped by discourse. We will begin by considering what is rhetorical about the law and will then focus our attention on the rhetorical effects of legal discourse. Bearing in mind that the law is particularly performative- that is, it has the power to produce the effects that it names- we will consider the role that the actual language of the law plays in doing the work of the law. We will examine a variety of legal texts and contexts including the courtroom, the trial transcript, appellate opinion, legal textbooks and the Supreme Court opinion in order to understand how prior legal discourses affect the outcomes of legal questions. To do so we will learn about and apply particular critical lenses to our texts including rhetorical culture, critical legal studies, narrative and the law as literature movement, and discourse analysis. In addition to reading trial transcripts and legal opinions, students will be expected to visit a courtroom and watch the proceedings during the course of the semester. Prerequisite: Comm 255, or consent of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 388: Rhetoric and Public Memory Ancient rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian have made memory central to the study and teaching of rhetoric. However, recent work by contemporary scholars goes beyond examinations of memory as mnemonic aid to consider memory, and its construction, as rhetorical activity. The primary interest in this respect is the persuasive and communicative features of memory and memory-making. This course examines the rhetoric of collective memory by focusing on how the past is constructed to serve the present. We will explore the communicative bases of public memory and its role in experiences of place and understandings of identity. We will consider how rhetoricians have addressed the issue of memory, paying close attention to how they discuss the materiality of memory, the social and cultural politics shaping the construction of memory, and the theoretical concepts and methods used to rhetorically analyze texts and sites of memory. Prerequisite: COMM 255 or permission from instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 389: Political Economy of Media This course introduces students to critical theories concerned with the political and economic authority of modern media industries. We discuss the potential impact of the consolidation of media ownership on the diversity and localism of media; the gatekeeping and agenda-setting functions of globalizing and corporatized media; the increasingly influential role of multinational media corporations in international policy and trade negotiations; the importance of institutional structure as it relates to the world of journalism; the struggle between public and 238 commercial interests to define and control the infrastructure, content, and interactive spaces of new media; and the possibilities and pitfalls of past and present media reform movements.

One credit acceptable, but two credit internships preferred. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Experiential Learning requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 420: Senior Seminar Focus of seminar changes frequently. Fall 2018 Seminar: Journalism, Culture, and Society. The course will deepen students' knowledge of journalism. The course will involve an extensive survey of contemporary approaches to understanding journalism, with emphases on the importance of journalism to democracy, and on the intellectual foundations of journalism criticism. Students will master analytical frames for understanding and criticizing print, broadcast, and online journalism. Spring 2019 Seminar: Fashion, Identity, and Power. Fashion is among the most visible and meaningful ways in which we express ourselves. In addition to being \"what we wear,\" it is a mode of communication and a reflection of the historical moment. Changes in clothing and discourses surrounding clothing indicate shifts in relationships and reflect tensions between groups of people. In this seminar we will explore the various social, cultural, economic, political, and personal meanings associated with fashion and consumption, while using media and cultural theory to trace the implications of sartorial style for the production and reproduction of gender norms from the 18th century to the present moment.

Grade Policies A student must earn a B- or better grade in any Education (EDUC) course for the course to count toward the Education major and licensure. A student must earn a C or better grade in all non-Education licensure course requirements, including cross-listed courses, for the course to count toward the licensure program. No course that counts towards the Education major and licensure may be taken with the Pass/Fail grade option. All Pass/Fall grades earned toward the Education major and licensure must be converted to the actual (A-F) grade equivalent and factored into the GPA. All other courses are subject to the College's grade policy. See the Education Department Policies and Procedures for additional information. Academic Grievances for Teacher Education Students Teacher education candidates have the same academic rights and responsibilities as all Lake Forest College students. There are, however, specific situations in the teacher education program when decisions may be cause for student grievances. These situations include the following: Admission to or dismissal from the teacher education program, a clinical experience, or student teaching Evaluation of the candidate's performance in courses, clinical experiences, or student teaching Recommendation for state licensure or for employment Students who wish to appeal any of these teacher education matters should first confer with the chairperson of the Education Department. Appeals must be made in writing to the Education Advisory Council through the chairperson of the Education Department. Students may have personal, academic, or legal support in hearings concerning teacher education matters. If an issue remains unresolved, the student may take his or her grievance to the AAB or the Dean of Faculty, depending on the nature of the grievance, and, finally, to the President of the College.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K-12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

For much of the world, the privileging of schooling as a site of education has had real ramifications on the possibility of maintaining cultural forms that go against the pressures of globalization and capitalism. This course opens with a broad consideration of education before focusing on schooling as the preferred institutional form of education under early 21st century globalism. Our questions will include both how schooling operates to maintain existing social structures and power relations and the possibilities - and consequences - of schools as a site of change. .

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.) ENGL 140: Stories of Resiliency Imaginative literature from many cultures documents challenges to the individual's personal resiliency. Whether these challenges come from antagonists, from the social norms of the community, or from nature itself, writers of poetry, drama, and fiction have studied the ways people have met, or failed to meet, challenges to their lives, wellbeing, and sanity. Focusing chiefly on American literature from the nineteenth and twentieth century, this course will engage students in discussion of resiliency struggles as they have been framed by the imaginations of great writers. This online course will research activities, threaded interactive discussion, video mini-lectures, and group projects. No prerequisites.

ENGL 180: Religion, SciFi, and Fantasy (Religion, Science Fiction, Fantasy) Of the literary genres, perhaps science fiction and fantasy best allow creative artists to imagine real and possible answers to the deep religious questions that have historically driven philosophers, theologians, and thinkers. Who are we? What do we want? Where did we come from? How does everything end? What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? In this class we examine science fiction and fantasy short stories, motion pictures, novels, and television programs to ask how creative artists and wider society have asked and answered these questions. We also consider how science fiction and fantasy have commented on and mirrored real-world religions. No prerequisites. Intended for first-year students and sophomores only.

Talking cats and stranded princesses. Web-footed women and enchanted forests. If you thought you left all of that excitement behind with your childhood fairy tales, think again. Many modern fiction writers have turned more and more to the resources of fantasy literature as a fresh way to explore serious ideas for an adult audience. Seeking both to teach and delight, modern fantasy writers re-angle old fairy tales or invent their own enchanted tales to prod contemporary readers out of conventional ways of thinking and acting, using space and time flexibly to challenge ethical, political, and religious beliefs - indeed, our basic understanding of nature, society and self. In this course, we read the delightful and instructively irreverent fantasies of several important modern fiction writers. In doing so, we try to evaluate the nature of each writer's fictional innovations as well as the serious purposes each writer may have in mind for his or her fantasy. In short, we try to understand some of the many possibilities and uses of enchantment in modern fiction.

It should not be surprising, then, that Indian authors have produced a wealth of novels, short stories, and poems written in English and concerned with issues of identity, nation, and history. In this course, we read English-language work by authors such as Rabindranath Rushdie, Arundati Roy, and Amitav Ghosh; learn about the major historical and political events described in these works: the Opium Wars, Swadeshi, Independence, Partition, \"the Emergency,\" the Naxalite movement; and read postcolonial theory to better understand and interpret these works.

A writing-intensive course focused on using the tools of narrative nonfiction to communicate scientific discovery to the public. Students will read the work of scientists and scientific communicators such as Stephen Hawking, Rebecca Skloot, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Atul Gawande, and Steven Pinker to discover the storytelling principles they employ to inform and entertain their readers. We will explore the science of story, the cognitive and evolutionary source of its power, and the art of scientific journalism, and students will draft and workshop their own essays about \"popular science.\" No prerequisites.

ENGL 210: Gods, Monsters, & Questing Humanity (Gods, Monsters & Questing Humanity: Ancient and Medieval Literature.) If you love stories of gods and demons, questing heroes and mythic monsters, you'll find a plethora of these fascinating figures in the great tales of ancient and medieval writers such as Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, Marie De France, Dante, Chaucer, and many more. This survey of ancient and medieval literature traces the origins of the Western literary tradition by exploring how writers from this delightfully distant period have imagined the gods, how they have understood themselves and their relationship to the cosmos, and how questing human beings have sought to answer problems of meaning and value that still have resonance for us today.

ENGL 211: From Fairyland to Flying Islands (From Fairyland to Flying Islands: Renaissance to Enlightenment English Literature.) This course explores British literature from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, an era of revolutionary new encounters, from discovered moons to newly-charted territories. Writers imagined the freeing power of \"golden worlds\" created by their verse just as experimental literary forms brought into being some of the most esteemed works of literature in Shakespeare's Globe and the newfangled \"novels\" of Swift and others. Yet it was also a time of profound tumult, from the stake- burning religious upheavals of the Reformation to the monarchical beheadings of the Civil War. How did the writers of the era make sense of both the discoveries and disruptions of their own time? What happens as we move from an \"early modern\" era into one that feels more distinctly \"modern\"? Making our way through some of the most well- known pieces of the era - Macbeth, Paradise Lost, and Gulliver's Travels - we explore how early writers shaped freedom and constraint, love and cruelty, and the discoveries of new worlds and crumbling texts.

Change came more quickly, and more dramatically, to England during the long nineteenth century - the period between the French Revolution and the First World War - than in any era before or since. The growth of cities, of democracy, of women's rights, and of empire haunted the imagination, spawning images of rebel outsiders, dreams of art for art's sake, and some of the best monsters - Frankenstein's creature, Count Dracula, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde - in all of literature. We follow the evolution of England's imagination in this most turbulent age. The third course in the Classics of Literature sequence.

The term \"Afrofuturism\" has been used to describe the recent cultural creations of black writers and artists who vividly envision futures of and for people of African descent. Afrofuturism, which aesthetic gained momentum in the work of science fiction authors Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, as well as in the jazz and poetry of musician SunRa, and which can be found thriving in works like Black Panther, is the subject of inquiry for this course. This survey is an introduction to the literary works produced within the movement from its modern manifestations to its present-day expansions. In his landmark essay on the topic, Mark Dery asks, \"Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?\" The wealth of literary and artistic production of works in the aesthetic provides a diverse and emphatic \"yes.\" This course seeks to position Afrofuturism as an alternative means of (re)interpretation, back-talk, and as an avenue for imagining a future in light of (and in spite of) the experiences of the past and present.

Malcolm X (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so often put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle-whether it be through the message of non-violence and 293 Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self-defense and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malcolm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular in style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featured by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to delve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle in America. We will look at the creative activist writings of each-speeches, letters, interviews, autobiographical material-and complicate what at first seems a simple battle between \"violent\" and \"non-violent\" approaches to liberation.

Yet, throughout our varied stories about medicine, writers confront again and again the profound isolation and invisibility of the sick. What is it about physical pain that breaks down our language to describe it? How do medical narratives represent illness, giving structure and voice to this night-side of life? In this course, we explore medical texts by reading radically different writers across time, including Tolstoy, Shelley, and contemporary physicians. Throughout, we examine the myriad ways artists represent illness, through novels, poetry, short stories, autobiographies, films, guidebooks, and more. We work to unpack the binaries of sickness/health, normal/diseased, patient/doctor, and even life/death, in these stories about doctors, patients, epidemics, and mortality. After learning to \"read\" narratives of disease, students \"write\" disease, creating their own disease through an archive of texts.

Burroughs (1914-1997) and his collaborators. While the course will pay particular attention to the outsized influence of Burroughs in contemporary aesthetics, we will freely investigate cut-ups, mash-ups, remixes, dj culture, user-generated content, conceptual literature, crowdsourcing, social media, and related strategies in publishing and aesthetics that together produce a collaborative critique of Romantic definitions of authorship and genius. In these domains, we will cover everything from Girl Talk to \"Auto-Tune the News\" to Star Wars: Uncut to what's happening tomorrow, all through the lens of user-based textual interventions. Lecture, discussion, and appropriation-based responses in hard copy and digital forms. No prerequisites. Course begins on the first day of classes after mid-semester break.

In recent years, virtual reality technology has made major advances, making it possible to do things and go places that were previously impossible. In this course, we'll explore - through readings, discussion, and experiential learning in the Lake Forest College Virtual Space - some of VR experiences in areas including gaming, science, art, research, education, storytelling, and socializing. We'll look at the way culture has thought about VR in the last few decades in novels by authors such as William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and Ernest Cline, and in film and television programs like Strange Days, eXistenZ, and Black Mirror. In all cases, we will focus on the way narrative storytelling is impacted by virtual culture. This class will give us a chance to think together about how space works differently in VR, how \"real\" VR experiences are and what the future of VR might hold. No prerequisites.

ENGL 228: Women Writing Women This course surveys selected women writers, in diverse genres past and present, with a focus on American women writers in the 20th and 21st centuries. As we read selected literary texts, we explore how they \"write women,\" in other words, how they deconstruct and reinvent the meanings of \"woman\" in their work.

We will explore \"drone\" as an umbrella term not only for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which run from children's toys to weapons of war, but also as technological \"noise\" that increasingly confronts us in our daily lives. In this, we will look to representation of automation in literature, in texts such as Galatea 2.2 by Richard Powers. Similarly, the \"selfie\" is not only the picture one takes on a smart phone, but also a current mode of representation that has significant literary and visual antecedents in portraiture and autobiography. Accordingly, course \"texts\" may include everything from The Picture of Dorian Gray, to a selfie stick, to industrial drone music, although the dominant lens of the course will be literary.

The class will trace the emergence and development of performance art as a form of expression both distinct from and yet dependent upon traditional and experimental forms of theater and other contemporary manifestations of theatricality. Students will negotiate, through reading, research, discussion and planning and practical application, the blurred boundaries between performing and living, entertainment and art.

We will pay special attention to plays that have been filmed a number of times, so that we can develop useful comparisons: Richard III (Olivier, Loncraine), Romeo and Juliet (Zeffirelli, Luhrmann, Zeffirelli, Almereyda), and Macbeth (Polanski, Kurzel). Major goals will be to develop our ability to do close readings of both the original texts and the films, to do creative film adaptation projects, and to develop effective ways of expressing both our analytical and our creative ideas.

We'll look at examples of the various elements of fiction as used in the genre - voice, character analysis, plot, narration, symbolism, point of view, and theme, with a primary focus on various ways to sustain and build suspense and use those as a model for our own creative work. The course will ask students to write short stories, participate in group workshops and discussion, attend individual conferences, and revise their work. Course reading may include: Edgar Allan Poe, Kelly Link, Shirley Jackson, Octavia Butler, Alvin Schwartz, Rosemary Timperley, Roald Dahl, Edith Wharton, Brian Evenson, Amelia Gray, Elizabeth Bowen, Blake Butler, Henry James, and Helen Oyeyemi.

ENGL 244: Writing Science Fiction In this writing-intensive course, students explore the strange new worlds of science fiction and the possibilities of virtual reality. The roots of science fiction go back to 16th- and 17th-century writers like Thomas More, Margaret Cavendish, and John Milton, who confronted the onset of modernity with wildly extravagant utopian and cosmological imaginations. Science fiction since that time has often anticipated the developments of ever- accelerating technological transformation, asking critical questions about the nature of the human in the increasingly alien world we have created while addressing key questions of race, class, gender, and ability. Students in this course read works of classic and contemporary science fiction by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. LeGuin, Octavia Butler, Kim Stanley Robinson, Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, Kathy Acker, and Ted Chiang, while studying the techniques of world-building, character development, and plot that enable them to write their own science-fictional works. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) 296 ENGL 245: Novel Writing Boot Camp An intensive course focusing on the craft of novel writing. Students will study the novel form and the possibilities and frameworks of different genres of fiction and hybrid prose.

Group discussions and individual conferences. Prerequisites: None, though ENGL 135 is recommended. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.) ENGL 246: Memoir Writing Boot Camp An intensive course focusing on the craft of memoir writing. Students will consider what it means to \"write your memoir,\" by investigating questions of how to relate dialogue (if you didn't get it on tape), how to share your work with family members, and how to trust your own memory. We will explore the line between memoir and autobiographical fiction, and the course will incorporate literature, critical theory, and creative writing exercises to determine if an author can ever write a \"true\" story. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ENGL 248: Writing Detective Fiction (Tales of Murder and Mystery: Writing Detective Fiction.) This workshop investigates the art and craft of writing detective fiction. We begin by examining the case of Edgar Allan Poe's \"tales of ratiocination\" and move on to putting Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes under the magnifying Brown, and Raymond Chandler's hard- boiled and laconic Philip Marlowe, as well as contemporary examples of fictional detectives. The goal is elementary, Watson: discovering what distinguishes the genre in terms of narrative elements such as character, tension, suspense, plot, and mood. Students are asked to file their reports primarily in the form of their own stories featuring their own detectives investigating crimes of their own choosing. This writing-intensive course features discussion and analysis of short stories and short novels, writing exercises, workshops, peer feedback, and revisions of student work. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.) ENGL 249: Brains, Minds, and Madness in Lit (Brains, Minds, and Madness in Literature.) Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often- dead writers become part of our own brain-matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Virginia Woolf to Vladimir Nabokov. Moreover, we consider the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" After learning to \"read\" the mind in literature, students will create their own aesthetic of the brain gone \"right\" or \"wrong\", creating narratives versed in the newest neuroscientific research on the pleasures and dangers of reading the \"minds\" of another.

ENGL 251: Grateful Dead and American Culture More than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight-Ashbury acid-testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s 297 found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan-soaked 1980s, and on to the jam-band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars. We'll understand the various subcultures that separate the sixties and now, and in doing so, offer answers to this key question: Why do the Dead survive?

Recipients of this award hail from all continents and their poems, plays, and prose present challenging responses to questions of class, culture, ethnicity, literature, and national origin. Central to this course is the examination of the differences between and the parallels of African, Asian, Latin American, and European writers in the aftermath of rapid (and often violent) political and social change. Readings are likely to include authors such as Alexievich, Coetzee, Kawabata, Milosz, Munro, Neruda, many others.

ENGL 264: The Beat Generation (The Beat Generation: Influences and Legacy.) The core members of the group of writers known as the Beats- Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs- have had a profound influence on the development of postwar American literary and artistic culture. In this course students will be introduced to some of the Beats' major predecessors (notably William Blake, Walt Whitman, and William Carlos Williams) as well as writers whose work has brought the Beat legacy into the twenty-first century (Anne Waldman, Roberto Bola, Amiri Baraka, Eileen Myles, and others). Students will read these writers with an eye toward their contributions to such topics as LGBT rights, the environmental movement, the introduction of Buddhism and Eastern philosophy to the United States, and postmodern cut-up and sampling techniques.

Rowling and Roald Dahl) This course examines the work of J.K. Rowling and Roald Dahl. In reading Rowling's Harry Potter series and select Dahl novels like The Witches and Matilda, we will consider the transgressive and transformative power of children's imaginations- the serious work of mischief- in an adult world. As we engage with these fantastical texts and the criticism written about them, we will investigate themes like power and surveillance, purity and danger, abjection, and absurdity as well as formal elements like voice, plot, character, humor, and symbolism. Although we will discuss the importance of these texts for an audience of children and young adults, we will also consider their appeal for an adult readership. Students will be asked to produce analytical and imaginative work in response to our course texts. Potential assignments include reader response essays, book reviews, critiques or syntheses of scholarly articles, and creative exercises in character or plot development. No prerequisites.

ENGL 266: The American Graphic Novel (Reading the American Graphic Novel) This course will examine the theory and practice of the graphic novel in America in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The serial visual narrative, also known as the graphic novel or comic book, has had a formative influence on American literary and popular culture. Not all comics and graphic novels are written about superheroes; the form has proven flexible enough to encompass such genres as the memoir, historical narrative, and journalism. This course will have a particular focus on the work of such writer- artists as Marjane Satrapi, Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Alison Bechdel, Scott McCloud, Joe Sacco, Harvey Pekar, Robert Crumb, Chris Ware, John Lewis, Daniel Clowes, and Lynda Barry. Students will read and discuss these 298 graphic narratives with an emphasis on how they make difficult or marginal content accessible to readers, and will have the opportunity to try their own hands at writing comics or a short graphic novel.

Usually placed behind romantic relationships, female friendship is now understood to be a powerful and even transformative dynamic, one that is central to female identity. Men and lovers take a back seat. Are BFFs taking over the usual unions of romantic or erotic love? How much are girlfriends the focus of these stories? In this course, we examine these contemporary representations of female friendship, from the four character \"types\" at the center of Sex and the City and Girls to the erotic and dangerous \"besties\" of Emma Cline's The Girls. We will examine how these \"types\" relate to, and part ways from, their literary predecessors, from Jane Austen to the present. Throughout, we discover the many sides of this complex, and contradictory, relationship. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) ENGL 269: Writing Fantasy (Writing Fantasy: Fantasy Worlds and How to Build Them.) Fantastic fiction such as the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland allows readers the illusion of escape. These works carry us on journeys to lands of myth and magic, stretching our imaginations and challenging us to reimagine the very foundations of our own world. Though fantasy embraces adventurous escapism, it is also a genre dependent on intricate world-building, rule-making, and a careful consideration of cultural systems and political hierarchies. In this writing and reading-intensive course, students seek to view our own world through the looking glass as they construct their own long-form fantasy project. Course reading may include classic and contemporary fantasy by such authors as Angela Carter, Lewis Carroll, H. Rider Haggard, J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien, L. Frank Baum, Kelly Link, Neil Gaiman, Nnedi Okorafor, and Margaret Atwood. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.)

Students in the course write various forms of music criticism ranging from short reviews of singles and albums to longer reviews about albums and artists; they also learn how to conduct interviews with artists and how to write up the interview in a long-form feature article and how to write concert reviews. The course also covers practical issues such as how to pitch pieces to publications and how to get published. No prerequisites.

Novel (Happiness, Human Life, and the 19th Century Novel.) What constitutes human happiness? Biologists may offer their answers by asking why zebras don't get ulcers; psychologists by studying the psychological responses of lottery winners. But long before such scientific inquiries, nineteenth-century novelists sought to solve the problem of human happiness in their own way, pursuing a very old philosophical topic through nuanced narratives and gripping descriptions of fictional human lives: Emma's as she tries to engineer the happiness of her good friend, Pip's as he ventures into the high life of London, Dorothea's as she apes the life of an old-time saint, and Anna's as she tries to live out the romances she has absorbed from novels. In this course, we'll read some of the best novels of the nineteenth century, justly famous because they shed so much light on the good life. We'll ask how these novelists defined a life of full flourishing (eudaemonia), what brings human beings closer to or farther away from happiness, how these questions get embedded within nineteenth-century cultural concerns, and what the novel as a genre of imaginative literature can uniquely contribute to our understanding of the good life. Novelists will include Austen, Dickens, Eliot, and Tolstoy (who both influenced and was influenced by his British peers). Novels may also be paired with contemporary or classic nonfictional readings on the nature of human happiness. Prerequisite: Any 200- level English course or permission of instructor.

In this course, students have a chance to read some of Chaucer's most famous Canterbury Tales, his riveting philosophical romance Troilus and Criseyde, and selections from the Legend of Good Women, which is his comical riff on the medieval saints' life tradition. In each case, we explore how problems of deceit or desire drive his tales and create a narrative framework for exploring provocative social, philosophical, religious, and even cosmological questions. Attention will also be paid to those medieval writers who influenced Chaucer, including Augustine, Boethius, Jean de Meun/Guillaume de Lorris, and, above all, his bawdy Italian inspiration, Boccaccio. Prerequisite: English 210. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.)

Do human beings find or make meaning in their lives? Is meaning even possible in the face of life's absurdities? If so, what constitutes a meaningful life? This course explores these and other big existentialist questions through the lens of the novel, focusing especially on three novelists from the nineteenth and twentieth century: Fyodor Dostoevsky, Albert Camus, and Iris Murdoch. Within the course, we compare and contrast the existentialist perspectives of Dostoevsky and Camus as well as examining Iris Murdoch's critique of existentialism.

The chief texts of the class will be novels, but there will be readings in poetry and memoir as well. Prerequisite: English 204 or English 302 205 or permission of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) ENGL 347: Woolf Joyce Beckett (Modernist Masters of Consciousness: Woolf, Joyce, Beckett). The modernist novel in English reached its apex in the twentieth century with the work of Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett, each of whom explored the minute movements of human consciousness in prose of unparalleled richness, complexity, and sometimes stark beauty. Woolf's writing, in both her fiction and nonfiction prose, was particularly concerned with the inner lives of women; Joyce developed his theory of the prose epiphany and found mythic underpinnings for stories of ordinary Irish life; Beckett's fiction and plays pursued the very limits of language itself. In this seminar-style course, students discuss the work of these three major authors and consider its implications for feminist thought, postcolonial theory, and psychology and cognitive science.

ENGL 364: Creative Unwriting & Remix Workshop This intermediate writing course explores the principles behind a broad range of contemporary innovative writing methods and styles including remix, mash-up, conceptual, uncreation (a la Kenny Goldsmith), and cut-up techniques. The course starts from the principle that writers do not start with a blank page. Rather, all writing is created from the substance of preexisting artworks. For a generation more familiar with turntables and text messaging than the traditions of classical poetics, this course will explore the former in the context of the latter, offering a philosophical base from which to create, or uncreate, works that respond most deftly to contemporary aesthetics. Prerequisite: ENGL 235 or permission of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ENGL 365: Poetry and Nature This course explores the relationship between poetry and the natural world, from its roots in Classical Asian and European poetry to its postmodern manifestations.

Thrillers on futuristic, mutant viruses. Stories of plagues from past and present startle us with their imaginative variety. In fact, many readers have questioned why these narratives so often push the limits of the \"real\" in their representations. Why do writers represent plagues experimentally? Is contagion inherently dangerous to represent, even fictionally? We explore representations of epidemic diseases across a wide expanse of time, from antiquity to the 21st century, encountering along the way common tropes and stock figures of the genre: the plague-pits, enterprising tricksters, and well-poisoners, among others. Across varied stories, including Oedipus and Romeo and Juliet, we track how writers and film-makers use medical disasters to conjure the deepest spiritual crises of societies-gone-wrong, calling on the plague to search for divine meaning and patient zeroes.

ENTP 270: E&S Ventures I: Product-Market Fit (Entrepreneurial and Social Ventures I: Product-Market Fit.) How do you test, iterate, and determine the best solution for a given problem or set of problems? Utilizing design thinking and minimum viable product frameworks, students find problems and use human-centered feedback models to define, test, and develop iterations of proposed solutions in both for-profit and not-for-profit settings. This course focuses on discovery and validation as a means to determine the impact of a program towards a given goal or mission, and the fit between a defined product, service, and its target market. Students learn how to create viable business or social models within the constraints of uncertainty, minimal resources, and limited time. Prerequisites: ENTP 110 or 120; and ENTP 320, or ENTP 350. ENTP 325: Digital Marketing & Analytics How can being consumer-focused and data-driven improve results? Entrepreneurs, social leaders, professionals, and individuals need digital brand-building skills and marketing acumen to sell themselves and their ideas, products, and services. This course takes a human-centered approach to teaching how end users and their buying decisions are influenced by digital media. The course teaches design thinking, digital tools, web analytics, and growth hacking frameworks through a combination of exposure to industry professionals, readings, and client projects. Prerequisites: ENTP 110 and BUSN/ENTP 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: BUSN 325 ENTP 340: Inclusive Innovation While entrepreneurs top the list of Forbes richest Americans, diversity does not. Why are women, people of color, and other groups persistently excluded from entrepreneurial resources? How might we make entrepreneurship more inclusive to drive disruptive innovation, help people reach their full potential, and propel positive economic growth? This course surveys the deeper (and often hidden) causal factors that have contributed to and reinforced entrepreneurial exclusion. We examine disparities at the macro- and micro-level (i.e., gender, race, sexuality, geography, ability, age) through case studies, reading, hands-on activities, and student research projects. Students propose their own reasoned and researched solutions to address the business case for access and inclusion not as a charitable cause but as an economic imperative. The course concludes with students pitching their solutions on how to empower an underrepresented group, increase access to high-quality tools to find problems worth solving for this group and the resources to solve them, and create new channels for revenue from a previously underserved and ignored market. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement.) ENTP 350: Intrapreneurship: Innov in Organiz (Intrapreneurship: Innovation in Existing Organizations) Innovative corporations, institutions, and social organizations require entrepreneurial-minded teams who can identify and create new opportunities, new products, greater value, and more meaningful relationships with their customers. Operationalizing innovation within organizations requires substantial challenges including navigating bureaucracy, risk aversion, political conflicts, intolerance of failure, and lack of leadership support. Through hands-on group exercises, case studies, and real- world experience, students learn to apply Design Thinking and Value Proposition Design frameworks to develop, test, and create value within existing organizations, and learn how to do so in a team-based environment. Prerequisite: ENTP 270 (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Experiential Learning requirement.) cross listed: BUSN 380 310 ENTP 470: E&S Ventures III: Growth (Entrepreneurial and Social Ventures III: Growth.)

An Environmental Studies major will be able to critically examine all sides of environmental issues and apply understanding from disciplines such as history, economics, psychology, law, literature, politics, sociology, philosophy, and religion to create informed opinions about how to interact with the environment on both a personal and a social level. 2. An Environmental Studies major will be able to recognize the physical, chemical, and biological components of the earth's systems and show how they function. 3. An Environmental Studies major will be able to apply lessons from various courses through field experiences. These experiences will allow students to develop a better sense of not only individual organisms, but of the systems in which these organisms live. Students will also see how natural systems and human-designed systems work together, as well as in conflict with each other. 4. An Environmental Studies major will be able to do independent research on human interactions with the environment. Environmental Studies courses ES 108: Environmental Chemistry A working knowledge of most environmental issues facing us in the twenty-first century requires an understanding of some key geochemical principles. This course introduces chemistry concepts and skills as they arise in the context of current environmental issues, including chemical cycles in nature, air pollution, ozone depletion, global warming, acid rain, energy sources, water quality, and solid waste. Students will be asked to collect and interpret their own data, as well as to use simple models to explain environmental issues from a scientific perspective. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: CHEM 108 ES 110: Intro to Environment and Society (Introduction to Environment and Society.) The environment is an ecological matrix in which all human societies are embedded. Solving current environmental problems therefore requires understanding how natural processes and humans' social, political, and economic processes interact, mutually influencing one another. This course's study of environmental problems is inherently interdisciplinary, blending perspectives from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Subject areas include ecology and biology as well as environmental economics, ethics, politics, history, and literature. Specific topics and content may vary with the professor(s). Intended for students with a general interest in environmental issues as well as those interested in pursuing the Environmental Studies major. No prerequisites. ES 116: Introduction to Geology This course will launch participants into the study of Earth's physical history, from the creation of our planet to ways in which geologic processes occur all around us today. Students will learn to identify many different types of rocks, minerals, and fossils, explain the workings of plate tectonics, interpret ancient climates and environments by identifying a single rock, and understand how geologic processes have shaped the face of today's Earth and the life on it. Students will better understand the most important environmental and economic issues facing the world today - the formation, distribution, extraction, and effects of fossil fuels - and gain insight into water movement, access, and pollution. Students will be expected to take a dynamic role in the teaching of materials through presentations and in-class activities. Field trips, including a possible weekend field trip, will be a required part of the class. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) 316 ES 117: Geography and Demography The most important issues facing the Earth and its people in the 21st century all have their basis in the geography of the planet, that is, the spatial distribution of land, water, languages, and economic activity. The course will address the following eight geographical concepts: the major forces driving population growth or decline; water scarcity, water pollution, and water management; food production and distribution systems; global flow of people, ideas, products, and resources; the drive toward urbanization and the response of cities to growth; global warming and the ways in which human activities in different regions contribute to greenhouse gas emissions; democratization, the history and current status of the form of government in different regions, how governmental form is tied to the geography; how gender roles influence societies in different regions. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) ES 120: Intro to Environmental Sciences (Introduction to the Environmental Sciences.) Using the disciplines of the physical, biological, and chemical sciences, this course studies the entities, patterns, and processes of the natural world and their modification by human activity. We examine scientific knowledge and principles and the application of that knowledge and those principles to natural systems, and survey selected environmental issues to ultimately consider the sustainability of human activities on the planet. Topics include population growth, biodiversity conservation, ecology, climate change, toxic pollution, and sustainable and unsustainable energy and agricultural systems. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.)

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 206, AMER 206 317 ES 209: Terrorism and the Environment Human injustice and the environment are deeply interlinked. Terror, war, disease, and slavery have environmental interconnections, and the current climate of terrorism has causes directly related to the availability and scarcity of natural resources. Both terrorists and counter-terrorist groups often deploy environmental weapons and strategies (such as dam breaching and oil field ignition) and make use of communication and supply chains that rely on the intimate knowledge of local geographies. Environmentalists have also employed terror tactics, often labeled as eco- terrorism, such as tree spiking and mailing bombs, to promote and protect environmental values. This interdisciplinary course weaves together geography, natural resource science, history, politics, and sociology to understand the connection between terrorism and the environment. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Writing requirements.) cross listed: IREL 296 ES 210: Environmental Ethics Examination of relationships between human beings and nature, drawing on literature, religion, and natural science as well as philosophy. What views have shaped our current perceptions, concerns, uses, and misuses of the natural world? What creative alternatives can we discover? How can these be applied to the practical problems of environmental ethics? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: PHIL 210 ES 215: Environmental Psychology Environmental psychology is the discipline concerned with interactions and relationships between people and their environments (including built, natural, and social environments). In this course we apply psychological methods and theories to a variety of issues and behaviors, considering such topics as landscape preference, wayfinding, weather, noise, natural disasters, territoriality, crowding, and the design of residential and work environments. We also explore images of nature, wilderness, home, and place, as well as the impact of these images on behavior. The course is grounded in empirical work, and incorporates observations and experiences in the local environment. No prerequisite.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: PSYC 215 ES 218: American Geographies Lewis Carroll tells of a nation who made a map on the scale of one mile to the mile, but \"the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.\" Similarly, American \"Geographies\" are plural because all geographies are multiple: the same location can be mapped in dozens of different ways, all of which can add to the richness of our understanding of place. \"Mapped\" denotes both physical maps and a range of mental and cultural constructs that describe place. These include urban geographies, agricultural geographies, natural geographies, and personal geographies as perceived by rulers, explorers, immigrants, recently freed slaves, mountain lions, and others. We compare American Geographies with other Geographies of the world (European and Chinese) to understand these American spatial experiences. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 200, AMER 480 ES 220: Evolution, Ecology, and Environment The diversity of life - the result of evolutionary and ecological processes - is a primary focus of environmental studies. In order to understand humans' effects on other species, ecosystems, and evolutionary and ecological processes and interactions, a deep knowledge of those entities and processes is critical. This course takes an interdisciplinary, theoretical approach to the evolution and ecology of human - environmental dynamics, including species concepts and speciation, extinction, conservation of biodiversity, political ecology, evolutionary ecology, the human dimensions of global change, demography, biogeography, human and non-human population ecology, and the status of evolutionary theory in the current political arena. Three lecture hours plus one four-hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: ES 108 or Chem 115 and Math 150 or BIOL 150 or ECON/BUSN/FIN 130 or MATH 351 or 318 PSYC 221 or SOAN 310 (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences and Technology requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) ES 221: History & Literature of Great Lakes (History and Literature of the Great Lakes.) The Great Lakes contain 21 percent of the world's surface fresh water. They provided a passage for exploration and still provide a passage for commerce. They are the reason Chicago exists. This course explores the history of the Great Lakes (geological, Native American, and modern) and the literature and art that arose from human interaction with these vast waters. In this interdisciplinary course we read geological and geographical descriptions, Native American literature, journals of early European explorers, poetry, short stories, and histories of social, economic, and environmental issues concerning the Great Lakes. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) ES 222: The Lake by the College (The Lake by the College: Geography, Ecology, History, and Current Environmental Issues of Lake Michigan). Lake Forest College calls itself the College by the Lake, yet most of us know very little about this vast inland sea. Geography is the study of physical places on the earth's surface and the relationships between people and those places. This course introduces students to the physical properties of the lake and its ecological and economic significance to Chicago, the City of Lake Forest, the Greater Chicagoland region, the United States, and the world. We explore current issues and policies about the lake's diverse and often conflicting uses as a dump site, a highway for transportation, a pristine recreational resource, and the source of our drinking water. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) ES 224: Biodiversity Biodiversity has commonly been defined as the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems, and the interactions between them. This course explores the evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of biodiversity and the models we use to conceptualize and conserve its components. We study and attempt to explain the unequal distribution of biodiversity over space (tropical rainforests have much greater biodiversity than temperate forests) and time (many more species of beetles have evolved than species of mammals). We pay special attention to diversity in the vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, and flowering plants, and consider concepts such as the tree of life, ecological diversity indices, and definitions of genes, species, and ecosystems. The course concludes with the study of theoretical and practical approaches to conserving the biodiversity we have and restoring the biodiversity we've lost. Prerequisite: ES 110, 203, 204, or 220, or any Biology course 120 or above. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement.) ES 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues such as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a \"true\" scientific theory, the basis of observation, and empirical knowledge.

Special attention is paid to the diversity of actors that shape environmental outcomes, including legislators, administrators, the science community, civil society, and the private sector. This course examines environmental politics and policy in the United States from the roots of environmental policymaking present at the country's founding through the emergence of the \"modern\" environmental movement in the post-World War II era that led to the raft of environmental legislation we have today. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science 319 requirement.) cross listed: POLS 237 ES 240: Religious Perspectives Environment The current environmental crises rest on a layer of philosophical and religious assumptions that are currently being challenged. Are human beings the center of the universe? Is humankind's mandate to dominate nature? Does nature belong to human beings or do human beings belong to nature? Contemporary Judaic, Christian, and Islamic ecological visions and action programs will be considered, along with the religious views and practices of particular native cultures of North and South America, Australia, and Africa. Participants may also discuss ecological perspectives derived from South and East Asian religious cultures.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: HIST 232, AMER 261 ES 261: Global Environmental History The Earth's environment has changed drastically over time. The first half of this course is a journey through the many phases of environment and climate on Earth in its 4.5-billion-year history from an atmosphere without oxygen to a warm lushly vegetated globe to a world with glaciers pushing toward the equator. In its second half, we will focus on the how environmental changes influenced human history. What was the world like when humans evolved and how did the Ice Ages determine where people migrated? Were the rise and fall of empires tied to the rise and fall of sea level? We will also examine humans as forces that shape and influence the environments they inhabit, for better or for worse. No prerequisite. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ES 263: American Cities This course is an introduction to the political, economic, and social forces that have shaped American cities from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the city of Chicago. We explore the growth of urban economies and new forms of labor, migration and immigration into cities, persistent patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and displacement, and struggles over power and resources that make up urban politics. We also pay particular attention to urban geography and the relationship between cities, rural and suburban areas. Students are introduced to multiple disciplinary approaches to understanding American cities, and take field trips to relevant sites in Chicago.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) ES 288: Botanical Imperialism From corn and sugar cane to opium and nutmeg, from quinine and rubber to pineapples and potatoes, the desire for plant products and the subsequent movement of plants around the globe has been both a cause and a consequence of imperial expansion. This course will examine the impact that plants and their products have had on human political history. The desire for spices, medicines, and crops has driven, and continues to drive, the people and governments of more developed nations to subjugate the people and governments of other, less developed nations, usually with disastrous results. We will spend most class sessions outside the classroom: at the Chicago Botanic Garden, the Field Museum, and in Lake Forest's own vegetable garden. Students will be responsible for learning plant science - the morphology, evolutionary biology, and chemistry of the plants we study - in addition to the history and politics. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.)

Among the technologies addressed are oil, gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, geothermal, solar and ocean-based systems. The approach is quantitative and the course is suitable for those comfortable with science and mathematics, although calculus will not be required. Prerequisite: ES 220, BIOL 220, ES 271, or permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) 321 ES 317: Environmental Sociology This course utilizes the sociological perspective to explore the complex ways that human society and nature are intertwined, having significant impacts on each other. How societies are organized, how they produce and consume, and what values and norms constitute their culture all have varied impacts on what is often referred to as the 'natural' world. As environmental problems - such as climate change, deforestation, species loss, pollution, etc. - are constructed and emerge, the impact on societies varies greatly across social groups based on race, class, gender, and national context. This course explores how, in the face of environmental degradation, society has responded in different ways: with social movements, changes in lifestyles, and private certification programs advocating conservation and preservation; and political and economic institutions, definitions of status, and entrenched social organization resisting change. Prerequisite: SOAN 110. Recommended: SOAN 210 or SOAN 220 (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: SOAN 317 ES 322: Freshwater Ecology (Freshwater Ecology of the Great Lakes Region.)

We focus on the methods for assessing habitat condition, the factors that contribute to a habitat's health, the development of conservation plans, and the economic costs of pollution and mitigation. Prerequisite: ES 220 or BIOL 220. ES 323: African American Envirnmntl Culture (African American Environmental Culture from Slavery to Environmental Justice.) Until the environmental justice movement rose to prominence over the past few decades and invited a more critical perspective on the connection between race and the environment, popular understanding of the American environmental (and environmentalist) tradition had effectively been whitewashed. But why? This course will work to find answers to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of African American environmental culture in conversation with key moments in African American history--from slavery to sharecropping, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. With a special focus on Chicago's African American environmental culture and a field study to the city's South Side, an interdisciplinary approach will examine sources as diverse as slave narratives, fiction, poetry, songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies, and we will consider African American intellectuals, writers, visual and musical artists, and everyday citizens not always associated with environmental thought, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and the victims of Flint, Michigan's, water crisis. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: AFAM 323 ES 332: Environmental Writing This course focuses on writing about the environment.

Prerequisite: English 235 or a lower-level Environmental Studies course. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 332 ES 335: Environmental Justice Environmental justice movements contest environmental inequalities (disproportionate exposure to environmental ills like pollution and inadequate access to environmental goods like nature-based recreation) that manifest themselves along lines of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. This course employs a variety of disciplinary perspectives - including history, literature, sociology, political science, and philosophy - to examine the origins and evolution of these social movements worldwide, but especially emphasizes the environmental battles waged by African American, Latinx, and Native American communities in the United States. From climate change's rising seas that threaten developing nations to the toxic waste dumps that threaten the health of communities of color, case studies are used to explore how local struggles help shape a global consciousness about environmental injustices. Chicago-area environmental justice movements are given special attention and are incorporated into field studies. 322 Prerequisites: ES 110 or permission of instructor.

This course explores the many ways Americans understood and shaped their diverse local environments during the crisis of the Great Depression. Although the Dust Bowl is perhaps the most iconic of these environmental upheavals during the 1930s, this course examines diverse geographical regions: from the Appalachian mountains to the (de)forested Upper Midwest, from the agricultural South to the Dust Bowl plains and the water-starved West. In each region, we use interdisciplinary approaches (including literary, historical, sociological, and visual media studies methods) to trace the impacts of economic turmoil on the environment and the people who depended on it for their livelihoods, as well as the way economic disaster paved the way for the government's unprecedented intervention in environmental matters.This course fosters critical examination of American subcultures during the Great Depression, including African-Americans, the Southern poor, the Range culture of the American West, and the immigrant experience. Prerequisite: Any 200-level ES course or permission of instructor. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: AMER 358 ES 361: Environmental Law This course will explore basic issues of law and policy involved in the consumption, conservation, and regulation of natural resources.

Topics to be discussed include: agency management of environmental risk; civil suits as a means of environmental law enforcement; wilderness and the use of public land; takings and other private property rights concerns; federalism and the environment. Among other statutes, we will examine the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. cross listed: POLS 368 ES 363: Apocalypse in PostWWII Amer Envrnmt (Apocalypse and Fear in the Post-WWII American Environment.) One dominant strain of the post-World War II American environmental imagination has been fear of imminent environmental apocalypse, which manifests itself on a spectrum from diffuse anxiety to paralyzing terror. This course explores this culture of fear through a variety of topics in postwar American environmental consciousness, including the specter of atomic annihilation, the anti-eco-323 toxics and environmental justice movements, food security, and climate change. Texts and methodological approaches are literary, historical, anthropological, and sociological. Prerequisite: Any 200-level ES or Hist course. cross listed: AMER 367 ES 365: Poetry and Nature This course explores the relationship between poetry and the natural world, from its roots in Classical Asian and European poetry to its postmodern manifestations.

Elephants, whales, rhinos, giraffes, gorillas, and bison are among the groups of animals studied. Feeding and mating ecology, mutualisms and parasitisms, and the particular behavioral and genetic problems of small population sizes are the key concepts applied to each of these groups. Political, agricultural, and socio-economic barriers to conservations are also examined. Prerequisite: ES 220. ES 382: Politcal Ecology Infectious Disease (The Political Ecology of Infectious Diseases.) An infectious disease, COVID19, is in the process of disrupting the social, political, economic, ecological, and medical systems that we have relied on, and in some ways taken for granted, up to now. Infectious diseases, like all things \u2014 animals, plants, genes, rivers, petroleum, planets, and molecules \u2014 have the ability to exert influence on their environments; that is, they have something like agency. In this course, we investigate what the nature of this quasi-agency is, and what the political, social, and economic consequences of accepting the agency of things might be. Our focus is on infectious diseases: where they come from, how humans discovered them and how we combat them, and how they have affected and are affected by international economic and political systems, environmental degradation, medical technology, ideas of sovereignty, and the prosecution of war and terrorism. Prerequisite: ES 110. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.)

This course investigates the meaning of animals to humans, the meaning of humans to animals, and the meaning of animals to each other. These investigations raise questions about the nature of equality, reason, feeling, justice, language, the social contract, and sentimentality. Prerequisites: Politics 260, or any Environmental Studies or Philosophy course at the 200 level or above, or junior standing. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement.) ES 481: Biological & Social Life of Paper This course explores the historical origins of paper; the biological organisms - cotton, linen, trees - we get paper from; the environmental effects of the production, use, and disposal of paper; and the cultural meaning of paper. We will follow paper from cradle to grave, cutting a tree and making paper ourselves, and learning to recycle paper. We will consider the pros and cons of a 'paperless future.' We will visit a plantation grown for paper-making, a paper- making factory, and the Newberry Library. We will also consider the history, production, circulation, and use of paper in the social production of knowledge, the shared imagination of value, and the mutual relations of consumers and commodities. There will be a semester-long 20-25 page research paper. Each student will be expected to lead one class session based on his or her research-paper topic. ES 482: 2010 Blowout in Gulf of Mexico This course explores many aspects of the 2010 ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, including the geology of the Gulf, the engineering techniques used to drill for oil and gas, uses of and possible substitutes for oil in the past, present and future, the environmental problems created by oil spills and the various cleanup and remediation techniques used, the effect of the leak on oil markets, and comparisons to other oil spills (notably those in Nigeria). Students will spend their fall break at sites along the Gulf, observing the effects of the leak and participating in cleanup efforts. Each student will choose a semester-long research project and be responsible for leading a class session based on their project as well as submitting a significant paper summarizing their research and conclusions. ES 483: Env Connections Chicago-New Orleans (Senior Seminar: The Environmental Connections between Chicago and New Orleans) This course explores the environmental issues associated with the greater Chicago area and compares and connects them to the environmental issues associated with New Orleans and the lower Mississippi Delta. The connection between the two areas goes back to the mid-19th century decision to reroute the Chicago River and build a canal system that effectively connected the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. This geographical change provided a trade route from Chicago to the Gulf, enabling Chicago to be a major distributing center for both major trade routes from the Midwest - the Mississippi and the Great Lakes. Other comparisons that the course addresses are: energy issues of coal and oil, migration routes from the Delta to Chicago, and urbanization. Prerequisite: senior standing and a major in ES or permission of instructor. There will be an optional Spring Break trip down the Mississippi to New Orleans, as well as shorter field trips around the Chicago area. ES 484: Restoring Native Wildlife (Senior Seminar: Restoring Native Wildlife: Motivations, Methods, and Mixed Outcomes) Humans have frequently tried to restore populations of native wildlife species to areas from which they have been extirpated. This course covers a variety of different restoration efforts, looking at reasons that the species disappeared, arguments for and against restoration, methods used, and the successes and failures of the projects. We review key factors that are likely to determine the outcome of projects. The course also discusses the dual relationship between wildlife and habitat restoration projects. Case studies may include urban peregrine falcon release programs, the Eastern 326 Whooping Crane Partnership, wolf projects in Yellowstone National Park and nearby areas, two 2015 bison restoration programs in Illinois, as well as other projects. Students are expected to participate in several field trips, at least one of which includes multiple days. Prerequisites: Senior standing and a major or minor in Environmental Studies, or permisssion of instructor. ES 324: Medieval Disasters & Climate Change In the fifth century, a cooling climate and epidemics accelerated the collapse of the western Roman state; while in the fourteenth century, worsened by the onset of the \"Little Ice Age,\" the Black Death reduced populations in Eurasia by half and laid the groundwork for the changes of the early modern world. This course teaches the history of environmental transformations and human adaptation through an exploration of some of the natural disasters and climate changes that impacted Europe and the Mediterranean world c. 300-1500 CE. Using specific case studies (including episodes like the so-called \"mystery cloud\" that troubled Levantine communities in 536 and the unusually well-documented 1348 earthquake in central Europe), the course evaluates how medieval people thought about nature, and how moments of crisis shaped individuals, communities, and larger ecosystems. Students learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to analyze, track chronologically, and map spatially a specific disaster or environmental event. No prerequisites.

If you are intensely interested in how your brain helps you think, feel, sense, read, write, eat, sleep, dream, learn and move, this course is for you. You will learn how brain dysfunction causes complex medical illnesses, like Alzheimer's, Autism, and Schizophrenia. You will meet Chicago's world-class neuroscientists through guest seminars and class-trips to famous laboratories. You will debate ethical dilemmas that face society and dissect human brains. Lastly, you will present at the Brain Awareness Week on campus. One year each of high school biology and chemistry is recommended. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 109: The Future In the fall of 2015, according to the 1989 film Back to the Future Part II, Americans would be traveling in hovercars, wearing self-lacing sneakers, scooting around on hoverboards, and - most improbably - celebrating the victory of the Chicago Cubs in the World Series. Predicting the future is clearly difficult. So-called experts in various fields have routinely failed to accurately predict events such as the housing bubble of 2007, weather catastrophes, the outcome of political races, whether bridges can withstand stress loads, pandemics, and so on. Yet, to be human is to make predictions. In this course, we will explore the ways people have tried to see into the future, both on a mundane and a profound level. Examining fields across the liberal arts curriculum, we will assess the quality of these predictions and ultimately make predictions of our own, to be placed in a time capsule for our future amusement. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 113: Music and Math In this course, students will investigate the connections between the fields of music and mathematics. Commonalities to be explored will include the musical concepts of rhythm, meter, scales, tuning, and temperament, and the mathematical concepts of geometric series, rational and irrational numbers, modular arithmetic, and symmetries of the square. No previous knowledge of music theory is required, only a desire to use critical and analytical skills to understand and appreciate music. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 114: Media Art & Technology (From Now On: Media Art & Technology.) Digital media, technology and the arts have become potent forces creating changes in aesthetics, communication, social engagement, political movements, and economic conditions. From social media to Virtual Reality, the lines between reality and artifice blur. As these forces combine, reconfigure and create innovations, how will these changes impact our everyday experience? What we should expect in the world of work? Mass access to design software allows everyone to be a maker capable of creating shifts in cultural and social trends. How can one thrive in a such a dynamic world? Artists have played an important role as a counterpoint to mass-media by creating work that articulates important questions and examines such changes. Through discussions, readings, exercises and projects the course examines the impact of new fields in art and technology. This course will help students to identify, learn about, and potentially create tools to navigate a technologically dense future. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 119: Chicago Media Industries Over the last 170 years, Chicago has been home to a diverse and vibrant set of media industries. From the founding of the Chicago Tribune in 1847, to the production of iconic films like Ferris Buehler's Day Off in the 1980s, to the current boom in television production started by Dick Wolf's Chicago Fire franchise in 2012, there is no doubt that Chicago has made an indelible mark on the U.S. media landscape. In this class, we will examine the history, policies, and practices of Chicago media industries, including print, film, radio, and television. We will also look at the way Chicago media industries have been impacted by larger political and economic trends, such as new media's effect on the newspaper industry, and growing international competition for Hollywood investment, known as \"runaway production.\" This course will include a field trip to a Chicago media company as well as famous movie 333 locations around the city. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 120: Religious Violence and Coexistence How do people of different religious faiths interact? How do they create professional and personal relationships - and what limits are placed on those relationships, either by law or by the individuals themselves? Conversely, what causes hostility and violence between faiths? This course investigates these eternal questions through an in-depth study of relations between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam in the medieval Mediterranean world. We will begin with the earliest interactions between these religious traditions, as Christianity and Judaism diverged from common roots into separate faiths in the first two centuries CE, and as Islam emerged in the seventh century. In our second unit, we will study medieval Spain, where Christians, Jews, and Muslims coexisted relatively peacefully for centuries, but where that toleration crumbled in the later Middle Ages, culminating in the Spanish Inquisition. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 123: Global Epidemics: From Aids to Zika What makes an infectious disease become an epidemic, such as the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, or that of Zika in Brazil in 2015? Moreover, how did COVID, which appeared in 2019, so quickly become a pandemic? Why does it take so long for pharmaceutical companies to construct a vaccine that protects against disease-causing organisms? In this course, we explore the medical, biological, and molecular complexities of a variety of infectious diseases that plague the world, such as malaria, Dengue fever, and COVID. We study the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause the diseases, how they are transmitted, and the chemical and biological challenges of making and distributing vaccines in less developed countries. In addition to class discussions, writing assignments, and oral presentations, students investigate microbial morphology through a high-powered laboratory microscope\u2014and even make bacterial art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 128: Robots & Brains:Fantasies & Facts Will computers ever become conscious? Will robots ever have the degree of sentience described in science fiction or shown in films? How does the human mind emerge from the workings of the human brain? How is our brain different from, and simultaneously similar to, the brains of other animals? How are the 'wet brains' of animals different from, and similar to, the 'dry brains' of computers? Readings will include introductory materials on the brain, on mind and consciousness, on science fiction stories about robots, on scholarly and popular articles from current work in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The course will include films, computer simulations, guest lectures, and field trips, all related to brain, mind, robots, and artificial intelligence. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 130: The Science of Cooking Since 1992, the term molecular gastronomy has become part of understanding the world's cuisine. This course examines the chemistry and physics of cooking, and the physiology of taste and flavor. We explore such questions as what is the science behind making a foam or gel; how do you prevent food bacteria from forming; and what does it mean to temper chocolate? The science of cooking includes the important works of Herv\u00e9 This, Heston Blumenthal, Ferran Adria, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and Grant Achatz, among others. We read their work and not only become familiar with the latest materials and methods of the world's most innovative cuisine, but also learn how these methods may be part of the solution to ending world hunger. We work with a chef to perform experiments to elucidate the theory we will be studying. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 131: Civil Disobedience/Pol Obligation (Civil Disobedience and Political Obligation.) Every society imposes rules upon its members; without such rules societies could not exist. In liberal societies individuals agree to constrain their behavior through a social contract. That is, individuals consent to their own rule by the majority. Social contracts are considered the most just methods of social organization, because members consent and because rights are traditionally preserved. Rule is maintained through a codified law, made known to all, with proscribed punishments for failure to obey. But sometimes the 334 obligation to obey society conflicts with other obligations: to family, to God, to justice. These conflicts cause crises in both the individual and in society. Our course will explore these crises historically and theoretically. Antigone, the heroine of Sophocles' ancient Greek play, made the choice of obeying the religious commandments but in doing so violated the laws of the city. Socrates, on being condemned to death by Athens, was offered the opportunity to escape the city and save his life, but refused for it would mean breaking the laws of the city. When individuals commit civil disobedience, when they purposely and publicly break a law they feel to be immoral or unjust, how should society react? Is there a minimum of obligation that can be demanded? Can civil disobedience be justified? If so, can violence against the state also be justified? Our course explores these questions through traditional literature, such as the writings of Plato, Shakespeare, Locke, Thoreau, King, and Malcolm X. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 135: Birth & Death in Chicago: 1850 (Birthing and Dying in Chicago: 1850 to the present) This course will examine the complex answers to a simple question: who lives, who dies and why? How are life and death issues defined and who decides what constitutes a threat to public health and safety? Focusing on Chicago, students will study the social, political, environmental and economic factors that have impacted the city's demographic patterns over the last 150 years. From the outbreak of the first cholera epidemic in 1854, Chicago has faced many public health crises. Race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and class continue to impact birth and death rates in Chicago. Topics will include early battles to provide birth control and family planning, the polio epidemic, ethical and legal responses to the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and current efforts to define gun violence and related deaths as a public health issue. Guest speakers and field trips will supplement class meetings and readings. FIYS 138: Art in Chicago While Chicago's extensive contributions to modern architecture are known throughout the world, it's been a critical center of visual art in all media since its earliest years. This course explores the rich and dynamic history of art- making in Chicago from before the Great Fire of 1871 to the present, as well as the city's role as a center for experimentation and learning in the visual arts. Throughout its history, Chicago has been home to an art community that has always charted its own path, free from the constraints of more commercial centers like New York, and in so doing has had great impact on visual art and our broader visual culture. The city itself is a critical resource for this class, as course content - in the form of readings, discussion, and various activities - is augmented by visits to diverse art institutions and meetings with influential art-makers. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 142: Dostoevsky on Good and Evil Is a student who murders a wealthy old pawnbroker justified in his murder, if he uses her money for the common good? Can a novelist realistically represent a purely good person, or would readers regard such a person as nothing more than an \"idiot\"? If the Devil visited one's bedroom, what would he look like and what conversation might he make? These are just a few of the fascinating questions prompted by Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels. This course will explore the evolution of Dostoevsky's literary and intellectual work leading up to his final novel of ideas, The Brothers Karamazov. We will focus on the genesis and development of that novel through Dostoevsky's contact with other novelists, such as Turgenev and Dickens. We will explore the novel against Dostoevsky's dramatic biographical and historical context. And we will examine the provocative philosophical, theological, political and aesthetic debates his novel broaches--debates that are as relevant today as they were in Dostoevsky's day. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 143: Money and Happiness Can money buy happiness? If you ask \"would you rather be rich or happy?\" the response may imply that the two are synonymous. This course will examine the relationship between money and happiness and will give you tools to get what you want and want what you have in your search for a happy life. You will learn negotiating skills along with influence and persuasion techniques, and explore the \"happiness equation.\" Using documentaries, articles, texts and case studies as a basis for our discussions, we will explore these questions: What is a fulfilling life? Is happiness learned or genetic?What role is played by humor, friendship, achievement, spirituality and love? In addition to writing about these topics, students will test these approaches and techniques during in-the-field 335 experiments. This course will make you think and challenge your assumptions as you prepare for what lies ahead in your college experience and well beyond. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 146: BFFs: Besties and Female Friendship (BFFs: \"Besties\" and Female Friendship.) \"Besties\" are found everywhere in contemporary fiction, television, and film. Usually placed behind romantic relationships, female friendship is now understood to be a powerful and even transformative dynamic, one that is central to female identity. Men and lovers take a back seat: A \"Coldplay song plays in my heart\" whenever Hannah Horvath sees her two closest friends in \"Girls.\" Are BFFs taking over the usual unions of romantic or erotic love? How much are girlfriends the focus of these stories? In this course, we examine these contemporary representations of female friendship, from television programs such as \"Girls\" to the erotic and dangerous \"besties\" of Emma Cline's The Girls. Throughout, we discover the many sides of this complex, and contradictory, relationship. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 150: Entrepreneurship in Action Entrepreneurship involves more than merely starting a new business that addresses a problem worth solving or innovating within an existing organization; it is a life skill that contributes to success in any field. This course explores the history of entrepreneurship through case studies, articles, and other activities. Students investigate the evolution of entrepreneurial best practices and pitfalls throughout the years. We dissect recent successes and failures in the world of entrepreneurship, and examine the role of technology in the future of the field. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 153: History Reversed; You to the World Usually, history courses start deep in the past, and move towards the present. In this class, we flip the script, and start with you, right here, right now, at Lake Forest College. By tracing our individual ancestries, we will situate our local lives at the College and in the city of Chicago within a global historical context. Using large-scale datasets and wide-ranging historical sources, we will explore Chicago as a global city of immigrants and the Midwest as an ancient civilization of indigenous peoples. Rewinding from the present, the course will chart a global path back thousands of years to the origins of the human species in Africa. By investigating and debating how change happens over time, we will understand our own place in history. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 154: The Irish in Chicago This course places Irish history in context and examine the large-scale emigration from Ireland to the United States in the mid-19th century. It traces the destinations of the Irish as they settled in America and focuses primarily on those who came to Chicago. It researches where and how the Irish community lived in the city and surrounding areas. It examines how the Irish immigrants contended with the darker side of this new life through impoverished times and the rise of mob activity, and yet, how the cultural aspects of Irish life (among them sports, music, dance, art, crafts, literature, and theater) not only survived the transatlantic crossing, but thrived in their new home, and continue to be part of life for the Irish community in 21st-century Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 155: Chicago: Land of Hope In the half-century following World War I, millions of African Americans left the American South in the Great Migration. Settling in northern cities like Chicago, which many called the \"Land of Hope,\" black migrants dramatically reshaped American life and culture. This course explores the connections between that history of northward movement and African American cultural production and experiences. We do this through a special focus on Chicago, where the black population grew from just over 44,000 to more than 1.1 million. We read closely and contextualize a variety of texts, including novels, plays, photographs, maps, sociological surveys, oral histories, and correspondence. We examine the historical significance of these texts from a variety of disciplinary perspectives - including history, literary and film criticism, sociology, critical race studies, and cultural studies (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 336 FIYS 158: Women to Beyonc\u00e9.) is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.\"\u2014Simone deBeauvoir Gender is learned\u2014a collection of behaviors that we all learn to replicate through a kind of performance that happens on and offstage. In this course, we will think about how this understanding of gender plays out in performance spaces. We'll take a broad look at the ways women have been portrayed onstage in different kinds of theatrical performance, from plays to music. We'll look at how women have expressed themselves and addressed political issues through theatre and performance\u2014and how their voices have, at times, been excluded. We'll look at the changing answers to the question\u2014what is a woman? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 163: Independent Media in Chicago This course focuses on the role played by independent media in the contemporary cultural landscape. Students become familiar with the workings of different independent media, as represented by the workings of film-makers, music venues, newspapers, zines, comic books, video games, and record labels that survive without direct connections to the large corporations that dominate the mass mediated culture in the U.S. At all times, readings concerning the role of the media in society contextualize the importance of the independent media. This class features several trips to the sites where these media outlets operate, with likely visits to: Quimby's Queer Store, The Hideout, Kartemquin Films, and The Chicago Reader. Paper assignments find students applying these experiences to the broader meanings of independent media. Students get a first-hand look at what the production of culture looks like in the context of independent media in Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 164: Archaeology of Chicago This course provides an introduction to the discipline of archaeology by exploring the city of Chicago, using to discuss and to engage with the social complexity found in urban America. Archaeology, a disciplinary subfield of anthropology, considers the material traces of human behaviors. Urban archaeological research looks at the complex interrelation of materiality and the documentary record, revealing everyday experiences and social relations at several levels. Through the lens of archaeology, we will cover Chicago as important stop along a prehistoric trail system, its place as a multicultural fur trade entrep\u00f4t, the attention from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and its current preeminence as a global city. Readings cover foundational concepts in archaeology, an introduction to historical archaeology, historical background on Chicago, and comparative urban case studies. Visits to current and future sites of archaeological excavations will be complemented with work on the preliminary archaeological assessment of a Chicago site. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 172: Gender and the Renaissance Ima In the late medieval and early modern period, convention and religious authority relegated women to a position subordinate to men. This course will explore some of the ways that women in the Renaissance overcame the obstacles placed before them to create works of art and to manipulate the culture of their time. Among the topics we will consider are the role of the image in constructing Renaissance notions of women; the manipulation of traditional images of power by women rulers to support their claims to sovereignty; the genres of writing most available to women in the Renaissance, with a special emphasis on the epistolary genre; women's access to art making and patronage activities, in the secular world and in the convent; and strategies by which women influenced the style and messages of works of art. We will also look at how Renaissance women are portrayed in modern works of art, literature, and film. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 180: Philosophy of Humans and Animals Western philosophers since Aristotle - at least - have claimed that human beings, as a species and alone among species, are capable of complex reasoning. The seventeenth-century French philosopher Descartes, famously, denied that non-human animals have minds or could think, claiming that they are essentially robots. From these 337 kinds of premises, philosophers have inferred a wide range of ethical and religious claims, e.g., it is ethically permissible to eat non-human animals. Alternative claims, however, have just as long a history. In this course, we will read and discuss an array of philosophical opinions on the similarities and differences between humans and other animals, and the practices of industrial farming, training animals to work or entertain, building and patronizing zoos, animal experimentation, and other controversial topics. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off-campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 182: Borders and Boundaries This is an uncontroversial claim: nouns are persons, places, things, and ideas. Yet, the precise lines separating a person, place, or thing\u2014and thus delineating their purpose and nature\u2014are more complex. Consider, for example, the type of existence that a historical artifact has in a museum. Labeled and placed within a glass case, it becomes an object of study and observation. However, in its original deployment, it may have been a tool to complete a task, a document that communicated information, or a good exchanged in trade. Whether as an object in a museum or as a thing in a world, its very being emerges from an intricate web of relations. What we determine the object to be is very much affected by where we find it. In different ways, the boundaries surrounding persons, groups (such as a group of citizens of a nation), and places also have hidden intricacies. This course is a study of these limits and the way that their openness or rigidity affects many features of the human and natural world. We study philosophical sources from ancient India, the United States, and Europe, alongside material from the disciplines of history, robotics, film, and literature. Moreover, students engage with case studies of boundaries claimed within the city of Chicago, the nation of the US, and groups around the world. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 183: Law, Literature and Logic A lawyer arguing a case tries to shape that case into a coherent, persuasive story: a dry recitation of facts and law is not enough. So, law is a literary - a story-telling - enterprise. And a dramatic one: fiction writers and filmmakers use crimes, investigations, court proceedings, and punishments to generate interest in their works. And yet, we still tend to think of literary flourishes as deceptive - after all, one meaning of \"to tell a story\" is \"to tell a lie.\" Legal reasoning, moreover, often seems arcane or merely manipulative, aimed more at obscuring the truth than revealing it. In this course we look into the complex and often bewildering interplay among law, literature, and logic, with the hope of illuminating all three - and with the hope of improving your writing skills, your reasoning skills, your rhetorical skills, and your argumentative skills. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 184: Why College? A Chicago Story Why go to college? Over time, students, families, teachers, employers, and politicians have answered this question in very different ways. In this course, we will explore the changing meaning and realities of college-going in Chicagoland from the 18th to the 21st centuries: from classical finishing school for white clergymen, to teacher- training for new cohorts of women and African Americans, to socialization into a radical youth culture, to \"human capital\" investment for a knowledge economy. We'll use a range of historical and contemporary sources to answer the questions: Why go to college? Who gets to go to college? Why is college so expensive? Through discussions, debates, and written reflection, we will dig into the past struggles and policy decisions that shape what college means for you here at Lake Forest College today. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 190: Exploring Adolescence: Then an (Exploring Adolescence: The Role of Chicago School Experiences Then and Now). Adolescence is a time of transitions shaped by the context of the experience. We will examine how adolescents develop with a focus on the challenges of the high school experience. Specifically, we will focus on the context of the Chicago public school experience and its impact on adolescent development as it existed both at the turn of the last century and today. To explore the contemporary situation, students traveling as a group will visit and conduct a series of observations at a Chicago high school. The class will develop a research question that can be compared to the past; this will be 338 investigated and the data collected will be analyzed to form a case study. Students will work collaboratively as a research team to explore these questions, and they will use background knowledge and critical thinking skills to discuss the conclusions and implications of the research question. FIYS 194: Peace Studies This course explores the interdisciplinary field of scholarly inquiry and advocacy known as Peace Studies, which seeks paths to end violent conflict and build ethical and harmonious interpersonal, societal, and global relationships. The course considers a range of peace-related topics, including peace concepts and disputes, peace networks, trends in violence, and gender and security. Much of this course focuses on the peace advocacy of one of Chicago's most famous social activists, Jane Addams (1860-1935). Best known for her settlement work with poor immigrants in Chicago, Addams believed that pacifism would benefit marginalized populations, from poor immigrants in Chicago's 19th Ward to industrial workers and farmers across the United States. She passionately opposed World War I, believing strongly that people from different nations and cultures were capable of interacting peacefully to advance their shared interests, and that it was necessary to form international institutions that would resolve disputes diplomatically and ensure lasting international peace, security, prosperity, and justice. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 196: American Playwrights in Chicago Chicago is home to a vivid and diverse theater scene that includes everything from tiny stages in the back rooms of bars to glitzy Broadway-style productions. This course examines a selection of American-authored plays from the Chicago season as the materials for an introduction to literary studies. As such, the course considers the plays we see and read as an occasion to develop skills in critical thinking, research, and writing. A secondary objective is to connect the various plays to particular moments or themes in American history and culture. We proceed from the acquisition of a simple critical vocabulary for describing a play's form and content, through character study, to more complex questions of the director's decisions in taking a play from the page to the stage. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 198: Criminal Justice in Chicago In Criminal Justice in Chicago, we will analyze historical and contemporary Chicago criminal cases to consider how criminal justice is doled out in the Second City. We will focus on the seemingly disparate cases of four Chicagoans: Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, notorious jazz-age murderers, legendary R & B artist R Kelly, and Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, convicted in the murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. Despite the differences in the defendants, nature of crimes, backgrounds, and outcomes of these cases, we will examine some of the common themes surrounding their cases to gain a better understanding of how high-profile criminal justice cases are handled in Chicago. We will also draw distinctions between such high-profile cases and more routine violent crime cases charged and tried in Chicago. This class will include classroom visits by professionals from a variety of fields (e.g., legal, media) with personal ties to the cases. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 199: The Past and Future of a Plague In the mid-1340s, merchant networks in the Mediterranean buzzed with news of a terrible disease ravaging lands further east. That disease\u2014known as \"the plague\" or the \"Black Death\"\u2014went on to wreak unprecedented havoc in Europe and the Islamic world, likely killing half the population in the space of a few years. It then continued to cause periodic devastating epidemics around the world until the widespread availability of antibiotics in the mid-20th century. In this course, after learning about the symptoms of plague, the progression of the epidemics, and the identity of the victims, we explore multiple facets of the human response to these natural disasters. These include: schools of thought on disease (humoral medicine, miasmatic theory, contagionism, germ theory); religious responses (penitential movements, massacres of religious minorities); medical measures (quarantine, sanitation, drug treatments); artistic representations; and the intersection of state power (both domestic and imperial) with public health efforts. In addition to addressing the history of the plague, this course offers a lens through which to view the current epidemic and future public health challenges. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 339 FIYS 112: Wild Chicago (Wild Chicago: Exploring the Urban Jungle.) This course will offer students a clear understanding of the wildlife around us and how humans interact with their environment. The goal for the class is to help students think and write clearly and critically, form educated opinions and defend those opinions about a wide range of environmental issues in urban environments. Based on our own observations we will also learn how to ask educated questions about the relationships between humans and the environment. By visiting with a carefully selected group of environmental professionals and regularly observing and recording information on the environment in which we live, we will explore how wildlife interacts with humans on an everyday basis. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 117: Becoming Adult in Times of Change (Becoming Adult in Times of Change: Liminal States.) You probably don't have a word for it, but the world right now is in a liminal state. In anthropology, a liminal state is a time of being betwixt and between, when things are not the same as they were before, but they haven't yet found a new normal. Starting college is also a liminal state, because you're not really a high school student anymore but not quite a college student. This course focuses on figuring out your liminal state in three ways: 1) exploring the idea of liminality, including the idea that all of college is a liminal space before adulthood; 2) challenging you (literally) to try something new on a regular basis, while maintaining a \"beginner's mind\"; and 3) exposing you to tools you will need in your college and adult life, ranging from negotiating politics at dinner parties to exploring career options. If you've read this far and didn't get put off by the scary title or your assumptions about what this course would be, you have what it takes. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 140: Global Science Fiction Science fiction is more popular than ever: it is almost impossible nowadays to avoid superhero movie \"universes,\" while dystopian novels such as The Handmaid's Tale - and their TV adaptations - are everywhere. This market seems to be dominated by Anglo-American science fiction, but Anglophones do not have a monopoly on this genre. How does science fiction from other regions and languages embrace and address its (multi-) cultural diversity, and how does it differ from Anglo-American science fiction? Is the experience of reading science fiction different because that work originated in another language and culture? This course explores these questions through texts and films from all over the world. Even if originally published in other languages, all texts will be available in English. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 144: Sacred Spaces in Chicago What do high-steeple churches, personal shrines, pagan festivals, Japanese gardens, and Hindu temples have in common? All are examples of the creation, use, and maintenance of sacred spaces. Individuals and groups representing nearly every religious tradition employ specially designated buildings, grounds, and surrounding natural features. In this course we study several examples of sacred spaces, consider how they are formed, and why they are used as they are. We ask questions about architecture and design, and also focus on the employment of the spaces. We look to the spiritual practices that take place inside them: everything from worship, ritual, and meditation to eating and drinking. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 148: Fashion, Culture, and Communication Fashion is more than simply how we dress. Among other things, it is a means of personal expression, a reflection of an historical moment, and an international industry. In this course we explore what fashion means at various points in history by considering how the political and social climate of the time period produces expectations for what should/should not be worn, by whom, and for what purpose. The course therefore situates fashion in terms of both its production and consumption, exploring its role in relation to identity and body politics (race, gender, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, and celebrity and popular culture. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 340 FIYS 152: The Politics of Population When you were born, you joined about 6 billion other humans on this planet, but by 2050, the world's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. What are we going to do with everyone? In this course, we explore the intersections between population growth and its impact on security, economics, and the environment. We explore a range of national efforts to manage population growth, from China's infamous \"One Child Policy\" to measures implemented in Japan and Singapore to encourage childbearing. We investigate how the international community shifted from a population control approach to one that prioritizes reproductive health, with accompanying debates surrounding reproductive choice; whether imbalanced sex ratios in a society lead to increased violence, including sex trafficking; and how sustainable development goals inform demographic policies, with particular attention to the impact on both women worldwide and on citizens of the Global South. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 166: The Uses and Misuses of Psychology Science can be a powerful tool to transform society, but the applications of scientific knowledge can result in either beneficial or detrimental outcomes, regardless of scientists' intentions. This course examines the societal ramifications, both real and imagined, of landmark discoveries from the field of psychology. For example, the work of B.F. Skinner greatly increased our understanding of how both animal and human behavior can be shaped through interactions with the environment, but these same principles of operant conditioning have been used by the U.S. military to produce soldiers who are more effective at killing in combat. We consider social, cultural, political, financial, and historical contexts as influential moderators of both science itself as well as the ends for which it is used. Readings include a mix of scholarly literature, popular sources, and works of fiction. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 167: Baseball in Chicago What does the study of baseball tell us about life in Chicago? In this course, we will examine this question from a variety of perspectives. We will explore both the history of baseball in Chicago as well its contemporary influences on civic and cultural life. Drawing on their field trips to both Wrigley Field (Cubs) and U.S. Cellular Field (White Sox), students will consider how the two different stadiums and fan bases help to illuminate some of Chicago's geographic, racial, and class-based divides. We will also examine the current political and economic controversies surrounding the renovation of Wrigley Field. In this interdisciplinary course, students will see how a variety of academic disciplines, including history, sociology, anthropology, economics, politics, and religion, illuminates our understanding of America's national pastime. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 170: Representation,Political & Personal The first year of college is an opportunity to consider what sociologist Erving Goffman called the \"presentation of self,\" or the ways that individuals try to make a favorable impression upon others. This course employs an interdisciplinary approach, with a bit of sociology, a bit of psychology, and a lot of political science, to investigate the ways in which people seek, as Dale Carnegie put it, to \"win friends and influence people.\" Many case studies are drawn from the interactions between politicians and the voters whose support they hope to win; after all, few individuals spend more time thinking rigorously about their presentation of self than elected officials and their staffers. We use examples from national politics, but also take field trips to meet with and observe elected officials around the North Shore and in Chicago. We investigate the art of political representation and how elected officials seek to win constituents' trust, as well as the possibilities of personal \"re-presentation\" that first-year students engage in when they arrive in this new college environment. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 171: My Brain Made Me Do It (My Brain Made Me Do It: Neuroscientific Challenges to Free Will.) We assume that people have free will. If someone decided to take this course, for instance, we would assume that they chose to take it freely. And if someone did something immoral like steal, we would think that they acted freely and that they should be held morally responsible for their actions as a result. While we may take free will for granted, many neuroscientists and philosophers claim that recent neuroscientific evidence offers new challenges to it. If, for example, our brains show 341 patterns of activity that suggest we will make a particular decision before we are conscious of making it, did we decide freely or was our decision pre-determined? We explore these new challenges to free will and moral responsibility and the important moral puzzles that follow from them. For instance, should someone who commits assault - potentially due to the effects of an undiagnosed brain tumor - be imprisoned for that crime? In the course, students develop their analytic writing skills by clearly representing the arguments of the authors who present these new challenges and then by developing their own responses to them. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 173: Am I a \"Normal\" Kid? (Am I a \"Normal\" Kid? Analyzing Messages of Power and Cultural Hegemony in Youth Texts.) Every type of text that young people encounter, from books and cartoons to songs, movies, and magazines, contains underlying messages about what is deemed \"normal,\" valued, and expected in our society. Such texts reflect the worldviews of dominant cultural groups (i.e., white, middle class, heteronormative), which serve to legitimize these views and minimize and oppress the norms and values of non-dominant groups. This course addresses issues of culture, power, oppression, and social justice; critical literacy theories. such as critical race theory and queer theory; and content/text analysis research methods. Students analyze a variety of texts aimed at youth such as advertisements, songs, and fiction books to study how the texts indirectly send messages about what is \"normal\" in our society and how they perpetuate the systemic marginalization of non-dominant cultural groups. Students also read scholarly works about cultural hegemony and critical literacy to inform their analysis of the youth texts. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 102: Knowing Yourself and Others (Knowing Yourself and Others: Socialization in College.) This course investigates the construct of Social Emotional Learning, and how that maps on to skills needed to be successful in college. Students will take on a \"third person: perspective as researchers to observe social and emotional occurrences on campus while engaging in self- reflection to become more socially and emotionally competent, themselves. Assignments will include summaries of research articles, observation logs, research protocol development, self-narrative construction, and a culminating assignment having the students investigating a specific element within SEL (self-awareness, social-awareness, self- management, responsible decision making, or relationship management), how it presents itself on campus, how it is presented in today's society and in popular culture, and strategies for teaching improvement in this area. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 104: Africana Philosophy This course serves as an introduction to the philosophies of the African diaspora, which are collectively referred to as Africana philosophy. Africana philosophy comprises three distinct philosophical traditions: African philosophy, African-American philosophy, and Afro-Caribbean philosophy. We will study the major figures, schools, concepts, and debates that animate these traditions. Although Africana philosophy is a broad category covering a multiplicity of different philosophical perspectives, all three philosophical traditions are concerned with the lived existence of Africans and African-descended peoples. We will analyze concepts such as 'reason,' 'double consciousness,' and 'creolization,' and we will examine disputes between philosophers, including the quarrel between Anthony Appiah and Lucius Outlaw over the significance of race. Some of the key questions we will answer include: What role did colonialism play in shaping the agenda of African philosophy? What is black feminist existential philosophy? How can the Haitian Revolution be understood from the standpoint of political philosophy? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 105: Music in Chicago Chicago offers its residents a musical soundscape as rich and as varied as any city in America. The city has a long history of classical music performances through organizations such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Ravinia Festival. Jazz and the Blues evolved in Chicago and can be heard in clubs across the city. Chicago also offers a diverse collection of ethnic and world music festivals nearly every weekend of the year. In this course, we will explore Chicago's unique soundscape through three main areas: classical music, jazz and the blues, and world music. Our investigation will involve frequent field trips, some as a class and some in smaller groups. We will study the history of music in the city and will also cultivate active listening skills. This course 342 requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off-campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. No prior musical skills are required. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 111: Race and Space in Chicago Schools The history of American education has been marked by inequalities along racial, ethnic, economic, linguistic, religious, and cultural lines. Since the late twentieth century, the development of suburban and urban boundaries has come to redefine equity and social justice in schools. This course introduces students to social and institutional forces that make 'race' and 'space' tools for educational inequity. Focusing on Chicago-area schools, we will consider how the laws and collective actions of society have produced a 'poor urban' and 'affluent suburban' divide that continues to shape the educational experiences of students from various backgrounds. By learning how to read carefully and to write clearly about the issues of 'race' and 'space' in Chicago-area schools, students will develop basic strategies of research, writing and presentation. Travelling as a group accompanied by the instructor, students will visit pertinent Chicago-area schools to explore these issues in real-life educational contexts. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 115: Climate Change Across Disciplines This course will explore the most pressing issue of our time: climate change. We will examine the physical science of global warming, but more so we will focus on the social, political, ethical, psychological and artistic aspects of global warming. We will critically examine the predicted and current consequences of climate change and how it impacts groups of people differently. In addition, we will engage the following questions: What global and local political efforts have been made to address and deny the problem? What are the economic implications of climate change? What do ethics and the law say about global warming? How has modern literature and film imagined the future in a warming world? Is technology enough to get us out of this mess or will it require more systemic social change? As individuals and societies how do we cognitively perceive such a large problem? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 116: Meteors, Dinosaurs and Science (Dinosaurs, Meteors and Scientific Argumentation.) What caused the extinction of dinosaurs? What theories have been derived from what evidence about this extinction? This course will examine how scientists go about convincing others by focusing on this topic. In 1980, scientists from disparate disciplines advanced the theory that the impact of a meteor 66 million years ago set in motion the events that resulted in the extinction of some three-quarters of Earth's species, including dinosaurs. It was only in the 1990's that the larger scientific community came to the consensus around that notion. And there is an ongoing research question of why did the meteor strike then in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula? In this seminar we will explore how scientists use observational evidence and calculations to advance persuasive arguments. This includes looking at the incomplete nature of contemporaneous scientific evidence as well as considering the questions of skeptical paleontologists, geologists and astronomers. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 118: Chicago, First City of Comedy In 1955, Viola Spolin and Paul Sills founded the Compass Players in Chicago and established the city as the birthplace of improvisational theater. Chicagois now home to Second City and dozens of other improv clubs that both feature and train aspiring comedians and actors. It also hosts Chicago SketchFest, the world's largest sketch comedy festival. In this course we will examine the early development of improv in Chicago and analyze the role of Chicago improv in humor production today. We will take class trips to comedy clubs, to attend shows and discuss this genre with practitioners and instructors. Students will learn to distinguish among different types of humor production and reception, and will consider the value of improv beyond the realm of entertainment (e.g., how improvisational theater games may help individuals prepare for the unexpected on the stage and in life). (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 343 FIYS 121: Street Art: Who Makes and Owns It? (Street Art: The Politics of Authorship and Ownership.)This course will explore the history of visual expression in public spaces in its different renderings, from graffiti vandalism to outdoor art galleries. We will focus on the aesthetic side of street art, as well as on its social and political implications in their different cultural contexts. We will discuss how street art has challenged traditional notions of art, has redefined what being an artist means, and has changed the way spectators see, enjoy, and consume art. Special attention will be given to questions of authorship and ownership by discussing issues of cultural property and art reproductions. Films, guest lectures, and creative projects will supplement class meetings and readings. This course will include an excursion to the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago, famous for its Latino street art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 122: Future of Energy: the True Story (Science of the Future of Energy: the True Story) In 1956, geologist M. King Hubbert predicted that the US oil production would begin to decline when half of the known reserves had been used. Inthe mid-1970s, there was an 'oil crisis,' when prices increased overnight and long lines formed at gasoline stations throughout the US. Indeed, Hubbert's prediction had come true, and the US became a large importer of oil. Now, in 2011, we are nearing the point at which one half of the known global reserves have been used. This course, as one of three linked First Year Studies courses exploring the broad topic of truth, will focus on the science of energy, its use, and the possible energy futures that lie ahead of us when global oil production begins to decline. As the world grapples with an inevitable shift to renewable energy sources, we'll explore the truth behind the many forces that resist the changes. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 124: Social Labels and Identity We use social labels (e.g., Hispanic, deaf, woman, heterosexual, working class) to identify ourselves and others. How do such labels shape our understanding of ourselves and how we view the world? How are these labels and identities influenced by the larger social contexts in which we live? How do social categories affect our attitudes about our own life circumstances? In this course we'll examine how personal identities form, and how they are influenced by social group memberships and larger social structures. We'll read about psychological research and feminist theory, participate in field trips, and listen to guest speakers. This course will demonstrate how academic research can help us understand our own experiences as we examine the lives of others. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 126: Mapping Chicago: How Space Matters This course explores how space matters to human well-being. We will consider theories about how space affects education, health and income in an urban environment, with specific application to the city of Chicago. Using ArcGIS, a software system for managing geographic knowledge, students will learn to map and analyze relationships among socioeconomic, demographic, political and location variables. In individual projects, students will develop spatial analyses of such topics as education accessibility, income inequality, racial segregation, and crime. This course will focus on how spatial analysis can be used to enhance public policy. Students will also gain skill in data management and analysis. Knowledge of Excel is preferred, and additional training will be given in classes. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 147: Government and Markets Why is the government involved in some aspects of our lives more than others? This question can be answered in many different ways, depending on one's theoretical background. Different economists would provide different analyses of the government's role, especially as it relates to business and markets. They would also base their arguments on fundamental economic theories. The primary goal of this course is to develop an understanding of economic markets and issues where governments have become important participants. Both in the United States and abroad, governments take an active role in the economics of education, the environment, health care, big business, poverty, and unemployment, among other issues. Although the course will be approached from an economic perspective, the topics relate to other fields of study as well, and particularly to the fields of politics and sociology. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 344 FIYS 165: Theater in Chicago The Chicago theater scene is internationally acknowledged to be the greatest in the U.S. In this course, you will have the opportunity to read, discuss, write about, and perform scenes from classic and modern plays, which you will see produced at a wide variety of Chicago theaters, ranging from small storefront companies to such institutions as the world-famous Goodman, Steppenwolf, and Chicago Shakespeare theaters. You will not only see the shows but you will also meet with some of the artists involved in the productions, both in the classroom and after the performances themselves, to talk about their work. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off-campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. Note: The plays we read and attend will be dependent upon range of genres, ticket availability, scheduling, and ticket cost. A lab fee of $150 will be charged to your tuition account for this course to defray ticket and transportation costs. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 168: Global Cultures: Chicago and Beyond Is the world getting smaller? Will increased cultural mixing and homogenization eventually make cultural differences a thing of the past? Or will resistance to cultural change provoke greater conflict and stronger cultural identification? In this course we will examine the accelerating trend of cultural globalization through the lens of cultural encounters and their impact on changing perceptions of identity, particularly in Chicago. Other global cities, such as New York, Shanghai, Beirut, and Paris, will provide further examples of shifting cultural associations and new ways of constructing social identity. Excursions to Chicago will enhance our discussions of the critical essays, literature and films we'll study, all pertaining to Chicago's historical and current cultural influences of various Latino, African American, Chinese and French-speaking groups. Guest speakers with different perspectives on globalization will help us to construct a wider vision of this trend and envision potential future scenarios such as increased cultural hegemony, balkanization, hybridity, integration, and assimilation. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 169: Recreational Mathematics Puzzles, paradoxes, and brain teasers have inspired many young people to pursue careers in science, and more than one achievement in mathematics has emerged from the desire to solve difficult puzzles. In this course we will examine many famous (and not-so-famous) puzzles, and explore famous games such as Sudoku, tic-tac-toe, and monopoly, to gain insight into all manner of phenomena. To guide us in our mathematical diversions, we will read essays by Martin Gardner, Ian Stewart, Peter Winkler, Terence Tao, and other popular mathematics writers. In addition, we will view documentaries and conduct group discussions to explore multiple aspects of mathematics. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 174: Chicago's Museums Chicago's renowned museums and exhibition spaces make it a destination for culture lovers the world over. From the Field and DuSable Museums to Hull House and the Art Institute, Chicago is home to a vast array of cultural, historical, and scientific repositories whose holdings include some of the greatest artifacts of human endeavor, contributing immensely to the city's identity. This course introduces students to some of these museums, with an emphasis on art institutions, while also examining their historic and current roles in the life of the city. Topics include the management, collections, curation, audience, programming, and architecture of these institutions. One museum will be selected for in-depth investigation. Working individually and in small groups, students will research its various functions and present their findings to the class. Because of conflicts with field trips, fall and winter athletes should not register for this course. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 175: Frankenstein: Myth of the Monstrous It's alive! This course will take Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, as its jumping-off point for a semester's exploration of this uncannily persistent tale of horror, now a byword for the dark side of science and modernity. Shelley's novel gives us so much - the archetypes of mad scientist and monster, inquiries into the origins of evil and nature versus nurture, questions about gender, sexuality, class, and race - that we could easily spend the whole semester studying the novel and the gothic culture that it emerged from. 345 But we will also look at film adaptations, read plays, stories, and poems on the theme of the monstrous, and consider contemporary \"Frankensteins,\" from atomic energy to drag queens to genetically engineered corn. This writing-intensive course will keep literature at its center but will also, as the above suggests, take turns into cultural studies and other disciplines. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 177: Black Activism in Chicago (\"You Can't Jail the Revolution:\" Black Activism in Chicago.) Since its original non-native settlement in 1780 by Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, a Black man of Haitian descent, Chicago has been a space for Black people to make their presence felt. This visibility has often come with struggle and strife. From Ida B. Wells to Fred Hampton to Camesha Jones, Black women and men in Chicago have claimed space and freedom despite the institutions working against them. This course will look at the history of Black activism in the city, using a variety of sources, including newspaper articles, speeches, autobiographies, interviews, documentaries, and films. This course will also utilize our proximity to Chicago and engage in field trips to witness Black activism in Chicago in action. We will investigate what it means to be an activist, what issues are important to Black activists in and around the city, what strategies Black activists have used over time, and what the costs of activism are. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 178: Politics in Film, Politics of Film In this course, we discuss political questions as presented in American and foreign films, both classic (Dr. Strangelove [UK, 1964], The Cranes are Flying [USSR, 1957]) and modern (Thank You for Smoking [USA, 2005], Parasite [South Korea, 2020], The Lives of Others [Germany, 2006], I Saw the Sun [Turkey, 2009]). We focus on five major themes: democracy and dictatorships, migration and citizenship, capitalism and inequality, social movements and revolutions, and international conflicts and wars. We investigate how and why these issues are depicted in films in different ways, depending on where and when the film was produced. Students discuss the appeal of political films as entertainment; they also read political science scholarship that critically examines political issues raised in films. Films thus serve, in this course, as the medium through which to examine how and why political problems emerge and are resolved. We also ponder the question: do films shape the way we think about politics or does politics shape the way we view films? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 186: Free Speech Undoubtedly, one of the most important rights that citizens in liberal democracies possess is the right to freely express themselves without fear of governmental sanction. However, while it may be easy to defend the right of free speech in the abstract, when faced with particular utterances that offend, shock, and/or harm, many of us will defend certain limitations on speech as morally appropriate or politically necessary. This course will be an examination of when, if ever, it is appropriate to restrict speech. Is there an absolute right to free speech? If so, does it only apply in certain public settings? And is the notion of \"hate speech\" a coherent idea? We will examine such questions (and many others) through a rigorous examination of iconic Supreme Court cases, classic works in political philosophy, and contemporary debates in politics, sociology, and psychology. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 187: Religion in Gilded Age Chicago Students in this course will study the history and context of religion in Chicago at the turn of the century, roughly 1870-1930. We will examine pivotal events in the shaping of Chicago's religious communities, including religious immigration and the building of the city's major churches and synagogues, the World's Parliament of Religions in 1894, the rise of faith healer and self proclaimed prophet John Dowie, the arrival of the Baha'i movement, and new occult and metaphysical movements. In addition to written histories, this course makes use of field trips and historical archival material. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off-campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 346 FIYS 188: Cultural Diversity and Dialogue In a culturally and socially diverse society like that of our own time, to confront and explore issues of difference, conflict, and community helps facilitate understanding and improve relations among social and cultural groups. This course provides an introduction to cultural diversity and social justice. By way of readings, discussion, and experiential activities designed to facilitate dialogue among students, we will examine crucial issues in contemporary life that focus on cultural diversity. By examining historical, psychological, and sociological texts as well as interactive exercises, students will be challenged to increase personal awareness of their own cultural experience, expand knowledge of the historical and social realities of diverse groups, and take action as agents of positive social change in their communities. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 189: Public Sculpture in Chicago This course is devoted to a first-hand examination of public sculpture in Chicago and its suburbs. Using intensive field study with photographic documentation, background readings and research, group discussions, individual research-based and analytical writings, and the development of an original public sculpture proposal, students will gain insight into the factors involved in the ideation, planning, funding and execution of public sculpture in urban and suburban venues. The class will tackle problems of community interest, artistic invention and intervention, accessibility, patronage, 'name-branding,' and symbolism in an effort to gain practical academic skills while learning about an important facet of the rich cultural experience that Chicago holds for residents, commuters and tourists. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off-campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 193: Writing Chicago Students in this course will explore how poets, writers, and other artists have described, imagined, and reimagined the city of Chicago as, alternately, \"nature's metropolis,\" the economic dynamo of the American dream, and as a nightmarish dystopia of corruption, pollution, violence, and injustice. Starting with the Burnham Plan, students will pair the investigation of particular sites and neighborhoods with the study of literary texts and cultural histories, as well as artworks and architecture. Urban spaces as envisioned by women, immigrants, African Americans, and the LGBT community will be a particular focus of the course, and students will produce their own creative and critical writings about the city. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 197: Tools of Science, Mysteries of Art How are forged works of art detected? Conversely, how is the authenticity of cultural heritage material determined? How do museums identify colorants and use them to date artwork? Can the identification of dyes and pigments help decipher trade routes? Scientists have developed tools to help answer these and other questions posed by curators, art historians, and collectors. In this course, students learn about the scientific tools used to study cultural heritage materials, including carbon dating, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Students read introductory material, newspaper articles, scholarly articles, and case studies to examine how scientific tools have been used to decipher an artist's intent, date works of art, identify trade routes, authenticate artwork, and discover forgeries. This course includes a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago.

Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Program are: 1. Students in Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies courses will be able to demonstrate an understanding of key scholarship on gender and sexuality. 349 2. Students in Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies will be able to identify and apply key works of scholarship on gender and sexuality to other academic areas in order to facilitate interdisciplinary analysis, evaluation and/or interpretation of cultural texts or practices. 3. Students in Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies will be able to demonstrate how concepts related to gender and sexuality function analytically to inform their critical thinking about cultural norms and practices. These outcomes will be assessed through an evaluation of writing assignments produced in GSWS courses. Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Courses GSWS 104: Chem of Health and Reproduction (Chemistry of Human Health and Reproduction.) This course focuses on biochemical processes related to human health and reproduction. It introduces concepts necessary to understand how the structure and function of naturally occurring small molecules and pharmaceuticals modulate biological processes - with an emphasis on human health and reproduction.

This course explores the role of gender and sexuality in shaping U.S. politics, economy, and society. In particular, we examine the way that power itself is \"gendered,\" and explore expressions of gendered power from intimate interpersonal interactions to global foreign policy. In this course we will not assume \"women\" or \"men\" have been solid blocks with unified interests over time, but rather have always been divided along lines of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and political ideology. We explore these divisions by looking at political movements throughout U.S. history, including women's suffrage, feminism, gay liberation, reproductive rights, sex-workers' rights, contemporary LGBTQ rights, and the #MeToo movement.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Writing requirements.) GSWS 301: Romantic Comedies & Phil of Love (Romantic Comedies and Philosophy of Love) Why do we like to watch romantic comedies? What's satisfying about them, even when they're not great films? Film theorist Leo Braudy claimed that \"genre [film] ... always involves a complex relation between the compulsions of the past and the freedoms of the present. ... [They] affect their audience ... by their ability to express the warring traditions in society and the social importance of understanding convention.\" In this course, following Braudy, we will investigate the relationship between the film genre of romantic comedy and age-old thinking about love, marriage, and romance. We'll read some ancient and modern philosophy of love, as well as some relevant film theory, and watch and discuss an array of romantic comedies, trying to unpack what we really believe about love.

How does group affiliation affect identity? What is the relationship between identity and change? How does faith in God influence understanding of the individual? This course considers the following topics: medieval conceptions of the individual in Christian autobiography; the role of the body and gender in determining identity (exploring topics such as the Eucharist, the cult of saints, and sex difference); how medieval Europeans defined their own identity by persecuting the 'other,' including heretics, Jews, and lepers; how change affected identity in medieval texts such as werewolf stories and resurrection 353 theology.

The increasingly popular musical genre and cultural phenomenon is often critiqued for being misogynist and homophobic. This class examines where this critique stems from and subverts this narrative to show the importance of women and gender to hip hop music and culture. Topics covered in this course include female rap pioneers, how discussions of masculinity and femininity have shaped rap lyrics, and the growing gender fluidity in hip hop. Prerequisites: AFAM 228 (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement.

This course examines the ways that we understand (or misunderstand) race, ethnicity, class, and gender from an archaeological perspective. We explore archaeological research projects across time and regions to interrogate an essential problem in archaeology: How can we tell whether material differences in the archaeological record correspond to boundaries human groups draw among themselves? Course topics include race and racialization, ethnic diversity and ethnogenesis, the formation and performance of class, social constructions of gender and sexuality, and the political stakes involved in archaeological studies of difference. Throughout this course we ask how an engagement with intersectionality\u2014the idea that categories of difference are entangled and covalent\u2014may allow for a more nuanced understanding of the past, and of the present.

In this class, we will cast a wide and critical eye on how sex and gender are defined, conceptualized, and studied. We will ask a series of questions about similarities and differences in a number of areas, including relationships, mental health, abilities and achievement, aggression, communication, hormones, and physical health and functioning. We will discuss gender development and socialization, as well as gender inequality and sex-role stereotypes, paying particular attention to how the scientific study of sex and gender is used and misused in contemporary society.

Empires asserted dominance over far-flung colonies, while technology and innovation churned to keep up with new demands. The era of colonization and expansion set the stage for further conflict and bloodshed in recent centuries, along with the emergence of new ideological assertions regarding individuals, liberty, and globalization. Although understanding the trends in modern global history is a massive undertaking, one group is frequently underrepresented or ignored: women. This course examines the history of the world from 1450 to the present with a special focus on women and gender. It seeks to broaden our understanding of participants in world history and identify ways that women helped shape the development of societies and ideologies around the globe. We also learn more about the everyday lived experiences of women in various cultures and nations. How have ideas of men's and women's roles, as well as conceptualizations of masculinity and femininity, shaped modern life? How does our understanding of history change when we focus on women?

Organized around major policy debates, we explore themes including women in the labor force, women in politics, gender and development, inequality, and violence. We also learn about top-down change, instituted by organizations like the IMF and World Bank, and bottom-up solutions created by NGOs and social entrepreneurs. Through class readings, group discussions, small group work, presentations, and a research paper, students are able to identify forms of existing gender inequalities, and critically examine policy solutions.Prerequisite: POLS 110 or consent of instructor. . cross listed: POLS 349 GSWS 350: Topics in Gender and Media (when applicable) Intensive study of selected subjects within the field of communications.

Rather than attempt a survey of all the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understandings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contemporary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the tropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' certain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's lives.

A unifying thread for those theorists generally accepted as working within Queer Theory is the prioritization of gender and sexuality as social ordering devices. Queer Theorists make dualities, power inequalities, and identity performance central to their analyses. The creation, rise, and ultimate deconstruction of these theories will be placed within social and historical contexts. Once the student has a firm understanding of the source and content of Queer Theory we will embark upon an exploration of its application through the investigation of a number of topics that are often peripheralized in the academy. Ultimately, we will question the utility of the theory in light of factors ranging from its dismantlement under deconstruction to the rise of social contingency theory.

Gender and sexual norms are perpetuated and challenged through notions of visibility, a key tactic in the fight for societal acceptance and civil rights. How sexuality is made visible and invisible will serve as a central focus in our analysis of queer film and media, focusing primarily on explicit representations of GLBTQ characters. Through feminist and queer theory, film theory and cultural criticism, we will analyze the contested relationships between spectators and texts, identity and commodities, realism and fantasy, activism and entertainment, desire and politics.

It will also consider representations of the domestic sphere as evidence for the functions of objects in houses, palaces, or villas. Addressing issues of patronage, function and audience, the course explores the uses men and women in the Renaissance made of works of art in their homes. Among the art forms we will analyze are: domestic architecture, paintings (frescoes, portraits, cassone, spalliere), sculpture, furnishings, metalwork, ceramics, tapestries and other textiles.

There is one exception: students may elect to take one required course for the major for a \"Pass\" grade; that course will not be counted toward the required grade point average. There are no limits for minors. Requirements for the Major: At least 9 credits History 110: Global Change:The Power of History - preferably in the first year One of the following two-course sequences: o United States History 200: Empire, Slavery, Freedom: Early United States History 201: Inequity, Rights, Reaction: Modern United States o East Asia History 212: Origins of East Asia History 213: Modern East Asia o Ancient and Medieval Europe History 204: Roman History History 205: Medieval History o Medieval and Early Modern Europe History 205: Medieval History History 206: Renaissance and Reformation o Modern Europe History 208: Europe 1715-1890 History 209: Europe in the Twentieth Century o African American History History 202: African American History 1500-1865 History 203: African American History 1865-2016 History 300: The Historian's Workshop - taken as a junior Four additional courses, at least two of which must be at the 300-level or above Completion of the Senior Studies Requirement in one of the following ways: o History 420: Senior Seminar o Senior Thesis Requirements for the Minor: The Minor in History consists of six courses, one of which must be at the 300-level or above. History 300 is encouraged but not required for the minor. A note on internships The History Department recognizes that internships are a valuable way for students to connect their classroom learning to future careers. Some History majors and minors have completed internships at institutions directly related to History (Lake Forest-Lake Bluff Historical Society, Newberry Library, etc.). Our students have also completed internships at other types of companies and institutions that allowed them to utilize the skills of a History major/minor (political campaigns, non-profits, etc.). We encourage our students to seek out these opportunities. Internships do not, however, fulfill any of the nine credits required of History majors or six credits required of History minors (see above). Rather, they will appear as \"extra\" History credits on the student's transcript (a tenth course for a major, or a seventh course for a minor, for example). For more information, see our \"Internships and Careers\" page. 360 A note on repeated courses Lake Forest College policy states that students who receive a C- or lower in a course may repeat that course once with replacement of the earlier grade. Normally, students must repeat a course with the same course number. However, in the spring of 2014 the History Department instituted a comprehensive course re-numbering. This could cause confusion among students wishing to repeat a course but finding that it now has a different number. Students in this situation should consult with the chair of History to be sure that they are repeating the same course, regardless of the different number. Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the History Department are: 1. The history major will demonstrate the skills required of a historian: critical thinking; writing; conducting historical research; and interpretation. 2. The history major will demonstrate an understanding of historiographical approaches to the past and the ability to recognize the limits and biases of documents from the past, and to appreciate the perspectives of both past and present in any reconstruction of history. History Courses HIST 110: Global Change: The Power of History This course offers an introduction to college-level study of history. Specific subjects covered will vary, but a significant amount of the course will focus on non-Western history. Topics may include: the origins of civilizations in the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas; the role of religion in society; the rise and fall of empires; encounters between civilizations, from ancient trade networks to modern colonialism. Students in all sections will be introduced to certain key skills and methodology used by historians, including analysis of primary sources and assessment of historical arguments. Close attention will be paid to the development of critical reading and writing skills. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) HIST 200: Empire, Slavery, Freedom: Early US (Empire, Slavery, Freedom: Early United States) What were the origins and foundations of the United States? This course follows the transformation of North America and the emergence of the United States as an independent republic from the seventeenth century to the greatest crisis of the new nation, the Civil War and Reconstruction. Connecting primary sources to major works of historical interpretation, it examines the foundations of the United States by tracing the political, economic, and social underpinnings of historical change. Our exploration of this history will revolve around three key themes: land, labor, and territorial conquest and empire.

The history of African Americans in the United States is often defined by the chattel slavery experience. However, the early years of American history that made people of African descent American are much more complex. By centering the 361 actions and voices of the heterogeneous African American community, this course examines topics including the Middle Passage, domestic slavery expansion, free and maroon black communities, various resistance strategies, interracial coalitions, and the role of enslaved people in bringing about their own emancipation. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 230 HIST 203: African American History 1865-2016 This course examines the journey of African Americans from the end of the Civil War through Reconstruction, the New Nadir, the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, the War on Drugs and new black capitalism, and the rise of hip hop, ending with the Obama years. In 1865, the centuries-old question of where African Americans would fit into the fabric of United States society was finally answered. As newly freed people and full citizens, African Americans learned that the process of citizenship would not be seamless or easy, and that the fight was just beginning. Blacks redefined their status over and over again during this 150-year period, and this course will examine why and how these shifts occurred. No prerequisites.

We begin with Rome's establishment as a small city-state, as recorded in both legend and archaeological evidence. We chart Rome's political development and imperial expansion under the republic, study the career of Augustus and the revolution by which he transformed Rome into an empire, and conclude with that empire's fragmentation into the Byzantine, Latin Christian, and Islamic worlds. The topics studied will include: key political institutions and leaders; war, imperialism, and their consequences, including slavery and social unrest; the work of authors such as Cicero, Vergil, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius; the varied Roman religious scene and the rise of Christianity and Islam; Roman social history, including class, marriage, and slavery. Students will work extensively with primary documents in translation. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: CLAS 211 HIST 205: Medieval History This course examines the history of Europe and the Mediterranean world in the years 300-1500 CE. We begin with the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into three areas: Latin Christian Europe, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic world. We then explore the richness of the medieval centuries, including: aspects of medieval Christianity ranging from the cult of saints to monasticism to the papacy; the development of the major European kingdoms, knighthood, and chivalry; intellectual life and the rise of universities; interactions between Christians, Jews, and Muslims both peaceful (trade) and hostile (crusade); lives of ordinary people in urban and rural settings.

In this course we examine this momentous Founding Age of the United States, with a special focus on the ideas that shaped this period. We explore the growing estrangement of American colonies from Great Britain and the culmination of this process in the Declaration of Independence. Then we look at the process and controversies involved in creating a new nation, and the United States government. (Under the old GEC, this course 363 meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 253 HIST 224: The New American Nation 1787-1848 This course covers America's 'Founding Period' from the end of the Revolution through the conclusion of the U.S.- Mexican War. During this time, Americans gradually came to see themselves as part of a unified nation with its own distinctive culture and ideals, though this outcome was far from certain. Beginning with the Constitution and the uncertain legacies of the American Revolution, the course considers the fundamental political, social, and cultural problems that could easily have torn the young Republic apart. Topics and themes include the problems of democracy and popular politics, the limits of citizenship, the formation of a distinctive American culture, the place of America on the world stage, the transition to capitalism and the 'market revolution,' and the figure of Andrew Jackson. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 271 HIST 226: American Civil War The origins of the war in the antagonistic development of the free North and slave South; Lincoln and the Republican Party; Black activity in the North and South; the war; the transforming and gendered aspects of fighting the war; Reconstruction; the impact of the war on American development.

We will pay special attention to new patterns of inequality in the contexts of industrialization, urbanization, and immigration. We will also examine the complexities and contradictions of progressive reform movements, including efforts to improve housing, sanitation, and labor conditions. We will look at how those transformations affected people's everyday lives and conceptions of American citizenship, and we will explore the emergence of popular mass culture through photography, art, architecture, advertising, and films.

AFAM 230 HIST 231: Indigenous History of the Americas This course is a survey of Indigenous history from pre-colonization to the present across both North and South America. Throughout the Americas, Native people built complex systems of cultural grandeur and political interaction. These cultures may have changed but certainly did not vanish when these groups came into contact with European colonizers. Rather, Indigenous people created new strategies for survival in a changing geopolitical reality, and impacted the development of emerging nations like the United States. In modern times, Indigenous people continue to fight for recognition of their sovereignty and rights. This course connects Indigenous history to issues related to nation-building, citizenship, economic change, and multiculturalism. No prerequisites.

We explore the growth of urban economies and new forms of labor, migration and immigration into cities, persistent patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and displacement, and struggles over power and resources that make up urban politics. We also pay particular attention to urban geography and the relationship between cities, rural and suburban areas. Students are introduced to multiple disciplinary approaches to understanding American cities, and take field trips to relevant sites in Chicago. This course is the foundational course for the Urban Studies minor program. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K-12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

It will mainly offer an investigation of Muslim immigration and integration in the post-1945 period. Along the way, we will also consider the broader context of immigration (i.e., of national, ethnic, and religious groups other than Muslims to France), the formation and evolution of concepts of French national identity, and the history of French citizenship policy. This course represents a postcolonial approach to the history of France, at the nexus of colonial, immigration, and urban histories. These histories will be studied with a focus on the social, economic, political, and cultural stakes raised by immigration, and the course will consider how some in France have reacted against certain groups of immigrants as antithetical to \"Frenchness\".

This course broadly surveys Mexican history from the pre-Conquest period through modern times, including a particular focus on the current Mexican-American border as well as regions that historically bordered Mexico (such as modern-day Florida, Central America, and even Spanish territories in the Pacific). The meaning of progress, indigenous culture, imperialism's impact, racial/ethnic identity, and popular mobilization are among its recurring themes.

These include the Haitian Revolution, the role of slaves during the American Civil War, the impact of Marcus Garvey's United Negro Improvement Association (including the role of his wife, Amy Jacques Garvey in keeping the organization active amidst his legal troubles), and the Civil Rights and the Black Power movements. This course also asks how such histories shed light on the current Black Lives Matter movement along with popular uprisings in Ferguson, Baltimore, and beyond. The history of black freedom struggles across the diaspora reveals that black people have always been active agents in fighting oppression. This course also encourages students to think about how these struggles were connected and have changed across time and space. No prerequisites.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 275 HIST 283: History of Emotions in the West (Thinking about Feeling: History of Emotions in the West.) Emotions were once considered stable and universal: love was always love, and fear always evidence of irredeemable cowardice. Recently, however, historians have found significant variations in expression and regulation of emotions in different periods and cultures. This course will examine ideas surrounding emotion in the West from Late Antiquity through the Early Modern period. The study of emotions raises a variety of historical questions: how do we research the history of something as intangible as emotions? Should historians use the theories and methodologies of other disciplines? Have institutions and belief systems mobilized particular emotions? Have norms and expectations for emotion changed over time? What is the relationship between the experience and expression of emotion? We will also explore some of the established narratives in the history of emotions, such as the \"hydraulic model\" and the rise of the affectionate family. No prerequisites. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) HIST 284: Epidemic Disease in Western History This course will focus on four epidemic diseases that caused widespread death and destruction in Europe and the Americas from the fourteenth to twentieth centuries: the Black Death, smallpox, cholera, and malaria. In each case, after learning about the symptoms of the disease, the progression of the epidemic(s), and the identity of the victims, we will explore multiple facets of the human response to these natural disasters, including: theories of disease; religious responses; medical measures; artistic representations; and the intersection of state power and public health efforts. We will also study key figures in the history of medicine. A significant portion of the course is devoted to the impact of disease in European imperial possessions (such as India and the Americas), violence against minority groups (notably Jews) in Europe in the wake of epidemics, and the ways in which theories of class and race influenced European thinking on disease. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) HIST 285: Public History Public history is the practice of history outside the academy. Public historians record and preserve evidence of the past in many formats, analyzing and interpreting their findings to general and specialized audiences beyond the traditional classroom setting. This course will survey the theory and practice of various professional historical 367 specialties - ranging from archival administration to historic site management, museum exhibitions, and historical reenactment. Institutional constraints, audience development, and conflicts between history and public memory will be major thematic issues. Field trips to institutions and sites in the Chicago metropolitan area. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 240 HIST 288: Gender, Sex, Power in U.S. History (Gender, Sex, and Power in U.S. History) From slave-holding plantations to tech company offices, from bedrooms to the halls of government, gender has fundamentally shaped the historical experiences of those living within the United States. This course explores the role of gender and sexuality in shaping U.S. politics, economy, and society. In particular, we examine the way that power itself is \"gendered,\" and explore expressions of gendered power from intimate interpersonal interactions to global foreign policy. In this course we will not assume \"women\" or \"men\" have been solid blocks with unified interests over time, but rather have always been divided along lines of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and political ideology. We explore these divisions by looking at political movements throughout U.S. history, including women's suffrage, feminism, gay liberation, reproductive rights, sex-workers' rights, contemporary LGBTQ rights, and the #MeToo movement.

The centuries from 1600 to today have witnessed unprecedented rates of economic growth, advances in agricultural and industrial productivity, and improvements in the standard of living, which have transformed social, political, and economic life across the world. Over the semester, we will explore a series of questions: What are the origins, consequences, and the future of capitalism? Why did some states and nations become so powerful, some economies so wealthy? Who benefited from economic growth and expanding trade? What roles did public and private actors play? Will capitalism converge on a single \"best\" model under the pressures of globalization? Through an introduction to the methods and major topics of economic history, students will gain essential skills in assessing historical sources and statistical datasets. No prerequisites.

What is a \"reliable source\" and where are they found? Whose history deserves to be written and who gets to write it? This course examines how these questions have been answered by different schools of historical thought and considers the purpose and value of studying history in today's world. The course consists of three main components: first, charting the development of the discipline of history; second, acquiring hands-on experience in archives at the College and elsewhere; third, understanding the many possible applications of the study of history in various careers. Prerequisite: an introductory history course. Required of all history majors. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) HIST 306: Civil Rights Movement This course focuses on the origins, development, and accomplishments of the civil rights movement in post-World War II America. Particular emphasis will be given to the differences between the struggle for black equality in the south and its northern counterpart. Taught in a seminar format, the class will be both reading- and writing-intensive. Course readings and paper assignments are designed to help students develop a comparative analytical framework and to illuminate the following lines of inquiry: What caused and what sustained the civil rights movement? What changes took place within the movement over time, particularly at the level of leadership? What underlay the radicalization of the movement and what were the consequences? To what extent did the civil rights movement succeed and how do we measure that success today? Finally, how did the black civil rights movement inspire other 368 groups and minorities in American society to organize? Prerequisite: History 200 or History 201.

More than an escape from everyday life, the games Americans have played and watched have been thick with social, cultural, and political meanings. Athletes and spectators alike have defined and challenged ideas of gender, race, and the body; they have worked out class antagonisms, expressed national identities, and promoted social change. Topics include: the construction of race; definitions of manhood and womanhood; industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of modern spectator sport; media and mass spectacle; fitness and athletic reform movements; collegiate athletics; sports figures and social change. Prerequisite: History 200 or 201, or permission of the instructor.

Placing the geographic area that would become the United States into a global frame, this course explores patterns of European, Asian, and Latin American migration into a land already inhabited by mobile indigenous populations, the forced migration of enslaved Africans to the U.S. and later migration of black citizens northward, as well as the movement of migrants over the long-contested (and moving) U.S.-Mexico border. We learn about the politics of migration, including the long history of anti-immigrant nativism and xenophobia in the United States, as well as the role of migrants in shaping major U.S. social and political movements. We also examine how ethnic, racial, and national identities - including \"American\"-are not fixed categories, but rather constructed and reconstructed over time.

This course examines how succeeding immigrant groups have practiced and lived their Catholic faith in different times and places. Religion cannot be separated from the larger social and economic context in which it is embedded, so the course will also pay attention to the ways in which the social and economic conditions that greeted the immigrants on their arrival shaped how they went about praying and working. Finally, the changing leadership of the Catholic Church will be taken into account, since it provided the ecclesiastical framework for the new Catholic arrivals. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of the instructor. .

Critics and audiences have noted that we are in a golden era of black television, with an upsurge of shows over the last few years that display the multiplicity of black life in the United States. And yet, this is not the first time this has happened. Since the 1950s, African Americans have been depicted on the small screen in both regressive and progressive ways. How have these images changed over time? How do these depictions impact the way people see African Americans and how African Americans see themselves? No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly- arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

This course will examine key questions debated by Christians from the origins of the faith in the Roman era to the end of the Middle Ages, many of which continue to be discussed today. These may include: should Christians use violence at all, and if so, under what circumstances? What is the correct relationship between the Church and the government? What makes a person a saint - celibacy? Harsh asceticism? Aiding the poor? Preaching the Gospel? What is the appropriate role of wealth and property in the life of a dedicated Christian? Should a Christian seeking religious truth rely only on the Bible and revelation, or do logic and scientific inquiry have a role to play? Students will work extensively with primary sources in translation and significant works of modern scholarship.

This course teaches the history of environmental transformations and human adaptation through an exploration of some of the natural disasters and climate changes that impacted Europe and the Mediterranean world c. 300-1500 CE. Using specific case studies (including episodes like the so-called \"mystery cloud\" that troubled Levantine communities in 536 and the unusually well-documented 1348 earthquake in central Europe), the course evaluates how medieval people thought about nature, and how moments of crisis shaped individuals, communities, and larger ecosystems. Students learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to analyze, track chronologically, and map spatially a specific disaster or environmental event. No prerequisites.

Empires asserted dominance over far-flung colonies, while technology and innovation churned to keep up with new demands. The era of colonization and expansion set the stage for further conflict and bloodshed in recent centuries, along with the emergence of new ideological assertions regarding individuals, liberty, and globalization. Although understanding the trends in modern global history is a massive undertaking, one group is frequently underrepresented or ignored: 372 women. This course examines the history of the world from 1450 to the present with a special focus on women and gender. It seeks to broaden our understanding of participants in world history and identify ways that women helped shape the development of societies and ideologies around the globe. We also learn more about the everyday lived experiences of women in various cultures and nations. How have ideas of men's and women's roles, as well as conceptualizations of masculinity and femininity, shaped modern life? How does our understanding of history change when we focus on women?

It shows, at its early phase, how a particular moral philosopher's thinking (such as Mencius and Xun-zi) is largely determined by his thinking on human nature. However, in later periods, particularly after the importation of Buddhism, the debates on human nature are replaced by an intense cognitive and metaphysical interest in the human mind. Moral cultivation begins to focus less on following moral rules but more on cultivating the mind. The effect of this nature-mind shift on Asian moral thinking is both historically profound and theoretically surprising.

Also, the U.S. refused to recognize both Israel's annexation of West Jerusalem and Jordan's annexation of East Jerusalem. After the 1967 War, Israel extended its control to Arab East Jerusalem and later declared all Jerusalem its eternal capital. Since then, American presidents have stopped short of pressuring Israel to abide by Resolution 181, arguing instead that the future of Jerusalem should be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. This course studies the complex history of the positions of modern American presidents on Jerusalem, focusing on how American domestic politics has shaped U.S. policy and the interactions between U.S. presidential administrations and international actors on the status of Jerusalem. cross listed: ISLM 349 IREL 350: Migration and Citizenship Migration across national boundaries is one of the fundamental issues in global politics of our time. What factors shape global migration flows? How do different countries regulate migration? How do states decide who belongs and who does not? Who is kept out and who is let in? How do immigration policies reflect the notion of citizenship? Can citizenship be earned, bought, or sold? This course examines causes and consequences of global migration and dilemmas associated with them in comparative perspective. Through case studies from various regions of the 393 world, including Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Middle East, students gain understanding of global patterns of migration flows, as well as how states and societies respond to them and are transformed by them.

When does a state of war produce its own structures and rules? How do different societies respond in different ways to life during wartime? How does ethnic and class conflict manifest in war? What happens when war and conflict become normalized? Does the perpetual conflict between tribes in Papua New Guinea constitute war in the same way that the war on terror is a war, and are either of these the same as World War II? Does the Arab Spring constitute a state of war? This course takes up the question of the social effects of war, including the consequences of living 'on war footing.' Potential topics include the militarization of societies, the differences between state and non-state control of violence, and the mechanisms by which populations are mobilized to violence.

Though it will remain the dominant world power for some time to come, most scholars agree that American global preeminence is waning. Yet scholars disagree about the effect of this shift on world order. Some see an effort by the United States and its closest allies to prop-up the current American liberal world order of global economic integration and cooperative security. Others envision either a 'post-American' world in which the United States and rising great powers re-negotiate the ground rules of a new liberal order, or a world in which the United States is one of a small number of great powers competing for power and influence in an illiberal world. Each of these possibilities raises compelling questions about war and peace, and cooperation and discord in twenty-first century international politics. Will this power shift jeopardize the liberal world order? Can this world order persist in the absence of American preeminence? How might the United States and its allies extend the current American world order?

Students learn the roles that different factors play in determining outcomes such as democracy, women's rights, and rights of minorities. Among other explanations of democracy, students will learn about modernization theory, the resource curse, and the role of religion. Students will evaluate these explanations as they apply to the MENA, considering 396 their strengths and weaknesses. By the end of the course, students should have a comprehensive understanding of the deterrents to democratization in the MENA and possible factors that could facilitate reform.

This course is an introduction to main concepts and theories of comparative politics. Students explore central questions of comparative politics research such as: under which conditions do authoritarian regimes persist or collapse? Why do some states succeed at democratization and others not? What causes democratic backsliding? Do variations in political institutions (constitutions, elections, party systems) matter and why? What are the causes and consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war? How do social movements get started? Why are some countries wealthy and others poor? How does possession of natural resources affect a country's politics? In addition, students learn about fundamental principles and methods of comparative political analysis. Lastly, case studies of developing and industrialized countries around the globe help students apply abstract theories, concept, and methods and thereby develop strong analytical and critical thinking skills.

Muslim medieval inventions and advances have shaped Western science for hundreds of years. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Al-Haitham (Alhazen), al-Khawarizmi (Algorithmi), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were among the many Muslim scientists and philosophers who developed existing disciplines in astronomy, medicine, 399 mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and transferred ancient knowledge from the Middle East, Greece, China, and India to European cultures. The course explores various scientific attempts at an interpretation of the Qur'an and how those attempts shaped the Muslim perception of science in general. The course also touches upon modern debates within Islamic and applied science, particularly in the field of bioethics. Focusing on contemporary controversies, the course examines, for example, attempts by contemporary Muslim scientists and religious scholars to reconcile or disprove the theory of evolution.

Also, the U.S. refused to recognize both Israel's annexation of West Jerusalem and Jordan's annexation of East Jerusalem. After the 1967 War, Israel extended its control to Arab East Jerusalem and later declared all Jerusalem its eternal capital. Since then, American presidents have stopped short of pressuring Israel to abide by Resolution 181, arguing instead that the future of Jerusalem should be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. This course studies the complex history of the positions of modern American presidents on Jerusalem, focusing on how American domestic politics has shaped U.S. policy and the interactions between U.S. presidential administrations and international actors on the status of Jerusalem. cross listed: IREL 349 402 Faculty Rachel Whidden Associate Professor of Communication Chair of Journalism David Park Professor of Communication Chair of Cinema Studies Camille Yale Associate Professor of Communication Chair of Communication No major is currently available.

JOUR 275: Reporting and Translating News (Reporting and Translating News in French.) This course explores the elements of effective communication of news in French, and will include the study of traditional media (articles, reviews, reports, and interviews), as well as newer media (blogs, vlogs, etc.). Students learn to distinguish elements of journalistic style and perspective by studying a variety of news (and fake news) sources, and learn to convey information to a particular audience in French through structured, oral and written presentation of information and argument. Additionally, students engage in the practice of translating news reports and reviews from various disciplines including the sciences, business, the arts, and international politics. Specific translation strategies help students to advance their proficiency in understanding written and spoken French while developing specialized vocabulary and additional knowledge of francophone cultural contexts. Students enhance their skills at oral communication in French through discussion, interviewing, and presentation of researched information.

How do they present themselves? What does their clothing convey? What do their gestures suggest? How are their props significant? Are they \"being themselves\" or are they performing a different persona? How important is their performance to our perception of the music they play? Utilizing methodologies from the field of Performance Studies, we survey the history of rock 'n' roll starting with early performers such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix. We note the emergence of glam rockers in the early 70s such as David Bowie and Marc Bolan as well as shock rockers like Alice Cooper and Kiss.

MUSC 222: Grateful Dead and American Culture More than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight-Ashbury acid-testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan-soaked 1980s, and on to the jam-band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars. We'll understand the various subcultures that separate the sixties and now, and in doing so, offer answers to this key question: Why do the Dead survive?

There is no such thing as music production separate from identity. Because hip-hop is the dominant musical form of our time, and because it's widely viewed as a form of black music, we study it to flesh out American musical identity. In-class time consists of listening, lectures, discussions, quizzes, and midterms and final exams. Homework consists of readings and listenings. No prerequisites.

Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"Mozart Effect?\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a single human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music.

Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often- dead writers become part of our own brain-matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Jane Austen to Ian McEwan. Moreover, we consider the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" No Prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 249 NEUR 268: Music and the Mind In this course, we wrestle with fundamental questions regarding music and the human experience. Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"Mozart Effect?\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a single human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 372, PSYC 372, Brain: Mechanisms of Neural Plasticity) This course studies the remarkable fact that the brain is malleable or changeable. Neurons are constantly altering their behavior at a cellular and molecular level to help us learn, remember, and adapt to new situations. This neuronal plasticity is an essential mechanism of the normal functioning brain but, when plasticity is aberrant, disease is likely to occur. We will examine the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, probe current techniques utilized by researchers, and evaluate primary research articles. We will consider how plasticity contributes to the learning and encoding of new information throughout the lifespan, as well as how aberrant plasticity contributes to disorders such as post-traumatic stress, addiction, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. We also will explore how these disorders are currently treated with drugs and therapy.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) cross listed: BIOL 389, BMB 389 NEUR 420: The Neuroscience of Reward \"Reward\" is a concept with which most people are familiar: a hard-earned vacation at the end of a grueling work schedule, an A grade on a particularly challenging academic assignment, a good meal and a glass of wine after a long day's work. However, this everyday usage of the term belies its complexity. In this course, we will explore \"reward\" from behavioral and neurobiological perspectives, often focusing on associative learning paradigms that allow for careful dissection of appetitive and consummatory behaviors. We will consider the underlying neural circuitry that enables individuals to learn about rewards and cues that signal these motivationally significant events. Our analysis will emphasize the similarities and distinctions between natural reward and drug reward.

Lombardi Professor of Philosophy Emeritus Director, Ethics Center Requirements for the Major: A minimum of 9 credits are required for a Philosophy major. To allow students flexibility, there are two approaches to completing a Philosophy major. Students may (1) complete a traditional major or (2) concentrate on their particular philosophical interests or focus on courses that make connections to other studies. Courses taken Pass- Fail may count towards the major or minor in Philosophy. The requirements for the traditional major are: 1. Core Courses: Philosophy 156: Logic and Styles of Argument Three of the following five courses: o Philosophy 290: Ancient Greek Philosophy o Philosophy 291: Descartes to Kant o Philosophy 320: Back to the Themselves: Husserl, Heidegger, and Derrida o Philosophy 322: Hegel to Nietzsche Philosophy 489 o Philosophy 355: Wittgenstein and the Analytic Tradition Philosophy 305: Comparative Philosophy: East and West Philosophy 325: Major Ethical Theories 2. Electives: At least 2 additional Philosophy courses 3. Senior Studies: The Senior Studies Requirement can be fulfilled in any of the following ways: o Senior seminar o Independent research project o Senior thesis Option to develop a more focused major: Students who would like to focus more exclusively on a particular area of philosophy may (in consultation with their advisor and with the approval of the chair) substitute up to two different Philosophy courses for any of the Core Courses. Students can focus, for example, on (1) ethics, political philosophy, or social justice, (2) philosophy across cultures, or (3) metaphysics and philosophy of mind. Courses expected for various career interests: Philosophy is a valuable major for students interested in law school, not simply because issues about the law often emerge in philosophical discussion, but because the analytic, reading, and writing skills developed through the study of Philosophy are essential for success in law careers. Students interested in law school should take Phil 156 (logic) no later than their junior year. Note that students interested in law school should take Phil 156 even if they develop a major focusing on courses in law and political philosophy. Philosophy majors may also consider other graduate programs, e.g., MBA or MAT. Some undergraduate course work in fields related to these areas is important. A philosophy major serves students interested in graduate work in cultural studies or arts criticism; these students should take aesthetics, philosophy of literature, or philosophy of film. (Philosophy majors have often earned second majors, e.g., in Business or Economics. Those interested in Elementary Education can earn their second major in Philosophy.) Students interested in graduate school in Philosophy should complete a traditional major, including courses focusing on the approaches they seek to study: Students considering graduate school in Philosophy should take Phil 290, 291, and 322. For students interested in Continental philosophy, Phil 320 and/or some independent work in 20th century Continental approaches is essential. For students interested in analytic programs (the majority of graduate programs in the United States), coverage of 20th century analytic philosophy, in Phil 355, is needed. Phil 294 and 296 can also be considered. Further, some advanced work in logic (instead of or in addition to Phil 156) would be appropriate. Requirements for the Minor: At least 6 credits no more than 2 courses at the 100-level at least 2 courses at the 300-level Students considering a minor in Philosophy are encouraged to speak to a member of the Department, to plan their programs. 490 Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the Philosophy Department are: 1. Philosophy majors will be able to express themselves effectively and conscientiously, with rigor and fairness, in spoken and written forms that seek and promote respectful and fruitful dialogue on substantive and controversial issues. 2. Philosophy majors will be able to demonstrate perseverance and success in comprehending difficult texts and following the main lines of argument, including a basic understanding of logic and the ability to make sense of a number of diverse methodologies associated with philosophical positions. 3. Philosophy majors will be able to demonstrate familiarity with important periods in the history of philosophy, including important thinkers from the Eastern and Western traditions and a recognition of the ways different cultures have engaged in philosophical pursuits which then inform students' reflections on, e.g., what really exists, the nature of the human condition, concepts of social justice and the responsibilities of global citizenship, and the rational, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions of human existence. 4. Philosophy majors will develop a degree of expertise on specific philosophical themes of particular interest to them that demonstrate a real excitement, insight, and love for philosophical texts and debate. 5. Philosophy majors will be able to engage in creative philosophical efforts that assess and build on a body of foundational knowledge and ultimately develop their own insights and arguments. Philosophy Courses PHIL 110: Introduction to Philosophy Examination of perennial philosophical issues, such as questions about the nature of reality and how we can know it, discussions of human nature, the meaning of life, and our moral responsibilities. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 112: Civilization and Barbarism This course examines the issue of violence and its relation to cultural rules and principles. We look at violence from two angles: its destructive and generating power and the rich cultural meanings it reveals. We look at civilization as a system of rules that govern human conduct united under a highly selective set of guiding principles. The central theme of this course is to study how the pressure of violence will give rise to different rules of human conduct subsumed under a few major principles. We will study those rules and principles through the actions in order to gain a basic understanding of the fundamental ways culture and civilization shape human behavior. Not open to students who have taken FIYS 182. No pre-requisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 114: Intro to Phil: Asian Thought Introduction, through representative Asian thinkers from India, China, and Japan, to fundamental philosophical issues such as the nature and meaning of human existence, what true happiness is, and what is real. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 117: Political Philosophy By tracing the development of political philosophy from its roots in Greek philosphy through the social contract tradition to modern liberalism and critiques of colonialism, this course will examine a number of questions central to political philosophy. What is the state? What model of government is best? What is the nature of political rights? How do governments gain legitimate authority? Readings will include Socrates, Plato, Locke, Mill, Marx, Martin Luther King Jr., Rawls, Nozick, Chomsky, Churchill, and Galeano. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) 491 PHIL 118: Why Philosophy Matters We will examine ethical issues related to topics like killing, family, sex, race relations, and the state. Some of the questions we will explore include: Is killing in war wrong? Is abortion wrong? Is prostitution wrong? Is same-sex marriage wrong? Are reparations for slavery wrong? We will not only learn why philosophy matters when it comes to those views we hold most dear, but we will also learn how philosophers argue for their views and, in turn, how we should go about arguing for our own. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 120: BK's Finest: JAY-Z and Philosophy (Brooklyn's Finest: JAY-Z and Philosophy.) From growing up in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn to selling out concerts at Madison Square Garden, JAY-Z has become a global hip-hop icon. Besides being the first rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and holding the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist, JAY-Z's body of work stands as a monumental contribution to American culture. In this course, we explore the poetics and philosophy of JAY-Z's music. As we cultivate an artistic appreciation for JAY-Z's rap skills such as storytelling, wordplay, and delivery, we also treat his music as an opportunity to critically engage topics such as racism, sexism, and economic inequality. Finally, we watch several of JAY-Z's music videos as well as documentaries focused on his life and work. No prerequisites. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 120 PHIL 156: Logic and Styles of Arguments Focus on the 'rhyme and reason' of language. Examination of the reasons arguments are constructed in the ways they are. Investigation of informal, Aristotelian, and propositional logics, with readings from magazine articles, advertisements, and classical philosophers. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Quantitative Reasoning requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 200: Philosophy & Gender What is gender? Is it the same as one's sex? Is it inborn or learned? In this course, we'll investigate these questions, as well as how gender differences do or ought to change our theories of human existence and human good. A comparison of classical, modern, and postmodern treatments of the effect of gender on love, knowledge, and ethical obligation. Reading may include Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Mary Shelley, Freud, de Beauvoir, and Irigaray.

Attention will be given to the moral foundations for and limits on business activities, the idea of professional responsibility, and the relationship between professional and business obligations and general moral obligations. (Not recommended for first-year students.) (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Speaking requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 205: Medical Ethics The course will investigate the three primary strands of medical ethics: (1) issues of professional responsibility, such as confidentiality and informed consent, (2) moral dilemmas that arise in the course of treatment, such as decisions about euthanasia, and (3) public policy matters, such as universal health care. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 210: Environmental Ethics Examination of relationships between human beings and nature, drawing on literature, religion, and natural science as well as philosophy. What views have shaped our current perceptions, concerns, uses, and misuses of the natural 492 world? What creative alternatives can we discover? How can these be applied to the practical problems of environmental ethics? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ES 210 PHIL 212: Multicultural Approaches Environmnt The central theme of this course is Humans and Nature. We will examine various motifs in the creation myths from different cultures, the images of man and woman, the theme of primeval flood or its absence, the alienation of humans from nature, and the beliefs (e.g., Chinese numerology) in the synchronicity between human affairs and natural events. We will search for answers to the following typical questions: What is the definition of environment? What is and ought to be the relation between humans and nature? What count as 'environmental issues' and what are their possible solutions? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) PHIL 220: Philosophy of Education Survey of significant theories of education, introduction to philosophical analysis of educational concepts, and development of analytical skills applicable to clarifying and resolving pedagogical and policy issues. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Speaking requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: EDUC 220 PHIL 223: Does God Exist? This course considers arguments for and against the existence of God, as well as the resources and methods those arguments use. After some discussion of logic and argumentation, we will consider questions such as: how could one demonstrate that God does or does not exist? What would constitute 'proof' of such a claim? How are faith and reason working for similar or opposed ends in such arguments? What does the character of arguments for or against God's existence say about human life and thought? To address these questions, we will consider the works of theologians and philosophers from monotheistic traditions. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: RELG 223 PHIL 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues such as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a 'true' scientific theory, the basis of observation, and empirical knowledge. Consideration of ethical issues generated by scientific practice, the politics of technology, and current work on the sociology of scientific knowledge. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ES 225 PHIL 230: Philosophy and Literature The question of meaning in and of literature. The philosophical study of works by Aeschylus, Euripides, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Nabakov, Philip Roth, and Milan Kundera as well as the poetry of Dylan Thomas and Wallace Stevens. Critical theories of Nietzsche, Roland Barthes, and Jacques Derrida are used. (Not recommended for first- year students.) (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 233: Philosophy of Sport This course will consider a host of philosophical issues that arise as one ponders sport in general and sports in particular, ranging from definitional questions (e.g., what is a sport?), through general value theory (e.g., is sport valuable, and if so, in what way or ways - and to whom?), to questions of applied ethics and public policy (e.g., what is the justification, if any, for allowing athletes to shorten their life expectancies - sometimes quite dramatically - for the sake of glory or pay or both?). Although many of the questions we will consider may seem simple at first - what for example, is the significance of winning, if any? - on reflection they reveal themselves to be deep and puzzling. 493 The course will thus provide us with a concrete gate through which to access thorny philosophical questions about the nature of - and the complex interplay among - luck, effort, desert, intention, and result. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 235: Philosophy & 1960s Popular Culture This course offers a demanding tour through the intellectual milieu of the 1960s in the United States. We will read philosophical works, social theory, popular and literary fiction, and occasional pieces of various sorts (speeches, journalism, etc.); we will watch films and television shows; we will listen to music: all with the goal of figuring out not just how people in the 1960s were thinking, but also of understanding how philosophy and popular culture reflected and refracted each other during a particular - and particularly volatile - historical moment. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 237 PHIL 240: Philosophy of Law Survey of some main philosophical theories about the nature and justification of law, with intensive examination of several key philosophical problems as they arise in workings of the American legal system. Readings drawn from law and philosophy. (Not recommended for first-year students.) (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 242: Catastrophe & Risk: Phil Insurance (Catastrophe and Risk: The Philosophy of Insurance.) This course examines the institution of insurance philosophically. Beginning with a consideration of the problem of induction, and ranging over philosophical discourses about miracles, apocalypse, and the nature of prediction, the course ponders the ways in which the concept of rationality is shaped, both by our knowledge and by our ignorance. The course explores the concepts of risk and luck, considering the extent to which political and social institutions can and should be used as risk-pooling devices to soften the effects of catastrophe and to buffer the effects of luck. We also pay some attention to insurance law, to the relationship between entrepreneurial projections and actuarial calculations, and to representations of insurance in literature and film. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 245: Philosophy of Humans and Animals Western philosophers since Aristotle - at least - have claimed that human beings, as a species and alone among species, are capable of complex reasoning. From that premise, they have inferred a wide range of ethical and religious claims, e.g., it is ethically permissible to eat non-human animals. Alternative claims, however, have just as long a history, and in the last twenty or so years there has been a boom in the study of non-human animals and the relationships between humans and non-human animals. Not open to students who have taken Phil 420: Philosophy of Humans and Animals. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 250: Philosophy of Religion This course is an introduction to the philosophy of religion. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of religious experience, ritual, prayer, and sacred books in articulating the idea of God. Course includes a philosophical encounter with mysticism as well as the more traditional metaphysical formulations of the divine, in both the West and East. The critical concern of a variety of rational skepticisms will also be examined. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: RELG 250 PHIL 253: Philosophy of Self: East and West The course will examine how great thinkers from East and West, ancient and modern times, have tackled the relation between reason, passion, and desire. We will study Plato's tripartite model of the soul, the Stoic monism, especially Chrysippus' theory of desire, and various Eastern concepts such as self-overcoming, unselfing, and self-494 forgetting. We will also include some basic readings from the scientific discussions on mirror neurons and Antonio Damasio's writings on self and emotion. No prerequisites.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: ASIA 253, IREL 283 PHIL 255: Philosophy of Race and Racism This course examines philosophical approaches to race and racism. We pay special attention to the normative, metaphysical, and conceptual problems and solutions that inform philosophical race theory. Some of the key questions we answer include the following: Is race a natural kind, a social kind, or something else entirely? What does philosophy have to contribute to the study of race and racism? What is the relationship between race and racism? We draw on readings from the history of philosophy, mainstream analytic philosophy, and recent European philosophy. Ultimately, the aim of this course is to provide students with a philosophical toolkit that will allow them to engage in civil and informed critical discussions about the nature and consequences of race talk and the practice of racism. No prerequisites. (Not recommended for first-year students.) (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements.

His films challenge the stereotypes and paternalistic assumptions about African Americans that have become sacrosanct in America's popular imagination. We will explore how the aesthetic representation of race, class, and gender in Spike Lee's filmography have helped create a new genre of film called African American noir. In so doing, we will watch several of Spike Lee's films, documentary projects, and television ads. Ultimately, our goal will be to appreciate Lee's cinematic technique, examine his critique of white supremacy, and consider the cultural and historical events that have shaped his artistic vision.

Artworks in different media and historical periods will be used as occasions for reflection. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 265: Symbolic Logic PHIL 270: American Philosophy American philosophy has a rich and diverse history. With the sometimes conflicting commitments to principles and pragmatism as a focus, the course will investigate topics such as (1) early debates over American political institutions: human rights and democracy versus aristocratic leanings to ensure good government; (2) eighteenth- century idealism (e.g., Royce) and transcendentalism (focusing on moral principle, as reflected in Emerson and Thoreau); (3) American pragmatism in its various forms (Pierce, James, and Dewey); (4) Whitehead and process philosophy; and (5) contemporary manifestations (e.g., human rights, environmental concerns, technology, and struggles with diversity). (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 269 PHIL 275: Desire and Discipline: Asian Morals This course offers a focused historical narrative of the development of Asian moral thinking. It shows, at its early phase, how a particular moral philosopher's thinking (such as Mencius and Xun-zi) is largely determined by his thinking on human nature. However, in later periods, particularly after the importation of Buddhism, the debates on 495 human nature are replaced by an intense cognitive and metaphysical interest in the human mind. Moral cultivation begins to focus less on following moral rules but more on cultivating the mind. The effect of this nature-mind shift on Asian moral thinking is both historically profound and theoretically surprising. Readings: Confucius, Mencius, Xun-zi, Lao zi, Zhuang zi, Zhang Zai, Chen Brothers, Zhu Xi and D. T. Suzuki.

Examination of the perceived tensions between efforts to promote social justice and guarantees of individual freedom. Theoretical debates will be linked to practical issues, such as promotion of free markets versus government social programs and questions of government's legitimate role on personal issues, such as providing for gay marriage. Efforts to seek common ground will be explored. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ETHC 277, IREL 287 PHIL 280: Capitalism and Its Critics This course is an introduction to the philosophical and historical treatment of capitalism in its various and current guises, beginning with its origins in 9th-12th century European merchant culture to its current form in contemporary America. This course will explore the definitions of capitalism, the conditions of its historical emergence, the implications of the system for both wealth and welfare, and the contrasting merits or detriments when placed against competing systems. For instance, we will consider Marx's criticism of capitalism and various forms of communism as responses to the system's perceived shortcomings, Piketty's modern diagnosis of social inequality, and post- 2008 financial crisis critiques of the system. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 285: Topics in Japanese Thought The course focuses on the Japanese understanding of nature, life, and history. We will focus on the ideas of fragility, impermanence, and beauty. Students will learn the central ideas of Zen Buddhism. Topics to be covered may include artistic representations in Noh plays, Tea ceremonies, and the Samurai culture. Prerequisite: any course in Asian thought or permission of the instructor. . (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements.

The course will give a general survey of the main issues in philosophy of language of the twentieth century, including questions concerning the relations between meaning and truth, meaning and reference, language and thought, and meaning and meaningfulness. It will introduce some basic concepts and analytical apparatus in the three main branches of language study: semantics, syntax and pragmatics. Reading materials will cover writings by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein, Austin, Quine, Davidson, and Kripke. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 296: Philosophy of Mind With the rise of Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Neuroscience, questions about the nature of mind have become increasingly important, and in the last 40 years much work on philosophy of mind has been done in analytic philosophy. The class will begin with an examination of some of the most influential texts in philosophy of mind from the last 50 years, and then proceed to current topics. Central questions may include: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain?

Prerequisite: Declaration of the philosophy major or minor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) PHIL 301: Romantic Comedies & Phil of Love (Romantic Comedies and Philosophy of Love) Why do we like to watch romantic comedies? What's satisfying about them, even when they're not great films? Film theorist Leo Braudy claimed that 'genre [film] ... always involves a complex relation between the compulsions of the past and the freedoms of the present. ... [They] affect their audience ... by their ability to express the warring traditions in society and the social importance of understanding convention.' In this course, following Braudy, we will investigate the relationship between the film genre of romantic comedy and age-old thinking about love, marriage, and romance. We'll read some ancient and modern philosophy of love, as well as some relevant film theory, and watch and discuss an array of romantic comedies, trying to unpack what we really believe about love.

PHIL 330: History and Philosophy of Slavery An examination of American slavery and its aftermath from the slave ship to the Age of Neo-slavery. We will read slave narratives, historical accounts of slavery, and philosophical interpretations of slavery from the black radical tradition and contemporary philosophy. All three approaches will provide us with multiple angles from which to 498 consider the institution of slavery and America's supposed commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On the whole, our aim will be to wrestle with the tortured logic that is the tragic contradiction of American slavery and American freedom. Prerequisites: AFAM 110, one philosophy course, or permission of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: AFAM 330 PHIL 340: Philosophy Born of Struggle (Philosophy Born of Struggle: Introduction to African American Philosophy.) African-American philosophy can be defined in two ways: (1) wide-ranging philosophical work done by Americans of recent black African descent and (2) philosophical work on the lived experience of Americans of recent black African descent. We will primarily read philosophers whose philosophical work emphasizes the African-American experience. Thematically, the course will be guided by one overriding question: Given the historical reality of the Atlantic Slave Trade, the Three-Fifths Compromise, the anti-miscegenation laws, the Fugitive Slave Law, Lynch Law, and the Jim Crow laws, among many other inhumane practices, how does the experience of Africans in America constitute a unique combination of philosophical perspectives? Once we answer this question, we will understand how the African-American experience has created a new tradition in Western philosophy.

Significant time will be devoted to periodic student reports on their projects. Prerequisite: Ethics Center/Philosophy 276 or 277 or permission of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement.) PHIL 355: Wittgenstein & Analytic Tradition A brisk and demanding tour through the analytic tradition in philosophy, from its beginnings around 1880 with the pathbreaking work of Frege in logic and in the philosophy of language, through the empiricist reception of that work in England (Russell, Moore), the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle (Carnap, Neurath), and ordinary language philosophy (Austin, Ryle), until the tradition proper begins to break up around 1960. The course emphasizes epistemological, metaphysical, and linguistic concerns, with some attention to issues in logic and in the philosophy of science. The central figure of Wittgenstein provides the organization backbone of the course. In addition to the work of philosophers already mentioned, the course may also consider the work of Mach, Brentano, Ayer, Popper, Strawson, Quine, Sellars, and Putnam, among others. No prerequisite, but the prior completion of PHIL 156 is strongly recommended. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 365: Race, Gender & Sexual Orientation In this class we will examine a number of questions concerning the reality, or metaphysics, of social identities. When people speak of race, are they referring to something biological or something social? Are the gender roles of men and women shaped more by genetic forces or social forces? Is there a 'gay gene'? Does sexual orientation 499 have a genetic basis? After examining recent literature on the metaphysics of social kinds, we will examine the recent debates surrounding the nature of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Possible readings will include: Foucault, Searle, Hacking, DuBois, Appiah, Taylor, Sundstrom, Butler, and Longino. Prerequisite: at least one philosophy class or instructor's permission. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) PHIL 380: Topics PHIL 410: Major Philosophers (Spring 2018 Major Philosophers: Hobbes.) In this course, we will examine, in detail, Thomas Hobbes's arguments for a new conception of politics, put forth in his 1651 classic, Leviathan . Hobbes sought to inaugurate a modern science of politics, rejecting notions of legitimacy rooted in codes of honor, in divine revelation, or in Aristotelian human nature, arguing instead for a notion of political authority arising from universal human fear. We will consider how the goals of Hobbesian politics--peace and security--are related to Hobbes's commitments to nominalism, to materialism, and to secularism. We will also ponder the vexed question of Hobbes's relationship to liberalism. Although our focus will be on Leviathan, which we will read entire, we will make some attempt to situate Hobbes historically, and we will also discuss the influence of Hobbes on the theory of international relations and on contemporary political philosophy (e.g., Gautier, Hampton, Skyrms). Prerequisites:Three PHIL courses or consent of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 420: Plato: Eros, Sexuality, & Memory Fall 2016 Topic: Plato: Eros, Sexuality, & Memory. This course offers an in-depth look into Plato's concept of eros and his understanding of culture as a pursuit of knowledge, as the dynamic, communicative exchanges between equal and reciprocating citizens. A key topic has to do with the issue of memory (the vehicle of cultural transmissions) and the multifaceted impact on human condition from the proliferation of mnemotechnologies, such as writing (for Plato) and internet (for us). The general concern is quite basic: how shall we live and how shall we adapt to the world of iPhones and internet. Our focus will be on Plato's Phaedrus and Symposium, along with essays from other perspectives, such as those by Joseph Ledoux (a neuroscientist of the memory of fear) and Larry Squire (a memory psychologist), as well as excerpts from French philosophers Bernard Stiegler and Derrida. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 430: Plato, Kant, Freud In this seminar, we study Plato, Immanuel Kant, and Sigmund Freud in some depth, analyzing similarities and differences in their conceptions of mind, motivation, and action. Plato claims that the soul has three parts, which resemble Freudian components of the mind. Kant also takes the mind to have three faculties. All three thinkers, moreover, believe that this tripartite structure is the key to understanding human motivation and action. Others have noted these similarities: Alfred Tauber, for example, claims that \"Psychoanalysis . . rests upon a basic claims that Plato and Kant share a \"Constitutional Model\" of the soul, whereby \"deliberative action by its very nature imposes unity on the will.\" This course explores the similarities between the perspectives of these philosophers that on the surface seem very different. Prerequisite: Two philosophy courses or permission of the instructor. PHIL 440: Nietzsche Nietzsche's influence on the present age is undeniable. Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel, wrote the following to his wife in 1902: \"I am sending you Nietzsche: learn to read and understand him. This is the best and the finest thing I can send you.\" The composer Richard Strauss named his symphonic poem after Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Even Freud reluctantly acknowledged his debt to the German philosopher. This course examines the philosophical, religious, and literary influences on Nietzsche's thought as well as his affirmative response and alternative to traditional morality. Some of the key questions we answer include: What is the doctrine of the \"will to power\"? Who or what is an \u00dcbermensch? What is the eternal recurrence of the same? Prerequisites: Two philosophy courses or permission of the instructor. 500 PHIL 460: Cogn. Science & Experim. Philosophy (Cognitive Science and Experimental Philosophy.) This course introduces students to Experimental Philosophy. This area of philosophy uses the methods of cognitive science to conduct quantitative research in order to investigate philosophical questions. Experimental philosophers might ask, for instance, if there is something essential to the self over time, if judgments to philosophical thought experiments are culturally universal and representative, or if the consideration of alternative possibilities affects how we think about causation, intentionality, and free will. The course surveys work in Experimental Philosophy\u2014on the topics of intentionality, free will, consciousness, morality, causation, the true self, and more\u2014and considers the potential limitations of this approach to philosophy. Prerequisite: At least one 200-level course in philosophy, neuroscience, or psychology, or permission from the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 480: Heidegger's Being and Time This course is a reading- and writing-intensive study of Heidegger's major philosophical work Being and Time, published in 1927.

PHIL 130: Introduction to Cognitive Science Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. This project requires tools developed in experimental psychology, philosophy, computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and many other disciplines. This course introduces students to the major tools, theories, and findings from these disciplines' study of the mind. As such, it surveys various topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, learning, reasoning, attention, language, intelligence, decision-making, and morality. This is an introductory-level course. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.) PHIL 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues such as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a 'true' scientific theory, the basis of observation, and empirical knowledge. Consideration of ethical issues generated by scientific practice, the politics of technology, and current work on the sociology of scientific knowledge. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ES 225 PHIL 341: Existentialism and the Modern Novel Who am I? What is my place within the universe? Do human beings find or make meaning in their lives? Is meaning even possible in the face of life's absurdities? If so, what constitutes a meaningful life? This course explores these and other big existentialist questions through the lens of the novel, focusing especially on three novelists from the nineteenth and twentieth century: Fyodor Dostoevsky, Albert Camus, and Iris Murdoch. Within the course, we compare and contrast the existentialist perspectives of Dostoevsky and Camus as well as examining Iris Murdoch's 501 critique of existentialism. We also consider the unique possibilities afforded by the genre of the novel in exploring philosophical questions. Major readings include Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, Camus's The Plague, and Murdoch's Message to the Planet. Other readings are drawn from shorter fiction by these and other writers as well as major nonfiction essays on existentialism. Prerequisite: A 200-level literature course or permission of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 341 PHIL 386: Neurophilosophjy This course familiarizes students with topics in neurophilosophy\u2014i.e., the application of concepts and findings in neuroscience to traditional questions in philosophy. This course explores a range of such applications. For instance, what can the behavior of patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex tell us about theories of intentionality? What are the implications of neurological syndromes for the concept of a unified self? What can eye tracking teach us about causation? Can results from EEG studies inform theories of free will? This course reviews some of the newest methods and findings from neuroscience, primarily cognitive neuroscience, and apply these findings to some of the major questions in philosophy. Prerequisite: PHIL 130, PSYC 110, or permission from the instructor. 502 Faculty Michael Kash Professor of Physics Chair of Physics Amy Abe Senior Lecturer in Chemistry & Physics Janice Leonhardt Lecturer in Physics Nathan Mueggenburg Associate Professor of Physics Scott Schappe Associate Dean of Faculty and Professor of Physics Jeffrey Schmitz Lecturer in Physics Veronica Walkosz Visiting Assistant Professor of Physics Major and Minor in Physics Requirements for the Major: At least 9 credits in Physics, plus at least 3 credits in Mathematics 3 Mathematics courses, which are prerequisites for many upper-level Physics courses o Mathematics 110: Calculus I (corequisite for Physics 120) o Mathematics 111: Calculus II (corequisite for Physics 121) o Mathematics 210: Multivariable Calculus (corequisite for Physics 250) Physics 120: General Physics I Physics 121: General Physics II Physics 210: Modern Physics Physics 250: Analytical Mechanics Physics 310: Electricity and Magnetism I Physics 330: Thermodynamics Physics 420: Quantum Mechanics I at least 1 additional Physics course at the 200-level or above Physics 480: Senior Seminar in Experimental Methods Physics 503 Students intending to pursue graduate studies or other careers in physics are advised to enroll in more than the 9 courses required for the major. Tutorials may be undertaken in subjects not listed among the course offerings. Exposure to other sciences, especially Chemistry 115 and 116, and more advanced mathematics, especially Mathematics 214 and Computer Science 112, is strongly encouraged. Courses taken Pass-Fail may not count towards the major or minor in Physics. Requirements for the Minor: 3 Mathematics courses, which are prerequisites for many upper-level Physics courses o Mathematics 110: Calculus I (corequisite for Physics 120) o Mathematics 111: Calculus II (corequisite for Physics 121) o Mathematics 210: Multivariable Calculus (corequisite for Physics 250) Physics 120: General Physics I Physics 121: General Physics II Physics 210: Modern Physics Physics 250: Analytical Mechanics at least 1 additional Physics course at the 200-level or above NOTE PHYS 120 and PHYS 121 and MATH 110 and MATH 111 (or their equivalent) must be completed before the sophomore year (perhaps over the summer) to finish the physics major in 4 years. Students who have tried to complete a physics major starting in their sophomore year have run into significant problems, primarily because the upper-level requirements are offered in alternate years. PHYS 120/121 is recommended for science majors. If there are scheduling conflicts, PHYS 110 may be substituted for PHYS 120, and PHYS 111 may be substituted for PHYS 121. This change is not acceptable for engineering, however . Both courses have the same laboratories. PHYS 110/111 is not much easier than PHYS 120/121. MATH can be taken with PHYS 120/121. Occasionally, \"advanced\" first-year students have sufficient experience in physics to skip the 100-level courses. This is most easily confirmed by a score of 4 or 5 on a relevant Advanced Placement examination. Please consult a department member for placement of such students. Typically, the correct courses to take are PHYS 210 and MATH 210 in the fall, and PHYS 250 and MATH 214 (if offered) in the spring.

POLS 140: Intro to Comparative Politics (Introduction to Comparative Politics.) This course is an introduction to main concepts and theories of comparative politics. Students explore central questions of comparative politics research such as: under which conditions do authoritarian regimes persist or collapse? Why do some states succeed at democratization and others not? What causes democratic backsliding? Do variations in political institutions (constitutions, elections, party systems) matter and why? What are the causes and consequences of ethnic conflict and civil war? How do social movements get started? Why are some countries wealthy and others poor? How does possession of natural resources affect a country's politics? In addition, students learn about fundamental principles and methods of comparative political analysis. Lastly, case studies of developing and industrialized countries around the globe help students apply abstract theories, concept, and methods and thereby develop strong analytical and critical thinking skills. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: IREL 130 POLS 200: Methods of Political Research This course introduces students to the nuts and bolts of systematic political science research.

We begin with an overview of the origins and development of communism in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China. Then we examine and analyze the profound political, economic, and social changes in the former communist societies. Specifically, we explore economic transition from planned to market economy, democratization and persistence of authoritarianism, as well as nationalism and conflict. After taking the course, students are expected to understand the emergence and collapse of communism and political dynamics of post-communist transition, as well as to be able to identify key challenges facing post-communist states and critically evaluate their prospects for democratization.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: ASIA 207 POLS 214: Populism Populism is a political ideology that claims society is comprised of two antagonistic groups. The \"elite\" include career government officials, the media, and the very wealthy who command political power and use it to their advantage. By contrast, \"the people,\" who are law-abiding and hard-working citizens struggling to make ends meet, are essentially powerless and therefore ruled over and manipulated by an elite-controlled, out-of-touch government. Often associated with other ideologies, such as socialism, liberalism, and nationalism, populism advocates the empowerment of the people, whose righteousness will democratize politics and redirect the institutions of the state to serve the \"general will.\" In addition to exploring populism's core tenets from an ideational perspective, this course surveys core themes of populism that are found in the various sub-fields of political science (theory, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations). By doing so, it also considers populism's impact on politics and government within liberal democratic countries - developed, post-communist, and developing, as well as these countries' external relations. It also considers political reforms these countries might pursue to meet populism's challenge to liberal democracy. No Prerequisites.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: AMER 221 POLS 222: Congress A glance at the enumerated powers granted the legislative branch under the U.S. Constitution suggests Congress is the strongest of the three branches of the national government. Yet the power of Congress is divided between two chambers, and the vast majority of legislation proposed in either chamber never becomes law. Congress is supposed to represent the interests of the people of the various states - and yet its public standing is nowadays at an historic low. This course examines the basic operations, structure, power dynamics, and politics of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. It also considers the rivalry and relationship between Congress and the President. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: AMER 242 POLS 226: Public Policy Studies This course focuses on how public officials address policy problems, and why they select the solutions they do. We examine the public policymaking process, paying particular attention to the role played by political actors (elected officials, interest groups, governmental agencies) seeking to influence the tone and direction of policy. Attention will also be paid to how particular policy issues and problems gain (or fail to gain) the public's attention, including the role that political elites and the media play in agenda setting. Finally, the course assesses the effects of public polices on citizens' lives. In doing so, students will assume the role of \"policy analyst,\" learning how to write briefs in which they evaluate various policy reforms. In sum, students will gain the necessary tools to systematically assess when a public policy is achieving its desired goals and whether it is being implemented effectively and efficiently. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 227: Campaigns and Elections This course examines the nomination procedures and election of political candidates focusing on Congressional & Presidential campaigns.

This course explores the origins of the women's movement and how suffrage came to pass. It also looks at how women's political movements have evolved following suffrage, and how this milestone has paved the way for future advancement of women's rights. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Domestic Pluralism requirements.) POLS 230: Religion and Politics This course examines the complex social, historical, and intellectual forces that impact the relationships between religion and politics. Students begin by exploring the historical genealogy of Western ideas about the proper role of religion in the public square. We draw from various theoretical approaches in order to better understand particular conflict situations such as contemporary U.S. political debates on the role of religion in policy-making; the tension between Islam and democracy in Turkey; the head scarf debate in France; and the actions of Christian and Buddhist monks during the Vietnam War. We critically reflect on the role of religious ideologies as well as the ways in which religious explanations of politics and violence can obscure more enduring histories of power relations. No prerequisites.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 236: Religion and Politics in the USA This course focuses on the ways religion has been a source of political division and unity in America. Polls indicate that America is, by far, the most religious of industrial democracies and that our contentious political debates are, in large part, due to the religious dimensions of morally evocative issues like abortion and gay marriage, and the firm positions of such constituencies as the Christian Right and new Religious Left. Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage, and temperance drew on scholarly and legal interpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We examine the role of religion in the founding of the American republic, and in contemporary political movements such as Black Lives Matter, the Federation for Immigration Reform, and 21st century civil rights organizations, which address issues including prison reform, the environment, and the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

Populism is a political ideology that believes politics favors the interests of the \"elite\" and the \"establishment\" over those of the \"people.\" Populists therefore seek to reform government and use it as a mechanism to empower the people, who are virtuous and incorruptible. This course studies the origins and evolution of populism, its relationship to other political ideologies, including liberalism, conservatism, and socialism, and its place in contemporary politics in the developed and the developing worlds. Country case studies include the United States, France, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Brazil, the Philippines, and India. No prerequisites.

Through an examination of traditional political theorists, this course will explore the treatment of these issues, and how they affect other, more established political problems such as citizenship, property, and community. Current legal and practical problems involving families will inform and illuminate our perusal of political theorists' approach to the relationship between the private family and the state. Readings include selections from the Bible, Sophocles and Aristophanes, Plato and Aristotle, the Gospels, St. Augustine, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Tocqueville, Mill, Engels and others.

POLS 270: Race and Criminal Justice This course will examine the systemic racial injustices inherent in American criminal jurisprudence from police interaction to trial and sentencing, incarceration, and supervised release. Students will study how racial injustice continues to pervade the American criminal justice system despite the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. How do so many players, from police officers to judges and juries, fail to protect against racial injustice? Why do courts, when confronted with allegations or proof of racially motivated police misconduct, overwhelmingly cite \"harmless error\" doctrine? To attempt to answer these complicated questions, students will learn legal criminal procedure, study 4th, 5th, 6th and 8th amendment case law, and have an opportunity to listen to and speak with a variety of professionals in the criminal justice field.

A driver in the contemporary evolution of many areas of law and overarching constitutional culture is the perceived need to protect national security. Most innovations and developments in national security law, however, encroach upon the foundational, individual civil rights enshrined in the very same constitutional system we seek to safeguard. This course will examine the constitutional balance of national security power among the branches of government, the components of the the intelligence/national security state today, and the tensions between its operation and personal rights and liberties.

POLS 324: Public Opinion This course will offer a broad-based introduction to the factors that motivate citizens' social and political attitudes. We will begin by discussing how we conceptualize and measure public opinion, from where do opinions or attitudes originate, what factors influence citizens' preferences, and whether political elites respond to public opinion when making public policy. We will investigate public opinion on a wide range of political issues, from taxes and government spending to attitudes about racial equality. Finally, we will take up important normative questions including the role that public opinion should or should not play in the American political system. Prerequisite: POLS 120 or permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 328: The 2020 Presidential Primaries (Topics in American Politics.) Spring 2020 Topic: The 2020 Presidential Primaries. The 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign is shaping up to be long, intense, and competitive. It is therefore obviously worthy of serious study. In this course, we undertake such a study in real-time. But rather than merely track the day to day 523 machinations of the campaign, our goal will be to try and analyze the situation as a political scientist would. As examples, we will ask: What is the 'invisible' primary and can it be measured? To what extent do party rules concerning the nomination contest shape the ultimate outcome? What are the most successful tactics and strategies for persuading voters and building a winning coalition? Prerequisite: POLS 120 or permission of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) POLS 340: International Terrorism The central aim of this course is to critically examine the phenomenon of terrorism. In so doing, we will adopt the following approach: (i) we will briefly analyze the concepts of security and violence; (ii) we will discuss the etymology of the concept \"terrorism.\" (iii) We will explore the idea of terrorism as an instrumentally rational undertaking. Parallel to this we will read a sample of articles from the positive political science literature on terrorism. (iv) We will examine the morality of terrorism as refracted through the lens of the rich theorizing on just war and will carefully investigate the philosophy literature on terrorism. Finally (v) in light of the foregoing theoretical examination, we will examine the U.S.-led \"war on terror.\" Prerequisite: POLS 110.

Students learn about the emergence of the specialized field of \"security studies,\" which focused on Cold War-era, military issues like conventional and nuclear deterrence. They then consider the more recent transformation of the field's scope to include both these traditional issues and new issues - both military and non-military in nature, such as proliferation, intra-state conflict, terrorism, environmental degradation and climate change, displaced populations, and infectious diseases. Prerequisites: Politics 110 (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.) cross listed: IREL 343 POLS 344: Gender and Sexuality in IR (Gender and Sexuality in International Relations.) This course explores the intersection of gender and sexuality with a variety of topics in international relations, such as conflict and war, global political economy, development, human rights, population policy, and global health. It examines how feminist and queer theories of international relations shed new light on existing areas of research, and how they generate new puzzles for political scientists to study. This course considers a wide range of cases from around the world, with particular attention to those from the Global South. Prerequisite: POLS 110 or consent of instructor.

Organized around major policy debates, we explore themes including women in the labor force, women in politics, gender and development, inequality, and violence. We also learn about top-down change, instituted by organizations like the IMF and World Bank, and bottom-up solutions created by NGOs and social entrepreneurs. Through class readings, group discussions, small group work, presentations, and a research paper, students are able to identify forms of existing gender inequalities, and critically examine policy solutions.Prerequisite: POLS 110 or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Global Perspectives requirements.) cross listed: GSWS 349 POLS 350: Liberty The concept of individual liberty is a relatively modern one; its development began with the English Enlightenment. In this course, we will examine liberty as it relates to markets, individual rights, conflicts between equality and freedom, and conflicts between governmental authority and individual freedom. Must markets be completely free in order to claim economic freedom? Does freedom require a government to protect an individual's autonomy? Can there be a balance between individual liberty and communal good? Course readings are likely to include Hobbes, Locke, Smith, Publius, Tocqueville, Marx, Mill, Hayek, Friedman, and Rawls, among others. Pre-requisite: POLS 130 or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 351: Justice and the Law Political societies must make all manner of judgments about what is just. We must distribute goods, determine crimes, give punishments, and create legislative districts, all with an eye to some idea of justice. Is justice fairness? Proportional? Equitable? Different political and legal theorists have approached these questions differently. Using both traditional political theory texts and contemporary legal theory, we will explore questions of justice and the law and whether justice can be found within the law or is external to it. Readings include those by Plato, Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke, Thoreau, Mill, King, Rawls, Gunier, and contemporary legal theorists. Prerequisite: POLS 130 or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 352: Liberalism and Its Critics Modern political thought is based on ideas of equality, individuality and individual liberty, private property, and an overall idea of progress. These ideas developed especially in the thinking of Locke, Smith, and Mill. But as modernism grew, so did its critics. The course covers some basic theories of modernism through readings in the liberal tradition. It also considers opposition to liberalism as found in the writings of Burke, Rousseau, Tocqueville, 525 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Marcuse, Arendt, and contemporary anti- and postmodernists. Prerequisite: POLS 130 or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 353: Topics in Political Theory (POLS 353 Topics in Political Theory: The Social Contract) Throughout the history of political thought, the metaphor of the social contract, or the idea that the consent of individuals is necessary for the formation of legitimate government, has been widely used to justify and/or criticize certain institutional arrangements. This course will be an examination of this metaphor. We will try to come to terms with both its philosophical appeal as well as its historical relevancy. In addition to reading classic texts of those like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Rawls, we will also compare the models of these authors with actual processes of constitutional formation including the American Founding. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 355: Dictators, Despots, and Tyrants This course is an examination of the ideological underpinnings of modern dictatorships, their politics, and how they organize the institutions of the state. It begins with an examination of twentieth century dictatorships, including Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, and Communist China. It then considers contemporary dictatorships in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Students are introduced to source materials including pamphlets authored by dictators and a variety of films from different genres. The course underscores the political commonalities and differences among dictatorial regimes over time and across regions. It also explores how modern-day dictatorships and their leaders have shown remarkable resilience against the forces of globalization and political liberalization.

Prerequisite: POLS 130 or permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 358: Democratic Theory Almost everyone seems to be in favor of democracy, but there is considerable disagreement about what democracy means and why it might be worthy of our support. In this course, we seek to understand the concept of democracy from a variety of different historical, philosophical, and empirical perspectives. Examples of questions to be covered include: What is the relationship between democracy and the protection of individual rights? How responsive should democratically elected representatives be to their constituents? Are ordinary citizens knowledgeable enough to participate effectively in democratic politics? Prerequisite: Politics 120 or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 361: The First Amendment In this course students explore the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of freedoms of speech (including obscenity and libel), assembly and association, the press, and the exercise and establishment of religion.

POLS 397: Political Ecology Political ecology examines the politics of the environment, exploring ways politics affects the environment and, conversely, the environment politics. This course expands our understanding of politics to examine the roles of human and non-human political actors in environmental change, environmental knowledge acquisition and dissemination, and environmental inequalities. With global inequality as a central concern, we consider topics such as global \"villagization\" in Tanzania, development projects in India, agrarian reforms in the global south, and effects of land loss on Cajuns, Native Americans, and African-Americans in Southern Louisiana. We also look carefully at the concept of agency and explore how much it is possible to expand our notions of agency to non-human 527 environmental entities, such as animals, plants ecosystems, and genes. Possible topics include cows, cotton, the Mississippi River, and carbon. Prerequisite: Any 200-level course in ES, ENGL, PHIL, or POLS. .

This course is a practicum aimed at engaging students in the process of scholarly peer-review, academic journal production, and print and digital publishing. Students learn how to use InDesign, an important software suite for visual communication. This 0.25 credit course is graded on a Pass-Fail basis and requires enrolled students to complete forty (40) hours of work as Editorial Board members while contributing to the production and selection of feature essays, peer review, editing, layout and formatting of the journal, and release of the journal at the annual publication party. Inter-Text aims to publish exceptional student work and foster community among students inside and outside of the classroom in the humanities and social sciences. cross listed: HIST 399, ENGL 399, ART 399 POLS 480: Presidential Power (Senior Seminar in American Politics and Law: Presidential Power) Students in this senior seminar explore the growth in executive power relative to the legislative and judicial branches of the federal government. Our examination begins with President Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. It continues with his successor, Richard Nixon, who, according to some people, epitomizes the concentration of executive power. Though Nixon's resignation signals the end of an 'imperial presidency,' under President Reagan the executive branch's consolidation of power is renewed. The experiences of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s are a backdrop for the study of the expansion of executive power under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Prerequisite: POLS 120 or permission of instructor. Open to Politics majors and minors in the third or fourth year. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 481: Revolutions and Global Development (Senior Seminar in Global Politics: Revolutions and Global Development) Social movements and political transformations constitute the critical dynamics of the contemporary international system. This senior seminar exposes students to key concepts, theories and empirical case studies in struggles for democracy and resistance against dictatorships in the modern world. We will critically analyze some of the goals of popular uprisings, peasant insurgencies, and popular mass mobilizations, and their effects on the geo-strategic configurations of power among major nation states. Utilizing regional case studies from England, France, Russia, China, Iran, Algeria, South Africa, etc., students will debate the scholarship on social change, economic development, and the imperatives of political democratization in the quest for power and prestige. We will also consider conflict and cooperation in the globally interdependent world system. This course is the capstone experience for fourth year politics and international relations majors. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 482: Affirmative Action (Senior Seminar in American Politics and Law: Affirmative Action) Affirmative action in employment and education is one of the most controversial issues of our time. As such, it transects many subfields of political science: political theory, American political institutions, elections, law and constitutionalism, public opinion, comparative politics. Affirmative action policies bring to light American attitudes toward race, gender, sexual identity, and ethnicity. The course begins with a study of the foundational legal, ethical and political issues of affirmative action. Students then pursue their own, specialized projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Speaking requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) 528 POLS 483: Democratic Peace & War Senior Seminar in Global Politics: Democratic Peace and War. Do liberal democracies conduct their external relations differently than dictatorships? If so, how, why, and to what result? These questions taken together constitute a central focus of international relations scholarship. This course finds its intellectual foundations in Immanuel Kant's thesis that liberal democracies at once enjoy a 'separate peace' amongst themselves and act belligerently toward dictatorships. Students in this senior seminar survey a rich literature on the 'democratic peace' thesis through the lenses of realist, liberal, and constructivist international relations theory, through reference to in- depth case studies and large-scale data analysis. In their seminar papers, students apply these theories and methods to their research on current foreign policies issues among democracies and between democracies and dictatorships. Prerequisite: Open to international relations and politics juniors and seniors only. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 484: Searches, Seizures, and Security (Senior Seminar in American Politics and Law: Searches, Seizures, and Security). The right against government intrusion into our lives is one of our most cherished freedoms found in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution. The framers believed that agents of government should not enter private homes or search personal property without justification. Yet now, government entities and corporations have access to our personal information raising questions of how current law, politics, and security issues at home and abroad reshape constitutional boundaries of our right to privacy. This course begins with a study of the Fourth Amendment and constitutional rights and limitations of search and seizure and continues with a review of current law affecting our national security. This course is a capstone course for politics majors and students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 485: Constitutional Change (Senior Seminar in American Politics & Law: Constitutional Change). While the United States may have the oldest written Constitution in the world, it has been subject to nearly constant change since the moment it was ratified. In addition to formal amendments including the Bill of Rights, our constitutional institutions and culture have been significantly modified and affected by Supreme Court opinions, presidential decisions, legislative constructions, and even citizen-based protest movements. In this seminar, we explore the question of how constitutional change has actually happened in our nation's past, and assess whether some of these procedures and mechanisms of change are better or worse than others. We will then conclude by evaluating a variety of contemporary proposals for constitutional reform. Students will thereby be invited to think both descriptively and morally about the history and future of American constitutionalism. As a capstone course for politics majors, students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 486: Global Justice Virtually all of the major pressing and controversial debates in international politics revolve on some level around questions of justice: When is humanitarian intervention justified? Are certain tactics of war morally unjustifiable? Are human rights universal ideals that should apply everywhere, or should they be limited by certain cultural and/or religious traditions? How should distributive justice work at the global level? Does justice require that rich countries allow for more immigration? Do we need a world state? In this senior seminar, students will probe these and other questions. We will examine these issues from a variety of perspectives, including ones that are skeptical about the very idea of 'global justice.' As a capstone course for politics and international relations majors, students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Junior or senior politics and/or international relations majors, or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives and Speaking requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) 529 POLS 487: Money, Equality and Power This course investigates some of the ways that money may (or may not) increase inequality in American politics. Money is very unequally distributed in America today. We discuss how income or wealth inequality affects our democracy, and how we can tell. Since the Supreme Court has set down complex rules governing the use of money in politics, we also discuss what can be done to address inequality even if it does produce undesirable results. In this course, students explore many other important and fascinating issues at the intersection of money and politics. The topic intersects with many areas of politics: political theory, American political institutions, law and constitutionalism, and campaigns and elections. It allows students the opportunity to select, for intense study, an area of special interest pertaining to the above themes. Prerequisites: Junior or Senior standing, declared Politics major or permission of instructor.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) PSYC 388: The Malleable Brain (The Malleable Brain: Mechanisms of Neural Plasticity) This course studies the remarkable fact that the brain is malleable or changeable. Neurons are constantly altering their behavior at a cellular and molecular level to help us learn, remember, and adapt to new situations. This neuronal plasticity is an essential mechanism of the normal functioning brain but, when plasticity is aberrant, disease is likely to occur. We will examine the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, probe current techniques utilized by researchers, and evaluate primary research articles. We will consider how plasticity contributes to the learning and encoding of new information throughout the lifespan, as well as how aberrant plasticity contributes to disorders such as post-traumatic stress, addiction, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. We also will explore how these disorders are currently treated with drugs and therapy. Prerequisites: BIOL 221 and PSYC 110 or permission of the instructor. cross listed: NEUR 388, BIOL 388 541 PSYC 410: History and Systems of Psych This course overviews psychological thought and methodology from the emergence of the discipline out of philosophy and the natural sciences to the social science we know today. You will learn about prominent psychological theories and methodologies from a historical perspective. A major focus will be on experimental psychology as it began in 19th century German universities and continued in the United States. The other main focus will be on the development of applied fields such as clinical psychology and industrial/organizational psychology. We will read original works by significant historical figures in psychology, as well as papers by historians. Special attention will be given to the recurring controversies that have fueled debate and motivated research on the nature and origins of human behavior and mental processes. In addition, you will be introduced to the process of historiography, i.e. the theory and methods that underlie the research and writing of history.

However, this everyday usage of the term belies its complexity. In this course, we will explore \"reward\" from behavioral and neurobiological perspectives, often focusing on associative learning paradigms that allow for careful dissection of appetitive and consummatory behaviors. We will consider the underlying neural circuitry that enables individuals to learn about rewards and cues that signal these motivationally significant events. Our analysis will emphasize the similarities and distinctions between natural reward and drug reward.

Methods for examining how religious thinking intersects with everyday decisions arising in relation to social, cultural, political, and philosophical issues. Religion Courses RELG 105: Yoga: Culture, Theory, and Practice What is the history of yoga, from ancient Asian religious origins to contemporary Western body culture? Taking a multidisciplinary approach towards the cultural, philosophical, and physical practices that we call yoga, this course analyzes a range of media from written texts and documentary films to Instagram and reality television. Each class meeting consists of both seminar discussion and a firsthand exploration of postures, meditation, and mindfulness. Topics include colonialism, orientalism, and cultural appropriation in yoga's history, a comparative analysis of the Indian yogic subject and the Western modern subject, and their distinctive concepts of body, mind, and spirit. We ask what a \"yoga body\" looks like, from Lululemon and yoga as a competitive sport to the body positivity and disability rights movements, and consider how #metoo is precipitating change in the yoga world. We also explore the emergent scientific discourse around yoga, meditation, and mindfulness. No prerequisites. RELG 110: Intro to the Study of Religion (Introduction to the Study of Religion.) Have you ever wondered what it's like to be an agent of change at a pivotal time in history? Do you have what it takes to ignite the imagination of others, to inspire and to lead, or to be a poet of revolutionary change? In this course, you learn about the academic study of religion and examine how religious texts are interpreted in specific contexts in pivotal moments in time while participating in historical role-playing games, which use an innovative methodology called Reacting to the Past. Students research and articulate opinions of historical characters (e.g. Mahatma Gandhi, Joan of Arc, Galileo, Darwin, Anne Hutchinson, Henry VIII), while learning to express themselves with clarity, precision, and force. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives and Speaking requirements.) RELG 118: Comparative Religious Ethics This course introduces the sources and patterns of moral reasoning within different religious traditions, both Western and non-Western. Participants compare arguments advocating specific positions on such issues as the morality of war, nature of corporate ethics, treatment of the environment, bio-ethical decision-making, rights of animals within a society, and the responsibility of government to protect its constituents.

RELG 180: Religion, SciFi, and Fantasy (Religion, Science Fiction, Fantasy) Of the literary genres, perhaps science fiction and fantasy best allow creative artists to imagine real and possible answers to the deep religious questions that have historically driven philosophers, theologians, and thinkers. Who are we? What do we want? Where did we come from? How does everything end? What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? In this class we examine science fiction and fantasy short stories, motion pictures, novels, and television programs to ask how creative artists and wider society have asked and answered these questions. We also consider how science fiction and fantasy have commented on and mirrored real-world religions. No prerequisites. Intended for first-year students and sophomores only.

As an introduction to the relationship between Islam and science from both historical and contemporary perspectives, this course examines the major contributions of medieval Muslim scientists and their influence on modern science. Muslim medieval inventions and advances have shaped Western science for hundreds of years. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Al-Haitham (Alhazen), al-Khawarizmi (Algorithmi), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were among the many Muslim scientists and philosophers who developed existing disciplines in astronomy, medicine, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and transferred ancient knowledge from the Middle East, Greece, China, and India to European cultures. The course explores various scientific attempts at an interpretation of the Qur'an and how those attempts shaped the Muslim perception of science in general. The course also touches upon modern debates within Islamic and applied science, particularly in the field of bioethics. Focusing on contemporary controversies, the course examines, for example, attempts by contemporary Muslim scientists and religious scholars to reconcile or disprove the theory of evolution.

We traverse a wide range of material, covering topics from animism to politics and ecology while paying particular attention to the religious sensibilities that inflect everyday belief, practices, and social relations. In this process, we think about assumptions underlying ancestral worship and indigenous socio-ecological relationships, such as those presented in the animated films of Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke). In addition, we analyze deep-rooted cultural motifs set in stories of old and new manga, classic and maverick. All the readings and class discussions will be in English.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) RELG 211: Global Judaism This course explores the origin, development, and contemporary life of Judaism. We will focus on how both ancient and contemporary Judaism emerge from a mix of different cultural and social forces, and how this religion has been shaped by thousands of years of spread (diaspora) throughout the globe. We consider texts, practices, and community developments, and look at Judaism as not just a historical religion but one that continues to develop and change today. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) RELG 212: Global Christianity This course explores the origin, development, and contemporary state of Christianity with reference to the many cultures and societies that have shaped it, the world's largest religion. We begin with the origin and early development of Christianity within the context of ancient Judaism and the Roman Empire. We consider the development of Christianity into its many contemporary forms, and focus throughout the class on how Christianity is practiced throughout the world. We pay special attention to how Christianity has developed in places unfamiliar to most Americans, such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Malcolm X (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so often put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle-whether it be through the message of non-violence and Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self-defense and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malcolm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular in style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featured by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to delve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle in America. We will look at the creative activist writings of each-speeches, letters, interviews, autobiographical material-and complicate what at first seems a simple battle between \"violent\" and \"non-violent\" approaches to liberation.

This course considers arguments for and against the existence of God, as well as the resources and methods those arguments use. After some discussion of logic and argumentation, we will consider questions such as: how could one demonstrate that God does or does not exist? What would constitute 'proof' of such a claim? How are faith and reason working for similar or opposed ends in such arguments? What does the character of arguments for or against God's existence say about human life and thought? To address these questions, we will consider the works of theologians and philosophers from monotheistic traditions.

Delving into epics, hymns, women's songs, animated films, scholarly articles, and observation of contemporary religious practices, we ask whether stories of Hindu goddesses empower women or serve the interests of a patriarchal culture. Through a variety of approaches, we investigate how women and men experience, negotiate, and subvert constructions of gender, femininity, and masculinity. The course culminates in a role-playing game, which uses an innovative methodology called Reacting to the Past to delve into legislation on Sati (ritual widow-burning) in colonial India. Students research and articulate opinions of historical characters, while learning to express themselves with clarity, precision, and force and developing their public speaking skills.

Students begin by exploring the historical genealogy of Western ideas about the proper role of religion in the public square. We draw from various theoretical approaches in order to better understand particular conflict situations such as contemporary U.S. political debates on the role of religion in policy-making; the tension between Islam and democracy in Turkey; the head scarf debate in France; and the actions of Christian and Buddhist monks during the Vietnam War. We critically reflect on the role of religious ideologies as well as the ways in which religious explanations of politics and violence can obscure more enduring histories of power relations.

RELG 236: Religion and Politics in the USA This course focuses on the ways religion has been a source of political division and unity in America. Polls indicate that America is, by far, the most religious of industrial democracies and that our contentious political debates are, in large part, due to the religious dimensions of morally evocative issues like abortion and gay marriage, and the firm positions of such constituencies as the Christian Right and new Religious Left. Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage, and temperance drew on scholarly and legal interpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We examine the role of religion in the founding of the American republic, and in contemporary political movements such as Black Lives Matter, the Federation for Immigration Reform, and 21st century civil rights organizations, which address issues including prison reform, the environment, and the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

RELG 245: Martyrdom in Early Christianity (Faithful to the Very End: Martyrdom in Early Christianity) Looking at early Christian teachers and narrative accounts of martyrs' deaths, this course examines the underlying logic and hopes encouraging these martyrs to make the ultimate sacrifice. Perhaps as early as Saint Steven, only a few years after the death of Jesus and continuing for centuries thereafter, remarkable Christians willingly underwent profound humiliation and excruciating pain in stubborn refusal to compromise their faith in a crucified messiah. The course focuses on the first three centuries of Christian history, tracing the political circumstances leading to the martyrs' deaths, and the ways in which they planted the seeds to become themselves objects of veneration in later periods through the present day.

This course examines how succeeding immigrant groups have practiced and lived their Catholic faith in different times and places. Religion cannot be separated from the larger social and economic context in which it is embedded, so the course will also pay attention to the ways in which the social and economic conditions that greeted the immigrants on their arrival shaped how they went about praying and working. Finally, the changing leadership of the Catholic Church will be taken into account, since it provided the ecclesiastical framework for the new Catholic arrivals.

How does group affiliation affect identity? What is the relationship between identity and change? How does faith in God influence understanding of the individual? This course considers the following topics: medieval conceptions of the individual in Christian autobiography; the role of the body and gender in determining identity (exploring topics such as the Eucharist, the cult of saints, and sex difference); how medieval Europeans defined their own identity by persecuting the 'other,' including heretics, Jews, and lepers; how change affected identity in medieval texts such as werewolf stories and resurrection theology.

SOAN 215: Archaeological Field Methods Archaeological Field Methods introduces students to the discipline of archaeology, with an emphasis on fieldwork and excavation. Students will serve as the field crew on an archaeological dig in Lake Forest, with lectures, readings, workshops, and field trips providing the theoretical and historical context for the archaeological methods. Students will learn excavation, recording, laboratory and analytical techniques via some traditional coursework, but most significantly, through participation. Students will have the opportunity to experiment with these techniques, 566 discuss the implications of their findings, and compare them with the research and ideas of professional archaeologists. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 or equivalent. Corequisite: This course has an additional weekly lab session (2 hrs). Not open to students who have taken SOAN 205.

The course considers the history of the discipline and its theoretical underpinnings, then looks at how archaeologists create research designs, discover and excavate sites, analyze artifacts and features, and disseminate their findings. It also introduces a series of spatiotemporally diverse archaeological case studies, calling on the students' understanding of basic archaeological concepts while emphasizing the ways that archaeological practice and museum display necessarily engage with political and social movements. Special attention is paid to how the archaeological record captures experiences of people of color, women, working class people, and those who are not literate. Multiple examples interpreted via material remains introduce students to the complexity of human experiences within a framework of cultural relativism. Field projects, in-class activities, and films supplement traditional lectures. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.

SOAN 217: Sociology of Work (Offered Less Frequently)The meaning of work, with emphasis on sociological concepts such as stratification, power, quality of life, and organization in the social world. Focus will be both on cross-cultural comparisons of the social definition of work and on the organization of work in the United States including types of occupations, power distribution within occupations, and changes in the workforce. Participant-observer studies will provide comparisons of the work worlds of pink-, blue-, and white-collar workers. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) SOAN 220: Domains of Human Evidence Anthropology literally translates to the study of man, and the discipline takes humankind as its object. This course explores the four distinct ways in which anthropologists have sought to understand humans: 1) as animals whose potential and limits are set by their physiological qualities (physical anthropology); 2) as material workers who shape and are shaped by their environment and who leave their mark on the landscape (archaeology); 3) as cultural creatures who collectively produce ways of interacting with and imposing meaning on the world and one another (socio/cultural anthropology); 4) as language bearers who mediate their experience with complex grammars and symbol systems (linguistic anthropology). These domains of evidence are key to developing an in depth understanding of what anthropology can do, and this course is foundational for upper level anthropology courses.

This course explores the origins and history of Muslims living in the US today. Studying the history of African American, immigrant, and convert communities, we address issues of identity, religious practice, integration, and assimilation. The course also examines such contemporary topics as the diversity within religious interpretations and views of Muslim communities, including perceptions of extremism and Islamophobia. Participants look at trends in Muslim-American culture and lifestyle, politics, and gender relations as seen in contemporary social media. No prerequisites.

This hands-on course introduces archaeological laboratory methods and accompanying archival and research-based techniques for interpreting these \"artifacts of modernity\": excavated materials from ongoing archaeological projects of historic-period sites in the Chicago area. Students will be exposed to various stages of artifact processing on a collection from a recently excavated site, including: washing, sorting, identification, data entry, analysis, report preparation, and curation. Students will learn how to identify 19th- and 20th-century artifacts--American, British, French, Japanese, Chinese, and other--representing a broad range of materials from the daily lives of past peoples/past societies. The artifact analysis will allow students to develop skills useful for museum, laboratory, and/or archaeological settings. Prerequisite: SOAN 205 OR SOAN 215 OR SOAN 220 OR consent of instructor.

We transition from our cross-cultural overview to focus on the Western conceit of mind-body dualism and its effects. This dualism makes sports a site for the reproduction of existing power dynamics of race and gender, but it also makes sports a realm of liberatory potential (cf Jackie Robinson, Title IX). Students in this course should expect to follow sports events throughout the semester and should be prepared for field assignments.

SOAN 231: Histories & Cultures Latin America This course introduces students to modern historical, ethnohistorical, and anthropological approaches to the indigenous populations of Latin America. The course will focus on the conflict and crisis that have characterized the relationship between the native inhabitants of the New World and the Old World immigrants and their descendants whose presence has forever changed the Americas. This conflict, and the cultures that emerged from it, will be traced both historically (starting with the \"conquest\") and regionally, focusing on four distinct areas: central Mexico; Guatemala and Chiapas; the Andes; and the Amazon.

The course begins from the idea of embodied experience - how does the city sound, smell, look, feel? Students learn how social structures, historical processes, cultural practices, and city organization intersect to affect how welcoming or forbidding different neighborhoods are perceived to be - and by whom. Using theoretical and field developed insights, analyzing data, and deploying technological skills learned in the course, students conclude the course by crafting map-based tours about different aspects of Chicago.

SOAN 239: Social Movements and Society Social movements have contributed to significant changes in modern society. The civil rights movement brought greater equality to African Americans; the Women's Liberation movement created an expansion of rights for women; anti-war and disarmament protests contributed to the end of the Vietnam war and the end of the arms race; and the environmental movement drew our attention to deforestation, climate change, and species loss. This course examines why people participate in social movements, when social movements emerge, which social movements succeed or fail in mobilizing constituents, how they are organized, how mass media influences movements, and why movements ultimately decline. Special attention will be paid to how social movements influence and are influenced by the social context in which they emerge, with the goal of better understanding a significant force of societal change.

SOAN 240: Deviance How society defines deviants - its outcasts and outsiders - and how the people so defined respond to this categorization; the nature of normal and abnormal, legal and illegal. Do these categories have absolute moral meaning, or do they always depend on the particular society and era in which they are defined? Topics to be addressed include stigma and stereotyping, cross-cultural variations in gender roles, the status of the inmate, deviance as blocked opportunity, and the political mobilization of outsiders.

SOAN 242: Cults, Sects, and Communes This course provides an introduction to the study of new religious movements, popularly called sects and cults, and the communal movements that are their more secularized cousins. We will consider several case studies and examine the wider phenomenon of such groups in the modern world. We will pay attention to the traditional sociological issues of leadership, charisma, conversion, and belief maintenance, as well as the lived practices and experiences of members of such groups, such as rituals, gender practices, and holidays.

For much of the world, the privileging of schooling as a site of education has had real ramifications on the possibility of maintaining cultural forms that go against the pressures of globalization and capitalism. This course opens with a broad consideration of education before focusing on schooling as the preferred institutional form of education under early 21st century globalism. Our questions will include both how schooling operates to maintain existing social structures and power relations and the possibilities - and consequences - of schools as a site of change.

We will look at how experiences of illness and health are culturally, rather than biologically, constructed. A second objective is to compare the belief systems and medical practices of several specific Western and non-Western societies. In carrying out these cross-cultural comparisons, we will focus on qualitative research and read several ethnographic case studies.

SOAN 246: Language and Culture This course is an introduction to and survey of Linguistic Anthropology, one of the four primary subfields within the broader discipline of anthropology. Linguistic anthropology requires competence in several areas that encompass scientific and humanistic approaches to the study of language. Students will acquire a broad grasp of critical issues in language and culture including by grappling with such questions as: What is language? Does language shape our intuition of the world? How might it affect our thoughts and behavior? What does color have to do with language and how can color terms tell us about our limits of awareness of the way that culture shapes us? How do we do things with words? What role do groups and social norms play in how we speak? How creative can we be with language? What is verbal art? How does language operate within actual communities, for instance serving to support and maintain traditional cultural practices or fostering distinctions between kinds of persons in society? Prerequisite: SOAN 110. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) SOAN 248: Intro to Physical Anthropology This course will introduce students to the discipline of biological/physical anthropology. The course will look at both the commonalities that hominids, and particularly humans, share with other biological organisms and idiosyncratic phenomena that make the human species unique. Students will first be introduced to the evolutionary and biological mechanisms that have guided the emergence of the human lineage and to the practices of taxonomy and phylogeny which inform the study of human biological ancestry. Next, the class will focus on the study of modern primates, humanity's closest living relatives. We will then move to the particular evolutionary history of hominids that produced modern humans. Through this course students will become conversant with the overarching questions and biological techniques employed in the study of both ancient humans and modern human variation. This course will directly engage students in anthropological work in both reading and practice and teach the methods used by anthropologists in their fieldwork. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 251: Intro Performance Studies In this course, we will explore the flourishing new discipline of Performance Studies. This field of study began as a collaboration between theater director and theorist Richard Schechner and anthropologist Victor Turner, combining Schechner's interest in 'aesthetic performance' (theater, dance, music, performance art) with Turner's interest in performance as ritual within indigenous cultures, or (as Erving Goffman has written) 'the presentation of self in everyday life.' Performance Studies often stresses the importance of intercultural performance as an alternative to 570 either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. In addition to the above and other authors, the course will include in-class performance exercises along with field trips to performances in Chicago.

We will look at families in their social and cultural context and ask what relationships exist between family forms, practices, and values and the economic system, political organization, religions, and cultures of the larger community. We will also ask what the sources of love and support, as well as conflict and tension, are within families and among kin, and we will question why family forms and ideal family types change over time.

SOAN 270: Mapping Chicago Creating maps, like anything done by humans, is a socially situated practice. This practice is framed by discourses on heritage, politics, race, socioeconomics, and even archaeology. What can a map make visible, and what might it erase? How do historical narratives materialize around maps, and what decisions are made in the process of committing narrative to boundary, from emplacing event on physical space? How do we remember people, incidents, and things through commemorations as locations? What can we gain, analytically, by mapping? This course is designed to teach students to think spatially, historically, and archaeologically through readings, lectures, field trips, and the use of StoryMaps software. Drawing from source criticism of text, artifact, and oral history, and via the use of StoryMaps, students in this course ask and work to answer these questions, creating their own maps drawn from research on selected Chicagoland sites and histories to create new spatial data and stories.

This study of ritual may include street fairs, parades, weddings, funerals, feasts and fasts as well as other public and private behaviors that comprise the diversity of American ritual life. Our course shall explore ritual as it occurs in many of the ethnic, racial, subcultural and countercultural communities in Chicago. We will investigate and attempt to understand both the invention and re-invention of community and personal identity through ritual action. Students should anticipate frequent field trips.

A central question for the course is how biological/physiological components of sex and desire are given meaning by cultures, with particular focus on the late 20th-early 21st century United States. The course will explore the US hegemonic binaries of male vs. female, masculine vs. feminine, and man vs. woman, examine how they articulate with one another, and consider various nonbinary responses. It also will look at the ways that social activism around sexuality and gender identity have simultaneously improved and undermined our understandings of both. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 or GSWS 110.

How societies are organized, how they produce and consume, and what values and norms constitute their culture all have varied impacts on what is often referred to as the 'natural' world. As environmental problems - such as climate change, deforestation, species loss, pollution, etc. - are constructed and emerge, the impact on societies varies greatly across social groups based on race, class, gender, and national context. This course explores how, in the face of environmental degradation, society has responded in different ways: with social movements, changes in lifestyles, and private certification programs advocating conservation and preservation; and political and economic institutions, definitions of status, and entrenched social organization resisting change.

Recommended: SOAN 210 or SOAN 220 (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: ES 317 SOAN 318: Archaeology of the Contemporary From abandoned council flats to the Ground Zero World Trade Center site, scholars are studying the material remains of the recent past using the methodology of archaeological \"excavation.\" These archaeologies of the contemporary past bring a new lens to anthropological questions, making familiar items unfamiliar as we examine material residues of late capitalist, post-industrial societies and beyond. Building on modern material culture studies, this focus on materiality can inform and contextualize our understandings of present day human experiences and challenges. This course is designed to explore some of these materially-focused anthropological case studies while providing the opportunity for students to undertake their own \"excavation\" of the recent past.

This course examines the ways that we understand (or misunderstand) race, ethnicity, class, and gender from an archaeological perspective. We explore archaeological research projects across time and regions to interrogate an essential problem in archaeology: How can we tell whether material differences in the archaeological record correspond to boundaries human groups draw among themselves? Course topics include race and racialization, ethnic diversity and ethnogenesis, the formation and performance of class, social constructions of gender and sexuality, and the political stakes involved in archaeological studies of difference. Throughout this course we ask how an engagement with intersectionality\u2014the idea that categories of difference are entangled and covalent\u2014may allow for a more nuanced understanding of the past, and of the present.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.) cross listed: GSWS 319 SOAN 320: Soc Research: Qualitative Methods Qualitative methods are used by both anthropologists and sociologists for working in small, bounded communities. The primary methodology of qualitative researchers, ethnography, tends to be more associated with anthropology as a result of disciplinary history. The writing of ethnographic 'thick description' is part art and part science, a methodology most easily learned by doing. This course is designed to give students exposure to the ins, outs and ethics of ethnographic research methods and to help students develop a sense of when such methods are appropriate. Course work will include fieldwork of various types culminating in research projects determined by the 573 students. Recommended for junior year.

SOAN 343: Education in Developing Countries SOAN 343: Education and Development in Developing CountriesThis course explores the historical background, philosophical foundations and major themes in the education of 'developing countries' within the broader context of global development and social change. The specific goal of this course is to familiarize students with the evolution of and critical issues in formal education in most low income, less industrialized nations. Students will be able to explore contemporary themes in education from a historical and comparative perspective. Additionally, they will expand their conceptual schema for rethinking educational issues within and beyond their own societies. Geographically, this course covers countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, but runs comparisons with countries in Europe and North America when theoretically relevant. Reading materials build on development studies and several disciplines in the social sciences and humanities such as history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and education.

The course is organized with a multidisciplinary perspective with analysis of history, theory, methods, and issues in comparative and international education. A major goal of the course is to interrogate the linkages between education and society. Recurrent themes will be examined to demonstrate how every educational system not only arises from but also shapes its particular socio-cultural context. Students will have the opportunity to deepen and expand their knowledge of educational issues within a global context.

Anthropology and related social sciences have a long theoretical and empirical engagement with the study of rationality and reason, and of perception and empiricism particularly in the early 20th century attempts to make sense of non-western religious and magical systems. At the time, people believed these practices were 'cultural' in a way that western science was not. Over the last two decades this belief has been soundly critiqued and rejected and a great deal of work has focused on the cultural practices of western laboratory scientists and of the cultural fact of science and technology in society more broadly. This course will present students with an introduction to the anthropological context for contemporary Science and Technology Studies. Prerequisites: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or 220 or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 348: Paranormal & Supernatural Cultural, social, and social-psychological forces operate together to create belief systems; paranormal and supernatural belief systems are examples of common systems of belief. These systems of belief are embedded within social institutions in identifiable ways and bearing identifiable consequences. The acceptance or refusal of these beliefs, or of the larger cosmology they reflect, tells the social scientist much about the believers and disbelievers and their societies. This course will examine belief systems that are commonly identified as paranormal, supernatural or occult. Topics may include astrology, magic, UFOs, cryptozoology, ghosts, and spirit possession. Prerequisites: SOAN 110, and either SOAN 210 or SOAN 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) 574 SOAN 350: Sociology of Knowledge This course investigates the patterns whereby social organization shapes both the content and structure of knowledge. The connection between knowledge and society is reciprocal: we will observe how a new religious message, scientific insight, or technological development alters the social order. The sociology of knowledge also involves the investigation of consciousness and belief: We will investigate the relationships between mental phenomena and social organization - how, for example, 'false consciousness' is constructed in relations of exploitation and how ideologies and stereotypes shape what is perceived. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and any SOAN 200-level course or higher. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 351: Performance Ethnography Performance Studies stresses the importance of intercultural performance as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional qualitative fieldwork. Looking at behavior through the lens of performance offers new ways for ethnographers to understand how identity is formed and expressed. As a discipline concerned with non-textual forms of knowledge, scholars engaged in this field sometimes use performance to present their research, recognizing the modes of knowledge that cannot be reduced to words. Students in this course will study Performance Studies scholarship, learn the basics of ethnographic practice, and create performances based on their research. They will study the work of scholars such as Dwight Conquergood and Erving Goffman and artists such as Tectonic Theater, which specialize in documentary theatre. There will also be required field trips and site visits. Prerequisite: THTR 251 or permission of instructor.

When does a state of war produce its own structures and rules? How do different societies respond in different ways to life during wartime? How does ethnic and class conflict manifest in war? What happens when war and conflict become normalized? Does the perpetual conflict between tribes in Papua New Guinea constitute war in the same way that the war on terror is a war, and are either of these the same as World War II? Does the Arab Spring constitute a state of war? This course takes up the question of the social effects of war, including the consequences of living 'on war footing.' Potential topics include the militarization of societies, the differences between state and non-state control of violence, and the mechanisms by which populations are mobilized to violence.

Rather than attempt a survey of all the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understandings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contemporary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the tropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' certain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's lives.

Do we have a global culture? Is the world becoming a more homogeneous place or a more heterogeneous one? Is globalization inevitable? What are the threats and benefits of 'global society'? How has the structure of capitalism influenced globalization? This course considers the various scholarly perspectives on these issues, as well as the social actors and institutions that have promoted, benefited from, and challenged globalization. Course materials will be taken from scholarship in sociology and anthropology. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 or by permission.

Analysis of inequality (e.g., sex, age, education, competence, wealth, power) in different forms of social organization from small, intimate groups to large-scale social systems. Theoretical approaches concerning the emergence and persistence of hierarchies. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and any SOAN 200-level course or higher. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 372: Queer Theory This course will address the contemporary social theories collectively described as 'Queer Theory.' A unifying thread for those theorists generally accepted as working within Queer Theory is the prioritization of gender and sexuality as social ordering devices. Queer Theorists make dualities, power inequalities, and identity performance central to their analyses. The creation, rise, and ultimate deconstruction of these theories will be placed within social and historical contexts. Once the student has a firm understanding of the source and content of Queer Theory we will embark upon an exploration of its application through the investigation of a number of topics that are often peripheralized in the academy. Ultimately, we will question the utility of the theory in light of factors ranging from its dismantlement under deconstruction to the rise of social contingency theory. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or SOAN 220 or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement.

Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or SOAN 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) 576 SOAN 390: Sociology of Religion This seminar starts with major classical theories of sociology of religion including those of secularization and privatization of religion in the modern world. Then we examine the relevant events of the past quarter of the century, namely the sudden explosion of politicized and highly public religions in the Western and the non-Western worlds. The existing sociological literature didn't anticipate the current significance of religion and this tension is expected to generate interesting debates in this seminar. Special attention is given to a comparative study of public religions in Western countries (e.g., Brazil, Poland, Spain, and the United States) and in the Middle East (Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia). Pre-requisites: SOAN 110 and any SOAN course at the 200 level or higher or consent of the instructor. cross listed: RELG 390, IREL 375 SOAN 395: Sociology of Law This course will examine the social organization of legal institutions and the relationship between law and the structure of society. Specifically, the course considers the nature and origins of law from the viewpoint of classical social theorists and anthropological studies of customary law. The course also emphasizes various aspects of the American legal system: the social structure of the legal profession, courts and dispute resolution, law as an instrument of social control, and the relationship between law and social change.

Theatre Courses THTR 105: Introduction to Dance In this course we will explore the basic elements of dance: space, energy, relationships, time, and the coordination of our bodies. We will develop our natural creativity and further our understanding of a variety of dance forms while gaining strength, flexibility, and technical dance skills. We will also study the historical development of modern dance. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) THTR 120: Acting I: Being on Stage For beginners and experienced actors alike, this course is required for all theater majors but open to students from any discipline with any level of experience. What is acting? Is there a difference between being and acting? How do we draw from our own lives to create a performance? Is there a difference between performing and acting? This class explores these questions through performance, reading, and written analysis. Students will study scripts, acting theory, and one another's work as they sharpen their acting techniques and critical thinking skills. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) THTR 160: Stagecraft for Stage and Screen An introduction to the technology employed backstage to create the magic of theatrical design and special effects.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) THTR 180: The Theater of Rock In this course we take a close look at what rock performers do onstage. How do they present themselves? What does their clothing convey? What do their gestures suggest? How are their props significant? Are they \"being themselves\" or are they performing a different persona? How important is their performance to our perception of the music they play? Utilizing methodologies from the field of Performance Studies, we survey the history of rock 'n' roll starting with early performers such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix. We note the emergence of glam rockers in the early 70s such as David Bowie and Marc Bolan as well as shock rockers like Alice Cooper and Kiss. We also consider groups that seem to be just \"being themselves\" onstage like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers. Other performers we study may include Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Amy Winehouse, and Lady Gaga. Finally, we consider rock performance in the COVID era: Zoom and other forms of online delivery. Students have a chance to examine and write about their favorite music performers in class presentations and papers. No prerequisites.

Theater Boot Camp is a production-in-a-month experience designed to supercharge your theater skills. This practice-driven class immerses the student in the creative process of collaborative theater toward the production of an original work. The creative process focuses on composition, presentation, feedback, and re-writes, as we take students through the entire creative cycle of development and production. Students sharpen their playwriting, acting, directing, and technical production skills, and emerge from the experience with the career know-how necessary to make their own successful theater production. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.) THTR 206: Grateful Dead and American Culture More than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight-Ashbury acid-testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan-soaked 1980s, and on to the jam-band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars. We'll understand the various subcultures that separate the sixties and now, and in doing so, offer answers to this key question: Why do the Dead survive?

In this class students read, discuss, and attend performances of classic and contemporary plays at theaters throughout the city, ranging from small 'storefront' companies to such institutions as the world-famous Goodman and Steppenwolf Theaters. In this class, we discuss how theater both reflects and shapes our understanding of various identities in society at large, and we draw from the field of performance studies to think about how theater can help us understand the politics of identity. Students read scripts and criticism, write reviews and research papers, and participate in workshops with local artists. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) THTR 251: Intro to Performance Studies In this course, we will explore the flourishing new discipline of Performance Studies. This field of study began as a collaboration between theater director and theorist Richard Schechner and anthropologist Victor Turner, combining Schechner's interest in 'aesthetic performance' (theater, dance, music, performance art) with Turner's interest in performance as ritual within indigenous cultures, or (as Erving Goffman has written) 'the presentation of self in everyday life.' Performance Studies often stresses the importance of intercultural performance as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. In addition to the above and other authors, the course will include in-class performance exercises along with field trips to performances in Chicago.

Looking at behavior through the lens of performance offers new ways for ethnographers to understand how identity is formed and expressed. As a discipline concerned with non-textual forms of knowledge, scholars engaged in this field sometimes use performance to present their research, recognizing the modes of knowledge that cannot be reduced to words. Students in this course will study Performance Studies scholarship, learn the basics of ethnographic practice, and create performances based on their research. They will study the work of scholars such as Dwight Conquergood and Erving Goffman and artists such as Tectonic Theater, which specialize in documentary theatre. There will also be required field trips and site visits. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Writing requirements.

In the last decade, prominent theater scholars have integrated neuroscience research into their studies. Their excitement stems from the realization that current scientific research seems to speak directly to one of the major concerns of theatre scholars for decades: How does performing and/or watching a performance affect the brain? In this interdisciplinary class, students will read the work of scholars such as Rhonda Blair and Rick Kemp, in addition to creating their own performances, as we explore the ways science and the humanities can intersect.

THTR 390: Internship Our Chicago connection allows us to offer internship opportunities at a variety of local theaters, while also allowing students to utilize their theatrical skills in an array of non-theatrical work opportunities. Internships are available in such areas of stage management, dramaturgy, education, public relations, and development, but we also encourage students to think more broadly about the applicability of their theater skills is such areas as business, law, public service, teaching, and many others. Students can work at such major theaters as Steppenwolf, Goodman, Chicago Shakespeare, and Second City, while smaller companies such as Victory Gardens, Writers, Timeline, and Lookingglass also offer valuable opportunities. Internships must be applied for in the semester prior to enrollment and applications include on-campus consultation with faculty and staff along with off-campus interviews with members of the host organization. Junior class standing and other prerequisites apply based on the nature of 584 the internship and its requirements. THTR 390 does not fulfill the 300-level requirement for the major.

THTR 480: Sr Sem: Business of Show Business (Senior Seminar: The Business of Show Business) The aim of this course is to provide a \"capstone\" experience for students majoring in theater. The course allows students to reflect on why one makes theater and to develop their own conceptual and economic basis for making theater. The course will stress issues that confront the theater artist, including professional practices and financial realities. Students will divide their time between independent research and the classroom. Classroom work will focus on student research presentations and discussions of practices and issues confronting the contemporary theater artist. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing in the major or permission of the instructor. This course counts as an elective toward the Entrepreneurship and Innovation minor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) THTR 492: Creative Project To fulfill their senior studies requirement, students may choose to work on a creative project that includes a substantial critical component, to be designed in collaboration with their thesis advisor. Possible projects include (but are not limited to) writing an original script, creating and performing a solo show, participating in a devised performance, or choreographing an original dance. The critical component will not only document the creative process, but also include an analysis of the texts and artistic influences that inspired the project and a rigorous post- performance critique. THTR 494: Senior Thesis A well-documented and well-executed senior project completed in the senior year may count as a senior thesis. (See Academic Regulations in the Student Handbook for details.) As with other theses, the final project will be reviewed by a thesis-examining committee consisting of three faculty, at least one from outside the Theater Department. Students are encouraged to consult with members of this committee during the planning and execution of the project. THTR 140: Costumes and Identity The clothing that we choose to wear reveals a great deal about our identity. Our choices are shaped by our understanding of race, class, sexuality, gender\u2014and how we want to convey who we are. In this course, students explore the performative nature of costume and fashion in theatre, art, media, popular culture, and everyday life. The course includes readings, discussions with guest speakers, and writing assignments. Students analyze historical costumes/fashion from samples of well-known film and theatre works with a focus on identity politics. Assignments include in-class presentations and discussion, and a costume research project.

Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the Urban Studies Program are: 1. Student will be able to recognize obstacles and benefits specific to working within an urban setting. 2. Student will be able to articulate specific issues that arise as a result of a dense and/or diverse population. 3. Student will be able to identify relationships between government offices and specific issues. 4. Student will be able to evaluate strategies designed to deliver services or regulate activities in an urban area in terms of their potential outcomes for more than one set of stakeholders. Urban Studies Courses URBS 110: Introduction to Urban Studies Urban Studies allows students to examine the development and impact of urbanization in the great metropolitan regions (comprising larger inner cities and suburban communities) in which a majority of the world's population now lives. This interdisciplinary course focuses on the economic, political, environmental and cultural dimensions of the urban experience, with guest lectures by a variety of college experts. A core professor will coordinate these visits, encouraging students to see how all elements interrelate to both limit and expand what is possible in metropolitan regions. Field trips to both urban and suburban locations will allow students to understand the range of issues confronting these population centers. Students will be challenged to think about how compromise and negotiation are crucial parts of urban planning and to ask how decisions that affect the urban and suburban community ultimately are made. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) URBS 120: American Cities This course is an introduction to the political, economic, and social forces that have shaped American cities from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the city of Chicago. We explore the growth of urban economies and new forms of labor, migration and immigration into cities, persistent patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and displacement, and struggles over power and resources that make up urban politics. We also pay particular attention to urban geography and the relationship between cities, rural and suburban areas. Students are introduced to multiple disciplinary approaches to understanding American cities, and take field trips to relevant sites in Chicago. This course is the foundational course for the Urban Studies minor program. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: HIST 235, AMER 263, ES 263 588 589 Lake Forest College has two graduate programs of study, a Master of Liberal Studies Program and a Master of Arts in Teaching. Master of Liberal Studies Master of Arts in Teaching Admission Contacts Master of Liberal Studies Program Carol Gayle Associate Director of the MLS Program 847-735-5083 gayle@lakeforest.edu Master of Arts in Teaching Program Adrienne Thoms Education Preparation Program Coordinator Department of Education 847-735-5169 thoms@lakeforest.edu Graduate Programs 590 The Master of Liberal Studies Program is designed for those who have completed a bachelor's degree and who want to enhance their knowledge and analytical skills to prepare themselves for the challenges of the twenty-first century. The Basics Lake Forest College offers a master's degree in liberal studies (MLS) to adults who live and work in the community, including teachers, professionals, and anyone interested in pursuing advanced study for their own enrichment and pleasure. At the heart of the MLS program is a series of interdisciplinary seminars, team-taught by faculty members representing different disciplines. These specially designed seminars foster the ability to integrate knowledge from several fields and to deal with major questions in light of the wisdom afforded by a broad understanding of the liberal arts. Getting Started The MLS program is flexible, designed to be responsive to the needs of individual students. Students can enter in either Fall or Spring and pursue the program at their own pace. Students working with an advisor design their own curricular programs. We will collaborate with you to develop a plan that fits your schedule and your life. For information on the Spring 2021 seminar, click here. Educator's Grant The MLS program welcomes educators and has a program of grants to help pay tuition. Educators are eligible for grants that can reduce their tuition per course by as much as half. Applying for a grant is simple. Email gayle@lakeforest.edu to learn more. Auditing MLS Seminars Auditing MLS Seminars Adults may register to audit an MLS seminar, assuming there is space in the class. Students who audit an MLS seminar attend classes and may participate in discussion, but they do not write the papers. Auditors do not earn academic credit but the course they audit will be listed on their official transcripts with the designation of AU. Tuition for auditing is currently $600 per course. Option for MLS Auditors to Transition into the MLS Program Students who successfully audit four MLS seminars will be granted one graduate credit, which may be counted towards the eight credits needed for the Master of Liberal Studies degree. A total of two MLS graduate credits may be earned in this manner. What Our Students Have to Say Anita Cukier : \"One of the most important things for me is to be able to crystallize my own viewpoints and to be able to defend them with facts .\" Thomas Skelly : \"The quality of the discussion around very interesting topics I found to be excellent. You get a clear diversity of opinion among professors and students with different life experiences.\" Jane Steen : \"It gives you confidence to talk about the things that you don't necessarily have a huge grasp on. I developed more confidence in writing and speaking about a variety of subjects. \" Contact Carol Gayle Associate Director of the MLS Program Master of Liberal Studies 591 847-735-5083 gayle@lakeforest.edu 592 To be admitted to the Masters in Liberal Studies program, candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Candidates should submit transcript records of all college work at the time they submit their application for admission. Our simple application form asks applicants to write a brief essay stating how the Graduate Program in Liberal Studies will serve their needs. In addition, each applicant will be interviewed by the Director, Associate Director, or another member of the MLS Committee. The Committee is responsible for admitting applicants. The decision to admit an applicant is based entirely on the Committee's assessment of whether the applicant is likely to perform well in the program and to benefit from it. Graduate tuition and expenses Application Fee: $30.00 Tuition per Course for 2020-2021: $2,772 Full-time teachers qualify for a grant to cover half of tuition costs. Withdrawal and refunds A student who wishes to withdraw from an MLS seminar or an elective course must notify the Associate Director of the program. Refunds will be made according to the following schedule (less a $100 nonrefundable fee): Seminar Meetings Completed Refund 1 90% 2 80% 3 70% 4 60% 5 50% 6 40% 7 or more 0% When students withdraw from elective courses, refunds follow the prorated schedule for regular undergraduate courses. All graduate courses are regarded as beginning on the first day of the term, and the amount refunded diminishes by 10% every week. All financial policies detailed under Undergraduate Tuition and Fees apply to the Graduate Program in Liberal Studies. Admission and Tuition 593 Master's in Liberal Studies A candidate must successfully complete at least eight Lake Forest College courses for graduate credit. Since each of these courses carries four semester hours of credit, the MLS degree represents a total of 32 semester hours of graduate credit. Of these eight courses, at least three must be MLS interdisciplinary seminars and/or colloquia. The remaining five courses are electives and may be chosen from the following options: additional MLS seminars; advanced undergraduate courses in which the graduate students will be expected to do extra work. In certain cases, students may choose to concentrate electives in a discipline; independent study, one form of which is a master's thesis. An overall average of B or higher is required to complete the MLS degree. MLS students are not required to take any minimum number of courses a year to remain in the program. Part-time students are welcomed and most students take only one course a semester. Students may also choose to complete the MLS degree in one year, or a year and a half, through a special accelerated program which usually requires completion of a thesis or final project. Coursework given a grade of incomplete by the instructor must be cleared within one year; after that, the grade will be recorded permanently as NC (No Credit), which will not affect the student's grade point average. Transfer credit Once a student is admitted to the program, the MLS Committee may approve the transfer of graduate courses from an accredited university. Only courses in which the student has earned a grade of B or higher and that fit into the liberal arts definition of the MLS program can be considered for acceptance in transfer. Normally, the Committee will accept in transfer no more than the equivalent of two Lake Forest College graduate courses. Apply to the Program Application for Admission Form (Adobe Acrobat PDF format) Requirements 594 Master of Liberal Studies Courses MLS 510: Darwin Seminar Darwin and Darwinism are studied from a variety of perspectives, including the ways thinkers used the prestige of scientific theory to justify contemporary business practices and social inequalities; the impact of Darwinism on literature; scientific developments since Darwin; the new sociobiology, the genetic and cultural evolutionary determination of human behavior. MLS 514: Public Policy & Environment The seminar will examine: the historical background of current environmental issues; alternative ways of conceiving of the relationship of humankind and the natural world; the complex issues created by the need to reconcile environmental with other social goals such as economic growth; consideration of international law and organization as a means of protecting the ozone layer and preventing global warming; analysis of the consequences of population growth. MLS 516: The Idea of Law The idea of 'law' can mean different things in different contexts and applications. This seminar considers such questions as whether the concept of law is used the same way in the natural and social sciences. How does 'natural' law differ from 'positive' law? While literature does enlarge our understanding of law in these several senses, how do letters, as well as the other arts, themselves reflect their own 'rules'? And do new theories of literary criticism along with chaos theory challenge older assumptions of order and meaning? MLS 518: Intellectual Revol of 20th Cen In the unsettled years around 1900 new aesthetic visions emerged in the arts, while intellectuals and scientists developed radically new ways of thinking about the natural and social worlds. These intellectual revolutions permeated the general consciousness during the early decades of the twentieth century. This seminar examines the contributions of major thinkers such as Freud and Einstein and movements such as modernism that had a decisive influence on our worldview. MLS 520: Mind and Brain The brain has been called an 'enchanted loom.' Can our knowledge of the physical brain help us understand our thinking selves, our emotions, and other mental processes? Conversely, can a good understanding of the human mind (rational, spiritual, and creative) illuminate our study of the physiological brain? How do personality and intellect develop over one's life? How does the brain develop, and how might consciousness have evolved? Do we have inborn 'social instincts'? MLS 522: The 18th Century The Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century transformed the intellectual climate of European civilization. In the century that followed, many argued that the rational methods of natural science could be applied to philosophy, religion, politics, aesthetics, and society. The impulse to Enlightenment was challenged by a generation of writers and satirists who, while often introducing new styles of poetry and prose, defended traditional humanistic values. From this tension between old and new, continuity and change, emerged a modern world view. This seminar will explore eighteenth-century culture in a variety of its manifestations, including science, literature, the arts, religion, and politics. Courses 595 MLS 524: Ways of Knowing We know many different things but we also know in many different ways. The poet and the biologist know nature in distinctive manners. What is the basis for scientific knowledge? How can we know the past? What kinds of knowledge are the province of literature and the arts? The seminar will explore several of the ways in which we know, concentrating on the scientific, the historical, and the literary. MLS 526: Sound and Image This seminar will consider the aesthetic interaction between ear and eye, especially in the mass-mediated forms of music, sound effect, dialogue, photograph, painting, and cinema. We will read both theoretical and literary reflections on the subject, see some movies, and listen to recorded music. Briefly considering the physics and physiology of hearing and vision, we will consider how the artistic imagination, delivered in audio and visual media, interacts with audience experience both as individuals and as a social group. MLS 528: Liberty The concept of liberty is a relatively modern one; we can trace its development from the English Enlightenment to the 21st century. This seminar will explore how the idea of liberty has developed as a political, economic, cultural and social ideal. We will look at liberty in markets, individual rights, conflicts between equality and freedom, international relations, psychological explorations of freedom, conflicts between states and individual liberties, and other topics. Materials will include classic texts and cultural explorations of liberty through literature and the arts. MLS 530: War and Peace Conflict/Human Nature (War and Peace: Conflict and Human Nature) This course examines how issues of war and peace frame international relations in the modern era. With a special emphasis on World War I, we will study popular attitudes toward war, including militarism, imperialism, and pacifism. Consideration is also given to Woodrow Wilson's peace plan and subsequent efforts to end states' reliance on armed conflict to settle international political disputes. The course also considers the effect of technological change on war, efforts to promote democracy as an antidote to war, humanitarian intervention, and Islam's tradition of pacifism as a response to jihadism. MLS 532: Sex & Gender in Nature and Society An interdisciplinary exploration of sex and gender, with emphasis on the perspectives of biology, psychology, history, art, and literature. We will examine the biological bases for differences between males and females and how evolution shapes sex roles in animal societies. We will consider the social and cultural differences between males and females and how gender and sex affect the social roles of men and women. How, if at all, have gender roles changed in the process of historical development? How does culture construct gender and in what ways can art and literature illuminate aspects of gender? MLS 534: Civil Liberties and Civil Rights MLS 536: Meetings: East and West Encounters between cultures play a significant role in world affairs. This course explores the complex and evolving inter-relationships among East Asian cultures and Western societies. It focuses on how both Eastern and Western traditions and discourses encounter, resist, assimilate, and transform each other in unpredictable ways. The course will involve history, politics, art, philosophy, film, literature, and music. MLS 538: Ethics and Life Selected topics dealing with the ethical dimension of human activities, institutions, and traditions. Topic for Fall 2005: International Relations. Considerations of the intersection between ethics and U.S. foreign policy, examining tensions and harmony between universal values and national interest. Examination of the extent ethics does, can, or should inform decisions about the U.S. role in international affairs. 596 MLS 540: Cinema & Society Cinema exerts a powerful influence on society. It reflects, shapes and comments upon a variety of social and political concerns. Through careful analysis of films--classic as well as recent--and related texts, the seminar will explore varying representations of such themes as nation, gender, class, and race from literary, socio-scientific, and artistic perspectives. MLS 542: Images of Human Nature This course will consider various views about the nature and meaning of human existence. Among the images to be examined are the religious and philosophical, the heroic, the psychological, and the sociological and historical. Readings include selections from Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Freud, and various contemporary documents, including film. MLS 544: Sensing Chicago (Sensing Chicago: Past, Present, and Future.) Our experience of place is mediated by our senses. Chicago\u2014a city whose name derives from an Algonquian term for stinking onion\u2014can be grasped via its aroma (the Stockyards, Blommer's Chocolate Company), sights (1893 World's Fair, the Chicago School of Architecture), sounds (Blues, Jazz, Classical), tastes (deep dish pizza, molecular gastronomy), and touch (the wind toward the Lake, the crowds on the CTA). By using our senses as a lens, we interrogate the many layers of Chicago. The course will integrate campus sessions as well as field-based explorations of Chicago's sensorium. MLS 546: Relig: Inter-disciplinary Approach Religion has been a cultural universal in the past, and remains a constant in our current societies. Some of the questions that this cross-disciplinary seminar explores are as follows: What is religious experience? How does it interact with other facets of our psychological, sociological, economic, and cultural life? What was its role in traditional societies? What is its future? We shall look at religion from the perspectives of theologians, philosophers, psychologists, and social scientists. MLS 548: Romanticism: Self and Society The Romantic era (ca. 1780-1830) was a period of revolutionary change in politics, literature, music, and the visual arts. This seminar examines the evolving relation of self and society through five transformational decades of modern European history. Discussions will focus on the works of a number of major figures, including Blake, Burke, Schiller, Wordsworth, Keats, Schubert, and Mary Shelley. MLS 550: Latin America: Economy & Culture An interdisciplinary study of the historical development of Latin American societies, highlighting the artistic achievements of Latin American writers and film directors and focusing on the links between political and economic change on the one hand and artistic production on the other. Literary texts and films will be treated as complex aesthetic objects whose language does not merely photograph socio-historical reality, but transfigures it. MLS 552: The Science of Science Fiction (Life as We Don't Know It: The Science of Science Fiction.) \"It's life, Jim, but not as we know it!\" An interdisciplinary seminar exploring classic and contemporary texts of science fiction from the perspectives of a scholar of literature and a trained ecologist. We will investigate the science behind some of the classic tropes of the genre including alien life, artificial intelligence, the ecology of other worlds, and the political logic of dystopia. How do science fiction stories and films help us imagine the future\u2014and perhaps as importantly, better understand the world in which we now live? Materials will include classic science fiction texts by Frank Herbert, Stanislaw Lem, Ursula K. LeGuin, N.K. Jemisin, and others, as well as films such as Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris and Alex Garland's Annihilation. MLS 554: Modern British Culture An interdisciplinary exploration of British culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. Topics include the Edwardians, the impact of World War I; the Bloomsbury circle; culture during the Slump; films of the Second World War; working class realism after the war; the Sixties; Thatcherism and its critics; postmodernism and posthumanism. 597 MLS 570: Preceptorial: AmericanGreats The course will focus on great works from American literature and philosophy. Works include those by Thoreau, Emerson, Melville, Twain, Wharton, and others from the 20th century. MLS 580: The American Founding (The American Founding: Principles, Practices, Controversies.) American politicians and legal scholars often support their opinions by referring to the Founding era of the United States. But what exactly occurred during those important years at the end of the 18th century? What were the major debates about the ratification of the Constitution and how were they resolved? Are these founding principles and institutions still worthy of support as they stand? Do they need to be revised to meet changed circumstances and, if so, to what degree? In this course we will carefully interrogate the history and political philosophy of the Founding Era by examining a wide selection of key texts. In addition, we will explore how different generations of Americans have (re)interpreted the meaning of these texts. Finally, we will consider how and why debates surrounding the meaning of the Founding era ae still very much present in virtually all of the major political controversies of our day. MLS 582: Iconic Supreme Court Cases American political and legal history is filled with important and influential Supreme Court cases that have dramatically shaped our constitutional tradition. In this course, we will carefully examine a number of iconic cases, such as Marbury v. Madison, Dred Scott v. Sanford, Roe v. Wade, and Obergefell v. Hodges (to name just a few), with an eye towards understanding their continuing legacies and significance. In addition to analyzing these cases on their own terms, we will also rely on them to illuminate broader questions concerning the proper role of the Supreme Court in our democracy. MLS 583: Hamilton and the Founding Fathers The reputation of Alexander Hamilton has vacillated wildly over the years. Detractors have called him an elitist, an opponent of democracy, or a crypto-monarchist, while his admirers view him as a realist who believed that the new Republic needed a strong central government in order to build a strong economy. Because he played a pivotal role in both the American Revolution and the formation of the Constitution, his story becomes a lens to study many of the defining moments of the founding of the United States. His life takes us into the great debates of the early republic over the scope and nature of government power and its role in shaping American society. This course will draw on the musical \"Hamilton\" as well as recent scholarship and key primary source readings to reassess Hamilton's influence upon the key events of his lifetime and his legacy. The goals of the courses are: 1) to understand the key personalities, debates, and decisions of the Revolution and the Early National Period and 2) to model and practice the most effective teaching strategies for use in your own civics and history classrooms. 598 The Master of Arts in Teaching Program (MAT) at Lake Forest College recommends graduates for initial teaching licenses in elementary, middle, secondary and K- 12 education. Through the MAT Program, students can obtain both a master's degree and Illinois teacher licensure simultaneously. This program is not appropriate for teachers who are already licensed to teach in K-12 schools. Our teacher licensure program has earned an excellent reputation for preparing knowledgeable, responsive, caring, and respected professional teachers. As a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) student, you will: Learn in small collaborative cohorts together with fellow students who are completing majors in various fields. It's an interdisciplinary approach not found at other colleges; Be guided by learned faculty and cooperating education professionals who provide individualized advising, mentorship, and assessment; Work with student populations spanning the American racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic spectrum; Get two classroom internships and practicums in school settings where you can hone teaching skills, not just one clinical experience like at most other colleges. The Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Program is suited for: Individuals who have completed a B.A. at another institution (with a major in an area of study offered by Lake Forest College) or at Lake Forest College and seek teacher licensure; Juniors or seniors at Lake Forest College who want to add a teaching degree to their majors; First-year or sophomore students at Lake Forest College who want to complete licensure requirements in five years in order to complete additional elective courses, an additional minor concentration and/or a study abroad or off campus program during their first four years of study; Transfer students who wish to become a teacher and have enough credits to graduate in four years, but will need another year to complete required coursework for teacher licensure. MAT Student Learning Outcomes: The MAT teacher candidate will demonstrate professional characteristics, responsive teaching practices, resourcefulness, teacher efficacy, and reflective capacities as these are described specifically in the Education Department's document entitled \"Identifying Dispositions of a Lake Forest College Educated Teacher\" through successful submission of artifacts and reflective essays through the electronic portfolio process. The MAT teacher candidate will meet all standards articulated for effective beginning teaching in the areas of planning, instructional delivery and assessment in each candidate's respective discipline (e.g., social science, chemistry, elementary education, etc.). Candidates' proficiency will be determined by receiving at least the state mandated passing score as scored nationally through the official edTPA (Teacher Performance Assessment) portfolio process. The MAT teacher candidate will demonstrate a beginning level of proficiency with teacher research methods and statistical analysis of research results by successful completion of a Teacher Action Research Project during student teaching.
