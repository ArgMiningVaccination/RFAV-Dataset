There's also an increased interest in using crystals for more esoteric purposes. Cultures around the world have used crystals in healing and meditation practices for thousands of years. But do crystals possess healing powers? According to crystal healer and certified meditation leader [Carol Boote](https://www.carolboote.co.uk/), the answer is yes. \"There's a long history stretching over thousands of years of the use of crystals for healing and protection, and many forms of meditation for focus and achieving a higher state of consciousness,\" says Boote. She believes that crystals have an effect on consciousness. \"The use of crystals in meditation practice can deepen your meditation, provide a focus object, and raise your consciousness and awareness of your higher self,\" Boote says. There's no scientific evidence that crystals can aid in healing, meditation, or spiritual pursuits. In fact, there's very little evidence about crystals at all. The most frequently cited information arguing that crystals only offer a placebo effect was research conducted by Christopher French, Lyn Williams, and Hayley O'Donnell. The research was presented at [two international conferences](https://www.gold.ac.uk/apru/pubs/conferences/) in 1999 and 2001 but never published in a peer-reviewed journal. Some research, like an older [2009 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814126/) [Some crystal users](/health/mental-health/healing-crystals) agree with this interpretation. There is also evidence, cited in a [2011 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055515/) [2008 study](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a1938.short) Writing under a pen name, All Natural Spirit claims to be a scientist with a PhD in biological sciences who is also a certified crystal healer. According to the [All Natural Spirit blog](https://allnaturalspirit.com/2017/05/27/science-crystal-healing-gemstone-therapy-stress-management/), \"There are actually no reliable scientific studies on crystal healing, probably because of the stigma associated with it and there is no scientific authority to say what crystal healing actually is or could achieve.\" While the science is almost nonexistent and more research needs to be done, there is historical evidence that crystals have been used in healing and spiritual pursuits for centuries. To get started with crystal meditation, you'll need your chosen crystal and a willingness to practice, particularly if meditation is new to you. \"The key issue to meditation is to practice as regularly as possible and make it part of your self-care routine. Often if you feel if you don't have time, feel tired or ill, you need it more than ever,\" explains Boote. When it's time to get started, set the mood. Find a place where you won't be disturbed, set the thermostat to a comfortable temperature, and adjust the lighting for a relaxed, soft feel. If you're already a seasoned meditator, you can simply add the crystal into your current practice. You can also add tools like: - candles - essential oils - incense - images of ancestors - images of inspiring figures, like the Buddha - sacred objects Next, have the crystals you're going to use at hand. Cleansing You'll want to cleanse your crystals before you begin. You can do this by: - passing your crystal through incense, especially sage smoke - using sound, like chanting or singing bowls - exposing your crystal to sun or moonlight for several hours - setting your crystal under running water - immersing your crystal in salt water - burying your crystal in a bowl of brown rice Some [cleansing methods](/health/how-to-cleanse-crystals) are appropriate only for particular crystals, so make sure to do your research before you start. Grounding The next step, says Boote, is to connect to your highest self. \"Ground yourself and ask your highest self and highest beings to help you in this session,\" she says. \"Set your intention that any information or actions are for the highest good to humanity.\" Then, ask your crystals for permission to use their vibrations. Simply connect to your intuition and feel for an answer. \"Connect to your breath and the crystal vibrations, keep your breath relaxed, and see where the energies take you,\" Boote says. \"Some people like to shut their eyes \u2014 but to keep a level of alertness, I find it better to keep them half open.\" If you notice your mind wandering, don't be dismayed. \"Any distracting thoughts are normal,\" Boote encourages. \"Acknowledge and send them off. You may be aware of sensations from the crystals such as vibrations, visions, or thoughts.\" Watch your timing According to Boote, crystals shouldn't remain on your body for more than 20 minutes. \"If you feel uncomfortable with the crystals before then, take them down immediately and drink water,\" she says. Closing your practice When the meditation session is over, gradually become aware of yourself in the room. \"You might want to stretch and wiggle fingers and toes,\" says Boote. \"Don't rush, take a drink of water to detoxify, and be aware of your experience and feelings.\" If you meditate daily, Boote recommends you add crystals no more than once per week. \"You're working with some powerful energies,\" Boote explains. \"You need time to assimilate and get rid of any negative vibrations.\" Finally, Boote says to remember that meditation is a long journey over many years. Don't rush it! Now that you know the basics, you might like to experiment to see what method of crystal meditation works best for you. Here are a few Boote recommends if you're just starting out. Crystal grids or circles If you don't want crystals touching your body while you meditate, you can create a crystal grid or circle. Place your crystals in an intentional shape around you or directly in front of you. \"Crystal grids are often beneficial and used by setting crystals upon sacred geometry shapes to focus on during mediation,\" Boote explains. \"These can be set up with a specific issue in mind and left to continue their energy work. This may be personal issues or even a larger community or global problems.\" In the bath If you're having trouble relaxing, you may find it helpful to mediate with crystals in a hot bath. \"A relaxing method is to meditate in the bath with the crystals in the water. However, this is not suitable for selenite or calcite as they will dissolve,\" says Boote. Crystals on your chakras [Chakras](/health/what-are-chakras) are thought to be energy transducers in your energetic body. Each represents a different part of your physical and spiritual being. When meditating, you can place a crystal on the chakra that aligns with your intention. \"Laying crystals on your body allows the healing properties to activate those areas and rebalance energies,\" Boote explains. \"Chakra balancing is commonly and effectively used by placing the corresponding colored crystals as you meditate.\" You don't need a whole host of crystals at hand, says Boote, although she recommends a few to get you started. \"There are two crystals I would thoroughly recommend for using in meditation. The first one is clear quartz,\" says Boote. \"[It] allows for altered states of consciousness and balancing the chakras, which are energy centers within the body.\" Boote's second pick for beginners is selenite. \"It's a gypsum-based crystal, which is beneficial for communication to your higher self and higher realms. In meditation, it helps the remembering of past lives and contains all sacred knowledge,\" Boote explains. \"Selenite is a high-vibration stone and activates the crown chakra. It brings light and healing to every cell in the body.\" Whatever crystal you choose to work with, Boote says it's essential you make your choice intuitively. In other words, go for what you feel drawn to. Here are a few common types: Amethyst Amethyst is said to: - possess a strong healing energy - aid sleep - support blood circulation - balance chakras Garnet Crystal healers believe garnet is beneficial for providing energy and regeneration of the body. It's considered a good choice when recovering from illness. Quartz There are different kinds of quartz crystal, including: - clear - rose - smoky Clear quartz is believed to improve awareness and reduce stress. Rose quartz is known as the crystal of unconditional love. It's said to boost feelings of self-love and foster loving relationships with others. Smoky quartz is considered a grounding stone and may help you feel rooted to planet earth. It's believed to be mood lifting and is used for protection. Black tourmaline This stone is said to protect against cell phone radiation, though there's no scientific evidence to support this. Tourmaline is generally believed to protect against negative energies. Selenite Selenite is commonly used for meditation. It's said to help the meditator connect to a higher consciousness. Citrine Known as the stone of joy, citrine is said to attract joy and abundance. Sodalite Sodalite is believed to bring order and calmness to your mind. Lapis Lazuli Said to boost spiritual development, this stone can increase your intuitive abilities and resolve conflict. Tiger's Eye Tiger's Eye is known as a supportive stone for times of change. It is believed to provide empowerment as well as the ability to assert yourself and find clarity in your intentions. When you begin your crystal meditation journey, you may notice that the words \"crystal\" and \"stone\" are used interchangeably. \"In the context of crystal healing, both can be used with good effect,\" explains Boote. \"In terms of definition, a stone is a solid, nonmetallic matter. Crystals are a solid material comprised of atoms and molecules in a repeating pattern known as crystalline lattices. Both are formed from minerals.\" Boote explains that stones and crystals are often confused, but that both can be beneficial in mediation. \"Although jet, amber, and obsidian are often described as crystals, in fact they are not true crystals and do not have a crystalline structure. They are resins but are extremely useful healers,\" she says. \"A powerful healer is also the Shaman Stone, sometimes known as Boji Stones, which do not have a crystal system but are used for grounding and bringing stability.\" Online meditation options Read our review of the [best online meditation options](/health/meditation-online) to find the right fit for you.
