ABSTRACT Cover crop system has shown a potential approach to improving carbon sequestration and environmental quality. Six of each winter and summer cover crops were subsequently grown in two soils, Krome gravelly loam soil (KGL ), and Quincy fine sandy (QFS), in phytotrons at 3 temperatures (10/20, 15/25, 25/30oC for winter/summer cover crops ) to investigate their contributions for carbon (C) sequestration. Among winter cover crops, the highest and the lowest amounts of C accumulated were by bellbean (Vicia faba 149 g/m2, respectively, in the summer cover crops, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L. ) accumulated the largest g/m2), while that by castorbean (Ricinus g/m2 at 30oC in the KGL soil. The mean net C remained in the residues following the 127 d decomposition were 187 g/m2 of C (73% of the total ) and 91 g/m2 (52% of the total) for the winter and summer cover crops, respectively. Following a whole cycle of winter and summer cover crops grown, the mean soil organic C (SOC ) increased by 13.8 and 39.1% in the KGL and QFS soil, respectively, compared to the respective soils before. The results sugges t that triticale, ryegrass, and bellbean are the promising winter cover crops in the QFS so il, while ) are recommended summer cover crops for both soils under favorable temperatures. Keywords : Carbon to Nitrogen Ratio (C:N), Greenhouse Gas (GHG ), (QFS), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC ) 1. Introduction Soil carbon (C) sequestration by terrestrial vegetation, as one of the main approaches for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, has long been identified by the Intergovern-mental Panel on Climate Cha nge [1]. Terrestrial ecosys- tems associated with land use and soil management play an important role in the global C budget [2]. For example, the current global terrestrial sink for C is estimated to hold 550-700 Pg of C in vegetation and 1200-1600 Pg in soil organic matter [3]. Soil is the largest terrestrial C pool, constitutes at 2500 Pg of total C (organic and inor-ganic) within one meter depth [4]. This soil C pool is approximately two-thirds of the total C in ecosystems [5]. The former is about 3.3-fold greater than the atmospheric C pool (760 Pg), and 4.5-fold greater than the biotic C pool (560 Pg) [6]. In addition, soil organic carbon (SOC) pools have the slowest turnover rates in general terres-trial ecosystems [7], therefor e C sequestrated in soils has a great potential to mitigate CO 2 emission to the atmos- phere [3]. Increased fixation of atmospheric CO 2 with terrestrial vegetation, and in turn, contributing to enhanced SOC leads to a reduction in GHS emissions and related nega- tive effects on the environment. However, the efficiency of C sequestration by various vegetations differs largely as influenced by differences in their physiological char- acteristics, growth rates, biomass accumulation rates, etc., and by many environmental factors, such as the soil type, temperature, etc. Maximizing biomass production by optimizing input use is a major goal in agro- ecosystems. Conversion of plant sequestered C to SOC is important since the latter is very stable with long residence time, i.e., hundreds and even thousands of years [8]. Agricultural soils under ap- Growing Cover Crops to Improve Biomass Accumula tion and Carbon Sequestration: A Phytotron Study 74 propriate management can contain substantial amounts of soil C in the forms of soil organic matter (SOM). Ex-cluding carbonated rocks, soils constitute the largest sur- face C pool, approximately 150 0 Gt, which is equivalent to almost three fold greater than the quantity stored in the terrestrial biomass and twice the amount stored in the atmosphere [9]. Cover crops provide an effective practice to enhance SOC [10-13] in addition to their role in improving soil and water conservation [14]. Cover crops can also en- hance soil fertility and productivity for a sustainable ag-ricultural production [15,16]. A linear relationship has been reported between the amount of C sequestered in the soil and C input as plant biomass or residues by a number of researchers [17-19]. Removal of cover crop tops from the soil greatly decreased soil C [20]. The growth rates and amounts of cover crop biomass as well as sequestered CO 2 C differed among different cover crop species and environmental factors [3]. In a wide range of agroclim atic regions, winter cover crops are generally grown during fall through spring. Summer cover crops facilitat e conserving soil and wa- ter during the rainy summer season, improving soil fertility, leading to increased yields and quality of the subsequent cash crops [14-16,2 1]. In Canadian prairies, growing summer cover crops instead of fallow seques- tered approximately 1.5 Tg CO 2 per year from the at- mosphere [22]. To improve C sequestration efficiency, plant seques- tered C in organic forms need to be transferred to stable forms, such as recalcitrant SOC via humification or car- bonization processes. The stability of organic C in plant residues or in soil depends on the cover crop species used in the production system in addition to effects of envi-ronmental factors, including soil type, temperature, and moisture. Organic C in plants comprises active and inac- tive components, which also refer to as labile and recalci-trant pools [23]. The active organic C consists of four fractions; i.e., decomposable organic C, resistant organic C, microbial biomass organic C and humified organic C [24]. The relative distribution of organic C in the above fractions depends on the physiological and chemical characteristics of plant residues, i.e., C:N ratio and lignin content. Most of the previous studies on the role of cover crops on C sequestration or SOC accumulation are ex- clusively related to agricultural practices: such as tillage, cropping systems, crop rotation, land use or shifting cul- tivation, fertilization, etc. [9,12,13,19,20,25,26]. Infor- mation is lacking on the influence of different cover crop species on the efficacy of soil C sequestration. In addi- tion, it is hard if it is not impossible to evaluate both winter and summer cover crops under filed conditions. Therefore, the objective of th e current research was, un- der the controlled environment, to elucidate effects of soil and temperature conditions on the quantities of C accumulation, biomass produc tion, mineralization rates and efficiency of C sequestr ation among different winter and summer cover crops typically grown in the temperate and subtropical regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Soils and Cover Crops A Krome Miami Dade County, a Quincy fine sandy soil (mixed, mesic Xeric Torripsamments) from Benton County, WA, were used in this study. Some characteristics of the above soils are shown in Table 1 . The above soils sam- pled at 0-15 cm depth were sieved to remove large rocks and plant residues. Plastic pots, 25 cm diameter, 23 cm high, 11.3 liters in volume with a capacity of 8 kg soil per pot, were used. Six each winter and summer cover crops, including three each legumes and nonlegumes were evaluated. The winter cover crops used in the experiment were in the order (Trifolium repens The summer cover crops included in the order of: sorghum sudangrass [ Sorghum bicolor cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata L., cv. Iron Clay). Table 1.

JEP Growing Cover Crops to Improve Biomass Accumula tion and Carbon Sequestration: A Phytotron Study 75 2.2 Experimental Design, Phytotron Setup and Management A nested factorial design was adopted with temperature as a main factor, soil types and 6 cover crop species (for either winter or summer cove r crops) were nested as sub- factors. The experiment was conducted in three individ- ual phytotrons (Conviron 8601, Conviron Products Company, Winnipeg, Canada) to simulate different tem- peratures but kept other parameters, e.g., light intensity, relative humidity and day length, etc. the same to repro- duce the growth conditions for the winter and summer cover crops with a respective fallow. For winter cover crops (November 20 th, 2007 through March 7th, 2008), temperatures were: 10/8, 15/10, and 20/15oC (day/night, d/n), following the seed germination at 20oC across all 3 treatments above. Light intensity was gradually increased or decreased 40% per hour with ramp procedure with 10 h day length. The light intensity was 0.294 \u00d7 103 \u00b5mol s-1 m-2, calibrated by a light intensity sensor (LI-COR, Quantum with LI-1000 datalogger), and relative humidity of 50/75% (d/n). The temperatures for summer cover crops (April 9th through June 25th, 2008) were 20/15, 25/20, and 30/25oC (d/n), the day length of 14 h. Light intensity was same as that used for the winter cover crops, with relative humid- ity of 75/85% (d/n). Plant density was 10 per pot for okra, bellbean, purple vetch, sorghum sudangrass and sunn hemp; clover, ryegrass and triticale; while 3 -5 per pot for castor bean, velvetbean, mustard and cow- pea. Three gram of fertilizer (10 N-4.3 P-8.3 K) was ap- plied per pot. No inoculation was applied to legumes. All plants were irrigated through drip line to adjust a flow rate of 2 L/h, the frequency and duration were deter-mined based on plant growth stages for quantities of wa- ter required. With a separate experiment, cover crop decomposition rates were preliminarily evaluated in an extra phytotron with the single (KGL) soil individually for both winter and summer cover crops. In this experiment, the same cover crop species as in the previous study were grown and harvested at the same temperature in the same (KGL) soil, the aboveground biomass was cut into approxi-mately 1-cm pieces, the fresh weight and moisture con- tent were determined with subsamples and those sub- samples were also used for chemical analysis. The cer-tain amount of fresh cover crop residues was evenly dis- tributed on the soil surface of the same pot used for re- spective cover crop growth. Residue surface application instead of soil incorporation was to extend the residue residence time in a similar field approach of no tillage practice. Water content of the soil was maintained at 75% of the field capacity for the respective soil by weighing the pots once a week . Temperatures maintained at 15 oC for winter and 25oC for summer cover crops, and the same lighting conditions that described above for the winter and summer cover crop growth studies were adapted. At the end of 127 d mineralization study, the remaining plant residues were carefully removed from each pot, dried and weighed, and subsamples were taken again for chemical analysis. The mass weight loss of plant residues due to decomposition was calculated based on the difference between the amount of residues applied and the amount remained after decomposition. The total amount of C decomposed was calculated based on the residue weight loss and the residue C concentrations de- termined in the subsamples. The concentrations of SOC and total N were determined before and after the de- composition experiment. 2.3 Sampling and Chemical Analysis Soil samples were collected fr om the center of each pot at 0-10 cm depth prior to and one month after cover crop growth. Soil samples were air dried and ground to pass through a < 1 mm mesh sieve for chemical analysis. The experiment was terminated at the time when any one of these cover crops was flowering, which was about 90 days for both winter and summer cover crops under the experimental conditions. The aboveground plant biomass was harvested, and fresh and dry weights (at 75 oC for 7 d) of biomass were recorded. A subsample of the above- ground biomass was ground to pass through a < 0.5 mm mesh sieve for chemical analysis. Total C and nitrogen (N) contents in the soil and cover crops were analyzed using CNS Auto-analyzer (Vario Max Elementar, Hanau, Germany). Soil inorganic C was determined via pressure calcimeter method and the or- ganic C was calculated by subtracting the inorganic C from the total C [27]. 2.4 Statistical Analysis of the Data The data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS [28] with nested design and a general linear model. For the ANOVA with the nested design in the experiment, three different error structures were con- ducted to compare mean squares of different sources of variation. The main factor was tested against the main factor error, where the sub- treatment was tested against the interaction of replicates (or block) \u00d7 sub-treatment and the interaction between the main factor and the sub-factor were tested agains t the sub-factor error [29]. Further analysis was conducted for each individual factor to separate means with the single factor or combination of the factors for the interac tion effects using Duncan test at p = 0.05, as needed. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1 Cover Crop Biomass, and C and N Contents Total C and N as well as biomass production of both winter and summer cover crops were significantly influ- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes .

JEP 76 enced by cover crop species and growth temperatures (Table 2 ). The soil type had no significant influence on the above parameters for the summer cover crops, while in the case of winter cover crops, it significantly influ- enced the biomass production and the total N. Also, sig- nificant interaction effects were found for temp \u00d7 crop for both winter and summer cover crops on total C and N, and soil \u00d7 crop for winter cover crops for all three evaluation parameters. Result implies that soil types have strong influence on the biomass production and total quantity of N accumu-lation for the winter cover crops rather than the summer cover crops. The growth temperatures rather than soil types influence the biomass production and the C:N ratio for the summer cover crops ra ther than the winter cover crops and a significant inter action effect (temp \u00d7 crop) occurred. 3.2 Total C in Aboveground Biomass Winter cover crops: Total C in the aboveground bio- mass varied among the winter cover crops ( Table 3 ). In the QFS soil, total biomass C (mean across all tempera- tures) was greater in bellbean as compared to that in the remaining species, except triticale. In the KGL soil, total biomass C decreased in the order: triticale > ryegrass > bellbean = mustard = purple vetch = white clover. Over- all biomass total C was significantly greater in the QFS soil as compared to that in the KGL soil for all cover Table 2.

Growing Cover Crops to Improve Biomass Accumula tion and Carbon Sequestration: A Phytotron Study 77 crops exce pt white clover. Temperature effect was sig- nificant only in bell bean and white clover species. The greatest amount of biomass C (597 g/m2) was obtained in bellbean grown in the QFS soil at 25oC. At 10oC in the QFS soil, biomass C was greater by triticale than that by the other cover crops. In the KGL soil at 25 oC, the bio- mass C was greater in triticale than that in either purple vetch, mustard or bellbean. At 15 and 10oC, the biomass C in triticale and ryegrass were greater than that in the remaining cover crops. Summer cover crops: In the QFS soil at 30oC, bio- mass C in sunn hemp was significantly greater that by castorbean, okra, ( Table 4 ). At 25oC, sunn hemp biomass C was significantly greater than that by the remaining five cover crops. At 20 oC, cowpea biomass C was significantly lower than that by the other cover crops. Similarly, in the KGL soil, the relative ranking of biomass C response among the six cover crop species was different at different te mperatures. Soil type influ- ence (mean across all temperatures) was significant on biomass C only in sorghum sudangrass. Biomass total C was significantly greater at 30 oC as compared to that at either 20 or 25oC for sunn hemp, velvetbean, and sor- ghum sudangrass. In general, biomass C accumulation was greater in the winter than in the summer cover crops under the experiment conditions ( Tables 3 and 4 ). 3.3 Aboveground Biomass and Total N in Various Cover Crops The aboveground biomass and total N response followed somewhat similar pattern as total C accumulation among various cover crops ( Table 5 ). The mean biomass pro- duction and total N of winter cover crops were generally greater in the QFS than those in the KGL soil. No sig- nificant difference was observed between these two soils for summer cover crop biomass and/or total N but these summer cover crops accumulated more biomass and N at high temperature than at low temperature. This result has confirmed that the soil type had greater influence on the growth and accumulation by the winter cover crops. Temperature appeared to have a dominant influence on the above response variables of the summer cover crops. Among the summer cover crops, sunn hemp produced the greatest amount of biomass ( Table 5 ), equivalent to 11 Mg ha -1 at 30oC. This agrees with results of our paral- lel field studies [21,30], which showed 15-20 Mg ha-1 of aboveground biomass by sunn hemp. Nitrogen under some growth conditions is a dominant factor to limit the biomass production and C accumula-tion. Therefore, legume cover crops, by virtue of their ability to fix atmospheric N, can overcome this limitation, thus are able to produce greater amount of biomass as compared to that by nonlegume cover crops [12,30]. Some winter cover crops, such as bellbean and purple vetch, accumulated 30-35 g/m 2 of N under the optimal conditions (25oC) in the QFS soil ( Table 5 ). All winter cover crops, except white clover, accumulated greater amount of N while grown on the QFS soil than that on the KGL soil. A similar trend was also observed with respect to accumulation of organic C ( Table 3 ). Table 4.

Values followed by different letters within the same column of a subset (by winter or summer cover s and by each response param eter) represent significant difference at P 0.05. 3.4 Concentrations of C and N in Cover Crop Biomass Among the winter cover crops, C concentration was sig- nificantly lower in white cl over (36%) as compared to that in the remaining five winter cover crops (40-43%) (Figure 1 ). Biomass N concentrations were in the range of 1.8-2.5% for legumes, which was significantly greater than the range of 0.9-1.1% for the nonlegumes. The C:N ratio varied from 13.9 (white clover) to 52.4 (triticale) among these six winter cover crops. The mean C concen- tration as well as C:N ratio across all winter cover crops were greater for the KGL than those for the QFS soil, while the converse was observed for N concentrations. The temperature effect was no t significant on concentra- tions of C and N across all winter cover crops and soil types but the C:N ratio was significantly lower at 10 oC than that at other temperatures ( Figure 1 ). The C concentrations in the summer cover crop bio- mass were significantly greater for sunn hemp, vel- vetbean, sudangrass and and okra ( Figure 2 ). The N concentration was the greatest for velvetbean, wh ile the lowest for sorghum sudangrass. As a result, the C:N ratio followed the pat-tern: sorghum sudangrass > castorbean = okra > sunn hemp velvetbean = cowpea. Overall, there was no sig- nificant difference found be tween soil types for the C concentration but plants grown in KGL soil had a greater N concentration than those in the QFS soil, which re- sulted in a greater C:N ratio of plant biomass in the latter than that in the former soil. The temperature effect was non-significant on the biomass C and N contents as well as C:N ratio. This result agrees well with the previous studies. For instance, the C concentrations in various winter cover crops remained constant but the N concen- trations differed greatly between legume and nolegume cover corps, which resulted in a large variation in C:N ratio in different cover crop biomass [11,32]. 3.5 Residue Decomposition and C Sequestered The rate of decomposition of crop residues over 127-d under similar conditions as those adapted during the re- spective cover crop growth period varied among both winter and summer cover crops. The total C remained in the soil following 127 d of decomposition varied from 53 to 79% and 18-58% of total C accumulated in the respec- tive winter and summer cover corps (Table 6 ). This agrees with the reports of Dossa et al. [33], i.e. 59-81% of the C dded as shrub residue was mineralized in 118 d. a Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Among the winter cover crops, total C input as well as the amount of C left in the residues after decomposition were greater for triticale, ryegrass and bellbean than that by the remaining three cover crop species ( Table 6 ). White clover ranked the lowest for both parameters although its amount of leftover was not significantly different from purple vetch. Among the summer cover crops, sunn hemp ranked the highest and cowpea the lowest for the total C left in the residues. The percent of C retained in the residues was sig- nificantly greater by castorbean, sunn hemp and sorghum sudangrass than that by cowpea. Percent of C retained in the soil was greater for castorbean (72%) as compared to that for velvetbean, okra and cowpea ( Table 6 ). The N concentration associated with C:N ratio is often an important factor to determine the biomass quality [34-36] and biomass decomposition [11,13,33,37-39], which is closely related to the C sequestration efficiency. The current study showed that the decomposition rate (Table 6 ) is related to the N concentration or the C:N ratio, as in the cases of sunn hemp and velvetbean com- pared to castorbean or of bellbean and purple vetch compared to mustard with various C:N ratios ( Figure 1 and 2). The quantities of C decomposed following 127 d were quite high for both triticale and sorghum sudangrass (Table 6 ), which had high C:N ratios, 52 and 67, respec- tively. Therefore, the biomass C:N ratio is an important trait of biomass quality that influences decomposition rate. In addition, some biochemical properties, such as lignin, polyphenolic and tannin contents also influence residue decomposition rate [38]. 3.6 Soil Organic Carbon Changes with Cover Crops and Temperatures After winter cover crops grown, concentrations of SOC in either the QFS or the KGL soil showed no significant difference regardless of different cover crops grown in comparison with fallow (data not shown). After summer cover crops grown, compared to fallow, no any signifi-cant change in SOC was observed in the QFS soil at all temperatures, and it seemed hardly to observe such a change in the KGL soil due to a considerable fluctuation even the concentration of SOC in one treatment was sig- nificantly greater than that in the other ( Table 7 ). Short duration of cover crop growth approved to have very little influence on the SOC changes in the soil. However, since the winter cover crop residues were returned to the soil (soil surface applied) and subsequently the summer cover crops were grown, the SOC at the termination of summer cover crop growth showed some changes among the cover crop species though such changes were fluctu-ated and not significant. Therefore, a long term trial is needed to monitor SOC changes with cover crops in the agricultural system. The fluctuation changes in SOC have been observed by other researchers [13]. Our results agree with that of Lal [2] who concluded that the use of cover crops as a short-term green manure may not nec-essarily enhance the SOC pool. However, increases of SOC occurred after cover crops grown as compared to the respective soils before the ex- periment. For instance, the SOC content (mean across all winter cover crops and temperatures) increased by 0.9 and 4.8% in the KGL and QFS soils, respectively, as compared to the respective soils prior to the experiment. The increases in the SOC content following the growth of the summer cover crops vs. winter cover crops were 13.7 and 25.9% for the respective soils. The correspond-ing increases after the summer cover crops (including winter cover crop residues returned to the soil) compared to the SOC prior to the experiment were 13.8 and 31.9% (Table 8 ). The SOC content of the QFS soil was signifi- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Growing Cover Crops to Improve Biomass Accumula tion and Carbon Sequestration: A Phytotron Study 81 Table 7.

This result agrees with a previous report that soil with low SOC usually has more potential to regain organic C than soil with high SOC [2]. Accumulation of SOC is a slow and long-term process. Sainju [19] reported that to observe differences in SOC under field conditions even w ith substantial C inputs by cover crops requires more than two years. Our previous study [16] with two years of cover crops grown in the field (KGL soil), showed no SOC in crease as compared to that of the fallow soil. Increased cropping intensity in crop rotations by reducing the frequency of bare fallow can increase crop production and C inputs to the soil [24]. Kuo and Jellum [11] also indicated that concentrations of C and N in the surface soil (0-15 cm) increased with increasing total C input from cover crops because sol accumulation of C and N is a function of the total input of organic C [40]. Bordovsky et al. [41] found that the surface (0-5 cm) SOC concentration increased with time in their 11-year field experiment following continuous cultivation of grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) in the Miles fine sandy loam soil in Texas. In Georgia cotton ( Gossypium hirsu- tum L.) production region with winter cover cropping system, SOC in the Dothan sandy loam at 0-10 cm in- creased by 6-8% over a period of 3 years with winter cover crops, such as rye ( Secale cereal L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). The rate of SOC sequestration was 233-300 kg C ha -1 yr-1 while the rate of loss was 167 kg C ha-1yr-1 in the soil without these cover corps [13]. Conversely, changing crop-fallow to continuous mono-culture or rotation cropping, or increasing the number of crops in a rotation system was less effective in seques- tering SOC as compared to shifting to no till practice [26]. Integrated agricultural prac tices, including cover crops with no tillage or at least with conservation tillage, are needed to improve soil C sequestration. Tillage or incor-poration of plant residues into the soil increases SOC mineralization [2,42]. In strip- and chisel-tilled plots, the SOC decreased by 3-17% and 4-17% in 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm depth, respectively, but in no till treatments, SOC increased by 6-8% with winter cover crops at 0-10 cm and by 0.4% with rye and 3% with biculture of vetch and rye at 0-30 cm [13]. The beneficial effects of growing cover crops in en- hancing SOC pool have been reported from around the world [43-45]. Furthermore, the enhancement of C se-questration by growing cover crops associated with con- servation tillage has been reported by a number of re- searchers [12,16,43,46,47] . For example, . [32] Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Growing Cover Crops Improve Biomass Accumula tion and Carbon Sequestration: A Phytotron Study 82 observed that hairy vetch under no till can improve SOC, and cover cropping associat ed with N fertilization can have effects in storing SOC in no tilled soils due to the reduction in mineralization rates of crop residues and soil organic matter. Metay et al. [46] found that no till with cover crop (Crotalaria) increased the storage of C in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) compared to disc tillage, with the latter only less than 10% of cover crop residues returned to the soil. No tillage or conservation tillage can conserve crop residues but cannot increase the soil C or biomass input. The SOC accumulation or C sequestration requires an increase in organic matter or crop residue inputs along with a decrease in decomposition rate of soil organic matter [2,3,48]. Paustian et al. [49] observed that SOC increases linearly with increased addition of crop resi- dues. Cover crops or cover cropping systems not only serve a large sink to remove the atmospheric CO 2 but also increases the biomass input into the soil. Therefore, cover cropping system combined with the conservation tillage has shown a great advantage in improving C se- questration and sustainable development in agriculture. The contribution of cover crops to SOC or carbon se-questration via assimilating atmospheric CO 2 into SOC has great potential in reducing the CO 2 concentration from the atmosphere. This potential may last at least a few decades because the SOC has been depleted over the world in arable land and may reach a new equilibrium in 50-100 years [3,26]. 4. Conclusions The total amounts of C accumulated by aboveground biomass varied greatly among both winter and summer cover crops. Therefore, choice of cover crops species is important for increased effici ency in biomass production and carbon sequestration. Soil and temperature influ- enced the biomass production and C accumulation under some circumstances. Biomass production and C accu-mulation of most winter cover crops, except white clover, were greater in the QFS soil than those in the KGL soil. Such difference was not evident with respect to the summer cover crops. When the aboveground cover crop biomass was returned to the soil for decomposition with over 127 days, about 73 and 52% of the aboveground biomass C was retained from the winter and summer cover crop residues, respectively. After a year rotation summer cover crops following winter cover crops, SOC increased by 13.8 and 31.9% in the KGL and QFS soil, respectively, compared to the respective soils prior to the experiment. This study has demonstrated improved SOC accumulation by sequestration of atmospheric C follow- ing the growth of cover crops. 5.

ABSTRACT Synthetic dyes are recalcitrant to degradation and toxic to d ifferent organisms. Physical-chemical treatments of textile wastewaters are not sustainable in terms of costs. Biological treatments can be more convenient and the lig- nin-degrading extracellular enzymatic battery of basidiomycetes scolor synthetic dyes. Many basidio- mycetes are edible mushrooms whose in dustrial production generates significant amount of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) with residual high levels of lignin-degrading extracellular enzymatic activities. We have demonstrated that the low cost organic substrate, the SMS deriving from the cultivation of the basid iomycetes Pleurotus ostreatus, chromo-acid baths containing surfactants and anti-foams, where the concentrations of the different dyes are exceeding the one recovered in the corresponding wastewaters. Laccase was the lignin-degrading extracellular enzyme involved in the discolouring process. The exploitation of the low cost SMS in the treatment of textile wastewaters is proposed. Accordingly, a toxi- cological assessment, based on a cyto-toxicity test on a human amnion epithelial cell line (WISH ) and the estimation of the germination index (GI%) of Lactuca sativa, Cucumis sativus and Sorghum bicolor, has been performed, showing the loss of toxicity of the chromo-baths after being discoloured by the SMS. Keywords : Anthraquinonic Dye, Diazo Dye, Laccase, Monoazo Dye, White Rot Fungi, Spent Mushroom Substrate 1. Introduction Synthetic dyes find application in different industrial divisions including textile industry. An annual con- sumption of about 0.7 million tons of synthetic dyes has been reported [1]. These compounds result to be recalcitrant to degradation and toxic for higher animals [2] and surface aquifers [3]. Textile industry alone ac-counts for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market. Ac- cordingly, discoloration of textile wastewaters is one of the major environmental concerns since last decades. Physical-chemical treatments such as coagulation/adsor- ption, electrolysis or ozonation are sometime unsuc-cessful or very expensiv e and frequently producing large amounts of toxic wastes [4]. At the same time, the strong electron-withdrawing groups characterizing the chemical structure of dyes protect them by the attack of bacterial oxygenases [5], affecting the treatment of textile wastewaters by conventional activated sludge plants. On the other hand, anaerobic digestions of various dyes produce toxic amines [6], which make the processes not recommended, unless combined with subsequent aerobic treatments to oxidize the toxic in- termediates [7]. In this scenario, the already reported capacities of fungi [8,9] with respect to aerobic oxidation [12], and extreme interest. Ligni- nolytic basidiomycetes causing white rot on wood, were shown to be the most promising fungi because of their capacity to produce a complex array of lignin-degrading extra-cellular enzymes, with very low substrate specific- ity towards xenobiotics [9]. The ligninolytic battery of extracellular enzymes of the basidiomycetes P. ostreatus has been described as capable to transform a very broad spectrum of waste substrates [14-16] including textile dyes [17]. However, it is worth to mention that P. ostreatus and many other basidiomycetes are edible Sustainable Discoloration of Textile Chromo-Baths by Spent Mushroom Substrate from the Industrial Cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus 86 mushrooms and their industrial cultivation produces a significant amount of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), reported as harboring high levels of residual oxidative enzymatic activity [18]. Actua lly, an average of 5 kg of SMS, are produced for 1 kg of mushrooms on the market, and the P. ostreatus production has increased over 500% in the last ten years, ranking the second or the third posi-tion in the context of edible mushroom industrial produc-tion in the world [19]. Thus, SMS would be a low cost source of ligninolytic enzyme [20-22]. However, the costs of purification of the latter can still negatively in-fluence the exploitation of the spent matrix in pollutants biodegradation. As far as we know, with the exception of the description of potential of the spent mushroom com-post of Pleurotus pulmonarius in synthetic pentachlo- phenol contaminated waters [23], no report on the poten-tial of the SMS from the cultivation of edible mushrooms as an oxidising matrix for th e treatment of industrial ef- fluents has been reported. The aim of this work was the recover and direct ex- ploitation of the low cost organic substrate, the SMS from the industrial production of P. ostreatus, to dis- colour complex chromo-baths used in textile industry. The feasibility of the process has been verified incu- bating the SMS directly in reactive and acid chromo- containing anthraquinonic, mono and diazo dyes, as single dyes or as a mix. In addition to dyes, the chromo-baths contained surfactants and anti-foams that are used as auxiliaries in the colouring process and normally released in textile wastewaters. Although usually not specifically investigated in terms of disap-pearance and generally used as biodegradable ingredi- ents, surfactants and anti-foams might interfere with the discolouring process or contribute to the toxicity of the textile effluents. The progressive discolouration of the different complex chromo-baths by the SMS were recorded in parallel with the evaluation of the loss of the here recorded toxicity. This latter has been moni-tored by a cyto-test on a human amnion epithelial cell line (WISH) and the estimation of the germination in- dex (GI%) of Lactuca sativa, Cucumis sativus oured chromo-baths. The li gninolytic enzymes poten- tially involved in the discolouring and detoxifying process have been monitored. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Chemicals, SMS, Seeds and Epithelial Cell Line Analytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy). The chromo-reactive and chromo- acid baths were provided by manufacturers, chemical components are reported in Table 1 . The real structure of the different dyes and auxiliari es were not disclosed by the manufactures, that categor ized the different chromo- baths in relation to the general classification of an- traquinonic, mono and diazo-g classified as alkylamine ethoxylated and silicon based chemicals. The SMS of Pleurotus ostreatus was obtained by a local mushroom farm. The human amnion epithelial cell line (WISH) was kindly provided by Prof. Francesco Sgarrella, University of Sassari (Italy). Plant seeds were obtained from the USDA-ARS North Central Regional Plant Introduction St ation, Iowa State Univer- sity, Ames, IA, USA. 2.2 Discoloration of the Chromo-Baths by the SMS The capacity of the SMS to discolor the chromo-baths was tested at 21 2C, in static and dynamic conditions (orbital shaking at 250 rpm) in sterile 2 L glass flasks incubated with plugs of SMS (0.3 cm thick), visually homogenously colonized by the fungal mycelium.

JEP Sustainable Discoloration of Textile Chromo-Baths by Spent Mushroom Substrate from the Industrial Cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus 87 SMS was collected for a total amount of 130 g of fresh weight and submerged in the glass flask containing 500 mL of the coloring bath diluted in 150 mM NaCl solution in water. The Black chro mo-Reactive Mix (BRM) was 10 and 5-fold diluted, an-thraquinonic Bath (BRaB), the monoazo Bath (RAmaB) were 5-fold diluted. Two flasks (one set) were prepared fo r each dilution. One set of flasks was not inoculated with SMS, the other was in- oculated with SMS previo usly autoclaved at 121 C, 1 atm for 20 minutes, respectively control sets for abiotic dis- coloration and for adsorption of the dye onto the SMS. A further set of flasks was prepared in sterile 150 mM NaCl solution in water to evaluate the contribution of the re-lease of pigmentation from SMS to the increase in the spectral absorbance of flask supernatants in the visible range. At each time-point, three volumes of supernatant of each flask were collected and analyzed for UV-Vis absorption between 400-800 nm (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). All the samples at time zero were diluted to give an absorbance < 1 and the same dilution has been used for samples corresponding to the succes-sive time points. The 150 mM NaCl solution served as blank. Percentage of discoloration with time of incuba- tion was quantified as the decrease of areas under the absorbance spectra of flask su pernatants at the different time-points of analysis and calculated against a baseline defined by the absorbance of supernatants from flasks without chromo-bath addition, at the corresponding time of analysis. The areas under the absorbance spectra were calculated by using PeakFit, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, California, USA. Decrease of the area under the spectra of supernatants deriving from flasks inoculated with autoclaved SMS with respect to the areas under spectra of supernatants from flask not inoculated with SMS was interpreted as percentage of adsorption of the dye onto SMS. 2.3 Enzymatic Activity Ligninolytic by a spectropho- tometer based method, in sa mple volumes of each flask supernatant collected in triplicate. Enzymatic activities were calculated as specific ac tivity. Total proteins were determined according to [24], using bovine serum albu- min as standard. All enzyme assays were performed at 37 \u00b1 0.5 C. Linearity with time a nd protein concentration was observed for all enzyme activities assayed. Laccase activity was determined as described by [25]. Manganese peroxidase and versatile peroxidase activity were deter-mined as described by [26]. Lignin peroxidase activity was measured as described by [27]. Enzymatic activities were detected before chromo-bath amendments, at the moment of the amendment of chromo-baths and at the end of the discoloring process. Laccase stability at different pH of incubation was monitored on 20 \u00b5l of control flask supernatant (no chromo-baths amended) incubated in different buffers and quantified using standard conditions at the time zero, after 3 and 24 hours of in cubation. Laccase stability at different temperature was monitored on 50 \u00b5L of control flask supernatant incubated for 15' at different tempera-ture. The effect of ionic strength on laccase activity was monitored in presence of increasing amounts of NaCl in the laccase mixture assay. 2.4 Isolation of P. ostreatus Mycelium of lected from the fungal fruiting body, streaked on a sterile potato dextrose agar plate and incubated for 1 week at 28C in the dark. The mycelium was maintained, through periodic transfer at 4C on potato dextrose agar plates in the presence of 0.5% yeast extract. Laccase activity has been monitored in liquid cultures prepared incubating 3 plugs (1 cm diameter) of the aseptically collected myce- lium, grown on the maintaining agar plates, in shaking flask (125 rpm/min) containing 250 ml potato dextrose (24 g/L) broth with 0.5% yeast extract at 28 C in the dark. At successive times, 1 mL of supernatant was collected in triplicate and analy zed for laccase activity. 2.5 Native Protein Gel Electrophoresis in Gradient of Polyacrylamide A 5-30% polyacrylamide gradient gel was performed at an alkaline pH under non-denaturing conditions. The separating gel contained a gradient of acrylamide from 5 to 30%, while the stacking gel contained 4% of acryla- mide. The electrode reservoir solution was 25 mM Tris-190 mM glycine (pH 8.4). A total of 60 ng of pro- teins deriving from the supernatants of 1) P. ostreatus mycelium grown in potato dextrose broth; 2) SMS in-cubated in control flasks; 3) SMS incubated in 5 fold diluted blue chromo-reactive bath (BRaB), were loaded on the gel that has been stained for laccase activity us- ing 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as substrate. Sample supernatants were col- lected at the time of maximum laccase activity for 1). 2.6 Seed Germination Test quots of undiluted different flask supernatants before and Copy \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Seed germination tests were performed in sterile Petri dish plates containing Whatman N.1 ashless filter imbibed with 10 ml of 1) control solution, 150 mM NaCl in water; flask supernatants 2) before and 3) after the SMS incubation. The plates were kept for 120 hrs in the dark at 25 \u00b1 1C. The germination indexes were calcu- lated from of germinated seeds and the cor- responding root length , according to was the mean number of germinated seeds and Ls the mean root length of germinated seeds in the sample; Gc was the mean number of germinated seeds and Lc the mean root length of the germinated seed in the control. The analy- ses were done in triplicate in plates containing 15 seeds for each set. 2.7 Cytotoxic Test The established WISH cell line derived from human am- nion epithelium has been routinely grown in RPMI me- dium 10% FBS and 5% CO 2/95% air atmosphere. The experi- ments were performed on 35 mm plates containing ap-proximately 1.000.000 of cells in RPMI complete me- dium maintained for 24 hours in the absence (control) or presence of volumes of the different flask supernatants corresponding to the dilutions of the chromo-baths used for the SMS discoloration. After incubation, plates were evaluated for the number of adhering cells to plates and for the trypan blue method [28] to evaluate the acute toxicity of the chromo-baths before and after discolora-tion with SMS. 2.8 Statistical Treatment of Data The analysis of variance of the data (ANOVA), has been performed by using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 for Windows 95, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, to evaluate the effects of different parameters of incubation on the discolouring process. The means of the significantly different main effects were compared by the Duncan's test at the 5% level using the Statistic program (Statsoft Inc., 1997). 3. Results 3.1 Discoloration of the Chromo-Baths In order to evaluate the potential of P. ostreatus SMS to discolor the black chromo-reactive mix (BRM), two dif- ferent dilutions of the latter were incubated in presence of the SMS. The incubation of the 10-fold diluted BRM was operated both in static and dynamic conditions. Dis- coloration of 10-fold diluted BRM, matched with a visi- ble effect to the naked eye. The 97% of discoloration occurred in 24 hrs ( Figure 1(a) ). The process has been observed only in presence of not autoclaved SMS and in dynamic incubation. In static condition a maximum of 8% of discoloration has been recorded. Due to the high percentage of discoloration observed in dynamic incubation with the 10-fold dilution, a 5-fold di-lution of BRM has been inoculated with the SMS only in dynamic incubation, because of the evidence that the oxy- genation was mandatory for discoloration. After 24 hrs, the 65% of discoloration has been observed; the 80% was recorded after 110 hrs of incubation (Figure 1(b) ). Figure 1.

No enzymatic activities have been detected in the supernatants of autoclaved SMS. Electrophoresis Enzymatic activities of lignin-degrading enzymes, measu- red before the addition of the chromo-baths to the dis- coloring sets of flasks, rev ealed that the lignin degrading battery of enzymes was limited to laccase.

Results obtained showed a very similar profile for the laccases recovered from the three super- natants (Figure 2(d) ). Table 2.

The en- zyme, whose optimum pH was between 4 and 5 (results not shown), showed a significant stability in a range of pHs between 5 and 10 and after 30 min of incubation up to 60 C. The laccase activity resulted to be 50% inhibited by 200 mM NaCl. 3.3 Germination and Cytotoxicity Test As a result of the germination tests, all the chromo-baths were extremely toxic because of the significant inhibition of seed germination that was nearly absent in the case of incubation in chromo-reactive baths for all the three plant species analyzed (Figures 3(a)-(d)). Acid baths were also extremely toxic (GI% < 50%), even though a certain percentage of germination has been observed (20%) with the exception of Lactuca sativa that was strongly inhibited in germination by the Red chromo-acid bath ( Figures 3(a)-(d)). The discoloration of all the chromo-baths de-termined the loss of toxicity of the discolored baths with a recover of the GI% to values (nearly 100%) communi- cated for the selected pl ant seeds by the USDA-ARS North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station ( Fig- ures 3(a)-(d) ). A human amnion epithelial cell line (WISH) has been used to determine the effect exerted by the chromo-baths on the cell viability. The WISH cells subjected to incuba- tion with chromo-baths showed a significant decrease of the number of adhering (healthy) cells ( Figure 3(e)) and a significant increase of the percentage of dead cells (stained by trypan blue) ( Figure 3(f) ) compared to con- incubated in PBS 5-fold diluted in RPMI me-dium (control medium). The discoloration of the chromo- baths by SMS incubation removed their toxic effect: the number of adhering cells and the percentage of dead cells, were not significantly different as compared to the con-trol ( Figures 3(e) -(f)). 4. Discussion Both azo and anthraquinonic dyes are associated to a high ecotoxicity and high recalcitrance to discoloration [12,29]. Our results demonstrated that, in aerated (oxida- tive) conditions, a low cost organic substrate, the SMS from P. ostreatus cultivation, discolored industrial chromo-baths containing either monoazo, diazo and an- thraquinonic dyes, either as single dyes or as a mix of them. Being interested in SMS exploitation for discol-ouring textile wastewaters, the capacity of the organic substrate has been tested on industrial chromo-baths, instead of aqueous solution of single synthetic dyes. In fact, the formers have a higher similarity to the real in- dustrial wastewaters, since containing auxiliaries of the dying process (mainly surfactants, anti-foams and salts), that actually are also released in real wastewaters and potentially can interfere with the discolouring process. The dilution of the chromo-baths, here tested for discol- oration, contained the different chemicals at concentra- tions definitely higher than the one recovered in the real wastewaters. In fact, they contained dyes and auxiliaries in concentration up to the 20% of the initial chromo-bath mass used in the dying process, while it is estimated that the amount of textile dyes released in wastewaters during the industrial process accounts for the 10% of the total used [30]. Thus, the SMS was capable to discolour dif-ferent chromo-baths at similar or higher concentrations than the one recovered in real textile wastewaters. The efficiency of the SMS in th e described process was dif- ferent in relation to the different chromo-baths. Reactive baths resulted more recalcitrant than acid one, even though a comparison is either questionable because of the difference in chemical components of the different chromo-baths, and difficult since the real structures of the different dyes and chromo-baths auxiliaries, indicat- ing their putative recalcitran ce to biodegradation, were not provided by the manufacturers. However, in 24 hrs the discoloration of every chromo-baths tested accounted for the 70-90% of the total. Abiotic discoloration and adsorption were excluded by the persistence of colours in sets of flasks not incubated with the SMS and in sets of flasks where every biologic al activity has been elimi- nated by autoclaving. Thus, the occurrence of a biotic process has been explored monitoring the ligninolytic activity of fungal extracellular enzymes, eventually asso- ciated to the grow of P. ostreatus on the SMS. Laccase resulted to be either the only enzymatic activity measur- able from the incubation of the SMS in a saline solution and in presence of the different chromo-baths and the only enzymatic activity recovered during the time inter- val corresponding to the discoloration process. Actually during discoloration, laccase activity increased either in presence or absence of chro mo-baths. Results obtained indicated the ligninolytic l accase as the enzymatic activ- ity involved in the discolouring process. The hypothesis was confirmed by the nearly absence of discoloration in static condition, because in accordance with the known mechanism of catalytic reactio n of the enzyme that uses molecular oxygen as electron donor to catalyze reactions consequently occurring in oxidative (aerated) condi-tions. The laccase recovered in the supernatant colouring baths showed peculiar traits. Laccases from basidiomycetes are generally considered acidic enzymes not active at basic pH, characteristic actually not con- venient for the exploitation of the enzyme in the treat- ment of textile wastewaters, which are essentially asso- ciated to neutral up to basic pH. However, the laccase produced by P. ostreatus growing on the SMS, although displaying an acidic optimum of pH, showed activity and igh stability at neutral to strong basic pH.

JEP 92 interesting trait of the here investigated enzyme was re- lated to the capacity to catalyse discoloration at high ionic strength. Also this characteristic results to be of interest because of the nature of textile wastewaters that are often associated to high ionic strengths. In fact, the laccase from SMS discoloured acid chromo-baths in in- cubation media containing two different salts, NaCl 150 mM and NH 4SO 4 227 mM. The enzyme resulted to be 50% inhibited by NaCl 200 mM, but the discoloration of acid baths occurred in only 24 hrs. The enzyme showed also a significant stability with respect to the temperature of incubation, and all the characteristics previously de-scribed make the laccase from P. ostreatus SMS ex- tremely attractive for industrial application, suggesting the exploitation of the SMS not only as a low cost sub- strate with oxidative capacity, but also as a source of robust laccase. In this cont ext, the induction of laccase production could be advantageous for enzyme-purifying purpose, even though, in the experimental condition here explored, an effect of induction of the chromo-baths on the ligninolytic battery of enzymes eventually associated to the SMS was absent. Actually dyes induction of oxi-dative enzyme, comprising laccase, has been observed in fungi [31]. However, the process can not be defined a generic effect of dyes on fungal metabolisms [32]. On the other hand, results obtained comparing the isoforms of laccases from different supernatants by native elec- trophoresis showed that P. ostreatus was able to produce the enzyme (with similar profile) in very different growth conditions, spanning from the one related to the presence of an easily available carbon source (rich broth where the fungus grows in axenic culture ), to growth condition with a more complex carbon source, eventually not sustaining the production of fruiting body and in presence of chromo-baths (onto SMS). Laccases from basidiomy- cetes have been described as capable to quite efficiently decolorize azo-dyes and, in relation to anthraquinonic dyes, the enzymes are reported as more efficient than other oxidases [33]. However, as far as we know, this is the first report on putative laccase capacity to discolour azo and anthraquinonic dyes in mixtures of chemicals chromo-baths, containing high concentra- tions of different surfactants, anti-foams and salt. In rela- tion to the experimental condition adopted, the extremely versatile laccase oxidative cap acity here observed, can be interpreted as related to the co-presence of the enzyme and eventually of chemical redox mediators deriving from the ligninolytic activity of the basidiomycetes. Me-diators act as electron transf er between the enzyme and very different substrates characterised by high redox state [34,35]. They can also acceler ate oxidative processes in terms of kinetics of reactions involved [36,37]. Actually, intermediates of the process of lignin degradation, de-fined as natural mediators, are reported as the best one to use for dye discoloration by laccase [38]. With reference to the here described discolouring incubations, it is rea-sonable to assume that the ligninolytic activity of P. ostreatus , growing on a lignin containing substrate as the SMS, released these or analogous intermediates in the dis- colouring supernatants. Thus, the occurrence of natural mediators might be the reason of the peculiar capacity of the P. ostreatus SMS to discolour a plethora of different chromo-baths, with different chemical compositions, by the quite efficient kinetics of reactions here observed. Moreover, as a matter of fact, the Annex I of the Dan- gerous Substances Directive in the European Union (EU) describe some dye as toxic or mutagenic and others as skin sensitizers for consumers [Council Directive 67/ 548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations, and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging, and labeling of dangerous substances. Offi- cial Journal of the European Communities, June 27, 1967; Vol. 196, p 1.]. At the same time, some discolouring process are associated to th e production of toxic interme- diates of dyes oxidation process [4,6]. Thus, any ap-proach for the treatment of textile wastewaters must be focused either on discolouring and detoxifying processes. Accordingly, the opportunity to exploit the SMS from P. ostreatus in the treatment of textile wastewaters has been verified by the toxicological assessment of the process, based on a cyto-toxicity test on a human amnion epithelial cell line (WISH) and a phyto-toxicity test on germinating seeds of Lactuca sativa, Cucumis sativus and Sorghum bicolor . The results obtained showed a strong toxicity of the chromo-baths related either to the cyto-toxicity exerted on cultured human amnion epithe-lial cells (WISH) and to the phyto-toxicity exerted on seed of different plant species. The discoloration of chromo-baths by the SMS was associated to the loss of toxicity either on WISH cells and plant seeds. In conclusion, the SMS from P. ostreatus resulted to be capable to either discolour and detoxify a plethora of different chromo-baths containing complex mixtures of chemicals with recognised t oxic effect for the environ- ment. The versatility of the low cost organic substrate is related at least to the laccase activity deriving from P. ostreatus , even though other elements favouring oxida- tion cannot be excluded. All in all, the development of processes of treatment of textile wastewaters based on the exploitation of the substrate, either as a source of robust enzymes or as a versatile low cost organic sub- strate with oxidative capacity, results to be sustainable in terms of costs and eventually profitable for the design of an integrated management of the disposal of the SMS as an organic waste. 5.

ABSTRACT In literature concerning ionic liquid (IL) applications, the commonly accepted properties of ionic liquids are frequently mentioned. For example, ionic liquids are described as possessing immeasurably low vapor pressure, being \"green material \", non-coordinating, physically and chemically stable, and non-toxic, to name a few. However, all these de- scriptions are deemed \"not exact\" [1] as intensive research on ionic liquid properties continues. This review highlights the most recent developments in IL chemistry where the \"well-known\" description of IL properties sometimes proves to be inaccurate. However, in the authors' opinion, all thes e new research developments c oncerning ionic liquid proper- ties serve to update knowledge on the typical physical and chemical properties of ILs, which is significant to both theo-retical research and industrial applications. This review presents an opportunity to understand IL through a more com- plete and accurate view. It seeks to pave the way for further studies on IL application in various fields. Keywords : Ionic Liquids, Functionalized Ionic Liquids, Volatility, Polarity, Green Chemistry 1. Introduction Scientific and technical research on ionic liquid (IL) ap- plication has progressed over the last 20 years. Interest has been derived from ILs' unique advantageous proper- ties, such as non-volatility, versatile solubility, and sta-bility, to name a few. These properties present ILs as a promising alternative to environmentally undesirable volatile organic solvents, especially chlorinated hydro-carbons. Successful industrial processes using ionic liq- uids appear to confirm such advantages [2]. Another important feather on the cap of ILs is the abil- ity of their molecular structur e to be tailored according to application requirements. This has spurred the rise of task-specific ionic liquids, or the so-called functionalized ionic liquids [3-5]. Existing studies on ILs, especially the earlier ones, re- iterated the following advantageous properties: 1) No measurable vapor pressure or non-volatility 2) Low toxicity 3) High polarity 4) Non-coordination 5) Physical and chemical stability The above-mentioned description appeared at a time when only limited kinds of ionic liquids were available, especially those based on imidazolium salts. In-depth investigations were not carried out. Nevertheless, as re- search progressed and a number of new ILs were synthe- sized, the said properties were proven to be non-standard. Various results obtained from newer research works offered counterexamples to the said properties. For ex- ample, IL vapor pressure can now be measured and ILs can be distilled. Further, the toxicity tests of commonly used ILs in bioassays prove that they are considerably toxic. Furthermore, the commonly used \"stable\" 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([emim][Tf 2N]) was even tested as a propellant for space shuttle. Based on these, the authors conclude that the traditional description has been rendered incomplete and inappropriate. In addition, the IL varieties that trigger property change are, to a cer tain extent, ignored and not realized systematically. To date, there is a significant number of high-quality reviews on IL research activities, from the early ones that generally focused on catalysis [6-13], to current detailed descriptions of specified applications such as coordina-tion chemistry [14], physicochemical properties [18], and nanotechnology [19]. All these reviews contribute largely to the rapid rise and stimula- tion of research interest on ILs. Revisiting Characteristics of Ionic Liquids: A Review for Further Application Development Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP 96 This review attempts to highlight the new findings concerning ionic liquid properties, specifically those in- dicating that the ILs' \"well-known\" descriptions should be updated and even corrected. The authors believe that a careful recognition of IL properties based on recent dis-coveries is essential to res earch and application. Instead of nullifying the unique value of ionic liquids, this will provide an opportunity to explore new avenues for re-search and application. W ithout a doubt, a more com- plete and accurate understanding of IL properties will be beneficial for further studie s concerning these \"magic\" liquids. 2. among the most common descriptions ascribed to vapor pressure of ionic liquids. It was therefore logical to assume that ionic liquids are non-volatile and impossible to distill, especially since they are co mposed completely of ions [20]. Early investigations of proper- ties using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [21] proved that they possessed minimal vapor pressure up to their thermal decomposition temperature. This property is considered an advantage when applied to the distillation process because the azeotrope formation between the solvent and products does not occur. In addition, this charac teristic is expected to ease manipulation and puri- fication, and facilitate multiphasic application and recy-cling [22]. Vapor pressure research related to ILs was almost refined in the binary or multimixed system of ILs and other volatile liquids [23- 29]. There were reports on the theoretical estimation of ILs' thermodynamic proper- ties, including the calculation of vapor pressures [30-32]. However, this feature led to certain limitations such as problems in distilling ionic liquids to achieve extreme purity or the almost-impossible use of the ionic liquids in the gas phase. One exception is the protic ionic liquids written as [HC] + [A], which can be vaporized like equi- librium forming [C][HA], which are both volatile [33] (Scheme 1 ). However, the reverse protic transfer is found recently can be controlled by changing cation type, for example, superbase cations by which the thermal sta- bility is greatly enhanced [34]. Information purporting that \"ionic liquid cannot be distilled\" and \"their vapor pressure cannot be measured\" has been nullified only recently. A report on one-stage Scheme 1. Distillation process of protic ionic liquids distillation of imidazolium ionic liquid of [Tf 2N] anion under reduced pressure at moderate temperature was published [35] The authors used experimental surface tension and density measurement, as well as E\u00f6tvos or Guggenheim empirical equations, to estimate the critical points related to the IL's normal boiling points. Accord- ing to the study's results, measuring ILs' vapor pressure is possible, owing to a wide window of possible experi-mental working temperature of obtained boiling point data. Ionic liquids, [C 10mim][Tf 2N], and [C 12mim][Tf 2N] were found to be readily distilled under 450 K and 1 Pa pressure. Shortly after, the experimental vapor pressure data were measured via the Knudsen method. Within the temperature range of 458-517 K, the relationship be-tween vapor pressure and temperature was obtained [36, 37]. More recently, studies proved that a broader series of ionic liquid of [Tf 2N] anion could be distilled at 473-573 K under low pressure using the Kugelrohr apparatus ionic liquids of triflu oroacetate or formate anion, however, can be distilled more easily using the standard method under normal pressure and temperature [39]. As mentioned above, the Lewis acidity/basicity is believed to produce the main effect on protic ionic liquids' vola- tile property [33]. From discov- ering a large number of distillable ionic liquids, it is needless to predict that the non-volatile advantage of ionic liquids is diminishing. However, all these observa- tions broaden the field of ionic liquid property research and may lead to wider applications. 3. Are Ionic Liquids Really that Green? Because of ionic liquids' \"immeasurably\" low vapor pressure under normal conditions [10], they are consid-ered as \"greener\" solvents rather than volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that emit pollution to the atmosphere. This \"greenness\", however, merely satisfies certain parts of the 12 principles of Green Chemistry [40] if ionic liq- uids are used in chemical processes. Unfortunately, this has been misinterpreted as possessing broader green prop- erties such as low toxicity and biodegradability. It should be noted that a considerable number of precursors to ionic liquids were labeled as toxic and environmentally haz-ardous, and the toxicity and biodegradability of ionic liq- uids generated thereof require further investigation. Looking into the hazards involved in using ionic liq- uids was not attempted until 2003 [41]. The authors of the study theoretically used the structure-activity rela- tionship to discuss the toxicity and ecotoxicity of a selec-tion of commonly used ILs. The direct toxicity analyses of ILs followed thereafter, mainly using bacteria or cells as targets. Examples included vibrio fischeri and WST-1 cell [42,43], human tumor cell Characteristics of Ionic Liquids: A Review for Application Development Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP 97 Escherichia acetylcholineste- rase [49]. The acute toxic effects of ILs on various high forms of organisms, plant or animals, were likewise tested; these Different ionic liquids displayed diverse toxicity to the bio subjects used in the said research. In addition, various method- ologies were developed and investigated for better un-derstanding of this toxicity issue, such as the quantitative structure-property relationship modeling [56], lipophilic- ity, and metabolic pathway prediction of ILs [57]. Despite various efforts to discover whether or not ionic liquids are toxic, as well as the possible extent of toxicity, researchers have yet to arrive at a clear answer because of acceptors' and ILs' variability. In certain reports, for example, compared with traditional sol- vents, imidazolium-based ionic liquids are reportedly more toxic to microorganisms [43]. However, a number of reports claim that the lactic acid-producing bacte-rium still grows faster in the presence of imida- zolium-based ionic liquids than in hexane [45]. Certain primitive trends on the commonly used ionic liquids were found, such as an increase in toxicity of aquatic organisms as the number of nitrogen atoms in the ca- tion increases [56]. The biodegradability of ILs are similarly an object of research interest, and the Closed Bottle Test (OECD 301D) is commonly used to administer the biodegrad-ability test. At present, the biodegradability of traditional non-functionalized ILs, such as those based on [C 4mim]+, are hard to be biotic-degraded [58]; and the abiotic deg- radation impossible for [C 4mim][BF 4] [59]. Despite the fact that many ionic liquids exhibit toxicity and create a negative impact on the environment, it should be remembered that ce rtain parts of toxic ILs are not necessarily indicating that all the ILs are toxic. Fur-thermore, ionic liquids in principle can be modified to be non-toxic. Previous studies have reported that ILs can be obtained from biodegradable and renewable resources [60-68]. With infinite possibilities for designing ionic liquids, the authors of this study are optimistic that IL can be designed to be non-toxic, readily degradable, and even edible. For example, the following shown ionic liquids can be classified as \"readily biodegradable\" [69] (Scheme 2 ). It is also possible to design ionic liquid pos- sessing a toxicity level that serves a specific need. For instance, ionic liquids extraction of Para Red and Sudan dyes from chilli powder, chilli oil and food additive combined with high performance liquid chromatography has been reported very recen tly [70], which shows appli- cation potentials of ILs in food industries, especially in analytical applications [71,72]. Scheme 2. Biodegradable pyridinium ionic liquids Until now, the toxicity related investigation is still a hot topic concerning safety issue of ionic liquids, among which detailed research activities are carried out con-tinuously [73-75]. A Agar Diffusion Test has also been developed for clarification of biocompatibility of wa-ter-miscible ionic liquids [76]. 4. Do Ionic Liquids have high Polarity? Polarity is a physical property of compounds related to other physical properties such as melting and boiling points, solubility, and intermolecular interactions [77]. Ionic liquids have been considered as polar solvents, such as those suitable for charged compounds, possibly because of their ionic nature. The first polarity investigation of ionic liquids using the solvatochromic dye method emerged in 2000, postu-lating that imidazolium-based ILs possess a polarity similar to lower alcohols [78]. Various methods were subsequently developed to determine the polarity of ILs, such as fluorescent density functional calculations (DFT) [85]. These different me-thods resulted in accordance, but a definitive standard has not been established for ionic liquid polarity. How-ever, all these tests revealed that ILs were not as polar as expected. On the contrary, they demonstrated considera-bly low polarity [86]. The polarity of ILs is responsible for their ability to dissolve solutes. The solubility of many non-polar sub-stances in [87], carbon monox-ide [88], and fullerene [89], has been tested. It has been found that hydrogen and carbon monoxide possessed solubility that is quite higher than what was initially ex-pected. In the case of ioni c liquid of cation with long alkyl chain, the solubility of H 2 is higher than non-polar organic solvents like benzene. C 60 can likewise be dis- solved in ILs at concentration of up to 0.1 mg/ml. There are as well reports on the CH 4 dissolution into low- po- larity designed ILs [90]. It is reasonable to state that ILs can dissolve not only polar solutes or charged solute via ionic liquid structure design, but also various non-polar compounds. However, a more comprehensive investigation on solute-solvent interactions has yet to be performed.

A decade ago, ILs were generally perceived as non-co- ordinating, which implied that their anions were non- coordinating as well [6-13]. Various scientific publica-tions ILs were \"poorly coordinating\" or \"weakly coordinating\" [91]. However, recent reports have claimed that ILs are indeed coordinating [92-94]. The coordinating ability is a tendency to donate elec- tron(s) to form a chemical bond [95]. In traditional imi- dazolium IL systems, the cationic part displays minor coordinating ability, thus the coordinating abilities are determined by the anionic part [96]. The chloride or bromide displays strong coordinating abilities, and this is reflected in many crystallographic studies as well as NMR and IR studies [97,98]. For other anions, however, especially those that reduce the viscosities and melting points of ionic liquids (e.g., [BF 4]-, [SO 3CF 3]-), there is little evidence obtained from X-ray crystallography. De-localization of the negative charge within the anionic core O-S-N-S-O for [Tf 2N]-, 3CF the columbic attraction between the anion and the weakly acidic organic cations (i.e., low lattice energy and lo w melting points). They are assumed to be non-coordi nating because the negative charge is highly delocalized over electron-negative fluo- rine atoms. However, as the chemistry of ILs continued to advance, there rose evidences that ev en the above-mentioned ILs demonstrate coordinating abilities towards main group metals and transition metals. Recent studies of several commonly used ILs through in situ re-crystallization suggest that the intermolecula r C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions are likewise commonly present in these ILs. The hydrogen bonding network differs depending on the anions, work, C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interactions were equally found in other ionic liquids with [SO 3CF 3] anion [100]. From the fact that these ILs can donate electrons to H atoms, it is reasonable to imply that they can likewise coordinate to Lewis acidic metals and exhibit a coordinating property. The coordinating abilities of ILs have been utilized in various processes as well. An interesting example is that [BF 4] anion exhibits a coordinating ability towards BF 3; this process has been successfu lly used in the storage and Scheme 3. Anion coordination of imidazolium ionic liquids transport of highly toxic gases such as BF 3 [101,102]. It is believed that the fluorine atoms in the anion can inter- act as donor to the boron atom of the BF 3 molecule, and a Lewis acid and base complex can be formed through this process. In another example, the [CH 3BF 3(CH 2)2CN] anion displays coordination ability towards potassium 3 ). The coordinating abilities of [PF 6] anions was investi- gated and compared with the molecular solvents di- chloromethane [91]. Owing to the coordinating behavior of the [PF 6] anion, the IL of [PF 6]- can be successfully used as both catalyst and solvent for olefin polymeriza- tion [91]. The m echanism is believed to be the coordination of F atoms in the [PF 6] anion, which activates the olefin. Polymeri zation can thus be induced in the presence of a nickel catalyst ( Scheme 4 ). Anion [Tf 2N] has been frequently used as ionic liquid anion to reduce IL viscosity; this can improve ionic con- ductivity as well. To date, its rich coordination chemistry remains unexplored. However, recent studies suggest that [Tf 2N] is a versatile coordinating anion that can interact with transition metals in various modes. For example, N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis (triflouromethanesu- fonyl) imide [92] reacts with YbI a complex in which the [Tf 2N] anions coordinate with the Yb center in a chelating mode using the two oxygen atoms as donors. The cation was included in the final structure to balance the charge. The O-Yb distances were between 241.0 to 251.7 pm, the latter being the longest among all complexes with Yb-O bonds. All the ligands showed cissoids conformation with respect to the CF 3 groups ( Scheme 5 ). With transition metals, Ti, Fe, Ru, and [Tf 2N] anions can use its donor O or N to coordinate metal centers forming 2-O, O, or 2-O, N, ). Ionic liquids appear to coordinate from birth and it should be noted that ionic liquids can be designed to co-ordinate deliberately by incorporating coordination groups. Ionic liquids containing various coordinating functionalities that can coordinate to main group metals and transition metals were reported. i This has evoked a change in ionic liquid chemistry. These functionalized ionic liquids have been successfully used in catalysis, coordination polymers, and gas-absorption. This aspect had been reviewed previously [4]. Apart from the cation coordinating ILs, a number of ILs bearing coordination groups in the anion have likewise been reported [106]. 6. Stable Versus Energetic The stability of a very limited number of ionic liquids has been misleadingly accorded to all ionic liquids. In fact, the earliest examples based on [AlCl 4] anions were extremely air-sensitive, so much so that their application has been very limited [107,108].

The high thermal stability has been an ad- Scheme 7. Energetic ionic liquids vantage in many applications. However, there have been reports alleging that they decompose when heated in the presence of water, thus emitting HF [109]. Detailed stability studies on ILs have been extensively reported and reviewed [66,110,111]. Imidazolium-based ILs are not stable under basic conditions. In the presence of strong bases, they decompose to produce Manich- elimination products [112]. Phosphonium ILs are more inert against strong bases, so that reactions using strong bases, such as Grignard re agents, can be carried out among phosphonium ILs. The results, however, are not better than molecular solvents such as THF [113]. In fact, stability can also been obtained through ionic liquid structure design. For example, a series of geminal dica-tionic ionic liquids were reported, among which the sta-ble range can be -4 to 400 [114]. Meanwhile, ILs can be design ed as unstable yet ener- getic [100,115-119]. For example, Shreeve et al. have designed and synthesized a series of triazolium, tetraa-zolium- based ILs, especially those with 3] anions ( Scheme 7 ) that can be exposed at considerably low temperature so that they can be used as energetic materials [120-123]. These works have been covered in a recent review [124]. It is important to emphasize that in general, organic nitrates and perchlorates are potentially explosive, especially when rigorously dried. Although no problems have been reported to date, care should be tak-en at all times when handling these. It has been reported that a large number of ILs, including commercially available ILs, are combustible owing to the positive heat formation, oxygen content, and decomposition products [125].

JEP 100 It is important to note that there is a significant number of functionalized ILs that are now available, though their stability has not been routinely investigated. 7. Perspectives This review aims to arrive at a gradual understanding of the following knowledge on IL properties, which is con-tinuously being updated: 1) Some ionic liquids can be readily distilled. 2) Some ionic liquids are proven toxic and envi- ronmentally hazardous. 3) Some ionic liquids are low polar. 4) Ionic liquids are normally coordinating. 5) Ionic liquid stability can be controlled through molecular design. All these changes demonstrate a quiet but ongoing transformation in our understanding of IL properties. Instead of arresting the development of IL applications, the realization and deeper understanding of IL properties can lead to innovation and app lication to more fields, as illustrated in Figure 1 . 8.

ABSTRACT The common practice of managing solid waste (SW) generated by supermarkets in Mexicali, Mexico, consists of mixing all kinds of SW without any separation process. The concern of these actions is that does not involve some of these products to be reused or sold for recycling. The company ceases to receive an income of $ 3,881 Mexican pesos as an additional benefit by the generation of approximately 5,869 kg of SW than can be recovered in only one of its eleven branches in the city. However, the only two products that are valued by the supermarkets are wax boxes for fruits and vegetables which are sold to a company that subsequently rese ll them to fruit shops for reuse, and the cardboard boxes, whose weekly generation in one branch is 5,375 kg. They are separated from the waxed boxes and placed in a compac- tor to form bales from 300 to 400 kg each and then are collected for sale to a recycling company. As for the generation of different types of plastics that can be recycled, a branch generates weekly 339 kg. The model to simulate the genera- tion of SW in supermarkets was performed using \" system dynamics \" as a tool for modeling and simulation in order to make better decisions to reduce generation of waste. Keywords : Solid Waste, Supermarket, Model, System Dynamics 1. Introduction Mexican Law defines \"waste\" any material or product that is solid or semisolid, which was discarded in con- tainers or tanks and can be capable of being valued or require treatment [1]. Mexican environmental policy promotes integrated waste management through waste minimization, reuse, recycling, source separation, and recovery of materials and energy [2]. Some wastes have value for the company and are used for their benefit [3] reduci ng the environmental impact [4]. Disposal of these wastes in the form of garbage im- plies a high cost to societ y [5] because the places where waste can be deposited with the proper conditions of health and safety must be enabled [6]. Mexico produced 36.8 million tons of SW in 2007 and only 3.8% was recovered for recycling purposes. For 2009, the estimated SW generation was 38.3 million tonnes of which only 68% were disposed in landfills or controlled sites [7]. The separation of re-usable materials from landfills is a common economic activity developed by people working in low economic conditions. Cur-rently, the separation takes pl ace mainly in the informal sector of scavengers that separate the material before harvesting or before final disposal [8]. In 2007 in Mexicali were collected 773 tons of non- hazardous SW, and in 2008 were generate d 850 tons. Due to the increase in municipal and commercial SW Mexicali opened about 54 thousand m 3 of landfill cell in the Ejido Benito Ju\u00e1rez. This increased the capacity of solid waste landfill and impacted positively on the qual-ity of life for Mexicali residents [9]. An unknown amount of SW was generated by the supermarket sector, including 35 stores [10], which are considered commer-cial establishments [11]. The supermarket is a commercial establishment [11], of retail [12] with a wide range of self-service products [13] designed to meet the needs of food and household products of consumers [14] with an area between 501 to 4.500 m2 [15]. Every day, tons of waste are generated in the form of packaging, plastics, nonferrous metals, or- ganic, and others that are not managed for reuse or recy- cling [8]. The main issues for consideration by the supermarket sector in the recycling of ma terials includes: identify the Systemic Analysis of Supermarket Solid Waste Generation in Mexicali, Mexico 106 materials are diverted from the waste stream, the reuse and recycling and the specifications of the buyers of re- covered materials [16]. 2. Methodology The research methodology includes, characterization of SW generated in the supermarket, conceptual model de- sign, development of a quantitative model, and simula- tion of the generation of SW at supermarket. The results were analyzed in an Excel spreadsheet from Microsoft and to develop and simulate the system dynamics models were used Vensim and Stella programs. 2.1 Characterization of Solid Waste Generated in the Supermarket The operations manager of a regional supermarket chain located in Mexicali was interv iewed in order to request permission to perform the char acterization of solid waste generated. The characterization was performed in only one branch of that chain in the supermarket it was not possible to apply the sampling technique under the quar- tering using Standard NMX-AA-015-1985 since to ho- mogenize the waste was difficult to obtain a uniform sample [17]. For this reason, it was decided to sample in situ adapting Standard NMX-AA-019-1985 to obtain the weight of waste in kg rather than the volumetric weight (kg/m3) [18]. The decision reflects the fact that super- market managers did not agree to compact the waste and not to wait to fill a container of known volume. For this reason, the garbage was placed in the container as they would be generated. For the waste characterization it was necessary to use a scale at the temporary dispos al site within each super- market where each head of department maintained the waste generated before being deposited in the container. The residues were separated by-product and placed on the scales and subtracting the tare. The results were re- corded in a log sheet following the registration form by-products of the Standard NMX-AA-022-1985 [19]. The adequacy of the format was evaluated according to the predominance of the type of waste found and that some of the items listed in re cord format of the standard were absent or the amounts found were minimal [20]. Thus, all waste generated in a day of activities within the supermarket was characterized. 2.2 Design the Conceptual Model The elements of the system and their relationship were determined based on the objective. These were classi- fied according to their specific role in the structure of the system and the relations between components that generate the dynamics of the system were also identi- fied [21]. Finally, it was drawing up the formal outline of the conceptual model using the symbology of \"System Dy- namics\" [22]. The data used to feed the model are the initial value of solid waste in the container and cardboard in the area of receipt, the pa ckaging for recycling fraction, the fraction of waste packages for the weekly flow of cardboard and paper, plastics, construction waste, wood, glass, garbage, organic waste, nonferrous metals, and shrinkage. 2.3 Development of the Quantitative Mode In the analysis, the quantitative model of the system un- der study was developed using the conceptual model as a basis, and thus set the rules governing the flow of mate- rial into the system using mathematical representations. 2.4 Simulation of the Generation of SW Several runs were made of the proposed models by comparing the system behavior under different condi- tions of interest. 3.

Conclusions and Discussion Supermarkets should classi fy the types and quantities of solid waste being generated and also the tools that are available to separate at source, that is, they must carry out a sustainable management of waste generated as this concept is based on identification of the possible Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Proper management of solid waste allows the company to earn additional income to cover some of their expenses. The supermarket sector must be able to assess the en- vironmental conflict that is generated by improper man- agement of their waste and take part in the settlement through their involvement. They should not wait for the authorities verification, resulting in penalties and a poor image for the company. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the authorities to encourage the creation of companies engaged in the collection and recycling of packaging [7]. Using \"dynamic systems\" as a tool, it is possible to model and simulate the generation of solid waste in su- permarkets, which allows observing the operation and behavior of each product generated. It is also possible to include additional variables that allow better decisions to reduce generation of waste. 5.

ABSTRACT Our understanding of the indirect effect of changes in solar output and feedbacks in the climate system is minimal. There is much need to refine our understanding of key natural forcing mechanisms of the climate, including solar ir- radiance changes, in order to reduce uncertainty in our projections of future climate change. Through the recent years, the conflict between researchers about whether global warming is a human-generated phenomenon or a result of solar variability has raised many question marks. The aim of this work is to try to answer some of these questions by studying the possible role of some solar variability parameters such as the geomagnetic index (aa) and the sunspot number (Rz) in global temperature changes. Here, we present a correlative study of the possible contributions for the two compo- nents that may be closely associated with the climate, throughout the last 130 years (1880-2008). We compared the correlation analysis and the power spectral density (PSD) of the Rz and aa with that of the continuous records of the GT in order to get a closer look at a possible connection between them. Our results displayed that the correlations be-tween both (aa & GST ) and (Rz & GST ) are + 0.66 and + 0.38, respectively when both parameters Rz and aa precedes by 2-3 yrs. The correlation of GST-aa is two times higher than that of GST-Rz. The GST spectrum reflected significant periods at 21.3-yr, 10.7-11.6 yr variations that observed in the considered geomagnetic and sunspot spectra. Keywords: Global Rurface Temperature, Geomagnetic Indices, Solar Variability 1. Introduction The debate concerning global warming has been the concern of researchers for a long time. Global warming is a term used to describe an increase over time of the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans . It plays an important role in the ongoing public debat e concerning global warming and the risk of man-made climate change. Where the global surface temperature has increased by factor 0.8 \u00b1 0.02 is observed in the last 150 yr [1]. Researchers have attrib- uted the increase in global su rface temperature to the rise in greenhouse effect caused by the increase of carbon dioxide emitted by man made [2], others attributed global warming to the decrease of the sulfate aerosols. Climate model s, driven by estimates of increasing CO 2 and to a lesser extent by generally decreasing sulfate aerosols, predict that temperatures will increase (with a range of 1.4 to 5.8 for the years between 1990 and 2100). There are many other parameter that effect on the global surface temperature similar solar activity. The effect of solar cycle lengths upon global temperature changes has also been the co ncern of researchers [3,4]. Other [5] demonstrated a stro ng correlation between so- lar cycle lengths and Northern Hemisphere temperatures over the period 1860-1990. Following studies [3-6] have taken an update data of the same results. Indices of geomagnetic disturbances measure the re- sponse of energetic solar eruptions that actually affect the Earth. Geomagnetic activity aa seems to be the possible link through which the solar activity controls the Earth's climate [1,7]. Near-Earth va riations in the solar wind, measured by the aa geomagnetic activity index, have displayed good correlations with global temperature [1]. Study of [8] found that the total magnetic flux, leaving the Sun and driven by the solar wind, has risen by a fac-tor 2.3 since 1901, leading to the global temperature has increased by 0.5 . In addition, the solar energetic erup- tions, which dragged out or/and organized by the ob-served variations in the solar wind, are closely correlated with the near-Earth environment [9,10]. Spectral Analysis of Solar Variability and Their Possible Role on the Global Warming 112 After work of [4], they found that the approximately 1.1 increase in global mean temperature since 1877 is unlikely to be entirely a product of internal climate vari- ability. Nearly 40% of the variation in global surface temperature could be accommodated by concurrent al- terations in geomagnetic aa and solar activity indices. Climate commitment studies predicted even if levels of greenhouse gases and solar parameters are to remain constant, the global climate is committed to 0.5 of warming over the next one hundred years due to the lag in warming caused by the oceans. There are many other parameters expel from Sun which have a high effect to changes in the global surface temperature as the ultra- violet radiation affect the oz one in the upper atmosphere, as well as the solar modulation effect on cosmic rays which in turn may affect the cloud cover and in turn lead temperature changes [11]. In the present work, we investigate the possibility role of some solar indices on climatic variable represented by changes of global surface temp erature. Indices of solar disturbance measure the near-Earth variations in the solar wind, have been studied. Here, we present a correlative study of the possible contributions for the two compo-nents that may be closely associated with the climate, throughout the last 128 years (1880-2008). The two pa- rameters are geomagnetic activity aa and the sunspots number Rz. 2. Data and Analysis The yearly of GT, aa, and Rz for the period 1880-2008 have been used in the present work. Data for the global surface temperature over the period 1880-2008 are avail- able ( http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gi stem p/tabledata/GLB.Ts. addition, the sunspot numbers Rz were provi ded vi a the National Geophysics and Solar Terrestrial Data Center ( http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/GEOMAG/aastar. shtm l), as well as th e geomagnetics aa were taken from th e (http://www.wdcb.rssi.ru/st p/data/geom a gni.ind/aa/ aa/ AA_MONTH). Linear regression has been used to de- termine the degree of similarity between two signals with zero lag. If the signals are identical, then the correlation coefficient is 1; if they are totally different, the correla-tion coefficient is 0, and if the phase is shifted by exactly 180\u00ba, then the correlation coefficient is -1. Secondly, the running cross-correlation was applied to find the similar-ity between two signals with lag time ( ). Thirdly, a se- ries of power spectral density (PSD) have been per-formed to yield the power spectral density (PSD). The results were smoothed using the Hanning window func- tion. This is necessary since most of the disturbed fea- tures will completely disappear, while the significant peaks are clearly defined. Ne vertheless, the particular window chosen dose not shifts the positions of the spec-tral peaks. Next, each spect rum is independently normal- ized to the largest peak in the complete spectrum. This restriction was chosen in order to avoid spurious strengths often associated w ith peaks near the start and end of the data set. This normalization dose not intro- duces any errors into our id entification of the peaks be- cause it changes only the relative amplitude and not the position of the peak spectrum. 3. Results and Discussion The Sun expels several products of its activity to the inter- planetary medium, namely electromagnetic radiation, ener-getic particles, solar wind and transient ejecta with a frozen in magnetic field. The solar radiation is the fundamental source of energy that drives the Earth's climate and sus- tains life. The variability of this output certainly affects our planet. The solar wind is pumped up with intense magnetic fields that extend far out into interplanetary space, blocking more cosmic rays that would be arrived the Earth. The resulting decrease in cosmic ra ys mean that fewer energetic particles penetrate to lower atmosphere where there may help produce cloud, particular ly at higher latitudes where the shielding by Earth's magnetic field is less. The reduc-tion of clouds that reflect sunlight, would explain why the global surface temperature gets hotter when the Sun is more active. Also, the variability in ultraviolet radiation expels from the Sun affects the ozone in the upper atmos-phere and thus may lead to a temperature change. Thus, solar variability provides a reasonable match to the detailed ups and downs of the temperature record [12]. The longest historical record of the solar variability is the sunspot num- ber. It is the number of the dark spot that appear in photo- sphere and it reflects the magnetic activity of the Sun. Fol-lowing, the aa index, the time series characterizing the geomagnetic activity disturbances, provides the longest data set of solar proxies which goes back to 1868 [13]. The role of geomagnetic activity in the climate change became a topic theme of many recent studies. Close relations during the last 60 years were found between the geomagnetic ac-tivity and surface air temperature [14]. Figure 1 shows the 5-year running averages of annual global surface temperature ( GST), geomagnetic indices (aa) and 1a shows the varia- tion of the global surface with time series from 1880-2008. The considered period has been divided into three sub-periods. The first (1880-1940) named as the first warming period in which we can see that the annual mean temperature showed a sustained warming of about +0.36 (+0.06 /decade). A second period (1940-1970) called global cooling period where there was a cooling of about -0.13 (~ -0.04 /decade). The third period is the second warming period (1970-2008) which we can see that the annual mean temperature showed a sustained warming of about +0.76 (+0.19 /decade). The in- crease in GST for the recent year (1970-2008) was faster and smoother than the first period (1880-1940).

Yearly variations of GST , aa, and Rz with time series (1880-2008) both minima and maxima of solar cycles. In some cycle the geomagnetics activity aa have two peaks structure (double peaked modulations), the first peak near the maxima of solar activity period and the other in de-scending phase [7,15,16]. It is believed that the first peak is caused by coronal mass ejections, whereas the second peak is caused by geomagnetic disturbances due to the coronal-hole fast streams, whic h are more frequent in this part of each solar cycle [1 7]. Dashed line shows the cy- clic variation for sunspot number Rz, where it has an ir- regular variation in both minima and maxima. 3.1 Cross Correlation Figure 2 shows a strong correlation between the solar activity and geomagnetic activity after 1-2 yrs lag time, the correlation coeffici ent between them is r ~ +0.8. Re- gression analyses have carried out between the consid- ered parameters ( GT-Rz and GT-aa). Figure 3 shows the scatter plots of the 5-year means of the global tempera- ture with the geomagnetic activity aa (solid line) and the sunspot number Rz (dashed line). The straight line fit indicates correlation between Rz and GST with magni- tude +0.33, indicating that any change in Rz may lead to a remarkable effect to change of the GST. On other hand, the straight-line fit has indicated a good correlation be-tween geomagnetic activity and GST , the correlation co- efficient is = 0.64, indica ting that any change in aa may be led to a change in GST. Previous work [18] displayed that the geomagnetic activity aa have a high effect to change GST with lag time of 5-7 years. Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Running cross-correlation (based on the annual averages between the aa and Rz) In order to find a causative parameter in solar variabil- ity that may be responsible for the observed climatic change, the running cross-correlation was applied in Figure 4 for aa-GT (solid line) and Rz-GT (dashed line). The 12-year lag time ( ) has been considered. For these correlations, is the lag, usually recommended to be of maximum 30% of the data length. Both curves showed similar short term variations and seemed to be on the increase after with short lag time. At zero time, positive correlations were obtained between aa & GST of +0.64 and between Rz & GST equal +0.33. The highest correla- tion coefficients ap pear between both ( aa & GST) and (Rz & GST) to reach +0.66 and +0.38 respectively when both parameters Rz and aa precedes by 2-3 yrs. It's ob- vious that the correla tion coefficient for the GST and aa is approximately two times higher than the correla- tions for GST and Rz. These results are consistent with previous study [14], which showed the same result. 3.2 Power Spectrum Density To assess the solar climate link it is important to know the periodicities involved and their possible interactions with climate. A series of power spectral density (PSD) have been performed for the 5-year running averages (1880-2008). The results were smoothed using the Han-ning window function and each spectrum is independ- ently normalized to the largest peak in the complete spec-trum. The power spectrum density is calculated for the wide range of frequencies (3.9 \u00d7 10 -2-0.5 c/y), which corresponding to a range from 2 to 25.6 years. Figure 5 shows the spectral analysis of global surface temperature ( GST), geomagnetic indices ( aa) and sunspot number ( Rz). Plots show that there are no significant peaks observed in the high-frequency region correspond-ing to the period from ~ 2-4.7 yr. A flat spectrum for the short-term fluctuations is observed. At the selected fre-quencies (> 5 yr) the spectral density is high and it shows significant variations frequency. Table 1 shows the sig- nificant peak for global surface temperature ( GST), indices ( aa) and sunspot number ( Rz) with the confidence levels. Significant peaks are observed (plot 5a) for GST at 21.3, 14.2, 11.6, 9.1, 7.5 and 6.4 yr, while plot 5b of aa displayed peaks at wavelengths 21.3, 14.2, 10.7, 9.14 and 7.5. Furthermore, the significant peaks for sunspot num- Figure 3.

In plot 5b, the geomagnetics aa spectrum displayed a remarkab le peak at 10.7 yr with higher amplitude, this peak was found in Rz spectrum. There are a similar fluctuations of 21.3, 10.7-11.6, 9.1, 7.5 between aa and GST. Also, other similar peaks 21.3, 10.7, 8-9.1 are appeared between Rz & GST . The spec- trum of GST showed peak of 21.3 yr that related to the solar magnetic cycle polarity (Hale cycle). The 21.3 was observed in aa spectrum with large significant magnitude rather than Rz spectrum, in this c oncern one can say that aa is more effective on global surface temperature than solar activity. Finally the gl obal surface temperature are strongly sensitive to the 21.3-yr, 10.7-11.6 yr variations that observed in the considered geomagnetic and sunspot spectra. 4. Conclusions The aim of this paper is to find out the relation in the long time (1880-2008) between changer of global surface temperature ( GST), Rz) and geomagnetic indices (aa), and to what degree they are connected. 1) Re gression analysis reveal ed that the correlation co- efficient between geomagnetic activity ( aa) and fluctua- tion of ( GST) is = 0.64, while the correlation between Rz and ( GST) is = 0.33 at zero lag. 2) The runni ng correl ation analysis displayed that the higher correlations between aa and GST is r = 0.66, and between Rz and GST is r = 0.34 at time lag of 2-3 yrs. The correlation of aa-GST is near two times higher than that of Rz- GST. 3) Re sults of spectral analysis revealed strong 21.3 yr peak in GST than the 11.6 yr peak. It is related to the changes in the polarity of main solar magnetic field. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) effect is more pow- ered on GST than the solar activ ity cycle. Significant peak at 10.7 yr are appear in both aa and Rz series which is the most established cycle of solar activity. 4) W e also found that 21.3 year peak in aa series is larger than the same peak in Rz series this indicate the geomagnetic activity predominate over the solar activity in GST.

JEP 1 Quantitative Analysis of the Fishing Activity in the Gulf of Manfredonia Foggia, Foggia, Italy. Email: l.grilli@unifg.it Received March 18th, 2010; revised April 1st, 2010; accepted April 18th, 2010. ABSTRACT The Manfredonia City Marine is the third in Italy both for its size and for its nation-wide importance, in the last decade a considerable crisis has been registered in this economic sector as shown by the always decreasing number of fishing boats registered in the Harbour-Office. As a result of such a reduction in the number of fishing boats, a remarkable fall-off in the production occurs. The fishing activity registers a deep legislative, organizational and operational trans-formation. The European Community, in order to face the in discriminate impoverishment of the ichthyic inheritance, has provided incentives for the fishing boats' casting off, by mean of an adequate reward. This paper aims to quantita-tively analyze the fishing activity in the Gulf of Manfredonia in order to present a significant picture of the forthcoming situation on the basis of real data. To this end, we adopt a Prey-Predator model in discrete time that is suitable to de- scribe properly the dynamics of an ecosystem in which just two species interact: predator and prey. The results show worrying forecasts. The fishing boats' number presents a decreasing dynamic and, above all, we record a remarkable reduction in the stock of fishes in the Gulf of Manfredonia. The quantity of fishes, in twenty years, will be reduced of 28%. The Gulf sea, once rich in codfishes, mu llets, cuttlefishes, octopus etc., runs the risk (on the basis of the results obtained in this paper ) of making such species rare. The situation should be much more critical if the fishing activity in the Gulf runs at the rhythms of one decade ago. We apply the model at data from 1995 , and we obtain catastrophical results; the number of fishing boats in the sector in 2015 should be 107 units (77% less ) and the ichthyic inheritance about 16345 tons (45% less ).

Introduction Manfredonia (Gargano, South-Italy), a fishing and sailing city, possesses one of the most representative marine of Italian coasts (third in Italy). In the last decade the situation of marine activity has been changing and still now it is in the middle of a cri-sis. In the year 1995, the number of fishing boats reg- istered in the Manfredonia Harbour-Office was 450, and in 2007 we count only 195 boats, and, on average, the fishing boats are about 26 years old (data from Manfredonia Harbour-Office). The last explicative data show a strong dropping trend of this important economic sector. In the year 1995, the registered production was 7072 tons corre- sponding to a value of 17071134 Euro; in the year 2007 we register a production of 1014 tons equivalent to 5393154 Euro. The reasons for such a situation, that is undoubtedly hard and worrying, are quite complex. It should be simplistic to blame the high cost of oil weighing upon the management costs of a fishing boat (from 40 up to 60 percent according to the boat). The high cost of oil has only increased the speed of a problem which was latent and was under-estimated; this problem leads di- rectly to a dangerous crisis which is representative of a very bad situation. A proof for it is given by the recent strikes and positions adopted by the professional fish- ing category in order to reveal the increasing state of difficulty of the fishing activity. It is worth considering also that the fishing activity is undergoing a deep trans- formation from the legislative, managerial and opera- tional viewpoint. The European Community, which is the Member States, has impressed a vigor ous legislative veer in order to face the indiscriminate impoverishment of the ichthyic inheritance, whic h was subjected to an uncon- trolled and irrational harvesting activity. The European Quantitative Analysis of the Fishing Activity in the Gulf of Manfredonia (Gargano, South-Italy) 118 Community, followed by the Italian Government, has recently provided incentives, by mean of an adequate reward, for the fishing boats' casting off. As a conse- quence, many fishers-ship-owners, close to the pension, has taken this opportunity that was, for many reasons, a providential help. This incentive has been suspended by the Minister of Agriculture in august 2005. It is re- alistic to suppose that the normative for the fishing boats' casting off will be reactivated with rewards more attractive compared with the past. For the mo- ment the incentives have not been restored, although it is worth noting that the \"Fondo Europeo sulla Pesca\" 1 (F.S.P.) has been brought into force for the period 2007-2013. The F.S.P. will provide funds to fishers and ship-owners in the case of a temporary stop of the fishing activity due to public safety or natural emer-gency but also for professional training and early-re-tirement. The problem of resource extraction activity is of great interest and it is studied by mean of many differ- ent approaches. In Grilli [1,2], the author studies a dif- ferential game in which players are overlapping gen-erations of extractors of a renewable good, the author considers the case in which players are not perfectly symmetric. In this paper we apply a discrete time model in order to analyze and understand the evolutionary dynamic of the ecosystem. We focus our attention on the problem of the ichthyic inheritance's impoverishment in the Adriatic Sea and in particular in the Gulf of Manfredo- nia. In order to have a picture of the future situation that is based on real data we adopt a prey-predator model in discrete time. Such mathematical model is able to describe the dynamic of an ecosystem in which only two species interact: the predator (in the case in point we consider the fishing boats active in the Gulf of Manfredonia) and the prey (the ichthyic inheritance in the zone). 2. The Model In order to construct the model it is necessary to know, a priori, the number of preys (fishes) and predators (fishing boats). The number of fishing boats registered in the Manfredonia Harbour-Office for the year 2007 (the most recent official data available for catch and fishing boats) is 195 units. The computation of the number of fishes, exactly the catch measured in tons, it is not trivial at all. In this paper, in order to estimate the number of fishes in the Gulf of Manfredonia, we consider the mean harvest- ing rate in the Adriatic Sea, which is about 2%. The last information together with the average quantity of catch in the last years (we consider the last five years in the period 2003-2007), allows us to estimate the stock of fishes in the zone. In fact, the ichthyic stock is computed using the ratio between the av erage catch and the average harvesting rate: The data about the catch in the zone referred to the pe- riod considered are: Year 2003 = 1014 tons; Year 2004 = 1530 tons; Year 2005 = 1990 tons; Year 2006 = 2370 tons; Year 2007 = 1895 tons; So the average catch results equal to 1760 tons. The ichthyic stock 01760 It is necessary to underline that this data refers to the entire Adriatic Sea. Knowing that the marine of Manfre-donia, for its position and size, is not able to reach the entire area we have established, comparing the produc- tion of Manfredonia to the production of other competing cities in the Adriatic Sea (Ancona, San Benedetto del Tronto), that the Marine of Manfredonia can influence only one third of the ichthyic stock in the zone. As a consequence the data interesting for our analysis is 29327 tons. In the model, let us consider that at time t = 0 the ich- thyic inheritance of the Gulf is 29327 tons, and the num-ber of fishing boats is 195 units. Let us suppose that, if it is known the quantity of predators and preys at time t, at time t + 1 the evolutionary dynamics is the following: 1 t In order to understand the co efficients' choice it is nec- essary to present criteria adopted for their computation. The coefficient a1,1 (0,2) must undoubtedly be < 1 since it represents the way in which the predators evolve in absence of preys, at time t + 1 the absence of fishes pushes the fishers out from the market even if a little part of them decides to continue the activity in the short run. The coefficient a1,2 (0,002) represents the variation rate of fishing boats as a function of the ichthyic stock. The coefficient a2,1 (-0,39) indicates the harvesting ability, more precisely, how the number of fishes is af- fected by the harvesting activity. The coefficient a 2,2 (1,022) describes how fishes evolve in absence of predators. In the model, for sake of simplicity, we suppose that the only cause of death for fishes derives from predators. This coefficient is com-puted as follows: 2007 Stock Ichthyic2007 Catch 2007 Stock Ichthyic 1European Fishery Fund Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Quantitative Analysis of the Fishing Activity in the Gulf of Manfredonia (Gargano, South-Italy) 119 Once the evolutionary dynamic is established it is pos- sible, by m ean of sim ple el ements of linear algebra (ma- trix diagonalization), to provide a picture of the fishing activity in Manfredonia for the future in the next years. The model, of course, provides answers that are more accurate if we look at the shor t term. We are interested in the evolution of predators (fishing boats) and preys (fishes) in 20 years.

Not only for the number of fishing-boats, which is in a worthy decrease, but above all for the important ichthyic inheri- tance's impoverishment in the area of Manfredonia. Data show an alarming situation, in 2038 the stock of fishes will decrease of 28% (from 29327 tons up to only 18453,23), as a consequence about 85 fishing-boats will exit the market and as a result 435 workers (considering an average of 5 workers per ship) will be dismissed. Some years ago the Gulf was rich in codfishes, mullets, cuttlefishes, octopus etc, and all such species risk to be- come rare. It is worth noting that the situation could be even worst if the present fishing activity should follow the extraction rate of one decade ago. If we apply this model to data of the year 1995, when the fishing boats regis- tered in the Manfredonia Harbour-Office were 450 with more than 2000 workers and a catch of about 7702,5 tons, we should comment a dramatic situation: the number of fishing boats in the year 2015 should be 107 units only (-77%) and the ichthyic stock should be only 16345 ton (-45%). Often data and numbers are more eloquent than many words, such numbers show a dramatic situation. Dealing with the problem of resource extraction of a natural re-source it is necessary to consider the problem of inter- generational equity. In fact actions of present generations (in terms of extraction rates) influence the choices of future generation in an obvious way. It is well known among economists that if extractors do not care about the effects of their extraction policies on future levels of stock of resource this can result in the so called \"tragedy of commons\" [3-5]. It is necessary to define in more de- tails the concept of \"intergenerational equity\". Rawls [6] claims: \"...consider the question of justice between gen- erations. There is no need to stress the difficulties that this problem raises. It subjects any ethical theory to se- vere if not impossible lest\" Solow [7] considers the problem of a natural resource: \"the current generation is always entitled to take as much resource out of the common intertemporal pool as it can, provided only that it leaves behind the possibility to each succeeding generation can be as well off as this one\" It seems that, in an enviro nmental context, with \"int- ergenerational equity\" we can mean that the extraction strategies of present generations can satisfy their own needs and in the same time guarantee to future genera- tions to do the same. This paper wants to be a contribu- tion in such direction. Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

ABSTRACT The present investigation deals with the assessment of pollu tion status along the wetland of Thane Creek, which has been subjected to a lot of pollution from the Asia's biggest Thane\u2014Belapur Industrial Complex located at the south of Mumbai harbor along the west coast of India. This paper advocates habitat conservation and ecological studies with special reference to the physico-chemical characteristics and heavy metal pollution in the soil along the creek area. In the present investigation, the pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, alkalinity and chlorinity values recorded were observed to be high during dry seasons and low during rainy season. The soil samples were also analyzed for their heavy metal contents like nickel, zinc, cadmium, copper, iron , arsenic and mercury. It was observed that, the concentra- tion of these heavy metals increases gradually in dry season s, followed by sharp decrease during rainy season. These heavy metals have a marked effect on the aquatic flora and fauna which through bio magnification enter the food chain and ultimately affect the human beings as well. The present experimental data on heavy metal pollution in soil samples collected along Kalwa bridge of Thane Creek points out to the need of regular monitoring of water resources and fur-ther improvement in the industrial waste water treatment methods. If the present conditions continue for a long period, the creek may soon become ecologically inactive. Keywords: Soil Pollution, Heavy Metal Content, Physico-Chemic al Characteristics, Metallic Contaminants, Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Bioaccumulation, Food Chain 1. Introduction Waste management strategies adopted in India have failed to keep pace with the industrial growth and ur- banization. This has resulted in the accumulation of toxic metallic contaminants with a consequent loss in quality of soil, for the past few decades. The problem of envi- ronmental pollution due to toxic metals has begun to cause concern now in most major metropolitan cities. The toxic heavy metals entering the ecosystem may lead to geoaccumulation, bioaccumulation and biomagnifica-tion. Heavy metals like Fe, Cu, Zn, Ni and other trace elements are important for proper functioning of bio- logical systems and their deficiency or excess could lead to a number of disorders [1]. Food chain contamination by heavy metals has become a burning issue in recent years because of their potential accumulation in biosys-tems through contaminated wate r, soil and air. Therefore, a better understanding of heavy metal sources, their ac-cumulation in the soil and the effect of their presence in water and soil seem to be particularly important issues of present-day research on risk assessments [2]. The main sources of heavy metals to vegetable crops are their growth media (soil, air, nutrient solutions) from which these are taken up by the ro ots or foliage. Most of our water resources are gradually becoming polluted due to the addition of foreign materials from the surroundings. These include organic matter of plant and animal origin, land surface washing, and indust rial and sewage effluents. Rapid urbanization and industrialization with improper environmental planning often lead to discharge of indus-trial and sewage effluents into lakes. The lakes have a complex and fragile ecosystem, as they do not have self- cleaning ability and therefore readily accumulate pollut- ants. It has been reported that sewage effluents of mu-nicipal origin contain appreciable amount of major es-sential plant nutrients and therefore the fertility levels of the soil are improved consider ably under sewage irriga- tion of crop fields [2]. However, studies on the water of Vasai Creek, Maharashtra, re veal that the presence of toxic heavy metals likes Fe, Pb and Hg reduce soil fertil- ity and agricultural output [3]. Treated sewage water also contains variable amounts of heavy metals such as Pb, Ni, Cd, Cu Hg, Zn and Cr [2], which have the potential to Soil Pollution along Kalwa Bridge at Thane Creek of Maharashtra, India 122 contaminate crops growing under such irrigation. The increasing trend in concentra tion of heavy metals in the environment has created cons iderable attention amongst ecologists globally during the last decades. Measure- ments have been made of atmospheric metallic precipita- tion in Europe and America. However, no such studies have been carried out in India and there are no past metal load data available. There is need for extensive monitor-ing efforts over long periods of time in order to describe average metal precipitation [4] and its trend, which is an essential component of any pollution control manage-ment. Several factors, like discharge of agricultural, do-mestic and industrial wastes, land use practices, geologi- cal formation, rainfall pattern s and infiltration rate are reported to affect the quality of soil along the creek area. As the quality of soil along the creek area greatly affect the vegetation, it is necessary to analyze the physico- chemical parameters of soil. Therefore, we initiated such a study to understand the physico-chemical properties of the soil samples collected al ong Kalwa bridge of Thane creek which is subjected to a lot of pollution from the Asia's biggest Thane\u2014Belapur Industrial Complex lo- cated at the south of Mumbai harbor along the west coast of India. In an attempt to determine the pollution history [5-9] and to assess the fate of heavy metals along the creek area, detailed investigation of the soil samples for heavy metal content was also performed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1 Area of Study The study was carried out in a creek near Mumbai City, which is one of the most heavily populated and industri- alized cities of India. The creek, known as \"Thane Creek\" separates the Island City of Mumbai in the west from the mainland in the east and houses industrial areas at a dis- tance of about 25 Km north-east of Mumbai city. Thane Creek lies in the southern part of the Deccan belt of India between latitude 18 o 53' to 19o 04' N longitude 72o 48' It is a triangular mass of brackish water which widens out and opens to the Arabian Sea in the South. The creek is narrow at the Northern end, were it is fed partially by river Ulhas. The geographical location of Kalwa bridge along the Thane creek is shown in Figure 1. The creek could be considered as an estuary during southwest monsoon period when the land drainage and river run-offs are considerable . This area is also highly bio productive and yields about 2 to 3 thousand metric tones of fish annually. This area was developed by the state government essentially for the chemical industries towards the beginning of the sixties and at present about 25 large industries and about 300 medium and small scale units using hazardous chemicals is located out of the total of 2000 units located in this zone. The main water source for the industrial consumption is Maharash- tra Industrial Development Corporation. The industrial area utilizes about 45000 m 3/day of fresh water. The ef- fluent discharge, treated and untreated amounts to 28750 m 3/day i.e. 64% of the total industrial effluents generated in Thane Creek area. Except for a few major industries, the medium and the small scale industries discharge their treated or untreated effluent s through the unlined surface drains into the Thane Creek. In addition to this, domestic sewage discharges from suburbs of Mumbai City meet the Thane Creek from the west side. Also atmospheric fallout from the chimneys and stacks and vehicle ex- hausts estimated to be 22000 t/day over the city, reach the creek after washout. The problem is furthered by un- restricted dumping of solid waste, construction debris and other waste. Because of all this, the soil as well as water of Thane Creek region has become severely pol- luted. This has created health hazards not only for local population but also resulted in disturbances of mangrove ecosystem. 2.2 Climatic Conditions The weather of Thane is typical coastal sultry and humid. Most parts of Thane lies in the plain at the sea level. The average rainfall of Thane records from 1500 mm to 2000 mm. The place experiences the onset of the monsoon in the month of June and experiences monsoon till the end of September. The average temperature recorded in Thane varies from 25 to 37 degrees. 2.3 Requirements All the glassware, casserole and other pipettes were first cleaned with tape water thoroughly and finally with de-ionized distilled water. The pipettes and burette were rinsed with solution before final use. The chemicals and reagent were used for analysis were of A.R. grade. The procedure for calculating the different parameters were conducted in the laboratory. 2.4 Soil Sampling, Preparation and Analyses The study period of nine months was divided into two: pre monsoon (dry seasons) i.e., from December 2007 to May 2008 and monsoon (wet season) i.e. , from June 2008 to August 2008. Eighty soil samples were randomly collected along Kalwa bridge of Thane Creek for both dry and wet seasons and at different depths. Soil samples from the top layer (0-15 cm) and sub layer (15-30 cm) were sampled separately. The soil samples were col- lected by hand-pushing plastic core tubes (7 cm diameter) as far as possible into the soil. The soil cores retrieved in the field were sliced on arrival at the lab at 1-cm depth intervals for the first 15 cm, 2-cm depth intervals from 15-25 cm, and then every 5 cm for the deeper sections of the cores. The soil samples were air dried for 8 days, Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Soil Pollution along Kalwa Bridge at Thane Creek of Maharashtra, India 123 KALWA BRIDGE Figure 1. Map showing geographi cal location of Thane Creek ground using agate mortar and sieved with a 0.5 mm mesh size sieve to remove stones, plant roots and have soil of uniform particle size. Soil samples from two dif- ferent layers were mixed thoroughly, packed in poly- thene bags and kept in a dry place until analyses. Well-mixed samples of 2 g each were taken in 250 mL glass beakers and digested with 8 mL of aqua regia on a sand bath for 2 h. After evaporation to near dryness, the samples were dissolved with 10 mL of 2% nitric acid, filtered through Whatman's No.1 filter paper and then diluted with deionized water to give final volumes de- pending on the suspected level of the metals [10]. The soil samples were subjected to nitric acid digestion using the microwave-assisted technique, setting pressure at 30 bar and power at 700 Watts [11,12]. 2.5 Physico-Chemical Study The present study provides a detailed description of the physico-chemical criteria of soil samples collected from along Kalwa bridge of Thane Creek area. The samples collected were analyzed for bulk density, moisture con- tent, pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and chlorinity. The standard techniques and methods were followed for physical and chemical analys is of soil samples [13]. 2.6 Heavy Metal Analysis The analysis for the majority of the trace metals was done by Perkin Elmer Analyst 200 Flame Atomic Ab- sorption Spectrophotometer (2003 model), but arsenic was determined by hydride generation coupled with an atomic fluorescence detector. A separate aliquot of the soil sample (0.2 g) was digested according to a modifica- tion of the EPA method of Hatch and Ott [14] for total mercury analysis. Mercury was analyzed with a cold- vapour atomic adsorption spectrophotometer. The cali- bration curves were prepared separately for all the metals by running different concentrations of standard solutions. A reagent blank sample was taken through the method, analyzed and subtracted from the samples to correct for reagent impurities and other sources of errors from the environment. Average values of three replicates were taken for each determination. 2.7 Quality Control/Assurance Soil samples were collected with plastic-made imple- ments to avoid contamination. Samples were kept in polythene bags that were free from heavy metals and organics and well covered while transporting from field to the laboratory to avoid contamination from the envi-ronment. Reagent blanks were used in all analyses to check reagent impurities and other environmental con-taminations during analyses. Analytical grade reagents were used for all analyses. All reagents were standard- ized against primary standard s to determine their actual concentrations. All glassware used were soaked in ap- propriate dilute acids overnight and washed with teepol and rinsed with deionised water before use. All instru- ments used were calibrated before use. Tools and work surfaces were carefully clean ed for each sample during grinding to avoid cross contamination. Duplicate samples Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Soil Pollution along Kalwa Bridge at Thane Creek of Maharashtra, India 124 were analyzed to check precision of the analytical me- thod and instrument. To vali date the analytical proce- dures used, the spike recovery test was conducted on some soil samples for nickel, zinc, cadmium, copper, iron, arsenic and mercury. 3. Results and Discussion The soil samples collected along Kalwa Bridge of Thane creek were analyzed for thei r physico-chemical proper- ties and the experimental data are presented in Table 1 . One of the most important factors that serve as an index for pollution is pH. In our study, the pH of the soil sam- ples collected for different sessions ranged from 8.10 to 8.94 this may be due to the high buffering capacity of the system. This is in accordance with earlier study by Wet- zel [15], who reported that the pH values of Indian wa-ters ranges from 8 to 9 units. Ghose and Sharma [16] in their study of the Ganga River recorded relatively high pH of water in winter months attributing to increased primary-productivity in which carbonates, sulfate, rted to hydroxyl ions. In the present investigation the pH of soil samples were observed to be high in dry seasons (average 8.81) and lower during monsoon (average 8.13). The low pH was mainly due to high turbidity and dilution. The variation in pH of the soil samples is graphically represented in Figure 2 . The measurement of soil water content and soil water fluxes is critical to a wide range of environmental studies including acidification, pollution and nutrient uptake [17]. There is a major current concern in the effective conser- vation and protection of water, and this interest is likely to increase with attention being focused on the effects of climate change. As a consequence, soil water content is an important component in many modeling studies, e. g. in calculation of evapotranspiration, and in estimation of losses to groundwater [17]. The % moisture content is soil samples collected for differ ent seasons were found to be low in dry seasons (average 3.84%) and increases sharply during wet season (average 4.02%) starting from June to August. The variation in % moisture content of the soil samples is graphically represented in Figure 2. Bulk density is a measure of the weight of the soil per unit volume (g/cm 3), usually given on an oven-dry (110 ) basis. Variation in bulk density is attributable to the rela- tive proportion and specific gravity of solid organic and inorganic particles and to the porosity of the soil. Al- though bulk densities are seldom measured, they are im- portant in quantitative soil studies. In the present inves- tigation the bulk density of soil was found to increase gradually in dry seasons (average 0.725 g/cm 3) and then decreases sharply in rainy season (average 0.531 g/cm3). The increase in bulk density of soil samples in dry sea-sons might be due to concentration of heavy metals, which are washed out in rainy season in to the creek wa-ter resulting in decrease in bulk density. The variation in bulk density of the soil samples is graphically repre- sented in Figure 2 . The conductivity of soil depends upon the concentra- tion of ions and its nutrient status. In the present investi-gation the electrical conductivity values of soil samples varies between averages of 4.83 m.mhos/cm in dry sea- sons, to 4.08 m.mhos/cm in rainy season. Washing of soil due to rain water results in removal of conducting ions present in the soil as a result conductivity values de- creases. The variation in conductivity of the soil samples is graphically represented in Figure 2 . Alkalinity and pH are the factors responsible for de- termining the amenability of water to biological treat-ment [18]. Total alkalinity values in our observations fluctuated from average of 19 .0 to 20.1 mg/L. In the pre- sent investigation alkalinity of soil samples increases gradually in dry seasons, followed by steep fall in the monsoon season. The low alkalinity during the monsoon may be due to dilution. Bishop [19] and Jain et al. [20], also reported similar findings in their study on Malayan Table 1.

Seasonal variation in physical properties of soil samples collected at Kalwa bridge of Thane creek rivers and the Halali Reservoir. The variation in alkalin-ity of the soil samples is graphically represented in Fig- ure 3 . The higher chlorinity is considered to be an indicator of higher pollution due to higher organic waste of animal origin. Munawar [21] observed a direct correlation be- tween Cl - concentration and pollution level in fresh wa- ter ponds of Hyderabad. In the present investigation, the chlorinity level of soil samples collected for different seasons varies between averages of 23-31 mg/L. The chlorinity level was found to be low during rainy season (average 23 mg/L) and observed to increase sharply dur- ing dry seasons (average 31 mg/L). Govindan and Sundaresan Jana [23] observed that higher Cl - con- centration in the summer period could be due to sewage mixing and increased temperature and evaporation. The seasonal variation in chlorinity of the soil samples is graphically represented in Figure 3 . Heavy metals, known to be potentially hazardous sub- stances are present in both natural and contaminated en-vironments. In natural environments, they occur at low concentrations. However at high concentrations as is the case in contaminated environments, they result in public health impacts. The elements that are of c oncern include iron, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, zinc, nickel and copper. Heavy metals may be released into the environment from metal smelting and refining indu stries, scrap metal, plas- tic and rubber industries, various consumer products and from burning of waste containing these elements. On release to the air, the elemen ts travel for large distances and are deposited onto the soil, vegetation and water de- pending on their density. Once deposited, these metals are not degraded and persist in the environment for many years poisoning humans through inhalation, ingestion and skin absorption. Acute exposure leads to nausea, norexia, vomiting, gastrointestinal abnormalities and dermatitis. Discharge of treated/partially treated or un-treated domestic and agricultural wastes also leads to the pollution of water bodies due to the heavy metals [24-26]. They can be absorbed by green plants, which are primary producers in the ecosystem. As they move up the food chain from producers to consumers, they endanger the public health by bioaccumulating in the plant and animal tissues and can cause physiological and neurological dis- orders. In the present investigation the concentration of heavy metals like iron, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, zinc, nickel and copper were observed to increase gradually in dry season and was found to be maximum in summer, while there concentration decreases sharply in rainy season (Figure 4 ). The experimental data on heavy metal con- tent in the soil samples collected for different seasons is shown in Table 2 . The concentration of nickel was found to be minimum in rainy season (average 62 \u00b5g/g) and maximum in dry seasons (average 78 \u00b5g/g). Short term overexposure to Ni is not known to cause any health problems, but long term exposure can cause decreased body weight, heart and liver damage, and skin irritation [27]. The LDL O (lethal dose low) of Ni for rat is 12 mg/Kg, but its affect on other mammals needs to be studied. Ni can accumulate in aquatic life, but its magni- fication along in food chain is not confirmed [27]. The concentration of Zn in the soil samples was found to be minimum of 182 \u00b5g/g (average) in rainy season to maximum of 196 \u00b5g/g (average) in dry seasons. In mammals, exposure to Zn causes metal-fume fever with symptoms like fever, pain, fatigue, shivering, sweating, etc. In plants excessive Zn causes necrosis, chlorosis and inhibited growth [27].

JEP Soil Pollution along Kalwa Bridge at Thane Creek of Maharashtra, India 127 Cadmium is contributed to the surface waters through paints, pigments, glass enamel, deterioration of the gal- vanized pipes etc. The wear of studded tires has been identified as a source of cadmium deposited on road sur- faces. The concentration of Cd was minimum in rainy season (average 8 \u00b5g/g) to maximum in dry seasons (av- erage 21 \u00b5g/g).There are a few recorded instances of Cd poisoning in human beings following consumption of contaminated fishes. It is less toxic to plants than Cu, similar in toxicity to Pb and Cr. It is equally toxic to in- vertebrates and fishes [28]. anemia, liver damage, portal cirrhosis, hematopoietic depression, anhydremia, sensory disturbance and weight loss. In addition to acute toxicity, long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic is associated with certain forms of can- cer of the skin, lung, colon, bladder, liver and breast [32]. A few years back, high concentrations of this element was found in drinking water in six districts in West Ben- gal. A majority of people in the area was found suffering from arsenic skin lesions. Arsenic poisoning through wa- ter can cause liver and nervous system damage, vascular diseases and also skin cance r. Arsenic poisoning has be- come a worldwide public health concern. The skin is quite sensitive to arsenic and skin lesions are the most common and earliest nonmalignant effects associated to chronic arsenic exposure [33]. In the present case study, the concentration of arsenic was observed to vary from minimum of 228 \u00b5g/g in rainy season to maximum of 253 \u00b5g/g in dry seasons. Copp er salts are used in water supply systems to con- trol biological growth in reservoirs and distribution pipes. The municipal waste and sewage, corrosion of Cu con-taining pipelines or fittings are the principal anthropo- genic source of Cu. Highly t oxic to most fishes, inverte- brates and aquatic plants than any other heavy metal ex- cept mercury. It reduces growth and rate of reproduction in plants and animals [28] . Copper becomes toxic for organisms when the rate of absorption is greater than the rate of excretion. Further si nce the copper is readily ac- cumulated by plants and animals, and the aquatic plants absorb three times more Cu th an plants on dry land [29], it is very important to minimize the levels of copper in the waterway. The concentration of Cu was observed to be minimum in rainy season (average 107 \u00b5g/g) to maximum in dry seasons (average 121 \u00b5g/g). In the present investigation it was observed that the concentration of Fe was very high in dry seasons (aver- age 7.67%) and decreases sharply in rainy season (aver- age 7.41%). It is important here to note that the high concentration of Fe may increase the hazard of pathogenic organisms, since most of these organisms need iron for their growth [27]. The seasonal variations in % Fe content of the soil samples collected along the Kalwa bridge of Thane Creek is graphically represented in Figure 4 . The acut e lethal dose for most inorganic mercury compounds for an adult is 1-4 g (or 14 to 57 mg/Kg) for a 70 Kg person [34]. Exposure to mercury and its com- pounds therefore can have ac ute adverse health problems. It may permanently damage the brain, kidneys and de- veloping foetus. Effects on brain functioning may results in irritability, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. In aquatic plants mercury compounds inhibit cell growth and impair permeability. In the present investigation the concentration of Hg was observed to be very high. It increases gradually in dry seasons (average 28 \u00b5g/g), and falls sharply during rainy season (average 9 \u00b5g/g). 4. Conclusions The experimental data on the soil pollution status along the Kalwa bridge of Thane creek suggest a need to im- plement common objectives, compatitable policies and programmes for improvement in the industrial waste wa-ter treatment methods. The high level of pollution along the creek area also suggest a need of consistent, interna- tionally recognized data driven strategy to assess the quality of aquatic body and generation of international standards for evaluation of contamination levels. If the present conditions continue for a long period, the Thane creek area may soon become ecologically inactive. Arse ni c occurs naturally or is possibly aggravated by over powering aquifers and by phosphorus from fertiliz- ers. Human activities have also intensified arsenic mulation in the environmen t. Arsenic usually accumu- lates in soil, water and airborne particles, from which it is taken up by various organisms. The concentrations of the dangerous inorganic arsenics that are currently present in surface waters enhance the chances of alteration of ge- netic materials of fish. This is mainly caused by accumu- lation of arsenic in the bodie s of plant-eating freshwater organisms. Plants absorb arsenic fairly easily, so that high-ranking concentrations may be present in food. High concentrations of arsenic in water can have an adverse effect on health [30,31]. Organs most susceptible to arse- nic toxicity are those involved with absorption, accumu- lation or excretion, including the skin, circulatory system, gastrointestinal tract, liver an d kidney. Arsenic is associ- ated with multiple health effects, including Blackfoot diseases, diabetes, hyperten sion, peripheral neuropathy and multiple vascular diseases.

ABSTRACT Emergency retention basins (ERB) are diked enclosures alongside rivers into which water from the main river channel is diverted during extreme floods. If the basins are operated during extreme flooding, two negative environmental im- pacts may occur: 1) contamination of the soils due to their transport by suspended sediments to the basin and 2) deple- tion of dissolved oxygen in the basin water. A computer-based methodology is presented which was used to assess the environmental risk exhibited by the operation of an ERB sy stem proposed for the Elbe River in Germany. The August 2002 extreme flood event was used as a test case. For such a flood, the results showed that there is a 77% risk that dis- solved oxygen levels fall below 2 mg/L in the water and a 48% chance of exceeding the inspection value of 500 mg zinc/kg in the soil. Keywords: Environmental Risk, Inundation, Retention Basins, Water Quality, Contaminated Soils, Quasi-2D Model 1. Introduction The European Union (EU) has passed a Floods Directive to provide a legislative foundation for flood protection and mitigation in Europe. Since most large river basins in Europe extend over several co untries, the directive will help to orient and broaden flood management efforts beyond the municipal and state authorities to the national and international levels and establish an improved and more cost-effective flood protection scheme (see also [1]). Interestingly, the direct ive includes many references to the environment and the EU Water Framework Direc- tive, e.g.: Article 4 (Preliminary flood risk assessment): ...[must consider] potential adverse consequences for human health, the environment Article 9 (Flood hazard maps and flood risk maps): ... shall be coordinated with and may be in-tegrated into the reviews provided for 2000/60/EC [WFD] Article 7 (Flood risk management plans): ... shall take into account costs and benefits, flood extent and conveyance routes, enviro nmental objectives of 2000/60/EC [WFD], soil and water management Hence, it will be mandatory to consider what impact new flood defence measures will have on the environ- ment. Also, these measures are not to conflict with the goals of the EU WFD of ach ieving a good ecological status of water bodies. After the extreme flood event along the Elbe River in August 2002, efforts were made to revamp flood man- agement schemes in the river basin. Hence, the construc- tion of an emergency retention basin (ERB) system has been proposed for the middle reaches of the Elbe River to reduce flood risk in the area [2]. Emergency retention basins are diked enclosures alongside rivers used to retain flood water by diverting and storing a portion of the river discharge during floods. The diversion from the main river channel to and from the ERBs is controlled in order to attain maximum cap- ping of the peak discharge volume. The floodwater di- version reduces water levels downstream in the river and inundated areas and alleviates stress and damages in re- gions prone to high flood risk. Studies on environmental risk assessment on retention basins by flood events are sparse in the literature. There- fore, the aim of the paper was to provide a possible computer modelling methodology on how such assess-ments can be tackled in fulfilling the proposed EU direc- tives. Further, a preliminar y assessment of the environ- ment risk of heavy metal soil contamination and dis- solved oxygen depletion in ERBs should be given. To solve these goals, excerpts ha ve been drawn from [3-6]. In detail, the following steps were in the focus of the research: Environmental Risk Imposed by Dive rted Flood Waters on Water and Soil s in Emergency Retention Basins 130 develop and test a quasi-2D (two-dimension) model in which the equations of motion and continuity are calculated in 1D (one-dimension) but the discretisa- tion scheme allows for a 2D representation of flow and substance distribution; this minimises comput-ing and pre-processing expenditure without com- pensating spatial differentiation of flood behaviour, test how effective the proposed ERB system is able to cap the peak discharge of the hydrograph from the August 2002 flood, investigate the environmental risk of heavy-metal contamination of ERB soils after flood water reten- tion, and assess the environmental risk of dissolved oxygen depletion in the water retained in the basins. 2. Study Area Two ERBs were investigated in this studie, P1 and P3 (see Figure 1 ). They are situated between Torgau and Wittenberg. Morphological ch aracteristics of the ERBs are given in Table 1 . Several gates are to control the flow of water through the ERBs: an inlet gate at the southernmost tip of P1, an outlet gate at the westernmost point of P3 by Pretzsch and a connecting gate between P1 and P3.

Investigated emergency retention basins (ERB) proposed for the Elbe River reach between Torgau and Wittenberg, modified from [2] 3. Modeling Tool and Setup The hydrodynamic module DYNHYD (based on St. Ve- nant equations), the sediment and contaminant transport module TOXI and the wa ter-quality module EUTRO from the WASP5 (Water quality Analysis Simulation Program v.5) modelling package, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen cy [7] was used for the floodwater simulations. Figure 2 (left panel) shows the discretisation of the river-ERB system domain in junc-tions and channels. The junctions ensure volume conti-nuity, hence all junction water volumes represent the total water volume in the system. The channels are the basis for computing the flow in 1D between the junctions. Many channels may branch from a junction allowing the discretisation to take a 2D characterisation. The segment discretisation for the contaminant transport and wa-ter-quality model, shown in Figure 2 (right panel), cor- responds 1-to-1 the junction discretisation. In TOXI, processes that describe the transport and fate of heavy-metal contaminants include: longitudinal dispersion in the water column, vertical diffusion of dissolved substances between the water column and the bottom sediments, sedimentation of suspended solids, re-suspension of solids from the bottom sediments to the water column, and sorption of dissolved substances to suspended and deposited sediments. EUTRO was used to simulate water quality pertaining to the oxygen balance in a river and ERBs using the cy-cles of dissolved oxygen (DO) decomposition and nutri-ent-limited phytoplankton growth. Oxygen is also con-sumed in the sediments, which is described in the model by the sediment oxygen demand. An important source of oxygen into the water body is re-aeration via the water surface from the atmosphere. An important source and sink of DO are phytoplank- ton photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Phyto-plankton growth is also light limited and its loss rate is governed by respiration, death, settling and zooplankton grazing. The DYNHYD, EUTRO and TOXI modules were structured in a simulation platform HLA (High Level Architecture) to allow Monte- Carlo analyses (MOCA) to be carried out [8]. The MOCA allowed uncertainty bounds to be computed in order to assess the degree of risk in exceeding environmen tal thresholds. For the en- vironmental risk appraisal the following were investi-gated: 1) the amount of zinc, with high contamination potential along the Elbe [9], sorbed and deposited from the diverted flood waters and 2) the minimum concentra-tion of DO attained in the basin waters. 4.

Only the key results to support the environmental assessments will be presented here. 4.1 Hydrodynamics Figure 3 (left panel) shows the water level hydrographs of the August 2002 flood simulated along the river at Positions A, B and C (see Figure 2 for spatial reference). The dashed line of the hydrog raph crests represent water level heights that occurred without the ERB system, the solid line represents the lowering of the water levels that can be obtained when the ER Bs are included in the mod- elling. The capping lies in th e range of 35 to 40 cm and progressively recedes as the flood wave moves down-stream (compare Position C). This is due to flood wave attenuation and widening of the floodplain downstream from Pretzsch towards Wittenberg (see Figure 1 ). Fig- ure 3 (right panel) shows the 2D spatial differentiation of the flow field. Details on the development, calibration and validation of the model and the optimisation of the control of ERB filling are given in [4] and [6]. 4.2 Soil Contamination Figure 4 (left panel) shows the results of zinc concentra- tions in the river and ERBs. The initial concentrations in the ERB segments on the onset of water inflow corre-spond to the concentrations in the water in the immediate upstream-lying segments. Once the ERBs are filled and the flood gates are closed (a pproximately after Day 6 for P3 and after Day 7 for P1), th ere is a substantial drop in substance concentrations in the ERB water column due to sedimentation of suspended sediment.

Figure 4 (right panel) shows the spatial distribution of particulate zinc concentrations in the bot-tom sediments representing zinc deposition during the retention stage of flood water diversion. Particulate zinc is deposited quite quickly when water enters P1. Much of the particulate matter has also been trapped in P1 before the water enters P3. During flood water retention, zinc concentrations are evenly distributed throughout the ERB bottom sediments. 4.3 Dissolved Oxygen Depletion Figure 5 (left panel) shows the DO simulations in the river at Wittenberg and in the ERBs. The DO levels in the river remain substantially below saturation levels. Upon entering the ERBs, diverted flood water receives more oxygen from the hydraulic re-aeration when pass-ing through the inlet gates. The initial flow of shallow waters during basin filling (Day 4 to 7) also contributes to the input of oxygen into the water. There is a progres- sive decline in DO concentrations during flood water retention (Days 8 and 9) which progresses into the emp- tying phase (after Day 9). The lower decile of the minimum DO concentrations is shown spatially in Figure 5 (right panel). The DO lev- els are higher in P3 than in P1. The extremity (eastern bay) of P1 is generally less oxygenated than the remain-ing water in the ERB. It should be emphasised that the August 2002 simulation represents a best-case scenario. Additional factors that may impact DO negatively but were not included in the m odel are 1) higher sediment oxygen demand if surfaces are arable lands and not grasslands and 2) anoxia in the water-soil interface caus- ing re-dissolution of inorganic nutrients from the ERB Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Environmental Risk Assessment 5.1 Soil Contamination In order to make an environmental risk assessment of contamination in the ERBs, the deposition of pollutants onto the ERB surfaces must be placed within the legal context of the German sewage sludge ordinance. An example is given here using zinc as the heavy-metal contaminant. The ordinance provides threshold values of zinc content allowed in the soils and sediment (\"sludge\") deposited onto the land surfaces within the basins (sum- marised in Table 2 ). In accordance to the German Sewage Sludge Ordi- nance, the background zinc concentrations in the soils, where the ERBs are to be si tuated, must be determined. The geogenic value of 150 mg zinc/kg sediment [10] for the Elbe catchment is used here for illustration. This value does not exceed the maximum allowable zinc con-tent in the soils of 200 mg/kg. Hence, sediment may be deposited from the river water diverted into the ERBs during extreme flooding. The content of zinc within the deposited sediment may not exceed 2500 mg/kg, if the land surfaces are to continue to be used for agricultural purposes. Table 3 summarises the results from the MOCA showing that the probability of reaching this value is minute (< 1%). A different approach based on standards provided by the German Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance is given in [5]. An important question that arises is how many flood- ings of the ERB can occur before the concentrations in the soil increase from the geogenic level of 150 mg/kg to the threshold value of 200 mg/kg. Figure 4 (right panel) shows a spatial distribution of zinc bound to deposited sediment, which corresponds to an 8% exceedence probability extracted from the MOCA. The zinc content in the soil increases by 5 mg/kg. Hence, approximately ten ERB floodings may cause zinc accumulation to reach the threshold value of 200 mg/kg. Although the environmental risk for zinc contamina- tion is low, it should be noted that an amendment to the sewage sludge ordinance is currently being discussed in which the threshold values for allowed zinc content in soils and deposited sediment (\"sludge\") are lower (see Table 2 ). Careful measurements of the background zinc levels in the soils of the ERB sites should be carried out to determine how close these values are to the maximum allowable content in soils. The environmental risk analyses presented here shows that there is minimal risk of plant contamination by zinc deposited onto the ERBs during floods. However, the risk may be substantially in creased if the ERBs are lo- cated further downstream. Figure 6 shows the zinc con- tent in deposited sediment along the portion of the Elbe River in Germany.

For the river stretch downstream from the Mulde and Saale tributaries, the range and the maximum of zinc content in deposited sediments is twice as high as for the upstream reach. 5.2 Dissolved Oxygen Depletion From the MOCA runs, probability distributions of the lowest DO levels attained in the ERBs during the simula-tion time frame were derived. The cumulative frequency distributions for three locations in the ERB system are shown in Figure 7 . The threshold value of the minimum concentration of DO in inland waters used for a risk as- sessment is 3 mg O 2/L\u2014the minimum oxygen content with which most fish in the Elbe River can endure for a short term [12]. As soon as the oxygen content sinks be- low approximately 3 mg/L, the fish begin to search for water pockets with better oxygen supply or begin to snap for air at the water surface [13]. For a summer time extreme flood such as the August 0123400.20.40.60.81 5P1 inlet P1 extremity P3 DO (mg O2/L)cumulative frequency Figure 7. Cumulative frequenc y distributions of the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations attained in the ERBs (mg O 2/L) 2002 event along the Elbe, the probability of the DO values dropping below a threshold value of 3 mg O 2/L is quite high, 77% for the inlet region of P1, 65% for the far eastern point of the P1 extremity and 54% for P3 (see Figure 7 ). In general, the DO concentrations are higher more frequently in P3 than in P1 due to the shorter resi- dence times of the water in this ERB and allowing less time for de-oxygenation of the water. The generally higher DO content in P3 is also due to its shallower depth, making it a more favourable aquatic environment for phytoplankton growth. The low DO values are also a result of low re-aeration (wind calm period) and high nitrification. In contrast to experiences gained from the Havel River during the August 2002 flood, the low oxygenated water emptying into the River Elbe does not appear to have negative implications to the oxygen levels in the river water. Although the water of the Elbe River was under Figure 8.

JEP Environmental Risk Imposed by Dive rted Flood Waters on Water and Soil s in Emergency Retention Basins 135 the DO saturation level, DO was still above the threshold value of 3 mg/l at Wittenberg (see Figure 8 ). However, if these ERBs were situated further down- stream where the DO concentrations of the river water fall below the threshold value, the emptied basin water could reduce the DO concentrations further and further stress the aquatic ecosystem. 6. Conclusions The quasi-2D approach was successful in simulating the spatial distribution of flow and substance deposition in ERBs and determining the effectiveness of discharge capping. The environmental risk to heavy-metal con-tamination is minimal but may increase due to stricter threshold values. Risk may also be higher for ERBs con- structed further downstream past the Saale and Mulde river confluences where exposure to contamination is higher. There is a high potential for DO levels in the wa- ter retained in the basins to drop to very critical levels (< 3 mg O 2/L), even after 4 days of flood water retention. From an ecological perspective, the basins should also be emptied as soon as possible after the flood in order to reduce the time of de-oxygenation of the water. REFERENCES [1] K.-E.

ABSTRACT Monitoring groundwater quality by cost-effective techniques is important as the aquifers are vulnerable to contamina-tion due to point sources and non point sources. This paper presents Artificial neural Network (ANN ) Models that might be used to predict water parameters from a few known parameters. The sample data from 112 hand pumps and hand operated tube well water samples used for drinking purposes by the local population was used. The ANN model features a back propagation algorithm and neuron members were determined for optimization of the model architecture by trial and error method. The model simulations show that the optimum network of 4-50-50-6 has mean error of -0.023 % on complete data was utilized. This demonstrated that the developed model has high accuracy for predicting. Thus it has been established that the two hidden layers neural network has more efficiency than asymptotic regression in the pre- sent. This model can be used for analysis and prediction of subsurface water quality prediction. Keywords: Groundwater Quality, ANN, Ec, TDS, Sulphates, pH, Tiruchirappalli 1. Introduction Water Quality is the physical, Chemical and biological characteristics of water in relationship to a set of stan- dards. Water quality standards are created for different types of water bodies and water body locations as per desired uses. There are separate quality standards for portable water, agriculture needs, industrial needs and construction needs. The primar y uses considered for such contact and for health of ecosystems. The methods of hygrometry are used to quantify water characteristics. Water quality depends on the local geology and ecosys-tem, as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies' heat sink and overuse. References [1-3], which emphasized the work initiated from Hill's general theory of uniqueness and bifurcation [4]. Environmental engineers and researchers have paid much attention to the behavior of water quality in portable operations over the last decade. It is difficult to define criteria for describing the stability in Water quality. In general, the contamination of groundwater could occur from non point and point sources. Among the major contaminants linked to non point sources are nitrates, heavy metals and pesticides. Heavy metals con- taminate groundwater from anthropogenic sources as well as natural sources. Some of the major anthropogenic sources of heavy metals are mining, fertilizers and pesti- cides and industrial wastes [5]. The high toxicity of hu-man health is manifested in the low maximum contami- nant levels (MCL). High concentrations of heavy metals occur due to a complex inter action between factors that include land use practices and hydro geochemical condi- tions prevailing in soils [6]. Groundwater monitoring is defined as testing of groundwater over a next ended time period in oder to document groundwater conditions, including the collec- tion of chemicals such as cont aminant concentrations [7]. Only limited monitoring schemes considered the conse- quences of different concentrations and varying pumping flows among wells as a major factor. One of the most interesting aspects of hydrochemistry is the occurrence of water bodies with different water chemistries is very close proximity to each other. This has been variously attributed to the surface and subsurface geology [8]. Wa- ter quality assessment in Akpabuyo, south eastern Nige-ria indicated waters are acidic, soft and characterized by low sodium absorption ratio, and waters are classified into four chemical facies: Ca 2+-Cl-1, Na+-Cl-1, CaSO 4- and Ca-HCO 3- [9]. Studies conducted on the chemical quality of groundwater of Mangalore city in Karnataka state and madras in Tamilnadu, India revealed that the groundwa- ter quality has been deterioted due to over exploitation of groundwater [10]. Replenishment the groundwater aquifers through arti- ficial recharge were carried out tin various parts of the worlds for the last six decade s. This motivated the study 137 Analysis of Groundwater for Potability from Tiruchir appalli City Using Backpropagation Ann Model and GIS of [5] which set the basics fo r the current study area. The chemical composition of water is an important factor to be considered before it is used for domestic or irrigation purpose [11]. This present study has been conducted to assess and evaluate the groundwater quality conditions for domestic purposes. In this paper an attempt has been made to evaluate the quality indices of groundwater to understand the hydro geochemical relationships of the water quality parameters for the suitability of groundwa- ter resources. 2. Study Area, Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Area Tiruchirappalli City of Tamil Nadu, India is selected for the study. The general topology of Tiruchirappalli is flat and lies at an altitude of 78 m above sea level. Tiruchi- rappalli is fed by the rivers Cauvery and Kollidam. There are reserve forests along the river Cauvery. Golden Rock and the Rock Fort are the prominent hills. The south- ern/south-western part of the district is dotted by several hills which are thought to be an offset of the Western Ghats Mountain range and the soil is considered to be very fertile. Figure 1 shows the study area. The following data that was collected from 112 from which seventy nine hand pumps and electrically operated tube well water samples used for drinking purposes by the local population of the Trichy town of Tiruchirappalli district of Southern Tamil Nadu Shown in Figure 1 . The samples collected were during 2006 and 2008 on Pre monsoon and Post monsoon were used in our project for modeling and prediction purposes. The samples were ana- Figure 1.

JEP 138 lyzed for the following physico chemical water quality parameters as per standard methods [1]. The Laboratory tests are conducted on these samples for 16 different physico-che mical water quality parame- ters as per the standard procedure [1]. [2,12] criteria are adopted for testing these samples . The groundwater hy- drochemistry records of the study area are used for the preparation of maps. These ma ps are obtained by geosta- tistical (Kriging) methodology and the results are pre- sented in the form of equal ion concentration lines [7,10, 13]. The MATLAB software was also used to analyze the data. The groundwater quality data are used as the hidden layer for the preparation of base maps. These features are the boundary lines between mapping units, other linear features (streets, rivers, road s, etc.) and point features (bore well points, etc.). The contours are developed for pH, EC, Cl -, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Total Hardness, Alkalinity, F, SO 4-, Coliform and NO 3- values for the pre monsoon and post monsoon values. The monitoring and sampling program was initiated in 2006 and finalized the year 2008. A total of seventy nine monitoring stations were estab- lished of them represented groundwater conditions. 2.2 Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) An artificial neural network was then developed using part of the experimental data for training and testing. Finally, the neural network model was applied to Collec-tion of available data about the various water quality pa- rameters of the groundwater sources in Tiruchirappalli town of Tiruchirappalli district in Tamil Nadu, India. The reserved part of the experimental data to perform the investigation of the occurren ce of water quality constitu- ents and to examine the effe ctiveness and robustness of the neural net work model. The effect of Sulphates, TDS, Ec, Chlorides, pH, Creation of an ANN model for the prediction of Electrical Conductivity when Sulphates, Chlorides, Total Dissolved Solids and pH data are avail- able for studying wrinkling behavior in ANN model. The literature reveals that a very little effort is reported on the use of ANNs in water quality modeling. Neural networks, as used in artificial intelligence, have traditionally been viewed as simplified models of neural processing in the human brai n. It is accepted by most scientists that the human brai n is a type of computer. The origins of neural networks are based on efforts to model information processing in biological systems, which may rely largely on parallel processing as well as implicit instructions based on recognition of patterns of \"sensory\" input from external sources [14]. 2.2.1 Back Propagation Network The back propagation algorithm has made it possible to design multi-layer neural networks for numerous appli- cations, such as adaptive control, classification of sonar targets, stock market prediction and speech recognition [14]. Also, BPNN has the advantage of fast response and high learning accuracy [14]. Hence an ANN with back propagation algorithm (BP) has been adopted here to model the potability behavior of subsurface water. One of the advantages of using the neural network approach is that a model can be constructed very easily based on the given input and output and tr ained to accurately predict process dynamics. This technique is especially valuable in processes where a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms is very difficult, or even impossible to acquire, as in the case of porous powder performs during upsetting. Neural network is a logical structure with multi-processing elements, which are connected through interconnection weights. The knowledge is presented by the interconnection weights, which are adjusted during the learning phase. There are several algorithms available among which the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (trainlm ) will have the fastest convergence [15]. In many cases, trainlm is able to obtain lower mean square errors than any of the other algorithms tested. This BP network is a multi layer of the network architecture including the input layer, hidden layer(s) and output layer. Layers include several process- ing units known as neurons. They are connected with each other by variable weight s to be determined. In the network, the input layer recei ves information from exter- nal source and passes this information to the network for processing. The hidden layer receives from the input layer, and does all information processing. The output layer receives processed informati on from the network, and sends the results to an external receptor [15]. The algo- rithm for the back propagation program is described be- low with the help of flow diagram as shown in Figure 2 . 2.2.2 Model Description In the development of a multi layer neural network mod- el, several decisions regarding number of neuron(s) in the input layer, number of hidden layer(s), number of neu-ron(s) in the hidden layer(s), and number of neuron(s) in the output layer and optimum architectures have to be decided. Based on the experimental investigation by venkatkumar et al. [7,10], the important input parameters such as the total hardness. Alkalinity, chlorides and Sul-phates are given as input parameters to the present ANN model. The output parameters are the pH, the Ec, the Ca 2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K. The input/output dataset of the model is illustrated schematically in Figure 3 . 2.2.3 Approach towards Groundwater Classification A fuzzy rule based system is generated in which users classify the water according to given data in Desirable, Acceptable, Not acceptable, Rejected quality with re- spect to different parameters, all connected using AND operator. The user's feedback is also taken with respect to overall quality for different parameters connected by AND operator. For example, one of the feedbacks taken Analysis of Groundwater for Potability from Tiruchir appalli City Using Backpropagation Ann Model and GIS 139 Figure 2. Model for feed forward network (source: Matlab user guide) (Ca2+) (Mg2+) Figure 3. Schematically input/output data set model for prediction of Chlorides and Sulphates may be like this, If TDS = good AND pH = medium and Sulphate = good then, overall water quality = What! Af-ter this, Delphi's technique is applied to converge the feedback of various users to a single value. A degree of match is computed between the user's perception and field data for different parameters and for every type of water quality viz. good, (Desirable) medium (Acceptable) or bad (Not Desirable). The water quality for which de-gree of match is the highest is considered to represent the quality of the water sample (see Figure 4 ). 3. Results and Discussions Physio-chemical Groundwater quality assessment by de-terministic method for drinking groundwater usage on the basis of 8 water quality parameters were compared with the concentration in the water with point value prescribed limits. In case Groundwater quality model approach, these 8 parameters were divided in the four categories on the basis of expert opinion having their importance with re- spect to drinking water quality criteria. The hydro chemical analyses revealed that water sam- ples in the study area is char acterized by hard to very hard, fresh to brackish and alkaline in nature. The highly turbid water may cause health risk as excessive turbidity can protect pathogenic micr oorganisms from the effects of disinfectants and also stimul ate the growth of bacteria Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

The performance capability of each network has been examined based on the correlation coefficient, error dis- tribution, and convergence of entire dataset within speci- fied error range between the network predictions and the experimental values using the test and entire dataset. In order to decide the optimum structure of neural network, the rate of error convergence was checked by changing the number of hidden neurons and number of hidden lay- ers. From out results, it is identified that the network with single hidden layer of 50 neurons has given correlation coefficient of 0.9978 and m ean error of 0.0289% which means the error distribution was uniform. But it was ob-served that only 78.68% of entire dataset are within \u00b1 4% error further increasing of neuron in the single hidden layer (beyond 50); the error distribution was not uniform. Hence, it has been decided to select two hidden layers and varied the number of neurons in each hidden layer to get an optimum one. It was observed that the network with 50 neurons in each hidden layer has produced the best performance for each of the output parameters (4-50-50-6). It is also obse rved that the architectures 4-40-40-6, 4-46-46-6, and 4-52-52-6, have more dif- ference in the mean correlatio n coefficient than previous architecture; it had not been selected as an optimum ar- chitecture, because the mean prediction error as well as the error distribution, maximum value of error, minimum value of error were observed as high. It was evaluated and presented the optimum network model of 4-50-50-6 has mean prediction error of -0.023% on the entire dataset. The result shows that 91.69%, 95.78%, and 98.63% of the entire dataset were the per-centage error ranging between \u00b1 4%, \u00b1 8, and \u00b1 12% respectively. This was demonstrated that the developed model has high accuracy for predicting. Characteristic by pH values, most of the water samples were alkaline in nature which are well within permissible limit (6.5-8.5) and some of the samples have been found acceptable for usage and the ranges were between 6.5 and 9.2 meeting BIS standards of IS:10500:1991 and WHO (2006) guide- lines. Based on Electrical Conductivity (Ec) values measured all water samples Zone-I (Srirangam) were desirable (< 1 mS/cm) for potability. Potability maps for the Premonsoon period are shown as Figures 5(a) , 5(b) and 5(c) for years 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. 4. Conclusions The quality of the groundwater of the Tiruchirappalli city was monitored in 79 sampling wells for 3 years and re-corded data revealed that th e concentrations of cations and anions were above the maximum, desirable for hu-man consumption. The Electrical Conductivity was found to be the most significant parameter within input parameters used in the modeling. The developed model was enabled well to test the data obtained from 79 sam- ples of bore wells of Tiruch irappalli city. Therefore, with the proposed model applications, it was possible to man- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

ABSTRACT With the aid of thermomagnetic analysis (TMA ) up to 800\u00ba the composition and distribution of particles of native iron and Fe-Ni alloy was studied in 15 sections, Gams of sediments varies from Miocene to Early Cretaceous . Iron particles are present at 521samples out of 921studied. Their percentage varies from 10-5% to 0.05%. The distribution consists of two groups : 1) \" zero\" group (iron is not found by TMA ); 2) group of logarithmic normal distribution with a differing modes . The global enrichment by iron particles in synchronous depos- its of Miocene, Maastrichtian-Danian, Santonian and Cenomani an was discovered. With resp ect to nickel content, the iron particles fall into two groups : 1) nearly pure iron without nickel ; and 2) iron with nickel content up to 20%, with modal value of 5%. The source of iron particles is the cosmic dust . Particles of pure nickel and the alloy containing more of 20% of nickel are very rare. Possibly, such particles are related mainly with impact events. A peak of elevated iron content with nearly constant nickel of 5-6% was found in almost all studied sections . It is a global effect which is not dependent of place and time of deposition of iron particles . Keywords: Cosmic Dust, Metallic Iron, Nickel, Fe -Ni Alloy, Meteorites, Sediments, Thermomagnetic Analysis, Curie Point 1. Introduction Modern data on distribution of native iron and nickel in the cosmic dust is rather li mited, since only \"direct\" me- thods of detecting such particles were used. Thermo- magnetic analysis (TMA) up to 800\u00baC was employed during petromagnetic (rock-magnetic) studies of sedi- ments [1-7]. The increase of MA temperature interval by 100 has given the chance to observe a detailed pic- ture of a distribution of metallic iron in space and time. Thermomagnetic investigations of composition and distribution of particles of native iron and Fe-Ni alloy was performed in 15 sediment sections: The spatial spread of the objects, from Gams in the west to Khalats in the east, is approximately 3000km. It allows to evaluate the glob al character of accumulation of cosmic particles in coeval deposits. Detailed selection of samples from Cretaceous sequences helps to find out features of accumulation of particles in time. 2. Methods of Petromagnetic Studies Petromagnetic studies included measurements of sample magnetization and its dependence upon temperature, i.e. thermomagnetic analysis (TMA). TMA was carried out with the aid of Curie express balance [8]. The curves of (T) after the first and second heating to 800\u00b0C were obtained for all samples. It is possible to analyze distri-bution of Curie points. It is known that in particles of cosmic iron the basic impurity is nickel. Converting Cu- rie points into Ni content facilitates subsequent compari- son of TMA data with those of microprobe and other analyses. 144 Metallic Iron and Nickel in Cretaceous and Cenozoic Sediments: The Results of Thermomagnetic Analysis For this purpose, we assumed a linear dependence of Curie points on Fe-Ni alloy compositions. Then the nick- el content will be defined by the simple formula: Ni (wt. %) = 0.243 (770 - TC), where 770 is the Curie point of iron, T C is a Curie point of the sample. This assumption has to be checked up. It is known that the Ni-Fe alloys with nickel content of less than 30% preserve the ordered - phase with body-cen- tred lattice close to the room temperature. - phase transforms into ' - phase with ordered face-centred lattice and - phase with disordered face-centred lattice at higher concentrations of nickel and/or at higher tem- perature [9-11]. In such and '- alloys, Curie points de- viate from the above linear dependence, \"underestimates\" being more often than \"overestimates\" ( Table 1 ). For example, invar (36% Ni) has TC = 230-270oC, i.e. below Curie point of pure nickel (358), but increases to 400 under mechanical stress [12]. There are apparent \"Curie points\" as a result of transformation at sample heating and transformation at its cooling. Such situations mainly occur in Fe-Ni alloys of interme- diate composition, with nickel of > 20% and < 80%. For them, appreciable deviations in the estimation of nickel content with the aid of linear dependence - Ni are common ( Table 1 ). In our case, it was more important not to understand the nature of such deviations, but to address two topics: 1) application the linear dependence - Ni to the natural meteorites containing Fe-Ni alloys of intermediate com- position, and 2) distribution of particles of a Fe-Ni alloy of intermediate composition in a cosmic dust. To answer the first question, the data from papers [10, 13,14] has been used, where both microprobe analysis data and MA results for samples of metal meteorites and metal inclusion in stone meteorites are available (Table 2 ). Samples contain kamacite ( - phase), tetra- taenite (' - phase) and taenite ( - phase) in different proportion. Appreciable divergences were noted only for two samples of alloys of intermediate composition: Ya- mato79069 and San-Cristobal. Hence, the use of linear dependence of T C - Ni for definition of the nickel con- centration on MA is admissible as the first approxima- tion. To answer the second questio n, we collected the data on composition of metal particles in the cosmic dust from the icecaps of Antarctica and Greenland, deep-sea ocean sediments, Pleistocene sediments of Canada, Eocene limestone of Tuamotu, the deposits from the area of Tunguska catastrophe, and sediments at the / bound- ary in Gams [1,15-17]. Figure 1 shows that the particles with nickel content of > 20% and < 80% are very rare. For the other compositions, the estimation of the per-centage of nickel content with the linear dependence - Ni is quite applicable. Figure 1.

Bold-faced line is the dM/d T curve of first heating; thin line is the curve of second heating Another problem is that detecting Fe-Ni alloys be- tween 360C and 680C is very difficult, as their Curie points and those for the hemoilmenite and titanomagnet-ite series overlap. For an identification of such Ni-Fe alloys, the samples have been chosen, in which Curie points are reproducible upon the second heating, and the Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP 146 Metallic Iron and Nickel in Cretaceous and Cenozoic Sediments: The Results of Thermomagnetic Analysis contribution of these magnetic phases in magnetization did not change noticeably (Figure 2 ). This provision allows to assume that such samples contain particles of Ni-Fe alloy with nickel from 100% ( C = 360) to 27% (C = 660). Really, magnetic minerals like pyrrhotite, titanomagnetite, and hemoilmenite are unstable and are oxidized during heating to 800 , are destroyed and/or homogenized and their Curie points are decreased; hence their contribution to sample magnetization varies greatly. To estimate the content of native iron, Ni-Fe alloy, magnetite + titanomagnetite, the contribution of each mineral into magnetization M was determined using the M (T) curves and, then, it was divided by the specific saturation magnetization of each mineral. The values of M s = 90 m2/kg for magnetite + titanomagnetite with TC = 540-580oC, and Ms = 200m2/kg for iron with TC = 700-770oC was used. The linear dependence Ms between nickel (s = 56.7m2/kg) and iron ( s = 212m2/kg) was accepted for Ni-Fe alloy [9]: s (Ni-Fe alloy) = 56.7 + 0.37 ( C - 360). The contribution of a mineral into bulk magnetization cannot be estimated with the accuracy of better than 10%. Accordingly accuracy for iron and alloy particles content cannot be better. The accuracy of Curie point determina- tion is ~5-10o, which corresponds to a nickel admixture of 1-2%. The lack of the linear dependence of TC - Ni and the limited accuracy of MA are compensated by the simplicity of sample preparation and their TMA, allow-ing quick acquisition of large datasets. The content of magnetite and titanomagnetite were determined to take into account re-deposition during ac-cumulation of iron particles. Their formation and accu- mulation, unlike native iron, has a terrestrial origin. The coefficients of linear correlation of iron and magnetite + titanomagnetite were calculated ( Table 3 ). Sequences of deposition of all sections are translated into a time for convenience of their comparison as fol- lows: it was assumed that the sediments accumulated with a constant velocity during each stratigraphic stage. Table 3. Coefficients of linear correlation between particles of magnetite was defined by dividing the duration of a stage by its thickness. Then , the age of each sampling point was defined by multiplying the distance (thickness) to the stage boundary by the sedimentation velocity. The stage ages were taken from the geological time scale- 2008 [18]. 3. Results of Thermomagnetic Studies and Discussion Content of metallic particles in sediments. The particles of native iron were found in 521 samples out of 901 stu- died, their concentration ranging from 10-5% to 0.05%. The bimodal distribution of concentration of iron parti-cles is usually clearly visible for separate sections, areas, and the sum of the data (Figure 3 ): the first set with the \"zero\" mode comprises the deposits, in which iron is absent (it is not found out by MA); distribution of such sediments in the studied sections is irregular. The second set has more often lognormal distribution with the slight- ly age-dependent modes: the the North Caucasus is 0.15 \u00d7 10-3% (Gergebil), and (Kvirinaki) are for Miocene sediments. Four types of accumulation of metallic particles in the sediments are recognized: Dotty type : the increased iron content is found in one sample, in a \"dot\", and is absent in the adjacent samples. This type has a random charact er and can result from the primary fall of iron into the sediment and from its re-deposition. Local type : the increased content of iron is found in a series of adjacent samples from a section and cannot trace from section to section. Such local accumulation of iron can occupy a long enough interval of time. Most likely, it is combination of primary accumulation and secondary re-deposition. Example of long non-uniform local primary accumulation of iron is the Bass section in the interval from 81 Ma to 72 Ma. An example of long mainly secondary accumulation of iron as a result of re-deposition is the Kara-Kala section in interval from 95 Ma to 99 Ma [7]. Regional type : the enrichment by iron is found in synchronous intervals at several sections in a region. It is unlikely that it is a result of re-deposition, which was synchronous over a wide area. The regional effect of enrichment by iron of sediments becomes more clearly visible if to combine all studied sections ( Figure 4 ). Global type : the enrichment by iron is found in syn- chronous intervals at several sections from different re-mote regions. It is possible to recognize the following intervals of regional and global enrichment by iron ( Figure 4 ): 1) 12-13 Ma, the Middle-Lat e Miocene. The iron con- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

JEP 147 tent that reaches 4 \u00d7 10-3% is found at two sections (Kha- lats and Kvirinaki) that are more than 1500 km apart. 2) 64 -67 Ma, Early Danian-Late Maastrichtian. The iron content that reaches 4 \u00d7 10-3% is found in the Gams, North Caucasus, Teplovka sections, but isn't detected in the Crimea, Tetritskaro, and Koshak sections. 3) 84-86 Ma, Santonian. The increased iron concentra- tion is found at five sections that are more 1000 km apart, with the maximum content ranging from 0.2 \u00d7 10-3% (Madzhalis) to 2.9 \u00d7 10-3% (Kara-Kala). This interval nearly coincides with the upper boundary of the Dzhalal paleomagnetic hyperchron (the interval of the geomag-netic field without reversals, 125-85 Ma [19]). The lower boundary of the Dzhalal hype rchron is not defined accu- rately, probably because of sparse sampling at and 4) 94-96 Ma, Late Cenomanian. The increased iron concentration is found at the Aimaki (94.9-95.6 Ma) and Kara-Kala (93.8-97.4 Ma) sections that are more than 1000 km apart. With a less ce rtainty, this interval can be related to the global enrichment by iron because of some role of iron re-deposition in the lower parts of both sec-tions [7]. The wide spatial distribution of iron particles and global character of the above noted intervals of the in-creased iron concentration tes tifies to the cosmic dust as their main cause. The iron particles fell on the Earth sur-face irregularly and probably came from different sources, as is indicated by the bimodal distribution of their concentrations ( Figure 3 ). In contrast to iron particles, the particles of Ni-Fe alloy with > 20% Ni are rare, their concentration does not cor- relate with the concentration of iron particles (r = -0.045). Appreciable correlation with the magnetite + titanomag- netite concentration (r = 0.7) in the sediments may mean that the noticeable part of th ese particles is not a Ni-Fe alloy, while the terrestrial minerals, like titanomagnetite and hemoilmenite, are fully preserved after heating to 800 , which is unlikely. Otherwise, these are the parti- cles of a Ni-Fe alloy that were re-deposited together with terrestrial minerals. Such a sharp difference in the quan-tity and accumulation conditions between iron and Ni-Fe alloy particles and the absence of correlation between their contents most likely testifies to their different origin. If the first are produced by cosmic dust fall on the Earth surface, the second are possi bly connected with impact events. Irrespective of the reliability of detecting Ni-Fe alloy particles, it is possible to assert that their concentra- tion is likely to be below 10 -5% (i.e., below of sensitivity threshold of MA) in the cosmic dust. Figure 3. Histograms of iron pa rticles concentrations in the studied sections. Intervals of iron concentrations (logarith- mic scale): 1 - 0-0.01(10-3%); 2 - 0.01-0.03; 3 - 0.03-0.07; 4 - 0.07-0.15; 5 - 0.15-0.31; 6 - 0.31-0.63; 7 - 0.63-1.27; 8 - 1.27-2.55; 9 - 2.55-5.11; 10 - 5. 11-10.23; 11 - 10.23-20.49; 12 - 20.49-54 (10-3%). Histograms are arranged on age from Miocene to Early Cretaceous Comp osition of metallic particles. Judging by the Cu- rie points, composition of iron particles varies approxi- mately in the same range from 680C to 780C in all sec- tions that corresponds to Ni -content from 22% to zero Metallic Iron and Nickel in Cretace ous and Cenozoic Sediments: The Re sults 148 ( a ) ( b ) Figure 4. Iron distribution in (a) Miocene and (b) Cretaceous sediments. The sum of the data (Figure 5 ). From TC = 690oC to 360C, the number of particles sharply decreases, they are absent altogether. Really, just 46 samples with Curie points of 360 oC to 660C, and hence probably co ntaining particles of a Ni-Fe alloy, are found ( Table 4 , Figure 5 ). The errors in detection of Ni-Fe alloy are quite probable, and so the proven cases of Ni-Fe alloy cannot exceed the above number. The rarity of Ni-Fe alloys of intermediate com-position among metal particles of cosmic dust is con- firmed with direct measurem ents of composition of dust particles ( Figure 1 ). Dust particles of pure nickel (Ni80- 100%) were met indeed ( Figure 1 ), but practically all of them are from one point of the / boundary layer in the Gams section [1]. Figure 5 demonstrates that the distribution of iron par- ticles composition falls into two groups (not counting the \"tail\" in the interval 350 oC-660): 1) pure iron without nickel addition and 2) nearly lognormal distribution with the mode of nickel of 5%. Bimodal distribution of parti- cles of iron, probably, reflec ts different sources of pure iron and iron with the nickel impurity. The second set with the mode Ni of 5% is sufficiently proven by the data on composition of dust particles (Figure 1 ). The first set of pure iron agrees with the data on lunar samples. For example, metal particles from the lunar material such as volcan ic glass, basalts and breccias that was delivered by Apollo 11 and 12 consist mainly of nearly pure iron [20-29]. Curie points close to 770 C prevail, with average TC = 765oC. It is quite probable that it is specificity of lunar magmatic rocks. Fragments of meteorites, which have been picked up on the Moon during the Apollo missions, contain Fe-Ni alloys of in- termediate composition that are usual for metal meteor- ites. Numerous microspherul es (products of impacts) contain of nickel from < 1 to > 20 wt. % [29-31]. Irre- versible character of heating-cooling M (T) curves, pecu- liar for - transformation in Fe-Ni alloys, was marked. Visible regularities in Curie point distribution and, accordingly, the nickel content in iron particles, were not found between sections. The compositions of iron parti-cles form a diffuse cloud ( Figure 6( )), which is typical for the cosmic dust. Nearly constant smoothed values of Ni content are observed in the 110-60 Ma interval ( Figure 6(b)). They vary within 6-8%, i.e. within the error limits of Curie point estimation. The average content of nickel is 5% in Lower Cretaceous and Miocene sediments. The Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Metallic Iron and Nickel in Cretace ous and Cenozoic Sediments: The Re sults of Thermomagnetic Analysis 151 permanent average composition of iron particles is likely to imply the constancy of the cosmic dust cloud, through which our planet moved. It is important to emphasize that, unlike the concentration of iron in sediments, which depend on re-deposition, the re-deposition does not affect the composition of iron grains. The time-distribution of iron particles with nickel con- tent close to the modes of the two sets (zero and 5% \u00b1 1%) also has no prominent features ( Figure 7 ). It is important to note that their distributions are not correlated with each other (Figure 8 ). This indicates the different sources of particles of pure iron and iron with nickel addition.

JEP Metallic Iron and Nickel in Cretace ous and Cenozoic Sediments: The Re sults of Thermomagnetic Analysis 152 During four intervals of global enrichment of sedi- ments by iron, the particles of the second set (Fe with Ni addition) obviously prevail ( Figure 9 ). The number of cases of pure iron is insignific ant and varies from interval to interval: 1) Just one sample with pure iron out 16 MA data is found for the 10 -13 Ma interval. The nickel content varies from 3% to 10%, 5.2% on average. 2) For the 64-66 Ma interval, pure iron is found in eight cases out of 150 MA data. The nickel admixture varies from 2 to 34%, 7.6% on average. 3) For the interval 84-86 Ma, pure iron is found in twelve cases out of 68 MA data. The nickel admixture varies from 2 to 20%, 8.4% on average. 4) For the 94-96 Ma interval, pure iron is de- tected in two cases out of 48 MA data. The nickel ad- mixture varies from 2 to 20%, 8.1% on average. So, the average nickel contents nearly coincide in the Late Cre- taceous intervals and significantly differ in the Miocene. No correlation between the concentration of iron parti- cles and the nickel content in them is observed (r = -0,024). On this background, a peak of enrichment by iron with almost constant nickel content of 5% is visible, irrespective of the place and age of sediments ( Figure 10). This enrichment is found even in Crimea, where the iron content very low ( Figure 10 ). Thus this is a certain global effect. 4. Conclusions The detailed pattern of distribution of native iron parti-cles in place and time during the Cretaceous, Danian and Miocene is discovered with the aid of thermomagnetic analysis up to 800\u00ba . The main results of our studies are as follows: 1) The concentration of native iron particles in sedi- ments ranges from 10 -5% to 0.05%; they are found in 521 samples out of 921 studied from 15 Cretaceous, Danian and Miocene sections of Austria, Russia (the Volga re- gion, Caucasus), Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Irrespective of sediment age and locality, their bimodal distribution is typical. The first set with the zero mode includes the sediments, in which iron is not revealed by MA; the distribution of such deposits in the studied sections is irregular and likely reflects the non-uniformity of iron particle fall. The second set has lognormal distri- bution with the mode of 0.04-0.15 (10 -3%). 2) The global enrichment by iron particles is discov- in Miocene and (94-96 Ma) deposits in the sections more than 1000km apart. The omnipresence of iron particles and global spread Figure 9. The content of nickel impurity in intervals of global enrichment of iron particles in sediments Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Dependence of nickel impurity in iron particles from their content in the sediment. The maximum concen- trations of iron particles are denoted by red color of the above-noted intervals of iron enrichment indicates the cosmic dust as their main source. Iron particles fall to the Earth surface irregularly and probably from different sources, as may be inferred from bimodal distribution of their concentration. 3) Distribution of iron particles composition falls into two sets: the first one corresponds to pure iron without nickel, and the second set has the nearly lognormal dis-tribution with the modal nickel of 5%. This bimodal dis- tribution implies different origin for of pure iron particles and those with a nickel addition. The lunar rocks are may be the source for the first type. It is worth noting that there are quite few particles with Curie points between 680 and 360; hence the particles of Fe-Ni alloys of such composition are very rare. The difference in quantities of iron and Ni-Fe alloy particles and the absence of correlation between their contents indicates their different origin. If the first ones are mainly produced by the fall of cosmic dust on the Earth surface, the second on es are possibly connected with meteorites and impact events. In all cases, it is possible to assert that the possible concentration of Ni-Fe alloy particles is below 10 -5% (which is the MA sensitivity) in the cosmic dust. This conclusion is valid irrespective of the reliability, with which Ni-Fe alloy particles are detected. 4) There is no correlation between the concentration of iron particles in sediments and nickel content in them. At the same time, the peak of high iron concentration with the same nickel content of 5% is found in almost all stu- died sections irrespective of the location and age of these sediments. Thus it is a certain global effect. REFERENCES [1] A. F. Grachev, O. A. Korc hagin, H. A.

ABSTRACT This paper focuses on a concept of using dimensionless variables as input and output to Artificial Neural Network (ANN ) and discusses the improvement in the results in terms of various performance criteria as well as simplification of ANN structure for modeling rainfall-runoff process in certain Indian catchments. In the present work, runoff is taken as the response ( output ) variable while rainfall, slope, area of catchment and forest cover are taken as input parameters. The data used in this study are taken from six drainage basins in the Indian provinces of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Ra- jasthan, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, located in the different hydro-climatic zones. A standard statistical performance evaluation measures such as root mean square ( RMSE ), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Correlation coefficient were em- ployed to evaluate the performances of various models developed. The results obtained in this study indicate that ANN model using dimensionless variables were able to provide a better representation of rainfall-runoff process in com- parison with the ANN models using process variables investigated in this study. Keywords: Dimensional Variables , Artificial Neural Networks , Rainfall-Runoff 1. Introduction The rainfall-runoff relationship is one the most complex hydrological phenomenon due to the tremendous spatial and temporal variability of watershed characteristics and rainfall patterns as well as a number of variables in- volved in the physical processes. Also, this process is non-linear in nature and thus difficult to arrive at explicit solutions [1,2]. The runoff needs to be estimated for effi- cient utilization of water re sources. The rainfall-runoff models play a significant role in water resource man- agement planning and hydraulic design. Several attempts have been made to model the non-linearity of the rain-fall-runoff process, arising fro m intrinsic non-linearity of the rainfall-runoff process and from seasonality These rainfall-runoff models generally fall into these broad categories; namely, black box or system theoretical mod- els, conceptual models and physically-based models [3-5]. Black box models normally contain no physi-cally-based input and output transfer functions and therefore, are consid ered to be purely empirical models. Conceptual rainfall-runoff models usually incorporate interconnected physical elements with simplified forms, and each element is used to represent a significant or dominant constituent hydrologic process of the rain-fall-runoff transformation [6,7]. A dimensional analysis technique has also been developed and used to obtain mean annual flood estimation in several Indian catch- ments [8]. In recent year, applications of Artificial Neural Net- work (ANN) has become increasing popular in water resources and have been used in various fields for the prediction and forecasting of complex nonlinear proc-esses, including the rainfall runoff phenomenon. Many studies have demonstrated that the ANNs are excellent tools to model the complex rainfall-runoff process and can perform better than the conventional modeling tech-niques [1,9-12] However, many a times, less attention is given to simplify the ANN structure. The use of dimensionless variables as input and output to ANN in rainfall-runoff modeling has not been found in the literature as of our best knowledge. Although, some evidences of using dimensionless variables in ANN are known in application of estimation of scour downstream [13] and for heat problems [14]. Swamee used the di-mensionless variables to co mpute annual flood estima- tion and hence, the same dimensionless variables are used in this present study in the context of rainfall-runoff process [8]. Thus, in view of the above, the objectives of the pre- sent study are to 1) evaluate dimensional analysis tech- nique of Swamee et al .; 2) investigate the technique of Analysis of Mean Monthly Rainfall Runoff Data of Indian Catchments Using Dime nsionless Variables by Neural Network 156 ANNs using process variables as well as dimensionless variables for modeling the complex rainfall-runoff proc-ess; and 3) to achieve simpli fications in ANN structure. The paper begins with a brief introduction of the com-puting techniques of ANN and study area followed by the details of the model development before discussing the results and making concluding remarks. The tech- niques are applied on all river basin data used in the pre-sent study and Damodar river basin is used as an exam- ple of individual river basi n to examine the effects on individual catchment. 2. Artificial Neural Network The Artificial Neural Network represents an alternative computational paradigm where the solution to a problem is learned from a set of samples. An artificial neural network consists of simple synchronous element, called neurons, which are analogous to the biological neurons in the human brain [7,15]. These neurons are arranged in layers in a network. The neurons in one layer are con- nected to those in the adjace nt layers and strength of connection between the two neurons in adjacent layers is called \"weight\". There are weights on each of the inter- connections and it is these weights that are altered during the training process to ensu re that the inputs produce an output that is close to the desired value with an appropri-ate training rule being used to adjust the weights in ac-cordance with the data that ar e presented to the network. An ANN normally consists of three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. In a feed-forward network, the weighted connections feed activations only in the forward direction from an input layer to the output layer. Each node in a layer receives and processes weighted input from a previous layer and transmits its output to nodes in the following layer through links. A typical three layer feed-forward network is shown in Figure 1 . There are many optimization techniques for neural networks training using the backpropagation algo- rithm. Recently, Levenberg-Marquardt learning algo-rithms are used increasingly due to the better perform- ance and learning speed with a simple structure [15,16]. Figure 1. Three layer feed-forward neural network This learning algorithm is discussed here briefly as fol- lows: The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is based on ap- proaching second-order training speeds without having the computation of Hessian matrix [17]. The Leven-berg-Marquardt algorithm uses an to the Hessian matrix in the following Newton-like update: when is large, this becomes gradient descent with a small step size, and when is small, the algorithm ap- proximates the Newton's method. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm uses this ap- proximation to obtain the revised weight in the following form: Xk + 1 = Xk - 1[]TTJJI J e ( 1 ) where J is the Jacobian matrix th at contains first deriva- tives of the network errors with respect to the weights and biases; e is a vector of network errors and I is an identity matrix [15,18,19]. Study Area The data used in this study are from 31 sub-catchments of six large drainage basins in the Indian provinces of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Locations of the various catchments and sub-catchments taken for the analysis are shown in Fig- ure 2 . The sub-catchments were grouped under six major river basins namely Damodar, Barkar, Chambal, May-urakshi, Lower Bhawani and Ram Ganga. Figure 2.

The monthly rainfall for each catchment was averaged using the Theissen polygon method. The hydrological data for use in the present study is taken from Pooja Jain and Rama Raju [20,21]. These data were originally taken from the reports of Soil and Water Conservation Division, (1984, 1987) published by Water Conservation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. The periods for which data is available vary from 10 to 17 years. Some data points were excluded from published hydrological data where runo ff was more than precipita- tion, which is practically not possible. Mean values of several years of data are given in Table 1 and ranges of the above mentioned data used in the present study are given in Table 2 . Table 1.

Methods 3.1 Dimensional Analysis For dimensional analysis, Buckingham's theorem can be used to obtain the various dimensionless groups [8]. Swamee has investigated the influence of inclusion of 4 dimensionless groups in mean flood flow estimation. These dimensionless groups were formed using variables such as discharge Q, Area A, average rainfall p, of dura- tion D and recurrence interval T, Slope S and forest cover F A [8]. Based on available data for Indian catchments, fol- lowing variables were identified: rainfall ( P), runoff ( R), slope ( S) and forest cover ( FA). Adopting A as the re- peated variable, following nondimensional groups were formed: R * = R ) P* = A-0.5 P ( 3 ) where R is the runoff in mm, P is the rainfall in mm and A is the drainage area in km2. Using the above dimensionless group, the following empirical equation was proposed: 3 1 *0 * 2 4 () ( )a a A Ra P S a Fa5a 5)a ( 4 ) Here a0-a5 are empirical constants, S is the slope (per- cent) and FA is the forest cover. The computed value for R* for i th data set R *ci was ob- tained as 3 1 *0 * 2 4 () (a a ci i i AiRa P S a F a ( 5 ) Here suffix i stand for ith data set and a0-a5 are fitted coefficients. Using Equation (5), the observed value R* for ith data set R*oi was obtained. To calibrate the model, the error criterion was set to minimize the average percentage er- ror Ea, defined as ** 1 *100n oi ci i oiRREanR ( 6 ) 3.2 ANN Model Development Using Process Variables Before the data presented to the ANN training, it must be standardized in order to restrict its range to the interval [0, 1]. The actual observed outputs of the network being outside this bounded range of neuron transfer function; need to be normalized such that they fall within the bounded output range. To develop a model, it is impor-tant to establish a correlation between the dependent variable with the independent variables. For this purpose, correlation matrix has been made and is given in Table 3 . Using the information drawn from the correlation matrix analysis, runoff models have been decided as a function of different input variables. However, rainfall has been considered as a common input variable among all. 1: ( ) { ( ) } ANNPAM R ) { ( ) S F A (10) 5: ( P t P t S F A Here ANNPAM represents Artificial Neural Network Process variables All river basins Model. The development of rainfall-runoff models using ANNs, involves the following steps: 1) selection of data set for training, cross-validation and validation of the model, 2) identification of the input and output variables, 3) normalization of the data, 4) selection of the network architecture, 5) determining the number of neurons in the hidden layer, 6) training of the ANN models, and 7) validation and cross-validation of ANN model using the selected performance evaluation statistics. Back Propagation Learning Network (BPLN) has been first calibrated using about 60 percent of data and 20 percent of data have been used in the validation of model. The remaining 20 percent have been used for cross vali- dation of the model. The mome ntum coefficient is ada- pted to 0.9 and learning rate is fixed to 0.05 for neural network training. The number of epochs has been set to 3000. Log sigmoid is used as transfer function. The set of inputs combination which produced desired results cor- responding to minimum RMSE were adopted for further analysis. 3.3 ANN Model Development Using Dimensionless Variables Following model ANNDAM 1 has been developed using dimensionless variables of rainfall ( P*), slope ( S), forest ( R*). sents Artificial Neural Network Dimensionless All river basin Model.

Results and Discussion Here is summary of results for all river basins data as well as Damodar river basin data using different tech-niques. All River Basins ANN models using process variables have been de- veloped using all river basin data and the best identified NN architecture was 4-6-1 of model ANNPAM4 for which RMSE was in the range of 18.70-31.30 and Nash- Sutcliffe efficiency was in the range of 0.689-0.907 while RMSE was in the range of 2.79-5.11, Nash-Sut-cliffe efficiency was 0.45-0.73 and CC was in the range of 0.729-0.910 for model DAAM 1 using dimensional analysis technique. Hence, it can be concluded that di- mensional analysis technique performed better than ANN models using process variables for all river basins data. Based on the performance evaluation of ANN models using dimensionless variables, ANNDAM 1 performed better than model ANNPAM 4 using all river basin data in terms of performance criteria. For this model ANNDAM 1, RMSE was in the range of 2.13-6.88 while RMSE was in the range of 18.70-31.30 for ANNPAM 4 using ANN models with process variable s. For best identified struc-ture 3-1-1 with model ANNDAM 1, RMSE was in range of 2.86-4.86, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency was in the range of 0.20-0.90 and CC was in the range of 0.64-090. Hence, it can be concluded that ANN models using dimen- sionless variables performed better than Ann models us- ing process variables for all river basins data. The com-parison of observed and computed runoff for models ANNPAM 4 and ANNDAM 1 have been shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively. It is important to note here that the ANN architecture of best identified model ANNPAM 4 using process vari- ables was 4-6-1 while ANN architecture of best identi- fied model ANNDAM 1 using dimensionless variables was 3-1-1. Hence it can be concluded that ANN structure can be simplified using dimensionless variables. In this analysis of given data set, it has been found that there was not much improvem ent in performance criteria by using input process variable as P(t-1). For best identi-fied model ANNPAM 5 with NN architecture 5-2-2-1 us- ing P(t-1) as one of input variables, RMSE was the range of 19.40-28.61 while RMSE was in range of 18.70-31.30 for the best identified model ANNPAM 4 with NN archi- tecture 4-6-1 without using P(t-1) as a one of input proc- ess variable. Similarly, for ANN model ANNDAM 2 with NN architecture 4-1-1 using P(t-1) as one of input di-mensionless variables, RMSE was in the range of 2.92-4.52 while for ANN model ANNDAM 1 with NN architecture 3-1-1 without using P(t-1), RMSE was in the range of 2.86-4.86.

JEP 1 Comparison between Non-Gaussian Puff Model and a Model Based on a Time-Dependent Solution of Advection-Diffusion Equation 1Institute March 30th, 2010; revised April 27th, 2010; accepted April 29th, 2010. ABSTRACT A comparison between a non-Gaussian puff model and an advanced time-dependent model to simulate the pollutant dispersion in the Planetary Boundary Layer is presented. The puff model is based on a general technique for solving the K-equation, using the truncated Gram-Charlier expansion (type A) of the concentration field and finite set equations for the corresponding moments. The other model (named ADMM : Analytical Dispersion Multilayers Model ) is solution to time-dependent two-dimensional advecti on-diffusion equation based on a discretization of PBL in N sub-layers; in each sub-layers the advection-diffusi on equation is solved by the Laplace transform technique, considering an average value for eddy diffusivity and the wind speed. A preliminary performance evaluation is shown in the case of continuous emission from an elevated source in a variable boundary layer. Both models were able to correctly reproduce the concentration field measured and so to be used as operative air pollution models. Keywords: Advection-Diffusion Equation, Air Pollution Modeling, Analytical Solution, Puff Models 1. Introduction Both our scientific understanding and technical devel- opments have been greatly increased by the use of em-pirical, analytical and numerical models to predict the air pollution concentration in atmosphere. For this purpose, the advection-diffusion equation has been largely applied in operational atmospheric dispersion models. In princi- ple, from this equation it is possible to obtain the disper-sion from a source given appropriate boundary and initial conditions plus knowledge of the mean wind velocity and concentration turbulent fluxes [1]. Gaussian models are theoretically based upon an exact, but not realistic solution of the equation of transport and diffusion in the atmosphere, in cases where both wind and turbulent diffusion coeffi cients are constant with height. The solution is forced to represent real situations by means of empirical parameters, referred to as \"sig- mas\". They can be either stationary (the plume models) or time-dependent (puff models). Quasi-instantaneous and short-term releases are fre- quently viewed as \"puff\" releases. A puff release sce-nario assumes that the release time and sampling times are very short compared to the travel time from the source to the receptor. The various versions of Gaussian models essentially differ in the techniques utilized to calculate the sigmas as a function of atmospheric stability and the downwind distance from the emission so urce [2]. Gaussian models are fast, simple and do not require complex meteorologi-cal inputs (in comparison to numerical models). For these reasons they are still widely used by the environmental agencies all over the world for regulatory applications. Nonetheless, because of their well known intrinsic limits, the reliability of a Gaussian model strongly de- pends on the way the dispersion parameters are deter- mined on the basis of the turbulence structure of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the model's ability to reproduce experimental diffusion data. A great variety of formulations exist [3-10]. One of the most popular Gaussian models is AERMOD [11] and among puff models CALPUFF [12] has to be outlined. Among non-Gaussian models we outline the puff model proposed by van Ulden [13], the plume non- Comparison between Non-Gaussian Puff Model and a Model Based on a Time-Dependent 173 Solution of Advection-Diffusion Equation Gaussian model by Sharan and Modani [14] and analyti- cal models presented in [15]. In order to take in account the puff releases, Reference [16] developed a K-model for the dispersion of passive non-Gaussian puffs. The model is based on a general technique for solving the advection-diffusion equation using the truncated Gram-Charlier expansion of the con-centration field and the finite set of equations for the corresponding moments. Actually, the Gram-Charlier expansion of type A is a classical method for approxi- mating a given distribution with moments of any order, basically consisting of a truncated expansion in terms of Hermite functions, whose coefficients are chosen so as to reproduce the sequence of moments of the distribution up to a given order [17]. Moreover, recently was obtained a semi-analytical solution of the advection-diffusion equation for non- stationary conditions [18]. From this solution a model named ADMM has been set up. The model is based on a discretization of the PBL in N sub-layers, where in each sub-layers the advection-diffusion equation is solved by the Laplace transform technique, considering an average value for eddy diffusivity and the wind speed. The main feature of this method relies on the following steps: stepwise approximation of the eddy diffusivity and wind speed, double Laplace transform application to the ad-vection-diffusion equation in the x and t variable, semi-analytical solution of the set of linear ordinary equation resulting for the double Laplace transform ap-plication and construction of the pollutant concentration by the Laplace transform inve rsion using the Gaussian quadrature scheme (semi-analytical due to the numeric inversion). The main objective of this paper is to present and dis- cuss the results of a comp arison between the non- Gaussian puff, where the concentration field is approxi- mated because only the first four moments of the con- centration distribution is used, and an advanced time de-pendent model, that accept general profiles for wind and eddy diffusivity coefficients (as well as the theoretical profiles proposed in the scientific literature, such as the vertical profiles of eddy diffusion coefficients predicted by the Similarity Theory), but they are described by a stepwise function. 2.

Validation against Experimental Data For a better understanding of the comparison between the two models in this work, we focus our atte ntion on the mathematical features of the two approaches. Concerning the semi-analytical method it is relevant to underline that in this approach no approximation is ma de in its deriva- tion except for the stepwise approximation of inver- sion by the Gaussian quadrature scheme. It is well known, that the results attained by the Gaussian quadrature scheme of order N, are exact when the transformed func- tion is a polynomial of degree (2N - 1). It is possible, performing relative error calcu lation, between numerical results with k + 1 and k points of quadrature as well for m + 1 and m points, to control the error in the Gaussian quadrature scheme, by properly choosing k and m, in order to attain a prescribed accuracy. Concerning the issue of stepwise approximation, it is important to bear in mind that the stepwise appr oximation of a continuous function converges to the continuous function, when the stepwise of the approximat ion goes to zero. For the semi-analytical method it is only necessary to choose the number of the sub-layers in an appropriate manner, by taking the smoothness of the functions and into account. zK u On t he other hand regarding the puff model, deriva- tives of the resulting system of equations are approxi- mated by a finite difference scheme, which does not oc- cur in the semi-analytical method. According to the Lax equivalence theorem [29] for linear autonomous prob-lems, the convergence of the numerical schemes de- mands the fulfillment of the requirements of stability and consistency. In order to ac hieve the stability conditions, the numerical methods like the one considered in this work, impose a large number of step calculations used in performing the time integratio n for all times. This feature does not appear in the semi-analytical method, because the semi-analytical character of the solution allows us to perform the calculation at any time. This guarantees the smaller computational time as well the smaller round-off error influence in the accur acy of the results of the semi-analytical method when compared with the nu- merical ones, because it demands less mathematical op- erations. Moreover the concentration field is described only using the first four moments of the concentration distribution. In fact we use the Gram-Charlier expansion (type A) of the concentration field truncated at the fourth moment. i K wz ( 2 3 ) A prelim inary evaluation of the performances of the Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP Comparison between Non-Gaussian Puff Model and a Model Based on a Time-Dependent 176 Solution of Advection-Diffusion Equation two models (with the boundary layer parameterization proposed) is presented, using the Copenhagen data set [30]. The Copenhagen data set is composed of tracer SF6 data from dispersion experime nts carried out in northern Copenhagen. The tracer was released without buoyancy from a tower at a height of 115 m and was collected at ground-level positions in up to three crosswind arcs of tracer sampling units. The sampling units were posi- tioned 2-6 km far from the point of release. We used the values of the cro sswind-integrated concentrations nor- malized with the tracer release rate from [31]. Tracer releases typically started up 1 hour before the tracer sampling and stopped at the end of the sampling period. The site was mainly residen tial with a roughness length of 0.6 m. Generally the distributed data set contains hourly mean values of concen trations and meteorological data. However, in th is work, we used data with a greater time resolution kindly made available by Gryning [32]. In particular, we used 20 minutes averaged measured concentrations and 10 minutes averaged values for mete- orological data. Tables 1 -3 report the fricti on velocity, the Mo- nin-Obukhov length and boundary layer height (only one value for each run), respectivel y, used in the simulations. In Figure 1 the calculated concentrations are plotted against the measured ones for the two approaches.

Conclusions The aim of this paper was to present and discuss the re-sults of a comparison between non-Gaussian puff model and a model based on a time-dependent semy-analytical solution of advection-diffusio n equation to simulate pol- lutant dispersion in the PBL, focusing the ability to cor-rectly reproduce the concentration field measured during the Copenhagen tracer experiments, considering the me- teorological parameters varying with time. Models performances were evaluated using data from the Copenhagen data set, but with a time resolution greater than the data ones ge nerally distributed [34], pre- senting good results for both approaches. In particular, we used 20 minutes average concentrations of SF6 and 10 minutes average values for meteorological data. The two models present compar able results an d, in this preliminary evaluation, their performance does not show any correlation with the mete orological characterization of the PBL. Both models underestimate the ground level concentrations, probably du e to the turbulence parame- terization used. 6.

ABSTRACT To satisfy the requirement on the separation of solid and liquid in waste drilling mud, prepare a high effective floccu- lant for high density waste drilling mud ethyl methacrylate chloride ( DMC) and acrylamide (AM). The result showed that when the ratio of starch, DMC and AM was 2:1:3, the weight of initiator (po- tassium persulfate ) was 0.2% of the AM, reaction temperature was 65 and reaction time was 5h, the performance of product was the best. The water content in filter cake was 27.6% after the waste drilling mud disposed by the optimiza- tion flocculant. The flocculent effect of optimization floccul ant was superior to that of other flocculant in market. Keywords: High Density, Waste Drilling Mud, Dispose, Cation 1. Introduction The waste drilling mud and dr illing wastewater were the inevitable industrial waste while Oil and Gas Exploration Drilling. They has become one of the most severe pollu- tion sources, whose effect on environment has been concerned gradually [1-3].There were many methods [4-7] to dispose the waste drilling mud and drilling wastewater, such as, Gravity Separation, Impact, Baffle, or Spray Separation, Parallel-Plate and Thin-Film Sepa-ration and Vacuum Separation. The Solid-Liquid Separa-tion has such advantages as large capacity, simple opera- tion and using a few equipments [8], it was the most im- portant and Widely Application method. At deep well drilling, the component of waste drilling mud was more and more complexity, the density of waste drilling mud was higher, and the waste drilling mud treatment was more harder [9]. The flocculant in market has not deal with the high density waste drilling mud. So a new starch-based cation copolymer flocculant for high density waste drilling mud was prepared. 2. Methods 2.1 Agent Edible waste drilling mud, the density was 1.639 g/mL and the Solid content was 56.72%. 2.2 Synthesis of Starch-Based Cation Coploymer Flocculant Add some deionized water, hy- droxide into a three-neck flas k with stirrer. Heat the sys- tem to 70 C and stir until starch dissolved completely (about 30 min), then cool the system to room temperature and removal of oxygen dissolved in the solution by blowing continuously nitrogen. After add some AM and DMC into above system, add the potassium persulfate solution drop by drop. Keep th e system react for a certain time at a given temperature to gain product. 2.3 Flocculent Treatment Add some gel breaker to some waste drilling mud, then add some flocculant to above system and stir, centrifugal separation (3500 r/min) for 10min. Weight the quality of filter cake (m1) and soild phase (m2) after baking, gain the water content in filter cake by the formula as follows: the water content in filter cake = (m1-m2)/m1. 3. Result and Discussion 3.1 Preparing Conditions of Starch-Based Cation Copolymer Flocculant 3.1.1 Appropriate Weight Ratio of AM and Starch The amount of starch was 3 g, DMC dosage was 1 mL, pH = 7, the reaction temperature was 70 C, reaction time was 3 h, the amount of acrylamide was respectively 3 g, 6 g, 9 g, 12 g, the amount of potassium persulfate was Preparation of High Effective Flocculant for High Density Waste Drilling Mud 180 0.2% of the quality of acrylamide. The flocculent effect is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 showed when m(AM)/m(starch) = 3, the wa- ter content in filter cake was the minimum (32.3%). When the m(AM)/m(starch) abov e 3, the lesser quality of starch made the active sites fo r graft reaction decrease, so the molecular weight of copolymer diminished. The Low Molecular Weight copolymer could not link tightly with solid matter in waste drilling mud, so the flocculation effect was not good. 3.1.2 Appropriate Dosage of DMC The starch quality was 3 g, the quality of acrylamide was 9 g, pH = 7, the reaction temperature was 70 C, reaction time was 3 h, the amount of potassium persulfate was 0.2% of the quality of acrylamide, DMC dosage respectively was 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL. Study the effect of DMC dosage on the water content in filter cake ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2 showed when the DMC dosage was 2 ml, the water content in filter cake was the lowest. Increasing the dosage of DMC make the cationic degree of copolymer increase. The clay in waste drilling mud charged negative, so the higher of the cationic degree of copolymer was, 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.031323334353637383940water content/% m(AM)/m(starch) Figure 1.

The effect of DMC dosage on water content in filter cake the more the negative charge neutralized, so the solid matter in waste drilling mud was more easier to separate from waste drilling mud. But when the DMC dosage was greater than 2 mL, the water content in filter cake in- creased. The reason maybe as follows: 1) Impact of Cl -: The initiator was K 2S2O8, Cl- can re- act with S 2O82- to form Cl 2, Cl atom can act as a chain termination agent, so that the molecular weight of co-polymer decreased. 2) Steric Hindrance Effect: DMC with Steric reduce the probability of collision between DMC monomer and chain free radical. Above two factor increase the difficult of Polymeriza- tion between DMC and starch and AM, so the floccula-tion effect was not good. 3.1.3 Appropriate Dosage of Initiator The amount of starch was 3 g, DMC amount was 2mL, the amount of acrylamide was 9 g, pH = 7, the reaction temperature was 70 C, reaction time was 3 h. The amount of potassium persulfate was respectively 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, of acrylamide. floc- culent effect is shown in Figure 3 . From Figure 3 we can see that when the potassium persulfate dosage was 0.3%, the water content in filter cake was the lowest. Because when the amount of potas-sium persulfate increased, the concentration of free radi- cals increase, grafting reaction rate accelerated, graft product molecular weight was larger. But when the qual-ity of potassium persulfate was more than 0.3% that of acrylamide monomer, the water content of filter cake actually increased. The increasing concentration of po-tassium persulfate caused homopolymerization reaction probability of monomer increas e and the termination of free radicals also increase, so the copolymer molecular weight was not big enough and the water content in filter also increased. 3.1.4 Reaction Time The amount of starch was 3 g, DMC amount was 2 mL, 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.530323436384042water content/% The amount of potassium persulfate /% Figure 3.

JEP Preparation of High Effective Flocculant for High Density Waste Drilling Mud 181 the amount of acrylamide was 9 g, pH = 7, the amount of potassi um persulfate was 0.3% of the quality of acryla- mide, reaction temperature was 70 C, the reaction time was respectively 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h. The flocculent effect is shown in Figure 4 . As can be seen from Figure 4 , the best reaction time was 4 h, this was because early in the reaction system, the active center of graftin g reaction was more, the reac- tion rate was quick. But when the reaction time was more than 4 h, the number of grafting points decreased, which made grafting reaction rate slow down, so the grafting yield had fallen and the water content in filter cake cor- respondingly increased. 3.1.5 Reaction Temperature The amount of starch was 3 g, DMC amount was 2 mL, the amount of acrylamide was 9 g, pH = 7, the amount of potassium persulfate was 0.3% of the quality of acryla-mide, reaction time was 4 h, the reaction temperature was respectively 50 C, 55 C, 60 C, 65 C, 70 C, 75 C. The flocculent effect is shown in Figure 5 . The reaction temperature at 65 C, the water content in filter cake was the lowest. Because temperature rising within a certain range can increases the degree of starch 34567303234363840424446water content/% reaction time/h Figure 4.

The effect of reaction temperature on water con- tent in filter cake swelling in water, thus ensure the reaction in the homo- geneous and be propitious to disperse initiator and mono-mer. When the temperature rose exceeds 65 C, the chain termination reaction rate incr eased, which lead to lower grafting yield, so the water content in filter cake was higher. 3.2 Analysis of FTIR Figure 6 and Figure 7 are respectively FTIR spectra of starch and copolymer flocculant. As can be seen from the Figure 6 , the peak of IR spectra of -OH symmetric stretching vibration in starch glucose unit appeared at 3440 cm -1 and 3442 cm-1. From Figure 7 , we can know the peak of IR spectra of C=O stretching vibration and -NH 2, -CH 2 stretching vibration cm-1, 3198 cm-1, 1027 be should absorption peak at 3198 cm-1, but it overlapped with the strong broad hydroxyl peak of starch, so there was only a single peak. The absorption peak appeared at 1618 cm -1 was the -NH 2 bending vibra- tion characteristic peaks. So, there must have some struc- tural units of AM and DMC in the starch- based cation copolymer flocculant. 3.3 Flocculent Effect From Figure 8 we can see that adding the same amount of flocculant, the flocculent effect of organic flocculants was better than that of inorganic coagulant, but the re-sults are not satisfactory, the water content in filter cake 4000 3000 2000 1000 v/cm-12928 16511021 3442 Figure 6.

ABSTRACT Current trends in energy consumption and biofuel manufacturing are neither secure nor sustainable, because they are not provided by necessary cost effective technologies. Furthe r reductions of cost and tech nological development will be needed for biofuels to be able to compete effectively without subsidy. With the debate raging about raw material of bio- fuel, microalgae may offer a solution to this conundrum; creating enormous reserves of biofuels and boosting feed production. In this goal Center suggest projects, which incorporate water recourse management and restoration of lakes, freshwater conservation and cleanup through cost effective biodiesel manufacturing as well as pharmaceuticals destruction through the use of microalgae Chlorella and wastewaters aimed to replace the burning technology includes also supplying biofuel profitably and d eveloped pilot bussiness plan based on the cost effective technology through applying new innovative approaches in various stages of microalgae production. The benefits of microalgae are so overwhelming that this, combin ed with the prospect of the improvement in nature protection, makes it imperative for the world to devise an international response and a plan of ac tion. Incentives will be needed for the development of indus- try-led platforms such as the World Microalgae Technology Platform and its international financial fund. Microalgae must be the key tool for the new design and building sustainable development and environment management.

Introduction A global shadow of environmental deterioration mani- fests the approaching dangers that threaten the existence of life. Changes in technology drive economic growth in developing countries and contribute significantly to eco- nomic well-being in rich countries. While technology has provided yield increases, this has not proved to be sus-tainable for a long term. Some technological improve- ments have reduced production risk, while others have increased it. Furthermore, th e effects of technological change on production risk have varied taking into ac- count time, space and produc tion activities. Some of these effects have been detrimental to individual and public welfare [1,2]. The patte rns of water, nutrients and energy cycles in the biosphere have been established in course of millions of years of biological evolution and thousand of years after the last glace periods. These cy- cles have been degraded in exponentially accelerating pattern during the last 100 years, by human activities mostly due to the lack of environmental consciousness and mechanistic approach to the management of natural resources. Greater risks of crop failures and livestock deaths are already imposing economic losses and under- mining food security, and they are likely to get far more severe as global warming continues [1,2]. In some Afri- can countries yields could decline by as much as 50% by 2020 [3]. Climate change wo uld also lead to increased water stress, which by 2020 could affect 75-250 million people in Africa alone. Our ripening into maturity and survival will depend on our ability to assimilate the ex-plosive progress of technology towards a new culture\u2014 bioculture\u2014webbed with unifying values and based on the better understanding and respect of the \"rights\" of bios. Bios provide the unifying force for the harmonious co-existence of all forms of lif e, leading to a new era of bio-diplomacy. This should provide the opportunity to see the future in a new vision, where technology can serve as a revelation of the truth and where every endeavour is governed by reflection on and appreciation of the envi-ronment. All aspects of infrastructure will be on the rise in 2009, as the governments around the world try to spend their way out of a deep recession. Adaptation measures are New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 184 needed urgently to reduce th e adverse impacts of climate change, as well as to minimize the costs of natural disas- ters. Technological improvements to energy systems drive cause efficiency and hence contribute to climate protec- tion [4]. Cost advantages ar e the primary drivers for en- vironmentally friendly investments. Approximately $ 3.5 trillion will need to be invested in energy projects in the next 20 years [4]. This corresponds to a six-fold increase from the current level. Planned spending limit on global infrastructure over the next 20 years, including water, transport, energy and healthcare, in total is around $ 20 trillion, but the number of options can make the rollout complex. Acceleration of su stainable development re- quires the implementation of new innovation measures. The knowledge-based bio-economy will play an impor- tant role in our emerging reality. In this case sun microal- gae production may be the main future resource for de-velopment of Life Industry (food and feed, etc.) and bio- fuel production as well as for environment management and sustainable development. Therefore this review pre- sent situtional analyses and our enviromnent management approch in the framework of our concept addressed to global sustainable development through including micro- algae and its biomass in Production (such as wastewater treatment and biofuel) and Bio Cycles (such as food, feed perfumery production etc.) [5]. It will be a key environ- mental management answer to unsustainable technologi- cal developments and Climate Change. 2. Water Recourse Management 2.1 Drinking Water Water is a fragile resource that is quite different from, say, ore and oil deposits. It is at once renewable through the natural cycle, yet if spoiled or over-abstracted, it actually becomes non-renewable. Water is unpredictable: even in normally arid regions, floods can cause havoc. Over the last 50 years, global water withdrawal has quadrupled while world population doubled [6]. Currently, about 1 bn people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. It has been estimated that the number of people worldwide who do not have the access to safe drinking water and sanitation will have risen by 2015. The global water withdrawal will incr ease by 31% between 1995 and 2020. East Asia, Latin America, Africa and several other regions use about one-third as much water per per-son as the average of OECD countries, and almost one-fifth of what is used in North America. The gravity of the problem increases in the face of global develop-ment and large-scale degradation of environment. In- creasing pollution loads will ou tstrip the self-purifying capacity of water systems. If no countermeasures are taken, anthropogenic assault will gradually lead to a situation when water is no longer the source of life, hu-man and ecosystem well-being, but on the contrary, a source of disease, ecosystem disruption and social disor-der. Serious decline in water resources has been observed in many parts of the World as a result of the lack of knowledge of how to establish sustainable systems of water management [7,8]. Most residents of the US take for granted that we will have an endless supply of water. In order of this view changing the US Department of Health (DOH) says: \"Imagine going to your kitchen sink to get a glass of water, and when you turn on the tap nothing is there\" [8]. The U.S. Municipal Water Supply \u2014Efficiency Requirements Act and Safe Drinking Water Act directs DOH to conservation and restoration of drinking water supply. The EU Water Framework Direc- tive requires the \"promotion of sustainable water use based on a long-term protection of available water re- sources\" [9]. 2.2 Eutrophication and Algal Bloom At present times eutrophication is surely the most impor-tant process affecting lakes and water reservoirs world- wide. An important consequence of this process is the general reduction in the possibility of water use and the increasing importance of lakes and reservoirs, conse- quently, many resources for socio-economic develop- ment can be seriously damaged. If aquatic resources are to be exploited on a sustainable basis in the future, a concerted effort is needed to resolve the conflicts between user groups. There is a great need for the restoration of lakes and other natural water bodies as increased nutrient loadings have accrued in the sediments and make it dif-ficult to control the level of fish production. Conservation and restoration of drinking water reservoirs are as well required. The increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HAB) over the last 60 years has been linked to the process caused by the enrichment of water with nu- trients from human population growth and associated activity and these problems know no national borders [6-13]. A first priority of US HARRNESS plan for the coming years is to understand and mitigate impacts of HAB species on pelagic and benthic food webs and their capacity to support fisheries and ecosystem services as well as mitigation of bloom impacts of all types using a suite of practical strategies to protect and utilize threat- ened resources, as well as to directly intervene in bloom development (where appropriate) using economical and environmentally acceptable me thods and mitigate im- pacts of blue-green algae species on pelagic and benthic food webs and their capacity to support fisheries and ecosystem services [11,12]. Blue-green algae of bloom are a group of prokaryotes which history goes back to 2700 million years. Blue-greens are not true algae. They have no nucleus, the structure that encloses the DNA, and no chloroplast, the struct ure that encloses the photo- synthetic membranes, the structures that are evident in photosynthetic true algae. While the simple plants con- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 185 tinue to thrive, especially in the environments in which they evolve d, each new grad e of organization has even- tually become more \"successful\" in evolution than its predecessors by most measures. Green algae evolved from prokaryotes between 2500 and 1000 million years ago. Now we see the reverse process, compared to the evolutionary track, that bl ue-green microalgae become more \"successful\" in comparison to green algae in water reservoirs as result of environmental contamination. Management strategies are needed that will prevent (avoid the occurrence of blooms or reduce their extent), mitigate (minimize blue green Cyanobacterial blooms impacts on human health, liv ing resources, and coastal economies when they do occur) , and control (actions that directly reduce or suppress an existing bloom population) [10,11,13,14]. It is certain that man's contact with blue- green will increase, and there is a probability that their role in human disease either as toxin sources (neurotox- ins affect the nervous system, hepatotoxins - liver, and dermatoxins irritate skin and mucous membranes) or as cutaneous irritants or sensitizers has been underestimated and unsuspected, because the algae blooms are not just disgusting but potentially dangerous [11,12,14-16]. In 1998, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) included freshwater cyanobacteria and their toxins on the first Candidate Contaminant Li st (CCL) (Federal Regis- ter, 1998). The risks humans run by eating fish and other animals from contaminated waters are difficult to quan- tify but are potentially significant [11-13,17]. Concerns about cyanophyte toxins contaminating eggs and car- casses in intensive poultry farms have led to the exten- sive use of environmentally undesirable pesticides to control blooms in farm water supplies. It is unknown to what extent other algae or cyanophyte toxins may accu- mulate in agricultural products [14]. There is no such protection in place for the irrigated agriculture and aquaculture industries. We do know that many toxins are extremely persistent in the environment, often being re- sistant to chemical or bacterial degradation. Preliminary investigations have shown that some toxins persist for more than a week on irrigated pasture grass, spray irriga- tion may lead to direct contact between water and fruit and it is possible that the toxic cyanophytes will dry on the grape surface. It is unknown which plants actually take up the toxins. However, it is known that some toxins persist in dried form for several months [14]. Currently preventative measures of control against bloom devel-opment as well as its toxic forms through preventing of including fertilizers, animal wastes and other sources of nutrients in water resource do not achieve sustainable results and spread of the bl ue-green infection can reach catastrophic dimension [12]. The conventional treatment and disinfection of most public drinking water supplies are not effective in removing or deactivating cyanophyte toxins as well as boiling is not effective [14,16]. Treat- ment techniques have been studied throughout the world and have proved that chlorination is ineffective. Killing the cyanophytes with chlorine, heat, mechanical disrupt- tion or any other process causes them to lyse and release their endotoxins into the water supply. Water that is free of cyanophytes cells may not be free of the toxins [14]. Now, the most important problem to solve concerns the following question: how to restore and adapt the hydro- logical, biogeochemi cal and biological cycles to the new conditions of high population density and activities, without obstructing development [6,9-11]. The first and most obvious step toward protection and restoration of a lake or reservoir is to divert or treat excessive nutrient, organic, and silt loads [13,14]. These approaches, how-ever, usually ignore the biological interactions of the lake, interactions which themselves may be responsible for low water transparency, high internal nutrient release, and the frequently observed slow response to nutrient diversion. The new approach requires an understanding of the dynamics of water and biogeochemical processes with special emphasis on the role of biota in the catch- ment and aquatic systems as being a very vulnerable but easily manageable component of the freshwater ecosys-tem. Water quality, expressed as secondary pollution and toxic HAB, continues to decline in aquatic ecosystems across the World. Therefore it is possible that problems of algal bloom mitigation can be done not only by re- ducing human impacts but also by regulating the aquatic biota through biomanipulation. The biomanipulation in- volves the deliberate alteration of an ecosystem by add- ing or removing species. Nevertheless, biomanipulation can be used as additional or exclusive measure to im- prove the quality of stagnant waters [18,19]. Food webs are controlled by resource limitation (\"bottom-up\") and by predation (\"top-down\"). In the last years, many ex-periments have been carried on applying gradually of biomanipulation techniques, following a step-by-step procedure aimed to produce a less stressing effect and to have the possibility to modify at any moment the inten- sity and the direction of the intervention. However, many problems of considerable importance still await a satis- factory solution. It is clear th at techniques of integrated biomanipulation show good prospects for managing eu- trophic aquatic environments with a view to the ultimate recovery of their quality. The literature on food web ma- nipulation indicates that important factor is the manipu- lated fish population stability (influences of anthropo-genic factor or natural event like fish mortality, etc.). In case of significant change follows fish quantity the new structure might be stable for a short time [14]. Complete removal of the planktivorous fish will not per se lead to optimal conditions for daphnids and stabilize. On the other hand, if the biomass of planktivorous fish exceeds a certain critical level the larger crustacean herbivores will not be able to dominate. Neither phytoplankton densities Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 186 nor biomass quantities can be regulated [20]. The studies dealing with top-down control in the food web have not provided any tailor-made solutions for a reduction of algal bloom biomass and sustainable improvement in light climate. However, the daily feed supply for aqua- culture raises nutrient levels, but does not simply in- crease normal predator-prey activity; rather, HAB events develop often with serious ecological and aesthetic im- plications [20]. Some typical problems of water quality management through biomanipulation became obvious (blue-green algae, long term stability) [18-20]. Many lakes have extensive littoral areas, and the production of organic matter by these zones is very significant in the cycling of nutrients and in the nutrition of lake organisms. In particular, the large annual production of rooted plants and attached algae may be a major source of decom- posing organic matter, and thus nutrients, to the open water and to the sediments of the hypolimnion [13]. Not only are the sediments of the littoral zone the source of nutrients for these rooted plants, the plants may release nutrients to the water column via aerobic decomposition. Even this expensive proces s, while necessary, may be insufficient to produce imme diate and long-lasting ef- fects, due to internal recyc ling of nutrients and the asso- ciated production of algae and macrophytes [13]. The basic assumptions of the biomanipulation concept were found to be generally valid, although quantitatively hard to predict. So studies dealing with biomanipulation tool show that to achieve good prospects and sustainable im-provement it is needed pr ovided any tailor-made solu- tions for a regulation of algal biomass in water resources [15,18,20]. Therefore new innovation tool for algal bio-mass quantity regulation is necessary. 2.3 Offered Tool for Management in Order to Restore and Conserve Water Recourse Our demonstration project of water recourse management includes both supplying energy profitably and restoration of lakes as well as freshwater conservation and cleanup through cost eff ective biodiesel manufacturing. This technology demonstration and commercialization may be key water quality management effective tool in cost effective manner, because it may be used also for the further biological engineering of the lake system in order to restore biological mechanis m that stabilizes the aquatic plant-dominant system, freshwater conservation, cleanup and restoration through reducing negative effect of algal blooms, lake internal surplus nutrient and heavy metals. It will create a more secure environment for power investors and users as well as offered manipulation tools applica- tion in biotic dynamics of freshwater ecosystems are synchronous with today's and future world request. Commercialization of the results of our project has the ability of self-start. Consequently, our technological deve- lopment of the microalgae biomass use for biodiesel industry has wide prospects and may provide sustainable economic development and meeting calls of Kyoto Objectives, Environmental Conservation and Lakes and Biodiversity Restoration, FAO, US HAPPINES, World Energy Outlook, World Development Report, 2008; U.S. Presidents Calls, U.S. Re source Conservation and Re- covery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901 et seq.

On the other hand, EU Environmental Liability Directive (2004/35/EC), seeks to achieve the prevention and remedying of environ- mental damage, which presents a threat to human health, bringing with it a number of new or increased risks to companies and their director [21]. The Directive has already been implemented in Italy (2006), Spain (2007), France (2008) and England (2 009). Therefore this Di- rective raises the possibility of our technology com- mercialization in Europe, as it grants a possibility for remedying environmental damage with obtaining profit and decreasing the ri sk of industries. 3. Environmental Pollution, Climate Change and Biofuel 3.1 Climate Change and Biofuel The Kyoto Protocol provides a mechanism for the crea- tion of GHG credits and debits based on limits negotiated for each Annex 1 signatory country to the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto Protocol came into force on 2005. The World is facing Global Climate Change and twin energy-related threats: that of not having adequate and secure supplies of energy at affordable prices and that of environmental harm caused by consuming too much of it [22,23]. Po- tential interference with the climate system means that proper attention should be paid to the expected evolution of GHG emissions. Global primary energy demand is estimated to increase by just over one-half between now and 2030\u2014an average annual rate of 1.6% [22]. Oil de- mand case will have risen by 29 mb/d by 2030, when it will reach 113 mb/d. In the medium-term, by 2012, an average increase of 1.3 mb/d annually is expected, while this yearly increase gradually falls in the longer term to 1.2 mb/d p.a [22]. On the other hand global en- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 187 ergy-related CO 2 emissions will have increased by 55% by 2030, or by 1.7% per year. These gases cover a wide range of activities, and include, for example, land-use change and farming. It is important to recall, however, that CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel used in 2004 ac- counted for only 57% of global GHG emissions. Over 70% of the increase in demand is observed in developing countries, with China alone constituting 30%. Develop- ing countries consumption will have almost doubled and reached 56 mb/d by 2030. Curr ent trends in energy con- sumption are neither secure nor sustainable economically, environmentally or socially [22,23]. Inexorably rising consumption of fossil fuels and related greenhouse-gas emissions threaten our energy security and risk changing the global climate irreversibly and the US and EU has accelerated the development of renewable energy and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions [22-28]. Biofuel is biodegradable and can reduce vehicle emis- sions of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocar- of biodiesel include higher lubri- cation, longer-lasting engines, clean burning as compared to diesel, less reliance on foreign oil, low toxicity, biode- gradability, pleasant odour and efficiency as compared to diesel. Compared with using petroleum diesel, the use of biodiesel in a conventional diesel engine substantially reduces emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HC), car- bon monoxide nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (PM). Some PM and HC emissions from diesel fuel combustion ar e toxic or are suspected of causing cancer and other life threatening illnesses. Using only biodiesel (B100) can eliminate as much as up to 90% of these \"air toxics.\" B100 provides the best emis- reductions, but lower-level blends also provide bene- fits. B20 has been shown to reduce PM emissions of 10%, CO 11%, and unburned HC 21%. Using biodiesel reduces greenhouse gas emissions because CO 2 released from bio- diesel combustion is offset by the carbon dioxide seques-tered while growing the soybeans or other feed stock. The net impact on greenhouse-gas emissions of re- placing conventional fuels with biofuels depends on sev- eral factors. These include the type of crop, the amount and type of energy embedded in the fertilizer used to grow the crop and in the water used, emissions from fer- tilizer production, the resulting crop yield, the energy used in gathering and transporting the feedstock to the biorefinery, alternative land uses, and the energy intensity of the conversion process. Calculating the energy and emissions balance of biofuel production requires esti- mates of, or assumptions about, all these variables, as well as the energy or emissions credit that should be attributed to the various by-products. CO 2 emissions at the point of use are assumed to be zero on the grounds that the bio- mass feedstock is a renewable resource (the carbon emit-ted is exactly equal to the carbon absorbed by the bio-mass). In practice, the amount and type of primary energy consumed in producing biofuels and, therefore, the related emissions of greenhouse gases, vary enormously. A study compares several reports on corn-based ethanol production in the US, in order to compile estimates of primary fossil-energy input/output ratios and net greenhouse-gas emissions using consistent parameters. It concludes that the \"best point estimate\" is that the primary energy input (excluding the biomass feedstock) is equal to about 80% of the energy contained in the ethanol output. On this basis, greenhouse-gas emissions are only 13% lower per kilometer compared with pe- troleum-based fuels [23]. Estimates for the net reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions that are obtained from rapeseed-derived bio- diesel in Europe also rang e from about 40% to 60%, compared with conventional automotive diesel. The EC shows that conventional ethanol production can result in a net saving of up to 23% of the fossil energy required for gasoline and a saving of over 30% in greenhouse-gas emissions. In 2005, biofuels were used in 17 of the 21 Member States of the EU [25]. The EU emitted 5 143 Mt of CO 2-equivalent in 2006, 7.7% less compared to 1990 levels [24-26]. CO 2 intensity, measured as kgCO 2 per ton of oil equivalent, has been slowly but steadily declining and in 2006 fell to 2498 kgCO 2/toe. Following a period of industrial restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the 1990s, GHG emissions picked up again after 2000. Carbon-free and indigenous energy sources (renewables and nuclear) in the EU's fuel mix would amount to 28%-30% under the New Energy Pol- icy compared with only 21-25% under current trends and policies. EU energy industries generated the highest amount of CO 2 emissions (37%) in 2006, followed by transport (23%), manufacturing industries and construc- tion (15%), and the residential sector (11%). EU green- house gas emissions from transport have risen considera- bly since 1990 and are projected to continue increasing [26]. Between 1990 and 2006 CO 2 emissions from trans- port increased by 26%. In formulating the future EU en- ergy policy it is necessary to conduct through analysis of possible developments in terms of the EU's energy de- mand by two main scenarios. In EU New Energy Policy demand in 2020 is projected according to current trends and policies (baseline) and in the case of taking action to achieve agreed EU targets on Climate Change mitigation, namely a reduction of 20% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990, along wi th a 20% share for renew- ables in the final energy demand by 2020, and to bring about a substantial improvement in energy efficiency. In the light of these scenarios, overall developments are described and their impacts on EU energy security and on 2020 objectives are assessed. Under baseline condi- tions the primary energy needs in 2020 continue to grow, compared to the current situ ation, although at a lower Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 188 rate than in the past. Given current trends, the EU's con- sumption rises between 5% and 9% depending on the oil price, with the higher increase in the case of moderate oil prices. Gross inland consumption would therefore reach in 2020 a level of between 1,900 and 1,970 Mtoe. Fuel needed for the transport sector remains the main driver. Transport is responsible for more than 50% of the addi- tional CO 2 emissions till 2020. Transport is the only sec- tor that showed an upward trend during this period and its consumption rises by 17%-21% by 2020, with the lower limit reflecting developments under high oil prices. The share of renewables would increase under all sce- narios and price circumstances . However, this increase would be partly nullified by a falling nuclear share as a result of nuclear phase-out decisions and closure of nu- clear plants considered unsafe in some Member States as well as sluggish replacement of existing nuclear plants at the end of their lifetime with plants of the same type. Given current policies and trends, irrespective of the level of energy prices, the 20% target will not be met in 2020. With moderate oil prices, energy-related CO 2 emissions are set to rise by 5% between 1990 and 2020 \u2014back on an ascending path, after earlier reductions due to restructuring in the EU12. GHG emissions would de- cline by 1.5% between 1990 and 2020, due to the reduc- tion in non-CO 2 GHG emissions. Transport accounts for a steadily increasing share of energy-related CO 2 emis- sions under current policies and moderate fuel import prices, reaching 29% in 2020 compared to 27% in 2005 and 20% in 1990. The CO 2 price required to achieve the 20% reduction in energy-related CO 2 emissions would be \u20ac 41 per ton of CO 2 in 2020, which is lower than would be the case if no renewables policies were put in place. With high oil prices and a CO 2 price equal to \u20ac 41 per ton of CO 2, energy-related CO 2 emissions could be almost 23% below their 1990 level. This price is consistent with the one that would emerge from the \"cost efficient sce- nario\" analyzed in the Impact Assessment for the January 2008 climate and energy package, which does not in- clude JI/CDM credits (JI and CDM contribute to global sustainable development through early mitigation action in third countries, in partic ular in developing countries [29]). It is however important to bear in mind that the main scenario considered in the January 2008 EC pro- posal, a policy case which achieves the CO 2 and renew- ables objectives while allowi ng trade in JI/CDM credits, would result in a lower carbon price of about \u20ac 30 per ton CO 2 while achieving less energy intensity improvements and CO 2 reduction. Implementing the energy and climate policy proposals would improve the environment and diversity of the fuel mix while fostering EU competi- tiveness through industrial l eadership on efficient low carbon technologies. At present first-generation biofuel technologies, based on grain, sugar and oil crops, will continue to supply the vast bulk of biofuels. The most crucial subject in the de- bate over the sustainability of biofuels, however, is the impact on the food supply of large-scale use and trade of biomass for energy purposes in case of this generation of biofuels [22,23]. Because biofuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol are made from biomass crops that can also be used for food production, both these markets affect each other. The debate has intensif ied, particularly, over the impact of biofuels on food prices and their positive effect on the environment. Moreover , the capacity of grain- based first-generation biofuels to replace fossil fuels, particularly for transport, is believed to be extremely limited [22,23,30]. The demand for grain will increase further as the world's population grows (9 billion in 2050, compared with 6.5 billion in 2006) and grain consump- tion in developing countries is expected to have doubled by 2050 from an annual average of 1.1 billion tons be-tween 1999 and 2001 [1] . According to International Monetary Fund rising food and feed demand, which competes with that of biofuels for existing arable and pasture land, will constrain the potential for biofuels production by using current technology [23] . The situa- tion in Japan is a case in point [30]. Japan may face ris- ing food prices and difficulties in securing sufficient amounts of foods, the white paper warned. Seasoning maker Ajinomoto Co said that its fiscal 2006 earnings were weighed down by a spike in sugar cane prices, re- flecting the growing popularity of bioethanol as an alter- native fuel. Japan should raise its food self-sufficiency rate as the global balance of food supply and demand is expected to get tighter in line with increases in produc- tion of biofuels, announced in a Japanese government white paper on agriculture [30]. In the US, more plants have been built for the production of bioethanol leading also to higher prices for food and animal feed [31]. By the use of current technologies demand for corn for bio- fuel production is expected to have risen to 31% of the overall US demand for corn in 10 years, from 18% in 2006, making the amount for export inevitably lower. The International Monetary Fund estimated that higher ethanol production in the US accounted for 60% of the global increase in corn consumption in 2007, and that the use of soybean and rapeseed oil in producing biofuels in the EU and US has accounted for the bulk of demand growth for these crops in recent years [22]. This applies especially to densely popula ted areas where food produc- tion has priority over bioenergy production. As an exam- ple the US, EU and India have very regulated and pro- tected food markets. There is also no point in developing a first-generation biofuel program if the country has to import expensive chemical fertilizer to increase feed- stock production. Very high feedstock prices could also prompt changes in policies regarding subsidies. A further vulnerability is the unpredictability of the weather and its impact on feedstock prices. While a combination of fac- Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 189 tors, including growing demand from emerging countries, lower supply due to unfavourable weather conditions, export bans and market speculation, contribute to food prices rises strong demand for biofuels is also an impor- tant reason. Besides the biofuels market, the food market is also a \"political\" market as it is highly regulated. Thus actual amount of biofuels crop production depends on several actors, political, as well as decisions made at the farming level. Until recently, most biofuels programs were conceived as part of farm-support policies, but a growing number of governments are now planning to expand or introduce such programs for genuine energy- security, economic and environmental reasons. The use of agriculture plants for manufacturing of first-generation biofuels could lead also to competition for water resources, both in terms of physical availability and access to water [22,23]. With these biofuels requir-ing large amounts of water, and with 2050 projections suggesting that irrigation withdrawals may have to in- crease another 20% to meet future global food demand, water for biofuels will add pressure to water resources that are already strained or will soon be in many places. The water resource impacts could be large for a number of countries and this is also expected to feed back into global grain markets. A study by the International Water Management Institute concluded that it is unlikely that fast-growing economies such as China and India will be able to meet future food, feed and biofuel demand with- out substantially aggravating already existing water scar-city problems. Ultimately, the competition between food and biofuels crop production depends also on land availability [22, 23]. At present about 14 million hectares of land are now used for the production of biofuels, equal to about 1% of the world's currently available arable land. The amount of arable land needed in 2030 is equal to more than that of France and Spain and that of all the OECD Pacific countries including Australia. Thus land availability and food needs will also limit the growth in conventional biofuels production based on sugar, cereals and seed crops. With pressures on land -use for energy as opposed to food production being increasingly felt around the globe, the growth of biofuels supply\u2014from first- generation technologies\u2014is expected to slow sharply in the longer term [23]. Furthermore, until very recently, estimates of GHG emission reductions from biofuels assumed that biofuels are derived from crops grown on lands already in production. Nearly all past life-cycle analyses of the GHG impacts of substituting first-genera- tion biofuels for fossil fuels have ignored emissions re- sulting from land use change [23]. When land is devoted to biofuels production the carbon stored in trees and bushes will be directly lost, as will a significant portion of the CO 2 stored in the soil. These effects can also occur indirectly. For example, the us e of a particular crop to produce biofuels in one country may lead to the conver- sion of grasslands or forest elsewhere to replace that crop. Only lately have attempts been made to quantify emis- sions from worldwide land use change. A ground- breaking study 18 assessed GHG emissions due to ex-panding US corn-based ethanol production in 2016 from 1-2 mb/d. The study found that, instead of producing a 20% reduction in GHGs compared to gasoline, factoring in land change emissions and amortizing them over 30 years roughly doubles GHG emissions [23]. Over time, using corn ethanol would produce GHG benefits, but it would take 167 years to recoup the extra emissions. In other words, corn ethanol production would cause net positive GHG emissions until it had been used for 167 years. Biofuels from switch grass, if grown on the US corn lands, increase emission s by 50% [23]. Large-scale mono-cropping could have severe negative impacts on biodiversity, soil erosion and nutrient leaching as well as on biodiversity. According to the UN report, even varied and more-sustainable crops grown for energy purposes could have negative environmental impacts if they re- place wild forests or grasslands. The United Nations of 2007 report considers 19 problems associated with first- generation biofuels among those included in list that will remain the most vexing and deserve the most attention. 3.2 Enviroment Management and Sustainable Development through including Microalgae and their Biomass in Production and Bio Cycles Microalgae contain, among other elements, high quanti- ties of natural proteins, enzymes, amino acids, pigments, over 40% glycerol , up to 8-10% carotene and a fairly high concentration of vitamins B 1, B2, B3, B6, B12, E, K, D etc, compared with other plants or animals [32,33]. In fact, the former USSR was the first to become a large scale manufacturing of microalgae, in the frame- work of producing high quality feed additives [33]. In 1980 more than 500 Chlorella manufacturings were in farms of Uzbekistan (mainly for sheep) as well as addiitional quantity in other Soviet republics. However, the disintegration of the USSR has caused interruption of all these manufacturing. Today's fruits and vegetables contain small amounts of key nutrients, including proteins (6%), calcium, phos-phorus, iron, vitamin B 2 (38%) and vitamin C [34] . Al- though there is probably more than one explanation, the trend may be largely through farmers choosing to gener-ate a high crop yield. As a result, the need of people and animals to use high quality food and feed additives to compensate for a lack of physiologically active compo-nents which they cannot get from ordinary food and feed has increased. During last year s, the primary goal was to increase the feed assimilability, but it was achievable principally by using small concentrations of powdered Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 190 activated carbon and adding enzymes, raising only the degree of cellulose hydrolysis, assimilability and the commodity weight of production per feed unit. This one-sided approach has resulted in product quality im- pairment and a decrease in animal resistance to illnesses. On the other hand, an acute increment of frequency of mass epidemics among animals and poultries in various countries was evidenced. This has caused great economic damage to manufacturers and whole countries. The manufacture of vaccines against mass epidemics requires enormous feats of organization and is not always effec-tive. So, at the end of 2006 a new strain of H5N1 avian flu virus (Fujian-like) was detected in China which was resistant to earlier produc ed vaccines [33]. Another problem faced today is the consequences caused by the over-use of antibiotics in animal feed. While antibiotics were proven to be effective in improving poultry produc-tion, their use came under pressure as an increasing number of consumers feared that their inclusion in ani- mal feed rations would lead to antibiotic resistant bacte- ria that are pathogenic to humans. In 2005, the EU re- moved the last antibiotic growth promoters from pig and poultry diets. As consensus begins to develop among the scientific community on this subject, a few approaches stand out in terms of effi cacy, technological and eco- nomical feasibility, particularly in terms of organic acids and the use of essential or botanical oils. Organic acids provide a natural alternative, reducing production of toxic components by bacteria and causing a change in the morphology of the intestinal wall that reduces coloniza- tion of pathogens, thus preventing damage to the epithe-lial cells [35]. Anions of organic acids deactivate the RNA transferase enzyme, which damage the nucleic acid multiplication process and even tually result in death of the organisms. But the use of organic acids and essential oils in the feed industry are potentially a source of other problems: corrosion, worker safety, handling, vitamin stability in pre-mixes, environmental concerns, and the stability of products [35]. With all this in mind, the use of microalgae Chlorella as a feed additive could become the best solution, since microalgae contain natural organic acids that reduce colonization of pathogens [33]. Thanks to this feature, mi croalgae Chlorella is used also for feed conservation and reduction of microbiological pollution of wastewaters. Hence, th e success of our approach through use of microalgae and its processing products in biofuel manufacturing as feed additives may help reduce not only the general deficiency, but the poor quality and inferiority of the majority of feed additives as well, which may be one of the major causes of the alarming frequency increases of mass epidemics facing animals, poultry, etc. [33]. Second-generation microalgae manufacturing volume sharply increased due to si gnificant influence of food additives, high-quality perfumery related industry development (US, Japan, etc.). So, currently over 75 % of pharmaceutical product development is generated by the food additives production comprising also microalgae. About 61% of Americans (spending $ 6 billion yearly) and 43% of Europeans use food additives. The market survey shows that initially these microalgae manufac- turing has reached super high growth rate, sales volume of several companies' has increased doubly, but in condition of the world microalgae manufacturing volume increase the prices of microalgae product was decreasing as well as excess profits gain ed in companies of deve- loped countries at start up (US Cyanotech. Corp. revenues in million dollars: 1994 - 2.7; 1995 - 4.2; 1996 - 8.1; 1997 - 11.4; 2003 - 9, 2004 - 11.6; 2005 - 11.4; 2008 - 13.9). According to our re seach now Chinese producers have least costs of microalgae manufacturing. At 2004 after start up of bird flu epidemic desicion makers of Chinese and Vietnamese policy felt that feed industry participants should seize the opportunity to grow with the development of livestock and aquacultural production industries. Nowadays Chinese carries out big investments in development of microalgae manufacturing. Taiwan green energy industry set to boom after new law enacted aimed at promoting renewable energy development [36]. The Taiwan Renewable Energy Development Act pro-vides a legal framework that will encourage investment in renewable energy production and offer incentives to local consumers to install renewable energy equipment. Third-generation microalgae manufacturing volume increase may be caused by biofuel and high quality feed additives productions (microalgae and biofuel manufac- turing processing biomass) [5,32,37]. Our vision infers suggests that algae have emerged as one of the most promising sources especially for biodiesel. Yields of oil from algae are orders of magnitude higher than those from traditional oilseeds [38,39]. In addition, algae can be grown away in farmlands and forests, thus minimizing the damage caused to the ecosystem and the conventional food chain. Furthermore, alga e have properties that make commercial production attractive, such as faster growth compared with land-grown plants; small water consump- tion, uniform cell structure with no bark, stems, branches or leaves, allowing easier extraction of products and higher utilization of microalgae cells; cellular uniformity making practical the manipulation and control of grow- ing conditions for the optimization of cell properties. Biofuel production will be a new rapidly growing global market for algae products as well as the manufacturing of microalgal biomass may be beneficial to countries not capable of growing conventional crops around the world [32]. Additionally algae can adsorb up to 450 tons of CO 2 per acre when grown commercially [40]. They are also harvested very quickly; dramatically speeding up production process with small water consumption [32]. To produce the required amount of biodiesel by growing Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP 191 soybeans almost 3bn acres of soybeans fields, or over 1bn acres of canola fields at nominal yields of 48 and 127 gallons of oil per acre, respectively, would be re- quired. Conversely, only approximately 9.5 m acres would be required to produce 15,000 gallons of oil per acre from algae. There is othe r interesting reason as well: algae can be grown in sewage with its cleaning and next to power-plant smokestacks where they digest the pol-lutants to produce oil [32,37]. From 1978 to 1996, the U.S. DOE funded a program to develop renewable biodiesel from algae, known as the Aquatic Species Program (ASP, above $ 300 million) [39, 41]. The main focus of this program was the production of biodiesel from high lipid-content algae. A major con-clusion from these analyses is that, for microalgae pro-duction, there is little prospect for any alternatives to the open pool designs, given the low cost requirements asso-ciated with fuel production. The factors that most influ-ence cost are biological- and not engineering-related. These analyses point to the need for highly productive organisms capable of near-theoretical levels of conver-sion of sunlight to biomass. Two hundred thousand hec-tares (less than 0.1% of climatically suitable land areas in the US) could produce one quad (1.055 10 18 J) of fuel. The DOE-ASP program concluded that the only plausi- ble near- to mid-term application of microalgae biofuels production requires its integration with wastewater treatment. This would fulfil the main task of ASP and permit the cost-effective technology for microalgae pro-duction to be applied around the globe, thus assisting in the resolution of some of the global challenges that face the world community. At 2006-2007 the US researchers and public is abuzz with talk of replacing imported oil with \"biofuels\" produced from microalgae and as look back at the DOE ASP program [42]. Why would NREL terminate the project if the prospects really were good? During the SP project appraisal valuable and interesting results of researches have been achieved. However, both the technical and economic conclusions were more poorly given reason, though they coincide with our viewpoints concerning the strategic directions for devel- opment of microalgae manufacturing. It is necessary to consider the objective distinctions in an economic situa-tion with fuel today and earlier. In 1998, a barrel of petroleum sold for $ 13 [41]; today the price can exceed $ 70-80 per barrel. In 1982, it was estimated by Bene-mann that the cost of production for a barrel of algal bio- diesel was, on average of $ 94 (the hypothetical base was $ 61 and hypothetical high was $ 127, depending on the mode of production). According to Michael Briggs: \"The operating costs, including power consumption, labour, chemicals, and fixed capital costs (taxes, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and return on investment) worked out to $ 12,000 per hectare [41]. That would equate to $ 46.2 billion per year for all the algae farms, to yield all the oil feedstock nece ssary for the entire country. Compare that to the $ 100-$ 150 billion the US spends each year just on purchasing crude oil from foreign countries, with all of that money leaving the US econ- omy.\" If the production of algal biodiesel has not already been widespread at an indust rial scale, it's simply on account of concerns about pr ofitability and competition and it is necessary, obvious, demonstration large projects. Our research obtained that after terminate ASP program DOE and FP7 R&D calls attention to microalgae tech- nologies was insufficient. However now many private companies are reviewing their energy policies and strate- gies to comply by today urgent legislative and economic request and diversification of its business ( Table 1 ).

Chinese company ENN [51] ENN has launched its pilot scale algal fuels project, ga sifying coal underground for CO 2 capture and using the gas as feedst ock for algal production and the company would commence construction of a demonstra tion-scale plant by late 2010, and will scale to commercial capacities commencing in 2013. New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 192 Our market survey shows also that today prices of mi- croalgae products are very high, which can be a result of insufficient investments in the development of innova- tion technologies. In the last decades our Center strategy believes also that the cost saving of raw material with the use of wastewaters through th eir biological cleaning will help raise the availability of microalgae biomass for biofuel, food, agriculture, medicinal and producers, thus leading to resolution of global tasks facing the world community. The Center carried out researchers for deve- lopment technologies of microalgae cultivation in some wastewaters of industrial plants [32,37]. As a result the Center developed, in parallel ASP research, a cost effec- tive technology applying new innovative approaches in various stages of microalgae production and this tech- nology for microalgae production may be applied all around the world. Simultaneously the high norms of wastewater purification from organic and mineral com- pounds were achieved and in parallel to this it was accompanied by sharp reduction of the bacteria contents in strongly microbiological in fected wastewater. Presently, our business plan is in the stage of commercialization, both seeking for partners and looking at large-scale production of microalgae in op en cement pools to increase the production volume excessively. Our business plan implementation will lead to substantial reduction of fi- nancial risks to investor contributions in future microalgae production activity. This is the way, when a cost-effective technology for microalgae production may be used throughout, and microalgae will find their productive application in global markets. Our strategy will allow producing microalgae through the use and purification of wastewaters which may be an additional source of profit, without applying any changes in tax law and subsidizing of biofuel manufacturing and nature protection actions. Consequently, our technological approach development may provide sustainable economic development and meeting Kyoto Objectives, FAO, Energy Outlook, World Development Report, 2008; US Presidents Calls, US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901 et seq. (1976)), World Energy Outlook, US Energy Security and Independence Act of 2007 (ESIA) , DOE and USDA Biomass Research and Development Initiative, Roadmap for Bioenergy and Biobased Products in the US (third generation of biofuel), EU New Energy Policy, EU Renewable Energy Road Map, EU Strategy for Biofuels, European Biofuels Technology Platform, etc. Why wastewaters? It is known that the biological method is considered the most effective and economically efficient method for the purification of industrial wastewater by using the microbiological active slime or alga [32,37]. However, bacter ia of the active slime have low stability to high concentration of organic and mineral components, thus considering big water flow volumes. This method also requires further destruction of super- fluous quantity of active slime, which contains also patho- genic microorganisms. Microalgae have higher stability, which enables working in mo re concentrated and toxic environments. Chlorella actively utilizes mineral elements, spirits, sugar, and amino acids and as compared with active slime enables higher purification rate (up to 96- 98% for organic and 80% for mineral components, accordingly). Chlorella has also organic acids, which prevent the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in wasterwater and feed. While using microalgae, high norms of cleaning were shown for some plants and agriculture wastes. Therefore the use of microalgae for waste and wastewater cleaning open new wa ys for their cost effective production, environment friendly manufacturing and na- ture conservation. As an example of this approach, our Center suggests also other demonstration project of drug destruction through the use of microalgae Chlorella and wastewaters aimed to replace the burning technology in order to mitigate Climate Change, environmental pollu-tion and fuel conservation. Why it is necessary ? Cur- rently destruction of pharm aceuticals are ideally disposed by their burning at temperature above 1,200\u00b0C in the special furnaces equipped with filters and in order to prevent the pollution of atmosphere by toxic products of combustion (dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans) with CO 2 emission. The products of combustion also contain- ing in the stack effluence include HCl, CO, CO 2, NO x etc., causing the pollution of atmosphere by toxic gases, which appear during the start up and burning processes and can't be completely prevented even if the latest technologies of filtration ar e used. However such incin- eration facilities, equipped with adequate emission con- trol, are mainly to be found in the industrialized world and this specialized equipment is not available in many countries [52]. During conflicts and natural disasters large quantities of pharmaceuti cals are often donated as part of humanitarian assistance and saved as waste [52]. The U.S. Pharmaceuticals En forcement Administration had given $ 50,000 to Cambodia through the UN for the destruction of 4 tons of pharmaceuticals-making materi- als found [53]. Quotations for disposing of the pharma-ceutical waste in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in this way range from $ 2.2/kg to $ 4.1/kg [52]. To inciner-ate the current stockpile of waste pharmaceuticals in Croa-tia would therefore cost between $ 4.4 and 8.2 million. Only the U.S. HRA charges an annual fee of $ 1,000 for all active studies which covers Auditor/Monitor visits and annual IDS pharmaceuticals storage fees [54]. Fur-thermore, the U.S. EPA is committed to taking action and working with partners to ensure clean and safe water. The Agency is concerned about the detection of pharma- ceuticals and personal care pro ducts in U.S. water [55]. At 2008 Judith Enck, Deputy Secretary for the Environ- ment, Office of Governor described pharmaceutical Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 193 waste as an important issue th at is a threat to our envi- ronm ent [56]. She believes that there is sufficient evi- dence to support an immediate end to flushing of unused pharmaceuticals, and charged the group with developing an action plan to address pharmaceuticals in water . The results of the Albany Medical Center Pilot Project pro-gram indicate that more than 90 percent of unused phar-maceuticals are unregulated, bu t those include some of the medications of greatest concern in the U.S. water \u2014antibiotics, antipsychotics, endocrine disruptors, mood elevators, etc [56]. Approximately 5% of unused phar-maceuticals are controlled substances and 4.4 percent are considered hazardous under RCRA [56]. Therefore the U.S. asked to advice on strategy to develop pharmaceu- tical take-back program [57]. As a predictable result of the accepted measures by the government of the U.S. (in further may be also other countries), it is possible to ex- pect sharp increase of the pharmaceutical quantity, which is liable to destruction. Hereupon actual task is the de- velopment of new cost-beneficial and ecologically safe methods of pharmaceutical destruction. Our developed project provides basic research strategies for destruction of toxic chemicals, decreas e of the pharmaceuticals de- struction cost and accordingly sales price, mitigation, environmental contamination as well as CO 2 emitting, fuel conservation and will allow, in parallel, produce microalgae by the use of wa stewater, which obtained biomass may be an additional source of profit through the use for biofuel, feed additives, etc. manufacturing. Consequently, our technological development may pro- vide sustainable economic development and meeting Kyoto Objectives, FAO, U.S. President Calls, U.S. Re- source Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a76901 et seq. (1976)), U.S. EPA calls, U.S. En- ergy Security and Independen ce Act of 2007 (ESIA), U.S. USDA Biomass Research and Development Initiative, Roadmap for Bioenergy and Biobased Products in the U.S. (third generation of biofuel), EU New Energy Pol- icy, EU Renewable Energy Road Map, EU Strategy for Biofuels, European Biofuels Tech nology Platform, etc. 4. Where is the General Tool Addressed to Global Environmental Management and Sustainable Development? The data shows that today basic cause of the environ-mental pollution and Climatic Changes is the conse-quences of the activity of the developed countries, and their outcome effect on all regions around the world. The U.S. and China's combined account is almost half of the planet's carbon emissions [58]. The U.S. government policy highlights the need for the biomass industry to develop new feedstocks that will be easier to grow, pro-duce higher yields of biomass, and be efficiently proc- essed into fuel, power, and products that will help both technology developers and investors identify viable ap- plications of biomass (including alga for third-gene- ration biofuel) for fuels, power or products [27,28]. The U.S. Biomass Research and Development Technical Ad- visory Committee released its Roadmap lays out a con-crete R&D strategy and recommends policy measures needed to improve biomass t echnologies and help create an economically viable, sust ainable and environmentally desirable biobased industry [27]. USDA and DOE an-nounced that combined, USDA and DOE will invest over three years, for 21 biomass R&D and demonstration pro-jects [58]. These projects are particularly aimed at over- coming critical barriers in order to make the production of biomass more efficient and cost-effective, in an effort to contribute to the President Administration's strategy of bringing online cleaner, bio-based products and biofuels to help reduce the U.S. dependence on oil from unstable parts of the world and mi tigate climate change. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed by Congress in February this year, provide $ 787bn in ap- propriations, including $ 37.5bn for energy efficiency and renewable energy [4]. The U.S. has been no government funding for algal research for over a decade [59]. The 6th Annual Renewable Energy Finance Forum - Wall Street will bring together a panel of industry visionaries, finan-ciers and investors to debate key issues and conceptualize the future of renewable energy finance in the U.S. [60,61]. With federal government support and growing confidence among investors, the industry is gearing up to meet this goal despite the challenging economic times. The senior advisor to the Secretary of En ergy on the Recovery Act in his keynote speech emphasized the need for the Admini- stration to expedite the allocation of stimulus funding from the DOE, but also expressed the importance of tak-ing a measured approach to the process to ensure a strong foundation so that these projects will be viable in the long term. \"This effort is not about the next 1, 2 or 3 years - it's about the next 20 years. We need to set up the correct infrastructure to do it right the first time around. Speed and timeliness are important, but we also need to make sure that we are supporting the best projects by adminis- tering our programs in the most efficient and effective way possible,\" he stated: \"DOE's goal in the short term is to get private capital off the sidelines and into the game. This means the Department will fund both lower risk mature technologies and highe r risk innovative technolo- gies under the Recovery Act. In the longer term, we will return to being an underwriter of higher-risk innovative technologies, plugging holes in areas such as energy effi- ciency and commercializati on scale-up, where private capital markets have traditionally needed more support.\" One of the main messages that came out of the conference was the assertion that the Administration's goal of dou- bling investment in renewable energy in the next two years is not only realistic, but necessary, and that the final Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 194 piece of the puzzle for unlocking pent-up private sector investment is the issuance of loan and grant guidance from DOE. ACORE predicts that once the government fi- nancing comes into play, it will unlock over $ 4 billion per month in funding for the industry over the next two years. At this summer the DOE said that will make $ 85 million to accelerate commercialization of algae-based and other advanced biofuels [62]. The money is from this Act. Ac- cording to a report the DOE will pick two or three projects and funds them over three year period. Goal number one is cost competitive algae based biofuels, while objective two is the production of drop-in renewable fuels from other biomass. The EC will study the possibility of processing cereals from existing intervention stocks into biofuels, finance a campaign to inform farmers and forest operators, bring forward a Forestry Action Pl an and examine the possibil- ity of using animal by-products and waste as energy sources. Another aspect of sustainability relates to ge- netically modified crops and organisms but while bio- technology offers an important approach to improving crop yields, safety in the food chain remains paramount. The policy instruments employed to achieve the GHG reduction target are directly linked with those for the deployment target. The EU Renewable Energy Directive will create conditions enabling renewable energy to play a key role in reaching the GH G reduction target. In its Strategy, the EC defines the role that biofuels, produced from biomass, a renewable resource, may play in the future as a source of renewable energy serving as an al- ternative to the fossil fuel energy sources (chiefly oil) used in the transport sector [24,26]. It also proposes measures to promote the production and use of biofuels. Accordingly, the EU has committed itself to the \"20- 20-20\" initiative: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increasing the share of renewables in energy con- sumption to 20% compared to 8.5% today and improving energy efficiency by 20%. To put renewals into effect, the EC tabled in January 2008 an integrated proposal for Climate Action aimed at providing a secure and predict-able investment climate for EU industry, to which, after eleven months of legislative work, the European Parlia- ment gave its backing Intelligent Energy - Europe II Program [63]. At last, it is essential that the EC continues to support research and innova tion, particularly in order to improve production processes and to lower costs. The principal measures will focus on, inter alia , continuing with activities in the field of research and development via the 7 th Framework Program for Research and Devel- opment and the full use of second-generation biomass and biofuels ( i.e. originating from the processing of ligno-cellulosic feedstock such as straw and forest resi- dues). Hannover Messe's World Energy Dialogue took place in April 2009 with the theme was \"Where Future meets Solutions.\" The key to success lies in leveraging all available sources and forms of energy towards achieving the correct energy mix. It is also important for these sources to be located in diverse geographic locations and brought together via global grids made possible by in-novative technologies and modes of energy transport. Well-balanced, stable trade relations are another pivotal factor, and this hinges on well-wrought foreign policy, intelligent systems of energy supply, advances in energy efficiency, and ongoing energy R&D aimed at broadening the palette of available alternative. These ideas were dis-cussed and brought to life by various global officials within the energy sectors. According to OECD study, in the EU-25 alone, goods and services provided by eco-industries are estimated to represent around 2.2% of the EU-25 GDP [64]. EU Eco-innovation under the Competitiveness and Innovation Program (CIP) consists of three components with budget \u20ac 433 million (2007-2013) for 37 countries [64]. According to China's National Development and Re- form Commission China could generate 20% of its en- ergy needs from renewable sources by 2020 [65]. Beijing seeks to achieve these goals by directing a significant share of China's $ 590bn economic stimulus package to low-carbon investment. About understanding of invest-ments significance into innovations testifies carrying out BIT Life Sciences' 1 st (Theme: \"New Starting Line for Decision Makers in Bio-economy Era\") and 2nd (Theme: Innovative Biotechnology for Sustainable Bio-economy) Annual World Congresses of iBio (Beijing 2008, Seoul 2009) by Chinese. Currently the U.S. and EU's state trade and subsidy policies will be critical to biofuel production. Therefore the burden of subsidy entirely lies upon on their taxpay-ers. The U.S. support for biodiesel is much more recent compared to that for ethanol. U.S. federal excise-tax credit of $ 0.01 per gallon of crop-based biodiesel for each percentage point share in the fuel blend was intro- duced in January 2005. Today the U.S. additional tax revenues generated by a profitable biodiesel industry will be significantly larger than the value of the Federal tax incentives provided to the industry. Assuming that the biodiesel tax credit of one cent per gallon for agri-bio- diesel and \u00bd cent per gallon for biodiesel from other sources was extended past 2008, the U.S. program would have cost $ 3.5 billion by 2015. However, as indicated above the industry will generate $ 8.3 billion of new revenue for the Federal Treasury for a positive net bal-ance of $ 4.8 billion. According to the EU Strategy for Biofuel, with the technol ogies currently available, EU-produced biodiesel breaks ev en at oil prices around \u20ac 60 per barrel, while bioethanol becomes competitive with oil prices of about \u20ac 90 per barrel. In compliance with to the Staff Working document adopted together with this Communication, which is based on the JRC Well to Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 195 Wheel analysis, the break even points for biodiesel and for bi oethanol are \u20ac 69-76 and \u20ac 63-85, respectively [25]. Further reductions cost will be needed for biofuels to be able to compete effectively with gasoline and diesel without subsidy [22-24]. According to key players' pol- icy production costs of conventional biofuels are, in gen- eral, higher than oil-based fuels, the strong expansion in the biofuel industry over the past few years have been critically dependent upon public sector support programs. Clearly the economics of biofuels are afforded favour- able opportunities by these support programs, but it is obvious that the industry has a number of vulnerabilities. For example, while ethanol in the U.S. currently enjoys a price premium as a fuel additive, it is uncertain whether this would continue once the demand for oxygenate is satisfied. Additionally, increasing demand for corn has resulted in higher corn prices, thus narrowing ethanol producers' margins. Very high feedstock prices could also prompt changes in policies regarding subsidies. A further vulnerability is the unpredictability of the weather and its impact on feedstock prices. For example, in North America ethanol production has decreased significantly in the past because corn planting in unusually wet condi- tions resulted in short corn supplies and higher corn prices. Nevertheless, issues related to land-use changes, competition with the food supply and other biomass uses, biodiversity, and competition for water resources will place a limitation on how much first-generation biofuels can be sustainably produced [23]. Harvesting biomass from forests, if not done properly, can expose soil to drying and erosion, reduce biodiversity, negatively im-pact the food supply for beneficial insects and wood- boring species, reduce organic matter, eliminate habitats and denning sites, and limit flowers that support declin-ing species of pollinators like bees, bats, butterflies and hummingbirds, among other adverse effects [66]. Envi- ronmentalists are concerned about tapping into available forest biomass, but officials say it can be done in ways that meet the country's energy needs while maintaining crucial forestlands. How much is it available ? Today the U.S. and EU at first lay their hope mostly on advances second-generation biofuels technologies by the use of forest woody biomass, but significant technological development need to be overcome to make second-generation technologies com-mercially viable [22,23] and many environmental prob- lems can occur when using forest woody biomass in the global dealer. At present prices of biofuel only increase. Key players of many measures of sustainable develop- ment policies are \"dangerously optimistic\" as, in reality, environment pollution increase [3,67]. Furthermore, the market for greenhouse gases will be worth nearly $ 45 billion by 2010 and only increases (2004- $ 0.4 billion, 2005- as well as unfavourable development visualize in algal blooms. On the other hand credit tool of Climate Change shows its small effective-ness, and it is not known - how programs carried in the framework of these credits can compensate the negative effects of environment contamination. A question arises as to how long governments will afford such heavy fi-nancial burden aimed to state subsidiary of biofuel pro- ducers instead of increasing investments in innovation technologies. The environment recogn izes neither ideo- logical nor geographic boundaries, neither developed, nor developing countries. I welcome developed coun-tries' initiatives aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of harmful substances, but it should be noted that such impact has global scale, so the world, as a whole, needs to undertake specific cost effective measures to change the situation. The sustainable development re- quires global partnerships among all of the countries. Combinations of policies, management approach and resultant actions need to link international processes and national perspectives to local action. It is already clear that the capacity of some communities to adapt will quickly be exceeded if environmental pollution goes globally unmitigated. On the other hand it should be noted that legislative and subsidy policies may not be applied, undoubtedly, in developing and poor countries. Run-time preferences in the implementation of legisla- tive and subsidy policies of industry may weaken com- panies' competitiveness in world markets and as result technological lag. To help these most vulnerable com- munities, it is essential for the world to devise a plan of action to technological development. Given the challenge facing us we must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with calls of all regions sustainable de- velopment. Separate solutions provided on local level cannot have high-performance as we are dealing with a comprehensive biological syst em. Therefore, the need for taking global action stems from very serious observations also conducted by International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) [3]. Our vision consist in fact that Global Sustainable Development may be only through develop-ment decision in cost effective manner aimed to tech- nologies global partnership of all word players with their synchronous action in area of eco-innovation. The U.S. agreed in January 2006 to co-operate on the development and transfer of technology to enable green- house-gas emissions to be reduced. Under this agreement, known as the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Devel- opment and Climate (AP6), me mber countries are work- ing with private-sector partners in several industry and energy sectors to voluntarily reduce emissions. The soon er a start is made, the quicker a new generation of more efficient and low- or zero-carbon energy systems can be put in place. To this end, they requested the In- ternational Energy Agency to \"advice on alternative en-ergy scenarios and strategies aimed at a clean, clever and Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. JEP New Design & Build Biological System through the Use of Microalgae Addressed to Sustainable Development 196 competitive energy future\" [22]. EC also plans to assist developing countries through a specific aid program for biofuels. Its assistance programs aim to promote effec- tive cooperation, including inter alia the development of national biofuel platforms and regional biofuel action plans [24]. The U.S. and EU can play crucial roles in these policy areas, using public spending and grants to create and maintain necessary infrastruct ure, promote technological innovation and incentivize behavioural change. It is ob-vious that the budget revenue of the developed countries is insufficient for a global t echnology transfer and tech- nical support around the word. It is also obvious that the budget revenue of the other countries is insufficient for a technology development or global technology transfer. Therefore, global sustainable development tools must provide incentives to stimul ate global investment in eco-innovation proj ects. Thus, the dilemma faced by policy makers is how to balance the real environmental pollution the need to provide certainty for investors. This offer could be designed in a manner that would simulta- neously maintain environmental integrity and minimize risk for investors. Private local investors' attraction of regions required from the key players development pol- icy and institutional decision aimed to financial risks reduction for stimulation of investment attraction in eco-innovation through cost effective market solution, without legislative and business subsidized investment initiatives, which bear heavily on region's local taxpay- ers. The Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) held a side event at the UNFCCC, SB30 meetings in Bonn, Ger- many on 5 June 2009 [69]. The event entitled \"Imple- menting & Accelerating Tech nology Transfer for the Transition to a Low Carbon Economy - Lessons from the work of CTI and UNDPA\". Asia Forum for Clean En- ergy Financing (AFCEF) organized and sponsored by CTI and ICETT attracted 60 submissions out of which 11 projects were shortlisted for coaching and showcasing before investors. Mr. Alan Miller, Principal Climate Change Specialist, Climate Change Environment and Social Development Department with the World Bank Group's International Finance Corporation, emphasized the urgent need to redirect private sector investment to clean energy projects in order to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC. CTI PFAN (Private Financing Advisory Network) is a multilateral initiative organized under the umbrella of CTI with contributions from CTI member countries, USAID, ICETT, APP, and REEEP which of-fers a free project financing advisory and investment matchmaking service to project developers to help them raise private sector finance that works in many develop-ing markets. PFAN program received endorsement in COP13 decisions (4/CP.13) for its work during the pilot phase, which led to the expansion of the program with new funding from USAID, APP and CTI. CTI's PFAN currently focuses on mitigation projects, but going for- ward upstream technology development, adaptation pro-jects, and possibly forestry are envisaged for PFAN sup- port. Our research shows that quantity of CTI and PFAN projects are less than needed today. Therefore it is nec-essary to improve the strategy and development of gen- eral lines of environmental management, leading to im- proved access to financing particularly private capital market to accelerate the broader development and diffu- sion of environmentally sound technologies. How long will it take ? The world could actually en- hance economic output and welfare by pursuing a path of mitigation cost through profitable eco-innovation. If we do not use this way, the negative effects of environment contamination will be difficult to global reverse. Tech- nological improvements will need a better incentive technology to encourage full participation and compli-ance. Recently, the combinatio n of escalating costs for energy and foods combined with climate change has re-newed interest in algae as a clean, carbon neutral energy source. The algal industry needs international and gov- ernment investment because the initial investments and risks are very high as well as there is not enough quantity of specialists with experience of algae industrial manu- facturing management and technology development. Roughly 50% of Algae World 2008 international con-ference respondents had less than five years experience in the algal industry while about 16% with over 20 years of industry experience [59]. Therefore many new studies and contracts between R & D Centers with private com- panies are sentenced to repeat past mistakes. The de-termination to find a solution may have been fueled in part by desperation\u2014and the fact that the world had just been dealt a sobering slap in the face by the financial crisis. That the Copenhagen talks at times seemed like a tussle between the US and China to take the lead in ad-dressing climate change suggests this decade will witness some tremendous geopolitical changes. The countries involved failed come to a binding agreement, but instead signed the Copenhagen Accord., which pledged $ 30 billion a year to a fund for po or countries to adapt to cli- mate change from 2010-2012, and $ 100 billion a year by 2020. 5. Our Vision Technological progress and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive, and governments, researches and business communities must mostly focus on emerging technological, procedural, or ganizational, institutional and political innovations based on the concept of the sustainability around the world. The analysis demon-strates the urgency required for policy and investment action in microalgae manufacturing development. Changes in fuel production, food and agricultural technology drive Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

JEP 197 economic growth in developing countries and contribute significantly to economic well-being in rich countries. Identifying opportunities in the next wave of technolo- gies, along with other policy initiatives including finan- cial crisis actions and climate policy, will affect renew-able energy companies today and in the future. The grav- ity of this solution increases in the face of Biofuels Di-gest updated Advanced Biofuels tracking database, which show that biofuel production capacity now pro- jected to reach 1.704 billion gallons by the end of 2013, based on announced projects and updated company guidance [70]. The database is now tracking 56 compa- nies with advanced biofuels projects in 13 countries. The previous 1.0 release of the database last year had pro-jected production capacity at 1.3 billion gallons. Among algal fuel is projected to reach 421.08 million gallons per year in capacity by 2013. Th erefore including microalgae production by waste and wastewater using in production and bio cycles open new ways for environmentally friendly manufacturing and nature restoration and con- servation of nature. Our strategy believes that the cost saving of raw material with the use of wastewaters through their biological cleaning will help raise the availability of microalgae biomass for food, agriculture, medicinal and biofuel producers, thus leading to resolu-tion of global tasks facing the world community. These benefits of microalgae are so overwhelmi ng that this, combined with the prospect of the improvement nature protection, makes it imperative for the world to devise an international response and a plan of action. Incentives will be needed for the development of industry-led plat-forms such as the World Mi croalgae Technology Plat- form. It should make it possible to establish a shared World vision and strategy for the production and use of microalgae addressed to biofuels, food and feed additives manufacturing, wastewater clean ing, climate change, etc. as well as the use of financial investments in cost effec- tive manner. The environment management mission of the World Microalgae Technology Platform is to con-tribute to: the development of cost-competitive eco-in- novation through initiatives of the creation, promotion and support regional privat e Microalgae Research, Tech- nology Development and Demonstration Centers aimed to reduce risk of private investment activities and pro- mote eco-innovation technology transfer around the word. Today the global financial crisis led many foreign inves- tors to seek out conservative investments closer to home rather than in emerging markets [71]. Therefore it is very necessary to develop global network of demonstration projects around the world aimed to promote financial investment and technology transfer. This resolves uncer- tainties that create difficulties in securing project financ- ing and reduces the cost of measurement, thereby facili-tating investment. In practice, technological break- throughs will almost certainly be needed for Environ- mental Management. The difficulties in realizing all this in the time frame of our analysis do not justify inaction or delay, which would raise the long-term economic, security and environmental cost. The World Microalgae Technology Platform with its adequate global calls in- ternational financial funds can be the key cost-effective tools for global reverse unfavourable change of environ- Figure 1.

The piloting innovative finance methods is one of the key priorities in its small-scale project funding, de-signed to have a \"wide ripple effect\". Each year of delay in implementing of this environment management tool through the use and commercialization microalgae eco- innovation would have a disproportionately larger effect on sustainable development. It is possible to expect that in the near future the abovementioned problems will be better perceived, thus leading to global reorientation of global sustainaible development management priorities. This should provide the opportunity to see the future in a new vision, where technology can serve as a revelation of the truth and where every endeavor is governed by reflection on and appreciation of the environment. Fostering access to microalgae technologies should thus be a key objective for policies aimed at sustainable development, environmental management, drinking wa-ter conservation, cleanup and restoration of lakes and mitigation of global climate change as well as for bio- diesel, food and feed additives manufacturing etc. In this case sun microalgae production may be the main future resource for development of Life Industry (food and feed, etc.) and biofuel production as well as for environment management and sustainable development ( Figure 1 ). Microalgae were the key tool for life development on earth; at present algae produce approximately 50-70% of the atmospheric oxygen and are the World Ocean Water natural cleaner. It is an approved choice of Nature. Therefore microalgae must be the key tool for the new design and building sustainable development of life and environmental management.

ABSTRACT The increase of biodiesel production results in the accumulation of glycerol, which requires an increasing demand to-wards the study of chemical application of glycerol. Glycerol has to be transformed to other valuable chemicals, which can be used as starting materials for organic synthesis. With the final goal to find a reasonable solution for this prob-lem we have studied the dehydration of glycerol in liquid phase using a support ed HPA catalyst and developed an en- vironmentally benign production of acrolein. Our method does not have any extreme conditions and produces a total conversion with high (93%) selectivity. Keywords: Consuming of Excess Glycerol , Production of Acrolein , Heterogeneous Method 1. Introduction Since people around the world almost exclusively cover its increasing energy demand with fossil basic materials (crude oil, natural gas, coal), sooner or later we are going to run out of these materials. To avoid this situation, the only possibility is to use biomass as a carbon source for the synthesis of fuels [1]. However, the use of biomass industrially in economically re levant chemical synthesis, new processes have to develop so that crude oil can be substituted [2]. Crude oil can be substituted by biodiesel where rape-oil is converted with methanol. However, there is a problem accompanying the bio- diesel production, namely the increase of the production of glycerol as a by-product, which can cause environ- mental and economical problem s, as well. The effective utilization of this byproduct will be a key issue to pro- mote the bio-diesel commercialization. Consequently an increasing demand has been developed towards the study of chemical application of glycerol to other valuable chemicals, which can be used as starting materials for organic synthesis [3]. One of the possibilities is to perform an acid-induced dehydration of glycerol to acrolein, as it can be seen in . CH CH2OH of glycerol to acrolein Acrolein is an important chemical intermediate so it is very important to develop a sustainable and cost- effective production route vi a glycerol from biodiesel, which offers an alternative for the presently dominating petrochemical process based on propylene. The dehydration of glycerol to acrolein became a rela- tively well studied subject r ecently, when the biodiesel production started to grow. However, most of these works applying drastic conditions, e.g. the dehydration of glycerol in sub- and supercritical water. B\u00fchler et al . found only low glycerol conversion (31%) and similar selectivity (37 mol%) meanwhile they used relatively high pressure (25-45 MPa) and temperature (300-400 oC) [4]. Ramayya et al. have studied the effect of the addition of sulfuric acid on the dehydration of glycerol and found that the addition of acid dramatically enhances the ac- rolein yield [5]. They have also used high temperature (300-350 oC) and pressure (34.5 MPa) and the obtained acrolein conversion was not too high. The other disad-vantage of this method was the application of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Meanwhile it was proven that high reaction tempera- ture was necessary for the de hydration of glycerol, since no acrolein formation was detected at 250 oC, 34.5 MPa using sulfuric acid as a catalyst [6]. Some other work can be found dealing with gas phase dehydration of glycerol on mesoporous ZSM-5 [7], or Nb 2O5 catalyst [8], but either the low selectivity or the expensive catalyst makes these methods practically un-Catalytic Dehydration of Glycerol under Mild Cond ition: An Environmentally Benign Acrolein Production 202 applicable. H. Atia, et al. have also studied the gas phase dehydra- tion of glycerol to acrolein using different supported HPA, as catalysts [9,10]. Th e influence of selected sup- port materials, catalyst load ing and reaction temperature on acrolein formation was st udied at standardized reac- tion conditions. Alumina was found to be superior to silica as support material with regard to catalyst activity and selectivity. Some other works were dealing with also the gas phase dehydration of glycerol using zirconia and silica supported heteropoly acid catalysts [11-13]. The authors compared the different catalyst preparation methods and they found that independently of the preparation history of ZrO 2, the Keggin-anion at the catalyst surface ap- peared as a key to the select ivity for acrolein production. Acrolein selectivity as high as 70 mol% was obtained over the catalysts having the intermediate densities (0.18-0.65 HPA nm -2). The dehydration of glycerol to produce acrolein was performed over several solid acids [14,15]. Supported heteropoly acids were effec tive catalysts for the dehydra- tion of glycerol. The catalytic activity depended on the types of heteropoly acid and on the size of the mesopores in the silica support. Silicotungstic acid supported on silica with mesopores of 10 nm showed the highest cata- lytic activity with the acrolein selectivity of > 85 mol% at an ambient pressure and 275\u00b0C. According to our knowledge there is no environmen- tally benign process for the utilization of the excess glycerol. With the final goal to develop an environmen- tally benign production of acrolein, we have prepared a supported HPA catalyst and studied the dehydration of glycerol in liquid phase. For our study relatively mild conditions were selected and a new heterogeneous cata- lyst, which could replace the very corrosive sulfuric acid in this process. 2. Experimental 2.1 Catalyst Preparation 7.0 g of Al 2O3 was suspended in 30 mL of methanol with stirring. 1.93 g (0.67 mmol) of phosphotungstic acid hy- drate (PTA) was dissolved in 25 mL of methanol and this solution was added dropwise into the alumina suspension with efficient stirring. The stirring was continued for an additional hour at room temperature, under an Ar at-mosphere. The solution was removed from the solid ma- terial and the solid residue was washed with methanol several times to remove the weakly adsorbed PTA from the surface of Al 2O3. The prepared catalyst was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, taking the spectrum of the phosphotungstic acid hydrate and the anchored PTA/Al 2O3, as well. The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bio-Rad FTS-65 A spectrophotometer, in the range of 400-4000 cm-1, in KBr pellets. 2.2 Dehydration Experiments The reaction was carried out in a two neck round-bottom flask, equipped with a dropping funnel and a column. The dried catalyst (8.93 g) was suspended in 70 ml high boiling point solvent (diesel oil) in a round-bottom flask and was heated gradually to 300 oC with efficient stirring. To keep the high temperature, the flask was covered with glass wool. The column was connected to a distillation apparatus and the distilled product was collected in a flask, cooled by ice. Having reached the suitable tem-perature 10 mL (0.13 mol) of glycerol was dropped slowly, meanwhile the product was distilled out. The two phase product was separated and the organic phase was dried by MgSO 4. The water phase was extracted by ether and the product distribution of both phases was determined by HP 5890 GC, using HP1 column and ethanol inert standard. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1 Catalyst Characterization With the final goal of developing an environmentally friendly process for the utilization of glycerol, which was produced in a large excess in the biodiesel production, we have anchored the phosphotungstic acid hydrate on Al 2O3 support. The prepared catalyst was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, taking the spectrum of the free phosphotungstic acid hydrate and the anchored PTA, as well ( Figure 1 ). The comparison of the two spectra above shows con- vincingly that the \"free\" acid and the heterogenized sam-ples have several similar bands (1090 and 890 cm -1), indicating the anchoring of the same acid. 3.2 Dehydration Experiments The preliminary experiments were done using H 3PO 4/ Al2O3 catalyst, which was prepared according to a patent description [16]. For the preparation of acrolein the same protocol was used as described in the patent and our pre- liminary experiments showed an increase in acrolein se- lectivity with increasing temperature. The dehydration reaction has not started below 240 oC, and it seems that a good acrolein production needs at least 280oC or even higher temperature. In other words, the most difficult problem in the laboratory to find a good, neutral solvent with a high boiling point. We have tried several solvents e.g. triglykoldimethyl ether, methyldiglykol- tert-butyl ether and finally a distilled fraction of diesel oil was se- lected. Based on data of our preliminary experiments and Copy right \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Using the former protocol with a higher boiling point of solvent and a more active catalyst we have expected a higher conversion, as well. The comp arison of the two catalysts can be seen in Table 1. Our expectation was correct as it can be seen in Table 1, with the new catalyst and a higher boiling point of solvent we obtained about three times higher conversion and selectivity was also higher. Consequently, studying the effect of temperature on the dehydration reaction we have decided to use these conditions (catalyst, solvent). In the third set of the experiments we have studied the effect of temperature on the reaction, more precisely we wanted to determine the optimum temperature for the formation of acrolein. Having the same reaction condi- tions we have changed systematically the temperature and the results can be seen in Table 2 . The systematic increase in temperature has increased significantly the yield of acrolein, at 300 oC we have reached 97% conversion and al so a high 77.5% selectiv- ity. Another increase in temperature with 20oC could produce the total conversion and an even higher 92.8% selectivity. Applying a good acidic catalyst and a high boiling point solvent we could determine the optimum conditions for the dehydration of glycerol. Using the above condi- tions we could produce total conversion and very high (93 %) selectivity, which are the best values\u2014according to our knowledge\u2014so far in the literature. Meanwhile we could not observe any other dehydration products (e.g. acetic acid, acetaldehyde). Table 2.

So, using the above conditions we could develop an environmentally benign method for the utilization of the extra amount of glycerol produced by the biodiesel formation. To check the efficiency of our catalyst we have made a blind experiment, too. During the blind experiment we have followed the same protocol without catalyst and we have not observed any acrolein formation. In other words applying these conditions the thermal dehydration is not occurring. 3.3 Recycling of the H 3[P(W 2O10)4]/Al 2O3 Catalyst It is well known that the most important advantage of heterogeneous catalysts is their recyclability. To check the reusability of our catalyst, we have applied our cata- lyst in three subsequent runs and the results can be seen on Figure 2 . As it can be seen on Figure 2 , (light column represents conversion, dark column selectivity) we could apply successfully our catalyst in three subsequent runs. Nei- ther the conversion nor the selectivity has changed dur-ing the three subsequent experiments, which means that our catalyst has the advantag e of the heterogeneous cata- lyst. The material balance is a very important fact from the point of view the practical application. For the experi- ments we have used 10 ml (0.13 mol) of glycerol for each run and the amount of isolated acrolein has in- creased as a function of temperature. Table 3 clearly shows that the isolated amount of ac- rolein has increased with increasing temperature. At the optimum temperature the material balance is reasonable. The loss of material is about 10%, which means the method is still practically useful. 4. Conclusions With the final goal of the utilization of the extra amount of glycerol, produced by the biodiesel production, we Figure 2.

This starting material is the acrolein, having two reactive double bonds, which make it possible to apply in various organic synthesis. The method devel- oped by us is an environmentally benign method, does not have any extreme condi tions and producing a total conversion with high (93%) selectivity. According to our knowledge this is the only environmentally benign method which produces such a high conversion and se-lectivity. REFERENCES [1] P.
