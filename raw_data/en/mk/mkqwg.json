Lavender Oil Has anyone ever used lavender oil drops on baby's crib? I'm coming out of the 4month sleep regression and I'm trying as many things as possible to help her sleep easier (having lots of false starts and then up every three hours). I've heard mixed reviews about using essential oil, anyone here any experience? Or any tips on how to make baby cosier / sleep tips? [The safest way for a baby to be put to sleep is on their back in a completely empty crib or bassinet.](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/sleep-solutions/newborn-baby-safe-sleep-practices/) Excuse the crazy long post, I'm in a science based parenting group and this comes up frequently. I copied the answer with evidence linked. If you don't want to read it, short answer is no, don't use it, it can actually be very dangerous. Essential oils should not be used on or around babies, toddlers, children in any situation. The oils can potentially poison children through ingestion or excessive application to the skin. They can cause skin rashes if a child ingests them, as well as get in their lungs and cause pneumonia. Essential oils can also potentially cause hallucinations and even seizures. Other toxic effects include chemical burns, hypo-tension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver failure, severe metabolic acidosis, and cerebral edema depending on which essential oil is in question.

In vitro tests show lavender is harmful to skin cells, with a proposed mechanism of membrane damage. If left exposed to air, lavender oil oxidizes, forming chemicals very irritating to the skin - with the study both identifying the oxidized components causing the irritation as well as showing irritation on patches of skin on test patients. The most common ones you'd think of to \"help\" Lavender and eucalyptus are associated with respiratory distress to seizures in kids under 2. First, the two most thorough, dealing with aromatherapy and EOs in general: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032645/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0032645/) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025082/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025082/) Next, other info: AAP on EOs [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/Supplement_1/240](//pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/Supplement_1/240) \"Many plants contain essential oils that are distilled, packaged, and sold unregulated to the public for medicinal purposes. Essential oils include any of a class of volatile oils composed of a mixture of complex hydrocarbons (often terpenes, alkaloids, and other large molecular weight compounds) extracted from a plant.4 Essential oils give the plant its characteristic aroma and will evaporate quickly from the skin or another surface; they are so concentrated that, if applied directly to the skin, they will often cause inflammation and dermatitis. Fixed oils are nonvolatile oils made of long-chain fatty acids, such as mineral oil or safflower oil. These are often used as carriers into which a few drops of the very concentrated essential oil are diluted during their application. Resins are solid or semisolid organic substances found in plant secretions; they are usually applied topically as creams or ointments.\" \"...any claims of health benefits from an herbal remedy should be subjected to the scrutiny of evidence-based medicine. \" \"Infants and young children are physiologically more vulnerable to certain adverse effects of herbs than are adults.\" \"Unfortunately, gaps exist in the regulation of herbal products and dietary supplements. Congress has passed legislation, The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, that does not include the usual consumer protections applied to medications used in the treatment of health problems.49 The ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require premarketing tests of safety and effectiveness is curtailed by this legislation, as is its ability to intercede in the marketing claims of an herbal product or dietary supplement unless the product has been shown to be overtly dangerous to health. DSHEA requires no testing of safety or efficacy for herbal products and dietary supplements, specifies few restrictions on product claims or controls on product purity or ingredients, and requires no postmarketing surveillance. DSHEA also makes no provision for the centralized reporting of adverse events.\" Essential oils are one of those things that need to be looked at through a risk/benefit analysis. There is little conclusive evidence that aromatherapy is beneficial for children, therefor the risks far outweigh the benefits. thank you so much for this! I never realised how dangerous they could be! I've never used them before and I definitely won't be now Wow thank you for this! People are forever suggesting lavender to me for baby, never knew any of this. I put lavender drops on my pillow every night and put a few drops on the top of his cot mattress (the other end from him) while I'm getting him ready for bed so it would be familiar to him when transitioning into his own room. I can't imagine that that's very harmful. He sleeps like a dream and moved into his big boy cot without a hitch and sleeps better in there now than he did in the cosleeper Although I may add. It's hardly the labs we doing the job (it is only an oil) I'd stay it's more than likely the association and familiarity from birth. You could try anything in place of essential oils.
