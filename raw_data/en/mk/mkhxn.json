By using healthy natural ayurvedic ingredients and applying them to our skin, we can achieve that radiance that is known as Ojas in [Ayurveda](/articles/short-intro-to-ayurvedic-medicine). This Sanskrit term for knowledge of life has been used in India and beyond for thousands of years to balance the mind, body, and soul in perfect harmony. This holistic approach to health and wellness, a sister of yoga, teaches that beauty comes from within and that nourishing our bodies from Mother Nature's powerful healing elements lead us to a healthy and vibrant life. Why should you use [natural cosmetics](/articles/5-easy-homemade-natural-skin-healing-treatments)? Many branded facial care products you use daily often contain harsh chemicals that can actually do more damage than good for your delicate skin? Before you go out and spend a fortune on overpriced items, first have a look in your kitchen cupboard at home; you may just have the perfect [herbal remedies](/articles/good-enough-to-eat-7-natural-skincare-recipes-list) for a home purifying cleanse. The Different Doshas Ayurveda recognizes three different body types, Doshas, which combine the five elements (earth, air, water, fire, and ether). [Discovering your Dosha](/articles/what-your-ayurvedic-health-body-type-quiz) makes a world of a difference when it comes to caring for your body. Just like you would know if your skin appears oily or dry, your Ayurvedic skin-type would relate to one or a combination of these Doshas. When Doshas are out of balance, they will each manifest in different ways. Let's explore some natural Ayurvedic ingredients to heal each Dosha's skin-type. VATA DOSHA Does your skin tend to become dry easily? Do you experience wrinkles and under-eye darkness? All of these signs indicate an imbalance of Vata, composed of space and air. In a Vata skin care regime, you should introduce hydrating essential oils into your daily life and stay on top of your water intake to ensure you hydrate internally also. Vatas should commit to moisturizing twice daily. Coconut Milk A popular ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Coconut Milk combats dryness, making it the perfect substance for Vatas. Mix a small scoop of almond powder with coconut milk to create a thick paste. Apply accordingly over your whole body for a deep moisturizing treatment. Apricot Oil Practice self-love the Ayurvedic way by giving yourself Abhyanga, a self-oil massage. For Vata skin care, apricot oil works a treat, but other essential oils can also nourish skin. Massage all over your body after a hot shower for ultimate hydration. Ghee Ghee, a clarified butter more commonly used for consumption, can actually serve as a hydrating ingredient for Ayurvedic skincare. Say goodbye to your dryness with a combination of ghee, rose water, honey, and lavender oil, and hello to the perfect facemask. PITTA DOSHA Is your skin oily, inflamed skin with a tint of redness? Prone to acne, rosacea, and eczema? These qualities are associated with Pitta, the fire and water Dosha. This skin type imbalance tends to be over-sensitive especially under sun rays, so if this is you, please be careful! To achieve Ojas, you should introduce cooling and calming herbs to counterbalance the overheating of Pitta. Aloe Vera Introducing cooling and soothing sensations, Aloe Vera is the go-to ingredient if you suffer from a Pitta imbalance. Apply the inside of the plant directly onto the skin for instant relief of irritation or mix together with some sunflower seed oil to lock in moisture, keeping you feeling fresh and silky smooth all day long. Witch Hazel Extract Indigenous to North America, Witch Hazel has been used for centuries as a natural healing ingredient. Boil the raw leaves to extract treatment for swelling and inflammation of the skin. Witch Hazel provides a natural remedy for minor skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Bentonite Clay Known as a swelling clay, Bentonite Clay absorbs and removes toxins from the skin. Detoxify your skin with this powerful healing clay to calm inflammation and reduce symptoms of acne, blemishes, and other skin conditions. KAPHA DOSHA Essentially smooth and well-moisturized, Kapha Dosha does wonders for aging skin and needs less commitment to a skincare routine. Associated with earth and water, Kapha imbalances manifest as blocked pores and puffy skin. Chickpea Flour Simply mix some chickpea flour with water to create a home exfoliating mask to use all over your body. Rub mixture all over in circular motions and leave for 30 minutes for maximum results. Wash off and admire your natural beauty radiating through your skin. Mustard Oil For overall skin therapy, Mustard oil brings many benefits. By promoting anti-aging and healthy skin, this natural ingredient can be applied head-to-toe as needed. If the strong mustard scent is too much for you, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to the mix. Cardamon A key ingredient in India's famous masala chai, Cardamom not only tastes great but also holds powerful antiseptic and antioxidant properties to heal our bodies and skin. Create a facial scrub at home by mixing cardamom powder with raw organic honey and apply all over your face for a clear, "}
