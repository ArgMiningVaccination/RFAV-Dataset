Steinman and Jacques Banchereau The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021 and Baylor Institute for Immunology cells (DCs) orchestrate a repertoi re of immune responses that bring about resistance to infection and silencing or tolerance to self. In the settings of infection and cancer, microbes and tumors can exploit DCs to evade immunity, but DCs also can generate resistance, a capacity that is readily enhanced with DC targeted vaccines. During allergy, autoimmunity and transplant rejecti on, DCs instigate unwanted responses that cause disease, but again DCs can be harnesse d to silence these conditions with novel therapies. Here we present some medical im plications of DC biology that account for illness and provide opportunities for prevention and therapy. Immunology is a major force in medicine. It is needed to understand how prevalent diseases (Fig. 1) come about and how to develop preventi ons and treatments. This broad reach of the immune system reflects its two functions: to recognize diverse substances termed antigens, and to generate many qualitatively distinct responses . Dendritic cells (DCs), named for their probing, tree-like or dendritic sh apes (Gr. dendron, tree) 1,2 (Fig. 1), are pivotal for both: recognition of a universe of antigens and contro l of an array of responses. 1Previously, we reviewed some biological features of DCs3,4. Here we illustrate medical implications of DCs, which c ontrol a spectrum of innate a nd adaptive responses. Innate immunity encompasses many rapid reacti ons to infection and other challenges5-9. Adaptive immunity, in contrast, is learned or acquired more slowly, in days to weeks; it has two hallmarks: exquisite specificity for antigen s, and a durable memory to develop improved function upon re- exposure to antigen. Adap tive responses are either immunogenic , providing resistance in infection and cancer, or tolerogenic , leading to silencing as is desirable in transplantation, autoimmunity and allergy. To date, the successes of immunology in the clinic have largely been based on antibodies made by B cells, but T cell- mediated immunity, which has enormous yet untapped therapeutic potent ial will be stressed here. DCs are specialized to capture and process antigens in vivo10-14, converting proteins to peptides that are presented on MHC molecules a nd recognized by T cells. DCs also migrate to T cell areas of lymphoid organs where the two cell types interact to bring about clonal selection15-17. The DC system is thus designed to harness the recognition repertoire of T cells, consisting of billions of different lymphocytes, each with a distinct but randomly arranged antigen receptor 18. This repertoire in turn represents a virtually in finite \"drug library\" for specific therapies that increase or decrease T cell function. Following clonal selection, DCs control many T cell responses. Antigen-selected T cells undergo extensive expansion, a thousand fold or more as a result of division at a rate as high as 2-3 cell cycles a day 19,20. Clones of lymphocytes are also subject to silencing or tolerance by so- called \"tolerogenic DCs\"21-23, which either eliminate (delete)19,20,23-26 or block (suppress) T cells27-39. If deletion is avoi ded, the clone undergoes differentiation to bring about an array of potential helper, killer, and suppressive activities. For example, under the control of DCs, helper T cells acquire the capacity to produ ce powerful cytokines like interferon- to activate macrophages to with facultative and obligate in tracellular microbes (Th1 cells)40- 44, or IL-4, 5 and 13 to mobilize white cells that resist helminths (Th2 cells)45,46, or IL-17 to mobilize sist extracellular bacilli (Th17 cells)47-51. Alternatively, DCs can guide to become suppressive by making IL-10 (Tr1 cells)28,30,52,53 or by differentiating into foxp3+ cells36,37,39. Finally, DCs induce the T cell clone to acquire memory , allowing it to persist for prolonged period s and to respond rapidly to a repeated exposure to antigen54-58. 2 There are four specialized featur es (Fig 2) of DCs that cont ribute to their capacity to control T cell recognition and res ponsiveness and in turn, either prevent or generate disease. Recent advances in DC biology are outlined in Boxes 1-4. Briefly, 1) DCs are positioned to capture disease-causing antigens and to pres ent these to lymphocyt es in lymphoid organs12,59-64, the sites for the generation of immunity and tolerance. 2) DCs have an endocytic system that is dedicated to antigen capture and processing, creating ligands for di fferent classes of lymphocytes13,14. 3) DCs differentiate or mature in response to a spectrum of stimuli14,65,66 (Table 1), allowing them to bring about innate and adaptive responses that are potent and qualitatively matched to the dis ease causing agent. 4) DCs are comprised of subsets that differ from one another in terms of location, antig en presentation, maturation and development67-72. Location (Box 1) and antigen presentation (Box 2) allow DCs to efficien tly select specific clones from the diverse recognition repertoire. Maturation (Box 3) and subsets (Box 4) allow DCs to control the diverse response repert oire of T cells and other classes of lymphocytes such as B cells and NK cells. 3Dendritic cells in infectious diseases DCs induce resistance to infection. When microbi al antigens are injected in association with DCs into mice, the animals acq defenses to viruses like CMV86,87, HSV-288 and LCMV89. In humans, a lack of circulating DCs during bacterial sepsis and dengue virus infection is associated with a poor prognosis90,91. A key concept is that DCs mature in distinct ways in response to different microbial components, thereby launching alternative versi ons of host immunity. The microbial ligands act on pattern recognition receptors5,7,8 including externally disposed toll like receptors6,44,92-94 and lectins95,96, cytoplasmic NOD/NALP family 97-99, RIG-I mda5 molecules100. These pattern recognition receptors can function synergistically44,101-104. In contrast, several microbes have the cap acity to actively bloc k DC maturation, e.g., Coxiella burnetti105, Salmonella typhi106, Anthrax lethal factor protein107, interesting exception is the effective attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine that may work by infecting and maturing DCs, allowing for antigen presentation to T cells125,126. Furthermore, pathogens can alter other leve ls of DC physiology to evade an immune response. For example, the agents of plague, Yersinia pestis , and typhoid fever, Salmonella typhi, selectively inject toxins into phagocytes, including DCs, and destr oy the cells required for innate and adaptive protection127,128. Influenza, measles and HSV-2 can induce apoptotic cell death in DCs112,124,129-131. With some viruses, cell death occurs through the intermed iate formation of giant cells or syncytia132-136. CMV, herpes and M. tuberculosis inhibit the migration step of DC function by blocking expression of CCR7137-139, a chemokine receptor that guides DCs into lymphatic vessels and onwards to lymphoid tissues15,17(Box 1, next page). 4 Box 1, Location of DCs. DCs are a uniquely positioned, prime target for disease relevant stimuli. DCs are abundant at body surfaces like skin, pharynx, upper esophagus, vagina, ectocervix, and anus419, and at so called internal or mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastro-intestinal systems61,62,364,420-423. DCs actually extend their processes through the tight juncti ons of epithelia, which likely involves DC expression of the tight junction proteins claude ns and occludens, without altering epithelial barrier function424. This increases DC capture of antigens from the environment61,163 even when there is no overt in fection or inflammation, probably allowing for the silencing of the imm une system to harmless environmental antigens26,363. DCs at body surfaces can function locally, e.g., to convert vitamins A and D to active retinoic acid and 1,25(OH) 2D3. One consequence of the overlooked metabolic capacities of DCs is to increase the homing of immune cells to that mucosal surface425- 427 and, in the case of retinoic acid, to help DCs differe ntiate suppressor T cells that block autoimmune and inflammatory conditions428-431. After leaving peripheral tissues, DCs mi grate with environmental, self, and microbial antigens to lym phoid organs, a process that is guided by chemokines15,17 and can be enhanced by vaccination432,433. DCs have now been studied in intact ly mphoid tissues without the need for cell isolation. These are the sites where immune resistance and tolerance are initiated. The DCs create a labyrinthine system within T cell areas, while probing the environment through the continuous formation and retraction of processes63 and displaying antigens and other stimuli needed to initiate res ponses by appropriate clones of specific T cells434-438. New research reveals interac tions of DCs in lymphoid tissu es with classes of lymphocytes, B cells423,439-448 and NK cells257,260,261,449. Microbes also can alter the function of DCs so that they switch T cell responses from protective Th1 to nonprotective Th2, as in infections with Aspergillus fumigatus140,141 malaria142, and hepatitis C143, or to IL-10 production in the case of Bordetella pertussis144. At this time, there are no therapies that tr y to interrupt the microbial immune evasion pathways that are summarized above. Several microbes additionally can exploit DCs for purposes of replication and spread in the infected host. The lectin DC -SIGN/CD209 is used by dengue virus145,146 and Ebola virus147 to infect DCs. In the case of HIV-1, CMV, and Ebola virus, the lectin additionally sequesters virus within DCs, which later transmit inf ectious virus to other targets like T cells147-153. DCs are 5also implicated DCs. DCs contain a specia lized endocytic system450, having many uptake receptors that deliv er antigen to processing compartments14,68,451- 458. DCs then present peptides from processed proteins to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells454,459, self and microbial cells460-462, and native antigens to B cells440,463,464. Many uptake receptors on DCs are le ctins with carbohydrate recognition capacity95,96. Some, like DEC-205/CD205 and mannose receptor/CD206179,312, are type I transmembrane proteins with multiple contiguous lectin domains451. A majority to date, such as DC-SIGN/CD209465, Langerin/CD207466, ASGPR467, LOX-1178 and DCIR68,468, are type II proteins with a single ex ternal lectin domain. Among these, CD209 has attracted wide interest because it binds a number of microbes including HIV148, dengue145, cytomegalovirus150, mycobacteria469,470 and candida471, and because it can hinder DC maturation and contribute to immune evasion472-474. Another lectin, Langerin/CD207, is reported to degrade HIV in DCs, thereby reducing transmission to T cells475. Early literature on DCs took antigen uptake for granted, without realizing that ligation of uptake receptors increases the efficiency with which antigens are delivered to the immune system in vivo by ~100 fold19,56,176,476. Targeting vaccines to these DC receptors should significantly improve the efficacy of T cell mobilizing vaccines. Following uptake of antigen, DCs are ab le to \"cross present\" antigens on MHC I to elicit CD8+ killer T cells235,263,307,476-482. During cross presentation, nonreplicating protein antigens are internalized and so mehow gain access to the cytoplasm before being processed by the proteasome for peptide presentation on MHC class I. Critical steps seem to occur from less acidic compartments456,458. Cross presentation allows DCs to induce CD8+ T cell responses to immune complexes, nonreplicating forms of microbes and vaccines, and dying cells205,206,287,299,482,483. For dying cells60,242,243,390,484, DC receptors for uptake remain to be defined in situ. Since cell death accompanies infection420, cancer246,248, transplantation390,391, the normal turnover of self tissues485, and some viral vaccines486, the uptake of dying cells is a starting point for DCs to capture antigens in many clinical settings. Fc receptors, which recognize antigen-anti body complexes, mediate antigen uptake and both activating and inhibitory signals in DCs204,205,207,487,488. For example, if inhibitory receptors are blocked, the binding of tumor cells coated with antibody leads to improved presentation of tumor antigens a nd production of the immune stimulating cytokine IL-12 207,209. 6All these consequences of the microbial-DC interaction have been analyzed on myeloid DCs, mainly in tissue culture but not in patients. We expect that microbes also evade and exploit plasmacytoid DCs, which also help to resist pathogens164 and are diminished in the blood during infections with HIV165-169, HTLV-1170 and RSV171. Box 3, Maturation of DCs. DCs differentiate or mature in distinct ways in response to a spectrum of environmental and endoge nous stimuli (Table 1). The maturation pathway then helps to designate which lymphocyte functions will be induced and which products will be made by both DCs and lymphocytes66,489-492. In the steady state in the overt absenc e of maturation stimuli, DCs can induce tolerance when they capture se lf and environmental antigens19,23,363. Maintenance of tolerance can require PD-L125 as well as fas493 on DCs. Upon infection or other causes of maturation, the DCs redeploy, but it is st ill not understood why DC differentiation is so rapid and extensive. One factor may be the high levels of required NF- B family proteins494,495 with each family member (s) able to control different DC responses496. Maturing DCs can induce different types of CD4+ T cells (see text), such as Th192,93,497, Th245, or Th1748,51,498-502 to increase resistance. Other stimuli can yield \"tolerogenic\" DCs, which induce Tr1 and foxp3+ T regs28,33,35-37,52,356,361,503-509 to silence immunity. Maturing DCs also expr ess more IL-15 and activate inflammation and NK cells in vivo261,510 When DCs mature in response to microbial products, expression of hundreds of genes is altered511,512, leading to synthesis of cyto kines, e.g., IL-12 and type I interferons that enhance i nnate and adaptive resistance86,513-519. While cytokines in turn can induce some components of DC maturati on, the DCs that direc tly interact with microbial ligands are the imm unologically more active ones520,521. The types of cytokines are influenced by the DC s ubset and the mode of DC activation522-524. Several chemokines are also se creted in groups at a time525, attracting different cells in succession to the site of DC maturation: phagocytes, memory lymphocytes, and na\u00efve T cells526. Numerous mechanisms also damp en the DC response to microbial products185,527. Maturation regulates antigen processing by lowering the pH of endocytic vacuoles, activating proteolysis, and transp orting Importantly, maturing DCs remodel their su rface, typically expressing many membrane associated costimulatory molecules243,520. These include members of the B7, TNF and Notch families529-532. continued, next page 7 Box 3, continued. A critical unknown is to define the cha nges in DCs that link innate to adaptive immunity in vivo533. The standard view that a combination of MHC-peptide (\"signal one\") and high B7-2/CD86 is sufficient to dr ive T cell immunity is oversimplified. To influence T cell differentiation, DCs additiona lly need to produce cytokines like IL-12 and type I interferons, CD70 to induce Th1176,535 and OX40L to induce Th2536. To counteract these mechanisms for pathogene sis of infectious di sease, DCs are now being considered in the design of vaccines to prevent and treat infection by enhancing immunogenesis. A new concept is to deliver vacci ne antigens to specific receptors on DCs (Box 2), along with stimuli to control DC maturation. For example, microbial proteins are genetically engineered into anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies, which then quickly and selectively target to large numbers of DCs within intact lymphoid tissues19,56,172. The CD205 receptor on human delivers antigen for processi ng onto both MHC class I and II, increasing presentation efficiency >100 fold rela tive to nontargeted antigen. Th1 responses, considered valuable for protection against many intracellular pathogens and tumors, also are induced when antigens from HIV, malaria, Leis hmania and tumors are targeted to maturing CD205+ DCs56,172,175,176. Significantly, these responses are broad, i.e., capable of recognizing many peptides from a given microbial protein and in several MHC haplotypes56,177, and the responses take place at mucosal surfaces, both key cr iteria in vaccine design. Other potential DC targets are being addressed including LOX-1178, MMR179,180, DCIR68, DC-SIGN181, toxin receptors182,183 and CD40184. Beyond the value of antigen targ eting, there is a need to mature DCs during vaccination in a way that is appropriate to the pathogen at hand. Here, one needs to define correlates of immunogenicity in vivo, i.e., what specific changes in DCs are re quired to generate protective responses from the response repertoire? Dendritic cells in cancer DCs are found in tumors in mice185 and patients186. Yet tumors suppress immunity, especially locally and by many pathways187-189. Tumors express cytokines, like IL6190,vascular may condition local DCs to form suppr essive T cells, such as IL-13 producing T196 and NKT197 cells. DCs even support the clonogenic growth of tumors in multiple myeloma198. Therefore, like some infections, cancers have ways to evade and exploit DCs199. Nevertheless, immunology is providing treatmen ts for cancer, mainly in the form of monoclonal antibodies200,201. Antibodies, by virtue of their antigen binding variable Fab regions, can block critical functions on cancer cells202; and by virtue of their constant or Fc regions, antibodies can mobilize an attack by other Fc re ceptor (FcR) bearing cel ls such as innate phagocytes and NK cells203,204. Antibodies mediate the uptake and processing of tumor cells by DCs and also can trigger DC maturation (Table 1)205-210. This portends the design of antibodies that harness select FcRs to induce better innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity . More emphasis is needed on cell mediated immu nity that also has a clear capacity to resist cancer211,212. In phase I clinical re search, adoptive transfer of killer T cells leads to regressions of melano ma and other cancers213-216. There is also a major survival benefit from allogeneic bone marrow transp lantation, in which lymphocytes from the marrow donor resist leukemia and other hematologic malignancies (the \"graft vs. leukemia\" reaction)217-220. In multiple myeloma, T cells that recognize glycol ipids and peptides in the tumor are found in a premalignant stage of disease but not when the tumor grows out of control221,222. In paraneoplastic diseases, T cells respond to antigens shared by the tumor and the nervous system, and likely resist the tumor but at the same time cause severe neurologic sequelae223. Examination of colorectal cancers indicates that the presence of a Th1 type immune response in the tumor correlates w ith a better prognosis224,225. On the other hand, immune suppression predisposes to higher fre quencies of several cancers226. All of the above examples imply a role for immune surveillance by T cells against human cancer, as is also seen in mice227,228. DCs can be marshaled for the prevention and treatment of cancer for the following reasons229. 1) Tumors are replete with potential antigens230-232, and they can become immunogenic when presented by DCs229,233-238. This means that the immune attack on cancer can be broad enough to encompass multiple target s including mutant proteins expressed by the cancer, and not just one target, where the latter favors immune escape. 2) Likewise, DCs can activate and expand the different arms of cell-mediated resistance such as NK239,240, NKT221,241- 244, T245 and T227,246-248 cells, each of which r ecognizes different alterati ons in cancer cells. 93) DCs in systemic lymphoid organs and DCs ge nerated ex vivo from progenitors in blood likely retain their immunizing capacities in cancer patients43,247,249-254. Therefore one can test whether the specific features of DCs (Fig. 2) can be harnessed either to generate therapeutic immunity or to prevent cancer during premaligna nt or minimal residual disease stages255,256. Two DC based immune therapy approaches ar e currently available. In one, DCs are generated ex vivo, loaded with tumor antigens, and reinjected to take adva ntage of the ability of DCs to migrate to the T cell areas of lymphoid organs to induce strong T cell and perhaps NK immunity257-261(Fig. 3). Less explored is the evidence that DCs themselves can acquire killer activity for human tumors and express granzyme and perforin killer molecules262. In another strategy, tumor cells or tumor antigens are targeted directly to DCs in the T cell regions (Fig 3), e.g., within monoclonal anti-DC an tibodies as discussed above. Already a large number of phase I studies in humans have used the first approach in which DCs are generated from precursors ex vi vo. These early trials have only occasionally yielded significant tumor regressions263-265, and there are no studies yet showing improved survival. 10The current deficiencies in DC therapy need to be addressed in patients to deal with significant scientific and other obstacles. First, DC vaccines are being tried only in late stage cancer patients who are immunosuppressed as a result of extensive radiation, chemotherapy and/or large tumor burdens. Why limit research to these patients, especially when DC therapy is nontoxic, including in the few patients who have experien ced major tumor regressions263-265? Second, most injected DCs remain at the inject ion site. Only a few migrate to the draining lymphoid tissue, ~ 1 % in mice and humans266,267. Research in patients will be required to overcome this limitation. One example is to conditi on the injected site with cytokines like TNF, so that the injected DCs receive need ed cues for migration into lymphatics268. Third, more emphasis is needed on DC quality, by testing DCs fo r their capacity to induce helper and killer T cells with a high avidity for tumor antigens but few T regs269-271. Fourth, many initial vaccine studies used DCs charged with one or a few tumo r antigens, whereas the potential of DCs rests with their still untapped capacity to elicit a strong and broad immune attack to lessen the chances of tumor escape. Fifth, vaccine studies need to be accompanied by in depth immune monitoring to define assays for protective lymphocytes whose presence correlates with tumor regression and/or improved survival. For example in HIV vaccines, it is thought that protective T cells will produce several and higher leve ls of cytokines like IFN- , IL-2, and express low levels of the PD-1 regulatory protein274-276; and have high functional avidity for antigen277. Sixth, DC based immune therapies require a coordinated re search effort to generate DCs for clinical use and to help investigators syst ematically evaluate the many va riables pertinent to efficacy278. Even with these limitations, early trials with ex vivo DCs have in patients with advanced cancer expanded T cells that recognize multiple tumor antigens279 and make the protective cytokine, IFN- 43,280,281. These observations provide a star ting point to use DCs in a more concerted way to study their imm une capacities in cancer patients , and to combine immunization with other therapeutic modalities282. Chemotherapy283-287, radiotherapy288, and removal of tumor regulatory mechanisms, e.g., CTLA4289,290, B7-H4291,292, IL-10293,294, TGF-195,295, IL-13196,197, could be more specific and less toxic if combined with DC-based therapies. The ex vivo technique is being developed so that it is easier to carry out, including in collaborative studies296-298. This approach allows the basic features of DCs (Fig. 2) to be controlled, e.g., to load them appropriate ly with multiple antigens including tumor 11cells263,265,299,300 tumor RNA301, or potentially cancer stem cells302; to select from many options for DC maturation300,303,304(Box 3); and to specify the DC subset for clinical use 279(Box 4). Box 4, Subsets of DCs. There are several types of DCs, each with distin ct markers and functions69. Plasmacytoid DCs, named because of cytologic similarities to antibody-producing plasma cells537-539, can be involved in tolerance in their immature state540. For maturation, these DCs sele ctively express activating FcR209,210 as well as TLR7 and TLR9328,457,541-544. When immune complexes containing DNA and RNA are bound and ingested, they signal potentially pathologic leve ls of type I interferons323,327- 329,331. Other \"myeloid,\" also produce type I interferons515,545,546. Myeloid DCs in different tissues can be further subdivided based on expression of certain markers and functions. In the case of skin, DCs in the epidermis (Langerhans cells) express Langerin/CD207547 and DEC-205/CD205, and induce strong killer T cell responses548; some DCs in the dermis express DC-SIGN/CD209 and mannose receptor/CD206549 and can activate antibody forming B cells550. Distinct skin DC populations also migrate to different areas of the draining lymph nodes551,552. Thus the outcome of skin vaccination may depend on th e lectin and DC subset that pick up the vaccine. In mouse spleen, a DC subset expresse s DEC-205 and is particularly efficient for the cross presentation of antigens on MHC I60,67,68,478,481,553, including tumor cells248, and also for the induction of IFN- producing, Th1 helper T cells41,42,176. A second subset expresses DCIR2 and other lectins and is mo re efficient at processing antigens for presentation on MHC II68. In lymph nodes draining mucosal tissues, the presence of an integrin, CD103, distinguishes a DC subset that cross presents on MHC class I554 but also synthesizes retinoic aci d for the differentiation of foxp3+ T reg428-430. DC subsets communicate with each ot her, e.g., plasmacytoid DCs produce interferons and membrane bound co stimulators that recruit ot her DCs to participate in immunity555,556. The production of most DC subsets is contro lled in the steady state by the cytokine, flt- 3 ligand557,558, whereas during inflammation and infection, another cytokine GM-CSF mobilizes increased numbers of monocyte-derived DCs559-564. In the steady state, DCs in lymphoid tissues emanate from marrow progenitors in the blood565,566 but not monocytes567,568, although monocytes give rise to DCs in some nonlymphoid tissues in the steady state568 and in many sites during inflammation69. A second DC-based strategy in cancer therapy would be to mobilize DCs directly within the patient, either within the tu mor or within lymphoid organs. In mice, irradiated tumor cells 12injected intravenously are taken up by DCs60,248. Alternatively, one can inject irradiated tumor cells that are transduced to express GM-CSF, wh ich recruits the patient's DCs to capture and present tumor antigens305-308. A new approach to the maturati on of antigen capturing DCs in vivo uses innate NKT cells that recognize glycolipids309. The activated NKT cells mimic the effects of a combination of TLR and CD40 ligat ion on DCs and elicit long lasting, protective CD4+ and CD8+ T cell resistance248,310,311. Another example is to selectively target cancer antigens within monoclonal an tibodies to receptors on DCs175,312, thus ensuring the delivery of antigen to large numbers of DCs in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs, as opposed to the small numbers that successfully home from an injection site to these areas (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, DC-mediated immunization against cancer is still an unde rdeveloped field. Yet this approach can exploit the patient's responses to cancer to produce more specific, less toxic, broader, and longer las ting therapies. There is an im portant unmet need to expand and coordinate research on DC based therapies agai nst proliferating and in itiating cancer cells. Dendritic cells in autoimmunity Inappropriate responses to self constituents, in select genetic backgrounds, can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions, termed autoimmune dis eases. DCs bearing self antigens are able to induce autoreactive T cells in mous e models of multiple sclerosis313, cardiomyopathy314,315, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)316. It is increasingly appreciated that a pivotal step leading to human autoimmunity is an overproduction of a particular cytokine(s)317-320, and subsets of DCs can be a major source. For example: TNF is a key cytokine in rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases, like psoriasis, and TNF blockade is a powerful therapy for many patients321. In psoriasis, a major source of TNF is a DC subset infiltrating the affected skin322. Lupus erythematosus, a systemic disease in which antibodies are formed against self constituents especially nucleoprotein s, is accompanied by what is termed an interferon signature in white blood cells323. Type I interferon is made in large amounts by plasmacytoid DCs324,325, which infiltrate the skin lesions of SLE326. Viral nucleic acids, as well as self nucle oproteins internalized in the form of immune complexes, trigger TLR7 and TLR9 leading to type I interferon 13production327-329. Moreover, the DNA binding pr otein and cytokine, HMGB1, can deliver self DNA to TLR9 and ligate the RAGE receptor on DCs330. Interferon in turn drives the mob ilization of activated granulocytes323 and differentiates monocytes into DCs, wh ich may present dying cells in an immunogenic rather than tolerogenic manner331. Ligation of activating FcR by the immune complexes that are formed during autoimmunity also drives DC maturation209,210,332. Type I interferon and plasmacytoid DCs are also proposed to be pathogenic in such other diseases as psoriasis333, dermatomyositis334, and Sjogren's syndrome335. IL-23336 is a cytokine that disease, including psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease337-341, and DCs are major IL-23 producers342-344. Despite their role in inducing autoimmunity, DCs are also releva nt to the therapy of these diseases. 1) Various treatments especially gl ucocorticosteroids can reduce DC numbers and functions323,345-352. 2) Since DCs seem to be a source of pathogenic cytoki nes, the stimuli for cytokine production need to be identified and obviated. 3) One pot ential antigen-specific strategy relates to the capacity of DCs to expand and induce T cells that suppress immunity, usually termed \"T regs\"31,33,37,353-358. T regs can suppress other DCs that present disease producing antigens359,360. In the case of a spontaneous mode l of autoimmunity, diabetes in NOD mice, T regs that recognize an tigens in insulin producing cells can be generated by DCs and provide a therapeutic benefit even after the onset of disease36,361. Dendritic cells in allergy DCs normally tolerize the immune system upon exposure to harmless environmental antigens22,34,362,363, including the pollens, dust mites, and foods that cause respiratory and intestinal allergy. The DCs at mucosal surfaces capture proteins364 and silence the corresponding T cells, possibly by expressing ICOS-L, which in turn differentiates antigen-specific, IL-10 producing T regs365,366. In allergy, instead of th is immune tolerance, CD4+ helper T cells develop along the atopic Th2 pa thway and yield interleukins (IL -4, 5, 13) responsible for many aspects of disease, such as the formation of IgE type antibodies. DCs both initiate the formation of proallergic Th2 T cells and boost symptom-producing responses in already allergic mice 367-371. 14How might the normal tolerizing roles of DCs be altered during alle rgy? Cytokines may again be pivotal, e.g., recent st udies reveal a role for skin375 to elicit unusual Th2 cells that secrete not only IL-4, 5, and 13 but also high levels of TNF. TSLP- treated mature DCs express OX40L, a TNF family member. OX40L can instruct T cells to develop a Th2 type of memory along with the pro duction of allergic mediat ors like prostaglandin D257,376. Several new directions for allergy research involve DCs. 1) DC maturation by TSLP needs to be understood and blocked; likewise fo r TSLP production by epithelial cells, which is controlled by retinoid receptors377 as well as IL-1 and othe r inflammatory cytokines378. 2) The substances that cause allergy may modify DC function directly by bloc king IL-12 production by DCs and in turn favoring formation of allergic Th2 cells379. 3) In humans, new synthetic oligonucleotides can suppress presen tation of allergens by DCs to Th2 cells380; these compounds have shown promise in trea ting ragweed induced allergic rhinitis381. 4) DCs might be targeted to allow for formation of allergen-s pecific T regs, which can treat allergy as observed in mouse models382,383. 5) New drugs can interfere with th e pro-allergic functions of DCs and treat experimental asthma384. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist FTY720 blocks the migration of DCs from lung to lymph nodes wher e the DCs could present antigens to disease- causing Th2 cells385, while agonists for the D prostanoid receptor condition DCs to induce disease-reducing T regs386. Dendritic cells in transplantation DCs play a key role in the outcome of organ and hematopoietic transplantation. DCs in grafted organs mature and migr ate into the recipient 387-389, where they stimulate alloreactive T cells that bring about graft rejection. Recipient DCs also can capture portions of the graft390,391 and elicit organ rejection. Interestingly, suppressive drugs in current clinical use may act on the rejection- inducing DCs as well as the rejecting T cells392-396. In hematopoietic transplantation, recipient DCs are key initiators of T cell-induced graft versus host reactions397,398. Mechanisms have yet to be pinpointed to explain the maturation and migration of DCs that accompany transplantation. It seems reasonable to propose that strate gies to block these DC functions during transplantation will promote acceptance399. However, recent discoveries show that DCs in 15grafted tissues can regenerate locally400, thus providing a long term source of antigen to stimulate rejection398. In this light, alternative pathways to us e DCs to induce transpla ntation tolerance are being assessed401-403. One involves the activation of reci pient NK cells, which reject donor DCs in tissue culture models404,405 and in vivo406. Another pathway is to induce DCs to become tolerogenic389, e.g., to express the to lerogenic ILT3 molecule407 or to induce graft-specific foxp3+ T reg suppress graft-rejecting T cells35,391. In hematopoietic cell tr ansplantation, strategies that lead to recipient DC depletion are currently be ing tested in the clinic. Extending DC biology into medicine. Immunology, including T cell mediated immunity, has a central role in understanding how disease develops and in designing new treatments (Fig. 4). Here we suggest therapies aimed at the upstream events initiated by DCs. DCs can either intensify or subdue T cell responses, depending on whether resistance or tolerance needs to be increased. Considerable evidence from studies in mice, which predominates in this review, shows how DCs act in a disease specific manner. Increased emphasis on the antigens that elicit disease should provide medical approaches that are longer lasting and less subject to side effects than current antigen-nonspecific ones. To repeat, DC -based analyses and therapies emphasize initial events in complex disease cascades, but more patient-based research is ne eded to take DCs into medicine. 16The scientific rationale is that a patient's response to disease invol ves not only antigens and lymphocytes but also DCs that control antigen presentation a nd clonal selection (the immune recognition repertoire) as well as lymphocyte growth, differentia tion and memory (the immune response repertoire). Each feature of DCs in fig. 2 is an intricate area for research, whose findings are facilitating a deeper an alysis of disease and how to in terrupt its progress. However, major gaps exist to take this science into medicine. In mice, the current research emphasis has been on model antigens, isolated DCs, and highly selected populations of T cells with a single transgenic antig en receptor. Instead, research on DCs needs to be directed to th e control of immune responses 1) in situ in intact animals, 2) within the natural immune repertoire, 3) to clinic ally relevant antigens, and 4) with new immune enhancers or adjuvants that act in defined ways on DCs. Even so, the immune systems of mice and men differ in many aspects408. A demanding subject, but one which will enhance disease research, is the development of mice with immune systems derived from human sources196,409-416. More research needs to be done with patient s. The patient sets the standards for the quality of knowledge that is required to understand many aspects of diseas e and its treatment. Often the pathogen (tumor, microbe, allergen, st imulus for autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease) is not easily or completely modeled in mice. Although scientists and the public both desire \"translation\" from mice to humans, there is an underappreciated need to create a sizeable limb of the scientific enterpri se that will bring new methods, concepts, and coordination to the basic study of disease with patients. This need is illustrated by the paucity of DC-based studies on the immunotherapy of cancer. Basic research with patients differs substantially from current outcome studies and drug licensing trials, which test whether existing practices and concepts are clin ically effective. In contrast, disease research yields new ideas and therapies. The bi ology of DCs is ready to be extended to dissect disease pathways and to direct its prevention and treatment. De spite the obstacles to research in patients417,418, physicians and scientists have the knowledge and tools to think systemically about diseases, plan their therapies, and investigat e how human beings respond. DCs are an early player in disease development and an unavoi dable target in the design of treatments. 17Acknowledgement .
