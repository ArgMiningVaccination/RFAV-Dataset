[Inner Traditions/Bear & Company](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/361356815/Inner-Traditions-Bear-Company) Reviews for Handbook of Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda 4 ratings0 reviews Book preview Handbook of Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda - Bridgette Shea Introduction What do we find more interesting, wondrous, and magical than the inner workings of ourselves? What we are, who we are, why we are here, and what our purpose is in this life. How incredible nature is! If we have a cut, it heals, if we have an emotionally turbulent time, we go deeper into the why of our being and higher into the truth of a grander whole, and we emerge stronger, more pieced together. Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, two of the oldest healing systems of the world, offer us tangible, and oftentimes transcendent, bigger-picture insights into who we are as individuals, as living beings, in relationship to ourselves, to others, to the environment, the world, and existence in general. And both continue to make an ever-increasing contribution to the health and well-being of people around the world. Chinese medicine has become increasingly popular because of the widespread positive results arising from its bodywork modality, acupuncture. These include alleviating pain, providing emotional comfort, increasing fertility, reducing stress, and addressing a long list of other issues for millions of people worldwide. Acupuncture is now recognized in the United States by many insurance companies, and many people have access to it, whether it's at a methadone treatment facility, a fertility clinic, on a military base, on-site at a disaster, on a cruise ship, in a doctor's office, or with an acupuncturist in private practice. The interest in how it works is growing, even in those who have yet to receive its benefits. It's fascinating and quickly becoming a part of our daily lives. Ayurveda, too, is increasing in popularity by leaps and bounds as it follows yoga into mainstream consciousness. Ayurveda segments on Dr. Oz and numerous references to it by such respected experts in the field of mind/body medicine as Deepak Chopra and Andrew Weil have certainly aided in its spread. Ayurveda fills in the gaps in Chinese medicine, particularly in relationship to diet and cleansing. Many people are absolutely obsessed with food and dieting, and Ayurveda offers the most complete, time-honored system available for understanding food at the level of consciousness as well as the level of the physical body. It is the natural go-to method for anyone seriously interested in using simple lifestyle modification, diet, and detoxification as tools for wellness and weight loss. My own treatment practice involves a blend of Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, maximizing the ways in which they supplement and enhance each other. However, most of the books on the market only cover one or the other, and the very few that discuss both do so in a way that does not necessarily emphasize their similarities or how they can be used together in a clinical practice. Also, it is often the case that introductory books in Chinese medicine offer a lot of good information but are either far too simplistic, or, like many books in Ayurveda, too complex and esoteric for a beginner. I've been frustrated throughout my career by the lack of a good single resource I can suggest to my clients. Instead I've recommended books I know won't really meet their needs and given away tons of handouts. I know many other practitioners who end up doing the same. There is a need for a clear, simple explanation of the deep knowledge of human health preserved in these systems, combined with accessible, immediately usable recommendations for a healthy diet and lifestyle. This book provides just such a resource for practitioners, patients, or anyone interested in either Chinese medicine or Ayurveda. I present the material in such a way as to clearly illustrate the ideas in both traditions without being too simplistic or overly complex. Whatever your starting point, this book will help you to understand the theory behind the actions outlined in both practices. Uniquely, it offers a blend of the two systems, while staying true to the roots of each discipline. It also includes dietary guidance, food lists, and a constitutional self-analysis questionnaire, which will guide you in utilizing the key concepts in the medicines to enhance mental, emotional, and physical balance. It is also a seamless introduction for the practitioner wishing to cross over into using a complementary field for understanding life and medicine in a different yet familiar and useful way. Why is it important to blend Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, and why have I chosen these two fields to highlight? The story of how I came to combine them in my own practice offers some significant insights with wide applicability. I became formally interested in ancient healing modalities in 1992 while visiting the original Aesclepion (a healing temple sacred to Aesclepius, the god of medicine) in Old Epidaurus, Greece. Having been a vivid dreamer my whole life, I had a natural fascination with the ancients' development of transformational dream healing clinics. While there, I was introduced to stelae (stone slabs) that depicted priestesses hovering their hands over patients, and a few years later I found myself practicing and teaching Reiki, qigong, yoga, and other energetic healing arts modalities. While I was receiving zero balancing energy work,*1 I was given the audible vision of the word astanga, which means eightlimbed and is used to identify certain schools of yoga instruction. It is also used more specifically to refer to the foundational Yoga philosophy compiled by the ancient sage Patanjali. This led me to study Patanjali's Yoga and later to go to India to pursue a deep study of asana (posture) and pranayama (breath control), mudra (ritual gesture), Sanatana Dharma (eternal truth),8 Sanskrit, and a little Ayurveda. While I was in India, through the same energy work modality of zero balancing, I received similar guidance to become an acupuncturist. I ended up in Seattle a year and a half later studying Chinese medicine at Seattle Institute of Oriental Medicine (SIOM), one of the more rigorous Chinese medical schools in the country. Becoming a practitioner of Chinese medicine\u2014which includes herbal medicine and acupuncture\u2014is an involved and demanding process. After three to four years of undergraduate study and prerequisites similar to that of someone applying to medical school, you can apply to Chinese medicine school. Programs include a minimum of three years of full-time year-round study and result in a master's degree. The program I was in is the only one in the United States requiring extensive training in the Chinese language. At SIOM students are taught to translate both simplified and classical characters. This means that the participants not only study the foundational texts that define the medicine but also translate them so that they are not solely relying on someone else's interpretation. This is very rare in the Western acupuncture world, and it grants participants a view of the medicine that not everyone has direct access to. Through this in-depth exposure I found that the theory underlying the medicine is very vague and often confusing. I felt a lack of continuity and explanation in the material with regard to foundational principles. Because of this, I had difficulty connecting to the soul of the medicine and acquiring an experiential awareness of its underpinnings. I was left with more questions than answers and felt that my understanding lacked grounding. Because of this feeling of disconnect, I returned to my earlier interest in Ayurveda. There is an enormous body of knowledge on Ayurvedic medicine that is also thousands of years old yet lacks the gaps I experienced in the Chinese tradition. This is not to say the same wisdom is lacking in Chinese medicine. It's just that the information on Ayurveda's core principles is much more accessible and it feels more complete to me. I started reading and contemplating the ancient Ayurveda texts, including the foundational works of the Indian physicians Charaka and Sushruta. There is a flow to them and to modern authors' renderings of their teachings that caused me to think about what I was studying in Chinese medical school and go, \"Oh, so that's what this is saying.\" As I continued my course at SIOM, I also attended workshops with Dr. Vasant Lad. Dr. Lad is probably the most well-known and well-loved Indian Ayurveda vaidya living in the West. His Ayurvedic Institute produces many of the textbooks used by students in not only the United States but elsewhere in the Western world. When he isn't instructing from his home base in New Mexico or taking students to India to observe clinical practice, Dr. Lad travels the world teaching Ayurveda. In addition to attending various workshops, whenever I could, I intensively studied the ancient texts and teachings of Ayurveda and began an apprentice-like training with a Seattle-based Ayurveda practitioner, Kumudini Shoba. In addition to what I was learning through external resources, I engaged daily in thought experiments. I would internalize the concepts of Ayurveda as much as possible and use them to decipher the code of Chinese medicine. Every now and again I would feel a tremendous sense of accomplishment when a respected teacher would verify the conclusions I had come to on my own. This helped keep me going in the process. I utilized my knowledge of Ayurveda to help me understand Chinese medicine at a deeper level and eventually integrated both systems into a comprehensive traditional medicine practice. Without the influence of Ayurveda, I'd be practicing Chinese medicine with less depth of understanding in its foundational principles. The way the truth of the medicine from India is presented resonated more with me\u2014it made more initial aha sense. Being able to apply this knowledge, once I had ingested and assimilated it, helped me to see where the Chinese were coming from in a new light. Instead of feeling like I was on the fringes of Chinese medicine, I could more readily integrate its concepts and truths into my perception in the clinic, and in life overall. Honestly, I'd have felt somewhat like an automaton in my learning and in my practice had it not been for my early applied understanding of Ayurveda. I'm sure this isn't true for everyone, and for some it may be the other way around. They may feel that Chinese theory helps them understand Ayurveda. I've met many Chinese medicine practitioners who naturally have a deep connection to and integrated experience of their art. Having said that, some of the most remarkable, spirited, contented folks I've come across are Ayurvedic practitioners who apply its teachings to their daily lives. This has made me step back and really think about how Chinese medicine is being passed down, at least in the Western world, and the effect this may have on the everyday application of its teachings for its practitioners. Although many enjoy their work, it seems as though there is less support for utilizing what it has to offer as a way of life. This may be especially so in small towns and more remote areas where there are fewer practitioners who can meet up and discuss case studies or support one another in other ways, for example, through exchanging treatments or attending internal cultivation sessions. This may have something to do with why job retention for acupuncturists is remarkably low five years post-graduation. There are a number of reasons for this and I see it happen. In fact, the way the whole acupuncture clinic scene is set up isn't for everyone. But practitioners may not know it until they've already run the gamut of schooling, loans, and becoming small business owners. However, among people who have studied Ayurveda\u2014at least in the West\u2014I recognize a deep experiential understanding and appreciation for Ayurveda and an awareness that the practice of it isn't a job so much as it is a way of life. In fact, the word Ayurveda can be translated as the wisdom of life. The meaning of the word Taoism\u2014Chinese medicine's foundational cosmological philosophy\u2014isn't that far removed. It roughly means not interfering with the natural course of events. We need to know the natural course of events so as not to interfere with their process. At their roots, both of these modalities emphasize the knowledge of nature or life. Whatever the system, the practitioner's capacity to have an internal experiential awareness of the concepts inherent in the medicine and therefore in life creates not only a better practitioner but a natural resonance of trust between the practitioner and the person they are treating. Conversely, the lack of this awareness may present as an obstacle to practice. This book offers a clear view of the backbone of each of these systems, so as not to be overwhelming to the beginner. It is an excellent manual to offer patients because it contains all the information that they will need to understand what they're being treated for and why and can provide more detail than we typically have time for in sessions. This can be indispensable for helping people keep themselves balanced between treatments. At the same time the book offers a profound resource for the experienced practitioner of either system who gets bound up in the complexity that can arise when contemplating the medicine or a specific case. And it is a useful aid for accessing information from a related discipline that may be the key to unlocking unanswered questions or may offer another tool with which to treat oneself or others. It can also aid practitioners who integrate both systems into their practice by offering a firm foundation in all the necessary concepts in both traditions. Part I of this book places Chinese medicine and Ayurveda in the context of other ancient medicines, providing the reader with a better understanding of the complexity and scientific nature of medical systems developed thousands of years before our own. From this starting point, we merge into a parallel explanation of Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. I know of no other book that lays out the principal tenets of these two systems side by side. This approach reveals the similarities between the foundational theories of both and makes the concepts easier to follow. For example, in a single chapter on the five elements, central to both medicines, the discussion proceeds idea by idea rather than presenting two separate elemental theories. This speaks to the interconnectedness of these approaches to well-being, while also making it easy for the reader to learn more about a particular topic in one place rather than having to flip through the book for answers. Part I also includes chapters that focus on constitution, anatomy, and consciousness, again, as they are understood in both systems. Chapter 4 contains a simple self-quiz to assess your constitution or current body-mind makeup. Using this and the health recommendations for each type presented in Part II, you can more clearly decide for yourself or for your clients what course of action is recommended for a specific presentation. Part II provides information on how to balance yourself. It contains a discussion on taste and which foods are optimal for which body-mind type along with basic dietary guidance that is practical and easy to implement but that the average person has probably never considered. Indeed some of the information contained here may even be news to practitioners. This is one of the beauties of combining these disciplines for the benefit of our patients. Also in this section is a chapter on a simple, safe, effective home cleanse. Part III is geared toward the practitioner. That is not to say the layperson will not derive benefit from it, but it is written in a slightly different voice and with a little more assumption that the reader has a solid grasp of at least one of the two disciplines. It offers treatment suggestions useful for practitioners from many disciplines that incorporate some Chinese medicine or Ayurveda into their practice, as well as generalized herb recommendations, acupressure guidance, and cross-discipline treatment protocols. Finally, the book includes a glossary of commonly used terms from both traditions. In this text I have done my best to incorporate the very best of both traditions and to emphasize what I judged at the time of writing to be the most useful points from both. In some places I have taken the liberty of oversimplifying some concepts or focusing on a general theme instead of delving more deeply into the material. Many details have been left out in an effort to offer a general introduction to both systems that isn't too complicated. In some places I have drawn from my own perspective and experience, rather than adhering to traditional or textual ways of explaining concepts. Some of the terminology could be presented differently or more completely, as could all of the theory and concepts. To do this would be an undertaking involving many more years of practice, contemplation, study, and writing. I invite others to jump off from here and carry this work forward. All of that being said, it is my intention that this book can help you change your life for the better, and I have constructed it in such a way as to help you enjoy the process. The common questions of practitioners, patients, and students that I have encountered are largely addressed here in an easily accessible format. This book can be a lifelong resource of basic information on both Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. It contains a vast wealth of knowledge that a person can use to help maintain his or her well-being and to help bring the body and mind into greater balance. One of India's foundational medical texts, the Charaka Samhita, states: Good health stands at the very root of virtuous acts, acquirement of wealth, gratification of desire, and final emancipation.\u00b9 May this book contribute to the improved health and well-being of you, your loved ones, and those who trust you to support them on the healing journey. PART I Foundations 1 The Magic of Ancient Medicine The history of medicine is a fascinating topic because it is our history. Mystery, horror, and magic abound when contemplating how ancient humans developed the complex systems of medicine that we have at our disposal today. Imagine being one of those ancient people, living in the Stone Age or earlier and having a tooth abscess or delivering a baby without any antibiotics or pain relief. Imagine breaking a bone or getting a laceration or a fever and being exposed to the elements the way primitive humans were. Or think of living in a village, struggling with unreliable crop yields, harsh weather conditions, and poor sanitation while loved ones were fighting off a mysterious, perhaps fatal, illness. How did ancient humans know what to do in these situations? Through trial and error, observation, experimentation, and intuition they figured it out. Just as we are, to a large extent, still figuring it out. Long before medical doctrines were put into written language, people were learning how to care for one another when something went wrong. Medicine evolved from the insight of intuitive, wise men and women, shamans, and barefoot doctors and was passed down from practitioner to apprentice over the course of millennia. Ancient peoples believed that exogenous pathogenic factors, spirits, ancestors, ghosts, and internal factors, such as mental and emotional issues, as well as causes from past lives or past actions in this life contributed to the development of a myriad of symptoms and disease processes. The ancients were able to deduce a large amount of information about how the body operated and how it related to its environment. These findings included details about the gross physical body as well as the mental, emotional, spiritual, and energetic dimensions of a living being. The ancient medical traditions viewed a human being as a whole in and of itself and inseparable from the rest of existence. Ancient humans recognized the cause and effect between where and how people lived and their good health, or lack of it. They evolved this knowledge to include a complete vision of how the universe operates, and how we operate within it. Cosmology not only included the dawn of time but also the moment of conception. At least one culture completely understood embryology, in some ways even better than we understand it today. Practitioners' areas of expertise often overlapped with that of artists, calligraphers, astrologers, palm readers, augurers, and exorcists. Many were great thinkers and scientists, able to blend their beliefs with rationality. The ancient practitioners established elaborate models of pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment strategies. They systematized medical education and specialized in certain areas. They dissected corpses, developed bodywork modalities, performed surgeries, and prescribed medications. Some of the ancient traditions are widely in use to this day, while others have left a lasting legacy of tools or approaches. Two of the more refined and widely accessible traditions come from India and China. Before examining these elaborate living traditions, let's explore some of the other forms of prehistoric medicine that evolved simultaneously in different parts of the ancient world, such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. It is probable that none of these systems of traditional medicine developed in isolation. It is difficult to know which came first when looking at Greek, Indian, and Chinese medicine. The oldest written medical texts that contain information on the humors and elements come from Greece and are dated to around 400 BCE, while the medical canons of India and China date to around 250-100 BCE. However, the systems from India and China are much more complex and well-documented. ANCIENT MEDICAL TRADITIONS OF MESOPOTAMIA AND EGYPT The Sumerians of Mesopotamia are widely recognized as being the first civilization to have developed a written language, called cuneiform. Many cuneiform tablets exist to this day, several hundred of them having to do with medicine. The ancient Sumerian system of medicine included diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Many of the treatments outlined in the tablets discuss courses of action that would still be taken to this day. Some of the ailments addressed include skin diseases, bleeding, worms and flukes, neurological disorders, and fever. Several medical papyri from ancient Egypt have been found, such as the Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus, dated to between 2100 and 1900 BCE, which focuses on gynecology and obstetrics. The Edwin Smith Papyrus dates to 1600 BCE, but there is some evidence it is only a copy of an original text that dates to 2500 BCE, when the Giza pyramids are believed to have been built. It contains a description of the brain, pulse diagnosis, and forty-eight surgical cases. It also outlines which ailments can be treated and which cannot.\u00b9 Diagnosis and prognosis are just two of the skills Egyptian physicians had in common with their Chinese and Indian counterparts. The Ebers Papyrus dates to 1555 BCE. It describes 876 remedies and 500 medicinal substances and talks about cutting into the body and cauterization. It also discusses ailments involving the stomach, liver, heart, veins, ears, tongue, and teeth and includes information on treating coughs, colds, bites, accidents, diseases of the head, burns, itching, musculoskeletal ailments, and tumors. It also provides a section on women's health and beauty preparations.\u00b2 The ancient Egyptians thought that humors were the primary cause of disease in the body. They called them air, blood, urine, mucus, semen, and feces and believed they all flowed in channels from the heart and through the body and terminated at the anus.\u00b3 These ideas are aligned with the medical theory of the ancient Greeks, as well as that of Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, which all describe a humoral system and channels that distribute energy, nutrition, food, fluids, and information. The Egyptian toolkit contained linen (adhesive/sutures), copper needles, metal shears, surgical knives, saws, probes, spatulas, hooks, forceps, cauteries, and scalpels. As one can surmise from this information, Egyptian medicine has greatly influenced our own medicine today. ANCIENT GREEK MEDICINE The roots of modern allopathic medicine are said to have originated in ancient Greek medicine, most notably with Hippocrates and Galen. Hippocrates, who lived from about 460-377 BCE, is credited with teaching that the focus in medicine should be on the person. Most people have heard of the Hippocratic oath, a variation of which is taken by modern medical doctors. It was originally a religious oath ensuring that the doctor was operating for the greater good of the community. Its values\u2014particularly, respecting one's teachers and honoring patient confidentiality\u2014persist today.*2 Greek medicine started largely as superstition. Good health was seen as a gift from the gods and ill health as a form of divine punishment. Around 400 BCE there was a paradigm shift toward reason, inquiry, and cause and effect. It was observed that lifestyle, heat, cold, and trauma all contributed to health and disease. People became concerned with diet and the treatment of disease. Hippocrates stressed the importance of nutrition and air quality. He believed we should not interfere too strongly when bringing the body back to health. He had a less is more approach. He preached removing any excess humor and allowing the body to do the rest. Hippocrates's On Ancient Medicine reads very much like a lecture on Ayurveda or Chinese medicine theory and emphasizes the role of diet in health and disease. Other interesting parallels between Greek and Eastern medicine are the concepts of depletion and repletion and the environmental factors of hot, cold, moist, and dry as being present in the body and potentially injurious to it. Bitter, salty, sweet, acidic, sour, and bland are the six tastes in Greek medicine. Ayurveda also has six; Chinese medicine has five. The Greeks believed the tastes needed to be mixed because straight tastes could cause damage. Methods of diagnosis in Greek medicine included inquiry into diet, bowel, and sleep habits, as well as pulse and facial diagnoses. Popular treatments included herbs, amulet adornment, sneezing therapy, enemas, and bloodletting. Bloodletting was used more moderately in Ancient Greece than in later years (starting in the Middle Ages and extending to as recently as the 1800s), when it was overused and harmful. Galen of Pergamum is perhaps the next most popular Greek medical practitioner and philosopher who had an influence on the roots of Western medicine. He lived from about 129 to 216 CE. Unlike previous thinkers, he recognized that humoral imbalance can also exist more specifically in the internal organs. His main interest was anatomy. Animal dissection had come into vogue, and through it he was able to identify the seven cranial nerves and heart valves. He found that arteries indeed carried blood, not air, and he tied off the laryngeal nerve in an effort to prove that the brain, not the heart, controlled the body. Galen described three systems in the body: the brain and nerves were believed to control sensation and thought, the heart and arteries were responsible for life-giving energy, and the liver and veins were in charge of nutrition and growth. These assessments are not far off. Blood and air were thought to be at their most refined when they produced pneuma, the subtle material that is the vehicle of sensation. Pneuma was synonymous with the concepts of breath, spirit, or soul and was recognized as air in motion, or an internal wind. This idea of pneuma is a very real phenomenon in Chinese medicine and Ayurveda\u2014it is called qi (pronounced chi) and prana vayu,*3 respectively\u2014and is associated with the breath, air, and sensation. In fact, it is the primary substance/force associated with vitality and wellness, as well as disease origin and formation. In addition to sharing strong parallels with Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, Greek medicine had an influence on Tibetan medicine and is also the basis of Unani, which is discussed in the next section. UNANI Unani, also known as Islamic or Arabian medicine, was largely adapted from Greek medicine in the seventh century and based heavily on the teachings of Galen, including his humoral theory. Practitioners aimed to restore the humors to the balance that existed before the imbalanced disease state. There are several branches of Unani medicine. Some doctors are experts in anatomy and physiology, some in surgery, and others in ophthalmology and internal medicine. Unani practitioners believed, and many probably still do, that astrology was/is directly related to the health and well-being of an individual. Hunain ibn Ishaq was a famous Unani practitioner from the late ninth century. He was the first to document that images entered the lens of the eye. It was previously believed that the eyes radiated light, and this light went out from the eyes and was reflected back to them from the object of vision. Cataract surgery, using suction through a needle, was practiced in the ninth and tenth centuries and was not utilized in Europe for another thousand years. Unani medicine continues to exist, particularly on the Indian subcontinent, but now includes modern methods of diagnosis, such as X-rays and ultrasound. Unani is recognized for its successful treatment of leukoderma, rheumatism, arthritis, sinusitis, jaundice, and elephantiasis. Like Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, Unani is a living tradition.\u00b9 CHINESE MEDICINE We believe Chinese medicine has its roots in prehistory, but its origin and its influence on other emerging medical systems in antiquity are unknown. Many ideas exist concerning the development of Chinese medical theory. The 1991 discovery of a 5300-year-old frozen corpse in the Alps revealed that some knowledge of acupuncture existed before it was written down, and it occurred outside of China. Known as Otzi, the iceman, he is believed to have been a farmer who died in his forties, having suffered from many ailments. His body displayed more than fifty tattoos that correspond to acupoints that would be used today to treat his health conditions.\u00b9\u00b9 This ancient Chinese information found on an Alpine man who lived thousands of years before its written documentation is just one example of the knowledge shared between cultures and the extent to which acupuncture's origins remain a mystery. Many practitioners speculate on just how such detailed awareness of the body and its subtle pathways and inner workings came about. Some believe it was the result of cause and effect. For example, if someone had a headache, ancient man may have realized that pressing certain points would help to alleviate it. However, it doesn't seem possible that this random discovery provides the whole picture of how the medicine emerged. Another theory may seem fantastical to many modern readers but is completely plausible to those involved in the esoteric sciences, internal martial arts, or meditation. That theory is that people in some kind of altered state, be it meditative or otherwise, were able to visualize the invisible pathways of energy or qi, which brings vitality to all bodily tissues. In fact, there are many ancient medical diagrams depicting these pathways. Some ancient Chinese may have told a different story: one of divine intervention. There are three primary divine beings said to be responsible for the origin of the Chinese medical system, among other things. Their date of being is unknown, as their mythical existence is part of a cultural memory from beyond the first written accounts. Fu Xi, the originator of the bagua (or pakua),*4 is responsible for elemental and yin/ yang theory, Shen Nong is credited with the development of herbalism, and Huang Di is thought to have established acupuncture and diagnostic techniques. In Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbs are two separate disciplines. The first written treatise on acupuncture dates to before the earliest written works on herbal medicine. This may suggest that acupuncture theory developed first, or it may just mean we don't have access to an earlier text on herbal medicine yet. The Nei Jing, or the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, is dated to around 250 BCE. It contains the earliest explanation we have on acupuncture, meridian theory, the five elements, and yin and yang. It is written in the format of a conversation between the divine emperor, Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor), and his court physician, Qi Bo. There are numerous translations of the two primary books in this text. Some of the information it contains is pretty straightforward if you know Chinese medical theory, but most of it is either vague or completely veiled, requiring either a full understanding of the Chinese language at the time the text was written combined with complete knowledge of Taoist thought, or the guidance of a seasoned practitioner over the course of many years. In addition to the work of these mythical figures, there are preserved writings from various doctors. Zhang Zhong Jing is one such person. He is famous for his text, the Shang Han Lun, or the Treatise on Cold Damage, which outlines the differentiation of syndromes through six stages. This poor man struggled to treat an epidemic that caused a large portion of his village, including many of his close family members, to suffer and die. He developed the theory of cold pathogens: how they enter the body, where they can manifest in the body, and how to treat them with herbs and some acupuncture. To this day Chinese medicine practitioners successfully use Zhang Zhong Jing's formulas for diseases as insignificant as the common cold to those as serious as the flu, as well as dysentery-like ailments and other life-threatening disorders. Another important contribution to the history and practice of Chinese medicine is that of the Wen Bing Xue (Warm Disease theory). The primary doctors responsible for its development and codification are Wu You Ke, Ye Tian Shi, Xue Sheng Bai, Wu Ju Tong, and Wang Meng Ying. Warm disease has a different diagnostic parameter\u2014known as the four levels\u2014than cold damage. This school of thought teaches that communicable diseases are primarily of a warm nature, or turn warm once they enter the body. What we now call pathogens were called pestilential qi by original Wen Bing practitioners, as well as by Chinese medicine practitioners today. Originators of the theory proposed that pestilential qi enters the body through the mouth and nose and wreaks a fairly predictable havoc on the system, depending upon where it lands. The four levels explain disease manifestation in terms of superficial qi levels and entry to bodily fluids and organ systems. It is a highly developed theory and still in use today. Herbal medicine is a highly sophisticated branch of the Chinese system that probably accounts for the majority of treatment protocols worldwide. Traditional Chinese medicine is a huge industry in China. Its annual revenue, just for herbal preparations, was estimated at 17 billion dollars, and that amount is expected to almost triple by 2025.\u00b9\u00b2 In 2012, Bin Li of Morgan Stanley explained that in China, even physicians trained in the West are using Chinese medicine as a first line of treatment 30 percent of the time. And 46 percent of Western doctors either use Chinese medicine instead of Western medicine, or treat using both systems. He explains that there is a growing population in China using Chinese medicine to treat chronic diseases.\u00b9\u00b3 In addition, the government of Taiwan has committed to spending millions to boost its Chinese medicine industry, including incorporating testing standards and making sure herbs are pure. In China, some hospitals have a traditional medicine wing. I remember one of my professors in Chinese medicine school talking about how one of her favorite, and more profound, experiences with the medicine while studying in China was watching the delivery of herbs to the hospital. She said huge shipments would come in vehicles like dump trucks and empty their contents of thousands of pounds of herbs at the hospital on a weekly basis. She recalled marveling at this, something we may never experience living in the West, and at seeing the medicine's profound effects on oncology patients at the hospital. Chinese medicine is also growing in popularity by leaps and bounds in the Western world. Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals purchased the Chinese medicine company Dihon Pharmaceutical Group in 2014 for over half a billion dollars.\u00b9 Herbal remedies from China may have a bad rap due to pesticides, tampering, and toxicity, but many reputable Western Chinese herb manufacturers from the United States are producing safe, clean, effective remedies for clients in the West. Chinese herbal medicine was recently a hot news item when Tu Youyou was awarded "}
