Every family member is important to us, and [our approach provides our patients with optimal results](/techniques-services/): gentle and compassionate care paired with state-of-the-art chiropractic technology. Caring for Children It's our firm belief that all children should be checked as soon after birth as possible. Why is this necessary? The rigors of childbirth alone often create spinal misalignment in the sensitive areas of the upper neck and the sacral area of the spine, creating less-than-optimal nervous system function. This often results in symptoms ranging from tummy troubles and ear infections to \"fussiness\" and nursing difficulties. Newborns and children respond to gentle chiropractic care quickly and effectively. It's exciting to see the difference that this type of care can make in the health potential of a child, and one of the greatest gifts that a parent can bestow upon their little one. Gentle chiropractic care can provide measurable benefits for the following conditions: - ADD/ADHD - Allergies - Anxiety/Depression - Autism Spectrum Disorder - Bed-wetting - Colic - Constipation - Ear infections - Flat head - Spitting up - Sleeping through the night Ongoing research has demonstrated that the rise of autism spectrum disorder, ADD, ADHD, sensory processing disorders, learning disabilities, allergies and gut issues are linked to a poorly functioning nervous system aggravated by other causative factors, such as: - Antibiotics and added hormones in our food supply - Auto-immune reactions (such as sensitivity to dairy, grains or vaccine ingredients) - Chemical additives and preservatives in our food supply - Electronic toxicity and interference (phones, video games, computers) - Environmental toxins - Lack of outdoor exercise and fitness - Poor diet Many children, due to spinal misalignment, develop a nervous system that's \"sympathetic-dominant,\" meaning that their nervous system is always in high gear. Add one, two or even three of the above factors to the mix, and you've created a \"perfect storm\" of preventable health issues. This is where pediatric chiropractic excels. Our scientifically-based care is primarily designed to balance, calm, reorganize, reintegrate and restructure your child's autonomic nervous system, resulting in wellness and optimal function. Dr. Cassidie is also a member of the nationwide EPIC pediatric group, which shares and disseminates information on the specific challenges and needs of children.
