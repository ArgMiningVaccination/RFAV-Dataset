Our Immune Boost program is designed to help you maintain a robust immune system through a comprehensive combination of Acupuncture and Physician-grade Supplements specifically formulated for immune health. Our Immune Boost Program Highlights Increases T Cells Studies show regular acupuncture treatments can actually increase the number of T cells the body produces. T cells destroy harmful bacteria and viruses in the body. The amazing part is the increased cellular response lasts for several days after treatment. Thus, receiving regular acupuncture treatments can actually prevent the body from getting sick. Returns Your Body To Homeostasis Acupuncture taps into the body's ability to heal itself, returning the body back to homeostasis. When Acupuncture balances your body, your immune system skyrockets. Patients who were previously consistently ill (allergies, colds, flu, etc) tell us that they have yet to feel sick since starting treatments. Fight Off Pathogens Acupuncture regulates immune function while speeding up the healing of infection and normalizing the body's immune response. A boosted immune system can also help fight off pathogens. Are you ready to boost your immune system? Schedule A Consultation Come Visit Us Sonoma Acupuncture Integrative Health 141 N.
