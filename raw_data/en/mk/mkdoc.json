And there is no more transformative a tool than the practices of self-compassion. We come together in a growing community to \"turn the wheel of healing\" and insight for ourselves, one another, and for the universe itself. The immersion will include silent sitting and walking meditations, yin yoga, dharma talks, one-one meetings with the teacher, and group sharing - as well as time to rest, eat, and soak it all in. Much of the event will be held in intentional silence, with the exception of several periods for group sharing and connection. ______________________________________________________ Immersions are guided by Justin Michelson, and are a synergy of: - the Insight Meditation tradition and the Brahmaviharas (Theravada Buddhism) - Internal Family Systems Theory - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MSBR) Over the years, we've realized the value of group integration/reflection/connection after these powerful experiences. However, scheduling and location have always proved challenging for everyone. Hence, we've decided to begin pre-scheduling an integration session during the following week on Zoom. For this immersion, the Zoom-based Integration Session will be on Wednesday October 4th at 6:30pm (link in registration email). ______________________________________________________ EQUITY AND SAFETY: We are aware that this group is led and often attended primarily by people who occupy identities of privilege; often predominantly white, settler (people who are not indigenous to the lands they live upon) and cisgender (people whose gender corresponds with the sex they were assigned at birth). We want to invite shared responsibility for cultivating and maintaining a safe(r), inclusive, and equitable space for all and ask each of you (especially white and cisgender folk) to engage in any preparation needed for you to do to show up in practice with people occupying other identities. Here are two introductory resources on white fragility and gender diversity: ______________________________________________________ FEES and DONATIONS: (work trade and scholarships available below) 1.5 days of Dharma, organic meals, overnight accommodations, personalized guidance, follow up session, and more. 1) Retreat Fee: Overnight, $100 - $200 $100 - Subsidized Donation or BIPOC Donation $150 - Sustaining Donation $200 - Supporting Donation Day-Long, $50 - $100 $50 - Subsidized Donation or BIPOC DONATION $75 - Sustaining Donation $100 - Supporting Donation *The \"retreat fee\" is designed to approximate the costs of administration, permitting, food, insurance, rent, outreach, supplies, movement-teachers, set-up/clean-up, etc. It's not designed to offer the main teacher a living wage for preparing teachings, holding the retreat container, meeting with participants, follow up, or preparing for future offerings. Nor is it designed to help support our 501c3 non-profit in sustaining or expanding its reach and services. Hence, there is an additional practice opportunity of donating to those ends. **Payment plans available (inquire within) 2) DANA - donation to Teacher and 501c3 mission. \"Dana\" is the Pali word for generosity and, in this context, operates as a donation to the Teacher and 501c3 mission. It is offered at the end of the retreat via cash/check to Eugene Insight Meditation Center or \"EIMC\". Paypal/Venmo are also options (at eugeneinsight@gmail.com and @eugene-insight). *Offering mindfulness teachings on a donation basis comes from the tradition of Insight Meditation. It keeps these powerful mindfulness practices accessible, honest, and communal. However, it only works if attendees incline their hearts to understand and participate in it. We invite you to consider this as a spiritual practice of generosity and loving-kindness. This offering supports the livelihood of the teacher, the work of the 501c3 non profit, and keeps the \"wheel of the dharma\" turning for all beings. **People often ask how much is appropriate. The guideline is to offer the teacher what feels generous to you while also within your financial means. However, when pressed for an amount, we often suggest $50-100 for the full overnight retreat. But sincerely, amount is welcomed. Thank you. And let us know if you have any questions. _________ REGISTRATION: There are limited spaces on the retreat.

Justin led us through various mindfulness exercises while also encouraging each of us to forge our own unique path of internal reflection and outward curiosity. I felt my energy take a huge leap forward during the retreat. Overall the experience was wonderful; I am definitely interested in a return experience this year!\" - Past Participant \"Though brief, the weekend felt spacious thanks to the flexibility afforded to us - we could move around as needed, tend to our own vital needs, and one on one support was offered by both a licensed mental health provider and Justin. Along with delicious, nutritiously dense, plant-based food, we were well-nourished by a gentle yoga practice that I felt was integral to the experience as well and enabled us to go deeper into practice. Perhaps most compelling for me was the repeated invitation to allow emotions of sadness and grief to emerge as felt comfortable, and to hold these with care as we cultivated a \"field of care\". Coming out of the retreat, we received guidance to take it slow and gentle with ourselves - I found myself feeling more like my true self, having a greater stress tolerance, feeling more loving and understanding towards all beings, feeling far more connected to nature, and experiencing more clarity in general. All in all, I believe we all need more of \"this\" in our lives given the culture we live in and to give each of our broken hearts a chance, and as Justin so aptly put it, that I will paraphrase here, healing occurs naturally when we allow the space for it to - we don't have to try or force anything - it simply happens in the room we make for it. I urge each of us to please make room - and to do so here with Justin would be a gift to yourself, your loved ones, the rest of us, and the planet. Many thanks.\" - Past Participant ______________________________________________________ LOCATION: Mandala Sanctuary, 10 minutes south of Eugene, OR.

Your essence has always been that first vulnerability of being found, of being heard and of being seen, and from the very beginning the one who has always needed, and been given, so much invisible help. This is how you were when you first came into the world, this is how you are now, all unawares, in your new body and your new life, this is the raw vulnerability of your every day, and this is how you will want to be, and be remembered, when you leave the world. ____________________________________________________ HOSTS: Nature's Heart LLC has merged with Eugene Insight Meditation Center 501c3.
