The physician's representative informed AA that Walgreens haddispensed the wrong medication.

Been charged, arrested or convicted of afelony ormisdemeanor in any state?2. Been the subject of an administrative action whethercompleted or pending in any state?3. Had your license subjected to any discipline for violation ofpharmacy or drug laws in any state?To the first question Respondent Phillips answered, 'no.,To the second question Respondent Phillips answered 'yes' and3'no' and then wrote, 'Not since last renewal.' To the thirdquestion Respondent Phillips answered 'no.' In theadministrative action section of the renewal applicationRespondent Phillips wrote, 'CA' and in the criminal actionsection she wrote 'none.\"On April 6, 2009, Respondent Phillips entered into aStipulated Settlement and Disciplinary Order, File No. 09-2004-161866, with the Medical Board of California. On December21, 2009, Respondent Phillips entered into an Agreed Orderwith the New Mexico Medical Board. On December 23, 2009,the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners filed aformalcomplaint against Respondent Phillips that is still pending.None of these administrative actions were disclosed byRespondent Phillips as is required by the renewal application.(Exh. 18)10. In aFebruary 2, 2011, Stipulation and Order by the Nevada State Board ofPharmacy respondent admitted that she provided false information on her renewal applicationby failing to disclose the administrative actions taken against her and the administrativeaction that was still pending against her. As aresult of the stipulated settlement respondent'sControlled Substance Registration and DEA Registration were cancelled, effective March 1,2011; however, respondent was allowed to apply for anew controlled substance registrationreflecting her disciplinary actions. That registration was revoked, the revocation was stayedand respondent was placed on probation until February 2, 2013 (Exh. 18)New Mexico Medical Board Actions Against Respondent11. Based on the April 6, 2009, California discipline, the New Mexico Boardissued an \"Agreed Order.\" The Order, which respondent signed on November 18, 2009,placed respondent on probation in New Mexico \"until she has successfully completed theterms and conditions set forth in the California Medical Board Order and her license has beenfully restored in that state.\" (Exh. 21) One of the conditions of the New Mexico probationorder was that respondent \"will provide quarterly affidavits to the Board attesting to hercompliance with the terms set forth in this Agreed Order.\"12. On August 26, 2011, the New Mexico Board filed aNotice of ContemplatedAction (an Accusation) against respondent. On September 2, 2011, the New Mexico Boardamended the Accusation. The Amended Accusation alleged the following:A. In December 2009 the Board approved an Agreed Orderwith Respondent which provided, in part, that Respondent4wouldprovidequarterly It was explained to respondent during thehearing that she was bound by the findings and the discipline imposed by Nevada and NewMexico and could not collaterally attack those determinations in this action. (See Arneson v.Fox (1980) 28 Cal.3d 440, 449.)25. Based on respondent's equivocations and misrepresentations to the court in thepresent action, and her seeming inability to distinguish truth from fiction, respondent'stestimony was completely discounted. LEGAL CONCLUSIONS1. California Business and Professions Code section 2303 provides:The revocation, suspension, or other discipline, restriction, orlimitation imposed by another state upon alicense or certificate topractice medicine issued by that state, or the revocation,suspension, or restriction of the authority to practice medicine byany agency of the federal government, that would have beengrounds for discipline in California of alicensee under thischapter, shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action forunprofessional conduct against the licensee of this state.2. California Business and Professions Code section 2261 provides that thefollowing constitutes unprofessional conduct in California: \"Knowingly making or signing anycertificate or other document directly or indirectly related to the practice of medicine orpodiatry which falsely represents the existence or nonexistence of astate of facts.\"3. Causes for discipline exist pursuant to California Business and Professions Codesections 2305 and 2261 for each individual instance which formed the bases for respondent'sNevada Medical Board, Nevada Pharmacy Board and New Mexico Medical Board disciplines.4. Causes for discipline exist pursuant to California Business and Professions Codesection 2305 for each of respondent's false answers on her March 30, 2011, and July 10, 2011,California quarterly probation reports.5. Causes for revocation of respondent's probation exist based on respondent'sfailure to comport with condition 8of her probation.6. The grant of probation by aregulatory agency is an act of grace. One who isplaced on probation should strictly adhere to the terms and conditions of the probation and notplay fast and loose with the conditions. Respondent's conduct in California, Nevada and NewMexico, when viewed individually and cumulatively reveal that respondent did not appreciatethe act of grace that was bestowed upon her by any of the jurisdictions.
