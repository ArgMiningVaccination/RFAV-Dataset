RESPONSE : Q6 Attachment - Foster Children.xlsx (a) The information that CFSA and OSSE currently share or plan to share regarding the education of students in foster care. CFSA and OSSE collaborate in various ways to ensure students in foster care receive their education. The following are the various collaborative activities led by the agencies: CFSA, DCPS, OSSE Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). OSSE, the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), and CFSA entered into an MOA to address specialized education services for children and youth placed in out of state placements by CFSA. The MOA clarifies each participating agency's responsibility for District of Columbia wards rec eiving specialized educational services while placed and attending schools in other jurisdictions. It is the intent of this agreement to ensure that school -aged children receiving specialized educational services receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) and are monitored accordingly under federal and local laws and regulations. ESSA Foster Care Provision. With the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (\"ESEA\"), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (\"ESSA\") on Dec. 10, 2015, OSSE partnered with CFSA to FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 9 create practical, comprehensive guidance to facilitate an LEA's ability to meet new requirements. This non -regulatory guidance was initially sent to all LEA Leaders on 11/28/2016 and it is available here: OSSE CFSA Foster Care - Educational Continuity Non -regulatory Guidance . It has been posted on OSSE's website and shared with foste r care points of contact. OSSE will also published a list of LEA Foster Care Points o f Contact to its website.

FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 10 CFSA and OSSE have collaborated in various ways to ensure students in foster care receive their e ducation. The following are the various collaborative activities led by the agencies: CFSA, Agreement (MOA): OSSE, DCPS and CFSA entered into an MOA to address specialized education services for children and youth placed in out of state placements by CFSA. The MOA clarifies each participating agency's responsibility for District of Columbia wards receivi ng specialized educational services while placed and attending schools in other jurisdictions. It is the intent of this agreement to ensure that school -aged children receiving specialized educational services receive free appropriate public education (FAPE ) and are monitored accordingly under federal and local laws and regulations. Prince George's County, OSSE, CFSA MOA: In May 2015, an MOA was entered by OSSE, CFSA, and Prince George's County Board of Education to coordinate services and to implement a pro cess for sharing information about the educational achievement and needs of CFSA's foster children/PGCPS' students. This MOA clarifies responsibilities for sharing student records including , but not limited to , grades and attendance. (h) Any and all informati on OSSE has about success or lack of success with the implementation of agreements and cooperation and source of funding of needed school stability transportation for children in foster care under the new provisions in ESSA, described by LEA. Since the im plementation of the new provision, there have been no disputes brought to OSSE's attention regarding the transportation of youth to their school of origin. CFSA also continues to offer assistance for school stability and ensures that students are being transported when needed. To our knowledge, once a best interest decision is made by the student's child and family team (which includes school staff), the student attends the school and is being transported, if needed. OSSE collaborated with CFSA to create a manageable approach to funding and coordinating transportation, whereby CFSA will fund the majority of transportation costs. LEAs are able to use some federal funding and are encouraged to use their UPSFF local at -risk funding to further support their por tion of costs. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 11 Q7: Provide student mobility rates at the state, LEA, and school levels for all students : A. Entries by month B. Exits by month RESPONSE : Q7 Attachment - Mid-year Student Mobility SY18 -19.xlsx The mobility metric on the DC School Report Card captures each individual entry and exit for all students enrolled at any point during the 2018 -19 school year and uses the count of students enrolled on the Enrollment Audit Count Day as the starting referen ce point to understand student movement throughout the year. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 12 Q8: The following questions are regarding nonresidency : (a) How many nonresidency tips did OSSE receive in FY19 and FY20? (b) How many nonresidency tips did OSSE investigate in FY19 and FY20 by sector? (c) How many cases were substantiated in FY18 by sector and what were the actions to remediate the situation? (d) Describe OSSE's efforts to strengthen its nonresidency program in FY19 and FY20 ? (e) How is OSSE ensuring each family receives adequate due process and no tice? RESPONSE: (a) How many residency fraud tips did OSSE receive in FY19 and FY20? Investigations of non -residency allegations can be initiated by any person submitting a tip through the OSSE tip hotline, both online and via telephone, through partner agencies investigating individuals for other fraud matters (e.g., Medicaid fraud), by s haring complaints received from the public relating to student residency, and by other mediums such as the mail, email, or in -person communications with OSSE's Office of Enrollment & Residency. The overall number of tips received by OSSE is often much grea ter than the number of cases investigated by OSSE. This is primarily due to duplicate tips (e.g. a tip for the same family submitted multiple times) or tips submitted without sufficient information for OSSE to investigate. Please note that OSSE tracks cas es on a school year (SY) rather than fiscal year (FY) basis and the table below reflects that practice. School Year Tips Received SY18 -19 7/1/2018 - 6/30/2019 357 SY19 -20 to date 7/1/2019 - 12/30/2019 120 (b) How many residency fraud cases did OSSE investigate in FY19 and FY20 by sector? Upon receiving a tip, OSSE merges duplicate tips or sibling tips and then reviews for sufficiency of information provided. For example, some tips come in without sufficient information to begin an investigatio n (e.g., providing a first name but no last name). If a tip has sufficient information to move forward, the tip will become a case and be assigned a case number. In addition, investigation referrals can also come from the Enrollment Audit. Instances where a student's residency was not verified through the full audit process is examined by investigators within OSSE's Office of Enrollment and Residency. OSSE will seek to verify the student's residency through its established interagency data feeds. If OSSE w as not able to verify the student's residency status, the Audit referral will become a case and assigned a case number. The table below provides the number of cases OSSE is currently investigating or has investigated to date. A single case involving relat ed students can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case if the students are attending schools in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of cases in both sectors. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 13 School Year DC Public Schools Cases Public Charter Schools Cases SY18 -19 7/1/2018 - 6/30/2019 219 140 SY19 -20 to date 7/1/2019 - 12/30/2019 72 51 (c) How many residency fraud cases were substantiated in FY19 by sector and what were the actions to remediate the situation? OSSE's non -residency investigations typically begin with a submitted tip or finding from the annual enrollment audit. Referrals from the annual enrollment audit and tips with sufficient information to identify the student are turned into cases and assigned an investigator. These cases are considered 'open' until a determination of resident has been made, or, in the case of a potential non -resident, substantiated after all notifications and administrative proceedings have concluded. For cases whe re a student is initially determined to be a non -resident, OSSE will issue a Finding of Non -residency to the family. The family can either contest or accept the finding. If the family accepts, the finding becomes final and substantiated and the parties ent er into an agreement for tuition. OSSE will notify the LEA that the student is a non -resident and ineligible to remain enrolled if the original enrollment was not in compliance. Continued enrollment at the LEA may require re -application, payment of owed tu ition, and completion of a valid tuition agreement. If the family contests the Finding of Non -residency, OSSE will file the request for an appeal at the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) and proceed with a mediation and continue with a hearing if th e mediation is unsuccessful. The outcome at OAH will either be a concession from the family substantiating the finding of non -residency, a reversal of OSSE's initial finding of non-residency and a closing of the case, or a substantiation of its finding of non-residency through an OAH judgement. All findings of non -residency are referred to the appropriate authorities, which may be the Office of the Attorney General, the Inspector General, and where a DC government employee is involved, the Board of Ethics and Government Accountability (BEGA). The prosecution of fraud, the pursuit of a False Claims Act case, or other civil remedies lies with the Office of the Attorney General or the United States Attorney. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 14 SY18 -19 SY19 -20 to date DCPS PCS Total7 DCPS PCS Total7 Total Cases (Investigation Initiated) 219 140 357 67 48 112 Open OSSE in process1 127 88 213 OAH2 2 2 Closed Residency verified during investigation3 90 34 124 5 3 8 Residency determined through Administrative Review4 Substantiated (Final Agency Decision) Concede5 Uncontested6 1 9 10 OAH decision7 Withdrawn8 1 7 8 1Open - OSSE in process . These cases are cases that OSSE is currently still investigating. 2Open - OAH : These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding and the family appealed the finding. When appealed, these cases are referred to OAH. These cases will continue through the administrative process with the OAH for formal mediation and hearing. 3Close d - Residency verified during investigation: These cases were investigated and student determined to be eligible to attend as a resident. 4Closed - Residency determined through Administrative Review: these cases were initially determined to be non -resident s but the determination was changed through the OAH mediation and hearing process. 5Substantiated - Concede: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non -Residency and the family conceded they were non - residents. 6Substantiated - Uncontes ted: These cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding of Non -Residency and the family failed to contest the finding within the provided timeframe. Because they did not contest the finding in the notice, OSSE's initial determination b ecame the final decision and these families are non -residents. If the students were still enrolled, these students were subsequently unenrolled from school. They were also issued tuition payment agreements for the relevant school year(s). 7Substantiated - OAH Decision: Thes e cases are where OSSE issued a Notice of Finding and the family appealed the finding. Neither OSSE nor the family came to an agreement during the mediation process and the case was decided through a formal hearing. 8Withdrawn: These cases involve students enrolled for very short periods of time and withdrew before an investigation could be conducted. *A single case involving related students can be counted as both a DC Public Schools case and a Public Charter Schools case i f the students are attending scho ols in both sectors. This crossover is why a total case count is not always the sum of cases in both sectors. (d) Describe OSSE's efforts to strengthen its residency fraud program in FY19 and FY20 ? OSSE is committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washington, DC residents This requires a robust system of compliance and enforcement to ensure that public schools in the District, including DC Public Schools (DCPS) an d public charter schools, are available, first and foremost, to bona fide residents of the District. In FY19, OSSE published its first Office of Enrollment and Residency Handbook and began a monitoring program to ensure LEA compliance with records retent ion policies. The handbook, compiled all relevant policies and guidance into a single location for use by LEAs and other District agencies. This document, to be updated regularly, provides additional transparency to the policies guiding enrollment and resi dency. The monitoring program, separate from the yearly enrollment audit, focuses on LEAs that have had issues with residency document retention in the FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 15 past. OSSE staff visit LEAs, review LEA record retention protocols and provide corrective action plans w hen necessary. For tuition collection, OSSE mandated electronic agreements for all tuition -paying non -resident students. This new process allowed for quicker processing of agreements and ensured that all payments and agreements were made prior to the sta rt of school. OSSE also established a partnership with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to ensure clear enforcement of significantly delinquent payments through referral to their Central Collections Unit. Finally, OSSE continued its public inform ation campaign to assist District residents with understanding the enrollment and residency process by providing materials at EdFEST, updating the DC residency verification form, and continuing an outreach campaign that notifies the general public on how t o report potential non -residents. OSSE expanded its outreach campaign to include digital ads that not only targeted District residents, but also residents in surrounding counties. The enrollment and residency process must balance ease for families and LE As and support for our most vulnerable families, with enforcing District laws and regulations that ensure residents have access to a free, public education. OSSE remains committed to ensuring District schools remain accessible first and foremost to Washing ton, DC residents. We will continue to take steps to improve our practice, and look forward to working with schools, families, and the community to further improve our residency efforts. (f) How is OSSE ensuring each family receives adequate due process and notice? When OSSE conducts a residency investigation, if it is not clear from the initial review of records that the student is a DC resident, and prior to issuing a determination of non -residency, OSSE contacts the family to gather additional informa tion. An OSSE investigator will set up a time either over the phone or in -person to talk with the enrolling person about any questions OSSE has regarding the persons residency claim. This also allows the family to help the investigation understand complex and unique circumstances that some of our District resident's experience. In some cases, the additional information and context provided by a family does not verify District residency, and in those cases, OSSE will make a determination that the student i s not a resident of the District. When a determination of non -residency is made, a detailed notice letter is sent to the parent, guardian, other primary caregiver or adult student by mail and email, if known. The detailed notice letter helps families under stand why OSSE's investigation led to a finding of non -residency and explains the next steps and timeline for the administrative review process. Specifically, the detailed notice letter includes the following information: The basis of the non -resident finding; An option to request an administrative review within 10 business days; FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 16 An explanation that the student may remain enrolled until a final administrative decision is made; An explanation that if a request for administrative review is not received within 10 business days, then the non -resident finding will be the final administrative decision; and An explanation of the tuition owed in the event of a final administrative decision of non - residency and that the tuition is prorated on the time the stude nt spent enrolled in a DC public school as a non -resident If an administrative review is requested, OSSE will refer the request for review to the Office of Administrative Hearings. The purpose of administrative review is provide families with an additiona l opportunity to tell their story and present evidence that proves they are a resident. First, OAH will schedule a mediation session between the two parties. In mediation, a specially - trained neutral mediator meets with the parties (the family and OSSE) an d assists them to state their positions and to explore options to resolve the case without going to an actual evidentiary hearing. The mediator helps the parties to reach a mutually acceptable settlement of the case. All judges are qualified to mediate any case before the Office of Administrative Hearings. If, during mediation, OSSE agrees that the documents and information presented in mediation are sufficient to establish a student's status as a District resident, OSSE will withdraw the finding of non -residency and take no further action. If a family concedes that a student is not a resident, the non -residency finding becomes final and the parties will enter into a settlement agreement for tuition. If mediation is not successful, the matter will proceed to a full evidentiary hearing where the Administrative Law Judge will issue a final decision, which will be the final administrative decision of OSSE. The final decision that is provided by the judge will also include the statement of appeal rights. As sta ted in the appeal rights, if a party wishes to contest the decision of the judge, they have 30 calendar days from the date the decision was issued to file an appeal to the DC Superior Court.

[NOTE: Please provide this information in Excel format.] RESPONSE: Q9 Attachment 1 - Discipline Data - all.xlsx Q9 Attachment 2 - Discipline Data - student groups.xlsx Beginning in the 2015 -16 school year, the Pre -K Student Discipline Act of 2015 (D.C. Law 21 - 12; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38 -236) requires OSSE to publicly report on the state of suspensions and expulsions in the District. In its third year of implementation, the school discipline report is based on data submitted by LEAs and Pre -K Enhancement community -based organizations (CBOs) from the preceding school year. This will be published on OSSE's website in winter 2020. The DC School Report Card reports information about discipline and school safety at public schools in DC, in accordance with the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Data collec tion. This information includes suspensions, expulsions, school related arrests, reported incidents of violence, bullying and harassment. The data is also disaggregated by student group. OSSE released the second DC School Report Card on in November and th e discipline data for SY 18 -19 was made available to the public at that time. School report card pages allow the user to compare school data with the DC average as well as to explore data across multiple years; users can also view for different student gro ups in the 2017 -18 and 2018 -19 school years. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 18 The DC Council passed the Student Fair Access to School Amendment Act of 2018 (D.C. Law 22-157; D.C Code \u00a738 -236, et. seq .) (the \"Act\"). In the 2018 -19 school year, there were newly required data elements inclu ded in the discipline collection template. The newly required data elements and reporting requirements went into effect on October 1, 2018 . Guidance and documentation were released for the 2019 -20 school year in September 2019.

At the same time, OSSE is committed to facilitating access to and use of education data so education stakeholders have high -quality information for decision making, as described in OSSE's strategic plan. External organizations and government agencies may request data from OSSE using its online data request portal. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law about the privacy of, and access to, student education records. FERPA and its implementing regulations apply to educational agencies and institutions, which includes any elementary, sec ondary, or postsecondary institution that receives U.S. Department of Education (USED) funding or any entity authorized to direct and control elementary, secondary, or postsecondary institutions. FERPA applies to state education agencies (SEAs) such as OSS E, in their role as custodians of education records from other institutions. Under FERPA, education records may not be disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of the parent or adult student, unless the particular disclosure is author ized under an exception to FERPA's parental consent requirement. OSSE, as the SEA, generally does not generate or create student -level data. Instead, OSSE collects and stores data from schools and LEAs. As a result, OSSE is subject to the \"re - disclosure \" provisions of FERPA. FERPA allows OSSE to re -disclose student -level data to third parties without parental consent under several exceptions. Most frequently, OSSE shares FERPA data under the exceptions for: Audit/evaluation (including enforcement/compli ance) (also commonly referred to as \"authorized representative\") ; and Research studies FERPA does not apply to all data OSSE collects, receives, holds and shares. It is OSSE's policy and a best practice to have a written agreement whenever sharing person ally identifiable information, even if FERPA does not apply. The table below describes OSSE's current research data agreements with governmental and non - governmental entities.

RESPONSE: OSSE's policies and procedures to protect student data OSSE is committed to protecting student privacy and takes its responsibilities as the state education agency under local and federal privacy laws seriously. At the same time, OSSE is committed to facilitating access to and use of education data so that education stakeholders have high-quality information for deci sion-making. To meet both of these goals, OSSE has taken a robust approach to codifying policies and procedures to ensure the protection of student information, and to build the agency's capacity around data privacy, security, and confidentiality. Dedic ating resources and supporting ongoing efforts OSSE has a data governance and privacy team within the Division of Data, Assessment, and Research that is charged with overseeing policies, procedures, and structures that govern and protect student data. To meet this charge, the data governance and privacy team collaborates with OSSE's Office of General Counsel to develop policies and ensure compliance. Additionally, data sharing agreements are critical legal vehicles needed to share student information with third parties, while holding them accountable for keeping that information private, secure, and confidential. OSSE ensures that all contracts and data sharing agreements comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and include additional protections for sensitive data. OSSE has created an internal tracking system for data sharing agreements and been featured nationally for this work in accordance with FERPA . OSSE requires all third parties that receive personal identifiable in formation (PII) to complete a data destruction form that describes how the data received from OSSE has been destroyed, and third parties are required to certify that the destruction occurred after the data sharing agreement has ended. Continually enhancin g security practices and protocols Security is the physical means of protecting sensitive information, many of which are technical, systems -based, and ensure that only authorized users have access. OSSE's data systems that house student -level data are all credential -based. Users of OSSE's data systems must have LEA - specific email addresses, receive written approval from the LEA for access, and participate in training before receiving access. In addition, OSSE's data systems tie student -level data to the re sponsible LEA and school. OSSE restricts each LEA user's view of the data by allowing the user only to view records where the student's LEA ID and/or school ID matches the LEA user's LEA ID and/or school ID, depending on the level of access of the user. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 27 All student -level data entering OSSE's data systems are subject to system data quality standards. During the system or application development cycle, data must be reviewed, tested, and approved by multiple subject matter and technical experts. Once fully v etted internally with consultation with the Assistant Superintendent for Data and Research and the Deputy Superintendent , the applications must then be approved by the agency's Chief Information Officer . In its data systems, OSSE protects student -level data through multiple layers of security and quality assurance checks. Common protocols used include HTTPS, SSL, Active Directory Authentication, Role Based Access, Password Strength Minimums, and Encryption Algorithms. Finally, OSSE conducts audits twice a year in which it requires all users of two (2) of its most - used systems, the SLED system and the SEDS, to re -certify access by verifying their account and confirming they still require access. If a user is unresponsive, the account is automatically deactivated. Moreover, OSSE requires all external users to take three (3) actions before they can access data in the SLED warehouse: Participate in mandatory training on effective usage and privacy. Sign a SLED data privacy policy that defines PII, emphasizes best practices to protect sensitive data, and provides guidelines to protect SLED user accounts. Acknowledge user access agreements every time they log in. OSSE has expanded this process to include oth er core student data systems and applications that provide access to student -level data. Training staff on protecting student data As cited in a recent report by the National Association of State Boards of Education , human error is a factor in 95 percent of all data security incidents. To address this, OSSE has continued to implement its data privacy training policy that includes two (2) primary components: Data Privacy Training o All new employees and on -site contractors at OSSE must complete data privacy training within 30 days of their start date. o All current employees and on -site contractors must complete data privacy training once every fiscal year. Non-Disclosure Agreement o All new employees and on -site contractors at OSSE must sign a data non -disclosure agreement upon start with the organization. o OSSE's human resources team must ensure all current employees and on -site contractors have a non-disclosure agreement on file. In consultation with national experts, OSSE has developed a robust training curriculum on the basics of student privacy that is used with all employees annually and has been shared with LEAs and other states. In 2018, OSS E released an online data privacy training module that FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 28 included real life examples of data incidents and required all staff to complete a data privacy quiz upon completion. Regarding non -disclosure agreements (NDAs), all current employees and on -site cont ractors signed and returned NDAs, affirming their commitment to protecting confidential information. OSSE's Human Resources Division is required to ensure all current employees and on -site contractors have a non -disclosure agreement on file. OSSE's polici es and procedures to respond to data and FOIA requests OSSE has protocols in place for sharing of data, whether through parent and student requests for a student's educational record under FERPA, requests for student -level data by external agencies and ins titutions, agency releases, and releases of records through the FOIA process. General data requests The OSSE Data Request Portal ( http://osse.dc.gov/service/osse -data-request -form ) serves as a centralized intake and tracking system for all requesters. In general, regardless of the type of request or requester, data request fulfillments go through a minimum of three (3) stages of quality assurance and security checks, including: Peer revie w in OSSE's Division of Data, Assessment and Research (DAR), where analysts review data pulled together by other analysts and ensure it meets the relevant standards, requirements, and limitations; Review and approval from DAR's Director of Data Governance and Assistant Superintendent, where data are checked for proper suppression and alignment with data sharing agreement(s); and Final approval from the Superintendent. Data is always transferred in the most secure means possible, primarily using a secure fi le transfer site. In 2018, OSSE transitioned from use of a secure file transfer server to the use of Box.com for data transfers. Box.com provides the same securities that the previous secure file transfer server provided, but includes additional access r oles and automatic data file removal after a preset number of days. OSSE continue to use Box.com for secure data transfers. Data requests for student records Under FERPA, parents and adult students have rights to request their child's education records and their own, whether for themselves or for a third party (such as an attorney). These requests are most often and appropriately directed to schools, so OSSE redirects requesters to LEAs as they are the original source of the information shared with OSSE. If LEAs are unable to respond to the request, OSSE will periodically receive and fulfill student records requests. These requests are also entered and tracked in OSSE's data request portal and handled by a designated staff person in DAR. Prior to receiving data, requestors are required to verify their identity in -person to ensure the person is entitled to this informat ion. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 29 Data requests for research and evaluation OSSE staff ensures that data requests that include a student's personally identifiable information (or other confidential information) require signed data sharing agreements outlining legal responsibilities for requesters and OSSE regarding data sharing, use, re - disclosure, protections, and destruction. Entities must agree to written data sharing agreements and demonstrate compliance with these agreements. If they do not, an entity may be subject to compliance monitoring and required corrective actions. Data sharing under FERPA is permissive, not mandatory; FERPA provides discretion t o the state education agency with regard whether to prohibit non -compliant entities from receiving data. The US Department of Education has enforcement authority and may also unilaterally impose 5 -year ban on data sharing with non-compliant entities. See 20 U.S. Code \u00a71232g(b)(4)(B) and 34 CFR 99.67 . Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests OSSE's Office of the General Counsel ensures compliance with the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2 -531-540) statute and has deve loped a system for processing FOIA requests that increase transparency, communication, and timeliness while safeguarding student data. This system encompasses robust coordination between the agency FOIA officer and points of contact within OSSE divisions t o identify and gather responsive documents in a timely manner. The FOIA officer is responsible for review and redaction of all responsive records in compliance with the D.C. FOIA statute to ensure protection of student information. Each FOIA request is sub ject to a four -tier review process including: initial review and redaction by the FOIA officer, legal sufficiency review by the General Counsel, technical security check by the Chief Information Officer , and final review by the programmatic lead in the rel evant OSSE division. OSSE has adopted the FOIAXPress tool that allows for centralized submission and tracking of all FOIA requests. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 30 Q13: Provide the PARCC scores for each DCPS and public charter school disaggregated by grade and by subgroup (race/ethnicity , at-risk, gender, special education and ELL status) for 201 8. RESPONSE : Q13 Attachment - PARCC and MSAA Achievement Results.xlsx FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 31 Q14: Provide the findings from the testing integrity investigations for SY 17-18 and the status of the investigation reports for SY 18-19. RESPONSE : Documentation on OSSE's test security and integrity processes, requirements, and templates as well as the test security investigations process can be found on OSSE's website at: https://osse.dc.gov/service/test -security -and-incident -forms . Following the integrity investigations of SY17 -18, there were no substantiated findings that resulted in official OSSE sanctions. OSSE is currently in the process of completing the test integrity investigations for SY18 -19. OSSE is charged with analyzing statewide assessment administration to ensure the validity and reliability of assessment results. As part of the annual review of state assessment results, OSSE reviewed data forensics analysis, incident reports, monitoring reports, anonymous tips, and administrative practices. OSSE investigated schools with test integrity flags that could indicate the possibility t hat irregularities or security incidents occurred in the administration of state assessments. Final determinations will be sent to LEAs, after which LEAs may participate in any relevant appeals or requests for reconsideration. OSSE will post these results at the conclusion of that process. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 32 Early Learning Q15: Please describe how OSSE is utilizing the Preschool Development Grant Birth through Five (PDG B -5). RESPONSE : OSSE received $10.6 million under the federal Preschool Development Grant, Birth to Five on August 23, 2018. This funding, administered by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) on behalf of the District, is being used to strengthen the District's early care and education mixed delivery system for children birth through age five (B -5) and their families . The aim of the investment is to strengthen our existing infrastructure of programs with a targeted focus on children experiencing homel essness, children with special needs, children in foster care and/or children in families with very low incomes who are especially vulnerable. The PDG funded work has centered around five areas of work and an evaluation : the District - wide needs assessme nt, District -wide strategic plan, maximizing parental choice and knowledge, sharing best practices and improving quality. Collectively, these efforts will improve the quality of early learning environments by strengthening and aligning evidence -based pract ices used within the B -5 cross -sector early c hildhood mixed delivery system. As a result, it is aimed that the early care and education workforce can be supported in implementing best practices and trauma -informed approaches through systemic professional development. Needs Assessment OSSE has strategically used PDG funding to better understand parents' awareness, access and utilization of early care and education benefits, programs and services throughout the mixed delivery system by conducting a comp rehensive needs assessment. The needs assessment report included qualitative and quantitative data from: Thirty -two family listening sessions; Twenty -one key informant interviews; Twenty -three professional focus groups; Analysis of administrative data; An online and print famil y survey with 2,099 respondents ; and An inventory of existing pilot and demonstration projects in the District. Strategic Plan The strategic plan, outlining systematic goals, objectives and actions for the District's early childhood system, is grounded in the needs assessment research and was additionally developed through consultation with key external stakeholders (e.g., State Early Child Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC), PDG core team made up representatives from multiple DC government agencies , philanthropy partners, public and private sector early care and education professionals, families). The strategic plan's mission was to build and sustain an integrated, comprehensive, and equitable early childhood system of high -quality, family -driven programs and services that promote positive outcomes for all families and young children. Maximizing Parental Choice and Knowledge FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 33 OSSE has strengthened supports to maximize parental choice and involvement in their children's educat ion by improving messaging and communication to paren ts: Enhancing the My Child Care DC website to include Capital Quality designations and family profiles.

RESPONSE : OSSE's recent child care licensing regulations (effective as of Dec. 2, 2016) seek to improve the quality of the early care and education workforce by ensuring that staff have the necessary qualifications and credentials to educate and care for young children. In June 2018, OSSE extended the deadline for meeting the qualifications for various child development facility positions. Position Minimum Education Credential Required Compliance Date Center Director Bachelor's degree (BA) in early childhood education (including early childhood development, early childhood education, elementary education, or early special education) or a bachelor's degree in any subject area with at least 15 semester credit hours in e arly childhood education Dec. 2, 2022 Teacher Associate degree (AA) in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family studies, or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Assistant Teacher Child Development Associate (CDA) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area Dec. 2, 20 20 Expanded Home Caregiver Associate degree in early childhood education (or early childhood development, child and family studies or a closely related field) or an associate degree (or higher) in any subject area with at least 24 semester credit hours in early childhood. Dec. 2, 2023 Home Caregiver and Associate Home Caregiver Child Development Associate (CDA) Dec. 2, 20 20 OSSE has taken numerous steps to ensure that the early care and education workforce meets the enhanced educational requirements. The list below summarizes those efforts. CDA Requirement, Emergency & Proposed Rulemaking Effective December 2, 2019, OSSE promulgated emergency and proposed rulemaking that clarifies specific language in the regulations regarding which staff members must be assigned to and supervising each group of children. This rulemaking updates Section 121 to clarify staff required for proper supervision, and adds definitions for the terms \"aide\" and \"substitute.\" In order to provide adequate time for providers to comply with the clarification in this new rulemaking, OSSE has determined that some staff in c hild development facilities will need more time to reach the minimum education requirements deadline. Therefore, through this proposed rulemaking, FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 39 OSSE extended the deadline to meet the CDA credential requirement for assistant teachers and home caregivers to December 2, 2020. ECE Resources Webpage Launched in July 2017, the ECE resources webpage (www.osse.dc.gov/eceresources) provides position -specific information on the new education requirements, as well as programs and resources available to help the workforce meet the new requirements. Early Childhood Education (ECE) Help Desk In Fall 2017, OSSE launched the ECE Help Desk to provide individualized support and address specific questions about the new education requirements. Child care professionals c an contact the help desk at ECEhelpdesk@dc.gov or (202) 478 -5903 and will receive a response immediately or within 24 hours. Help Desk on the Road Targeted Presentations Starting in November 2017, OSSE began conducting targeted presentations at child deve lopment facilities throughout DC. These presentations focus on the new education requirements, local education programs and scholarship resources. Initial participating facilities were chosen based on the highest need of the new minimum education credentia ls of staff. OSSE currently delivers this presentation upon request by the center director or as needed. College Fairs OSSE's Division of Early Learning, in partnership with OSSE's Division of Postsecondary and Career Education, facilitates the Adult Co llege Completion Fairs: Early Childhood Educators Edition. This initiative provides focused support to DC's early childhood education workforce in learning about programs and resources to help gain their respective education credential. Quorum Online Lear ning In May 2017, OSSE introduced an online training platform through Quorum. The platform allows child development staff unlimited , 24/7 access to a catalogue of engaging and interactive training courses, including those required for obtaining a Child Dev elopment Associate (CDA) credential. All of these courses are available at no cost to the educator. In partnership with Quorum and The Council for Professional Recognition, OSSE developed a CDA guidebook which provides step -by-step guidance on how to obtai n CDA instructional hours using Quorum as a resource. Quorum course completion certificates will automatically be inserted into PDIS for each workforce member . Professional Development Scholarships OSSE also supports the early learning workforce by providing funding to obtain higher educational credentials. There are three avenues of support: (1) Child Development Associate (CDA) grants; (2) Teacher Education and Compensation Helps (T.E.A.C.H.) scholarships; and (3) First Step program: Child Develop ment Associate (CDA) Grants FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 40 OSSE funds two grantees, CentroNia and Southeast Children's Fund, to provide sch olarships and supports through their CDA programs, which are offered in English, Spanish, and Amharic. The grantees also provide scholarship funding to cover the CDA application fee for those who obtain the required instructional hours outside of the grantees' programs, including via Quorum. T.E.A.C.H. Scholarships The National Black Child Development Institute (NBCDI) administers this program on behalf of OSSE. In FY2019, there were 140 active scholars (i.e. teachers, directors or expanded home caregivers) in the T.E.A.C.H. program working on either an associate or bachelor's degree. First Step OSSE piloted the First Step CDA Career and Technical Education (CTE) program in FY17, which provides high school students the opportunity to graduate with their CDA credential and high school diploma at the same time. OSSE' s pilot graduated seven high school students from the First Step program. For the 2018 -19 school year, there are currently 116 students in the First Step CDA Program across four DC Public Schools and two DC Public Charter School high school sites.

FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 50 Q21: Provide an update on the full implementation of Capital Quality. RESPONSE: Capital Quality is the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). Capital Quality is a systematic approach to assess, improve and communicate the level of quality of a child development facility. Capital Quality has three components: an annual rating, a continuous quality improvement (CQI) plan and process , and a public -facing online pr ofile to convey the quality designation of each child development facility. Methodology Capital Quality measures program quality using research -based measures (the Infant -Toddler Rating Scales -Revised (ITERS -R), the Family Child Care Rating Scales -Revised (FCCERS -R) and/or CLASS Pre -K) to evaluate the quality of each program. OSSE has collected observation data for all licensed subsidy f acilities and for non -subsidy licensed facilities that voluntarily participate in Capital Quality. The data is used to inform each facility's Capital Quality designation: Developing, Progressing, Quality and High -Quality. The CQI plan includes a set of research -based quality standards that are common to programs that serve children birth to age five. Most of these standards align with the Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS), the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Act and the National Association f or the Education of Young Children's accreditation standards. The 10 quality indicators in the Capital Quality Continuous Quality Improvement Plans (CQIPs) look at the following: o Curriculum is aligned to DC Early Learning Standards o Formal and informal asse ssments are aligned to curriculum o Formal and informal assessments are implemented o Data is used to inform instructional and professional practices o Using the results of the CLASS Pre -K and/or ITERS -R and/or FCCERS -R o Culturally and linguistically responsiv e practices are implemented o Inclusion practices are implemented o Developmental screenings are implemented o Early care and education professionals meaningfully engage in professional development o Family engagement promotes positive and goal -oriented relationsh ips o Mission statements are reflective of both the program and the families served Reporting The public -facing quality profile on mychildcaredc.org will include the facility's designation and additional information that will be beneficial to families including, but not limited to, group size and ratios, curriculum used and the mission of each faci lity, as appropriate. Support To support this effort, each facility participating in Capital Quality has a quality facilitator (provided by a third party grantee of OSSE) who provides one -on-one support to the child development facility director to help them improve quality and monitor progress. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 51 New Capital Quality participants received an initial site visit from a facilitator and OSSE representatives. These visits were conducted to gain a better understanding of the child development facility and thei r specific needs. The programs received technical assistance (TA) on how to complete the online CQI plan and completed their first complete CQI draft plan within their first year in Capital Quality. The plans were reviewed by the quality facilitators and providers received feedback on the CQI plans. These plans will then be reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Initial and follow -up site visits were conducted with participants, OSSE staff and the quality facilitators. Follow -up site visits were then cond ucted to gather one -on-one feedback from providers about their experiences in the program (e.g., areas of strength, how OSSE could provide better supports). The valuable feedback received from both the site visits and the community of practice sessions was used to improve the overall design and implementation of Capital Quality. For example, providers indicated that they preferred that meetings were held in the community, rather than the OSSE office, which has since been implemented. Additionally, providers voiced the need for updated curriculum and training, and this need was also addressed. Progress to Date In April 2016, OSSE successfully launched the pilot of its redesigned QRIS, Capital Quality. Between March 2017 and January 2019, OSSE welcomed three cohorts of child development facilities in Group Two, Group Three and Group Four. There were 238 total active facilities in Capital Quality as of December 2019. Facilities that have entered into and maintain an agreement for subsidized child care services with OSSE are required to participate in Capital Quality . Licensed non -subsidy facilities may voluntarily elect to participate in Capital Quality. The following table shows the active facility types as of December 2019. Facility Type Subsidy Non-subsidy Total Child Development Centers 165 16 181 Child Development Homes 34 4 38 Expanded Child Development Homes 14 5 19 Total 213 25 238 Beginning Oct. 1, 2018, OSSE transitioned all subsidized child care facilities from their Going for the Gold rating to one of four Capital Quality Designation s: (1) High Quality, (2) Quality (3) Progressing, or ( 4) Developing and all subsidized child care facilities will be reimbursed based on their Capital Quality designation. OSSE implemented a \"hold harmless \" policy to ensure that the tiered reimbursement for each of the four Capital Quality implementation groups will not be lowered upon initially partic ipating in Capital Quality. If the program's designation lowers during the designated time -frame (which varies for each Capital Quality group), then the tiered reimbursement will remain the same for a period of time (i.e., the program will not receive a lower reimbursement that would be associated with that lower designation). However, if a program earns a higher designation, then the program will receive a higher reimbursement that FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 52 aligns with the higher designation. The hold h armless policy is summarized in the following table. Action Pilot and Group Two Group Three Group Four Capital Quality designation determined Fall 2019 Tiered reimbursement changes only if facility designation is higher Fall 2019 Hold Harmless policy ends; tiered reimbursement aligns to facility designation whether higher or lower Fall 2020 Fall 2021 Fall 2022 OSSE completed the Capital Quality rating and designation process for facilities participating in the Pilot, Group Two, Group Three and Group Four in Fall 2019. Subsidy facilities that received a higher designation in Fall 2019 began receiving the higher tiered reimbursement effective Oct. 1, 2019. Facilities that enter into a new subsidy agreement after Oct. 1, 2018 are designated Preliminary until a Capi tal Quality rating and designation is determined based on observation data. In September 2019, the authorized representative from each child development facility that participates in Capital Quality had an opportunity to review the accuracy of their faci lity's Capital Quality rating, designation and review the calculations. This review process is referred to as validation. Each year, child development facility owners, center directors and home providers (\"providers\") will have an opportunity to review the scores used to calculate their facilities' Capital Quality rating and designation . Providers will also have the opportunity to review for accuracy other information that will be included in their facilities' Capital Quality profile, which will be accessed through My Child Care DC. Validation is a passive process, meaning if a provider does not submit any concerns during the validation time period, OSSE considers the Capital Quality rating, designation and all other information to be final. In November 201 9, all Capital Quality participants received their official Capital Quality designation notification letter and certificate based on the Hold Harmless policy. These designations are in effect for each facility for FY 2020 and the observation -based designat ions are valid for up to three years. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 53 Q22: Please detail outcomes of the Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Grant Program for FY19 and FY20 to date. For each of these grants, please list each award recipient, the amount awarded, the type and amount of funds used to support the program, the number of at -risk students served, and the criteria used to select grant recipients. RESPONSE: In accordance with the requirements of the Pre -K Act and Chapter 35 (Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion Funding) of Title 5 (Education), Subtitle A (Office of the State Superintendent of Education) of the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR), OSSE allocates funding in an amount consistent with the Uniform per Student Funding Formula (UPSFF) rate, to eligible commun ity-based organizations (CBOs) to provide and maintain high -quality pre -K education services. The regulations define general eligibility requirements that each pre -K program must meet and maintain in order to receive funding allocation through the program including criteria related to determination of eligibility for enrolled children, required class size, program length and operating hours and participation in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). Moreover, the regulations outlined the high -qualit y standards pre -K programs must meet and maintain to receive funding, which include the following: o Maintenance of defined adult -to-child ratios; o Consistent use of a comprehensive curriculum that is aligned with DC's early learning standards; o Accreditati on by a national accrediting body approved by OSSE; o Utilization of assessment tools that are aligned with the program's chosen curriculum; o Employment and retention of teachers and teacher assistants who meet or exceed minimum educational requirements; o Equitable wages for educators comparable to the public school system in DC; o Professional development and coaching support for educators; o Opportunities for families to participate in and support the program's educational mission as active partners in their child's learning and development; o Plans to ensure inclusion of children with disabilities, in accordance with federal -stated goals; o Safe, secure and developmentally appropriate space for use as classrooms; o Daily active play for each pre -K age child; o Maintenance of a process for ongoing program assessment and continuous quality improvement; o Provision of comprehensive health and support services for all children enrolled in the program (e.g., developmental, vision and health screenings); and o Compliance with program guidelines and reporting requirements. In addition to the requirements guiding eligibility and program quality, the regulations also broadened access to high -quality early learning programs by maximizing the utilization of multiple fundi ng sources. As such, Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion community -based organization (CBOs) are required to use funding allocated to supplement, and not supplant , FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 54 existing federal and local funding sources, such as those available through subsidized child care and the Head Start program. FY19 In FY19, all applicants who applied and met the high -quality standards were designated as high - quality pre -k programs. Specifically, OSSE designated three new CBOs as high -quality pre -K programs and allocated funding consistent with the UPSFF for each stud ent enrolled in a Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion classroom. Additionally, in accordance with the Early Learning Equity in Funding Amendment Act, (D.C. Law 22 -9; D.C. Code \u00a7 38 -271.06(b)(1)), OSSE will also provide a supplemental allocation in the amount o f $2,334 for each child identified as at -risk (homeless, foster, or TANF/SNAP) that is enrolled in a Pre -K Enhancement and Expansion classroom.

OSSE's role in Head Start programs include the following: (1) Leading the District's Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO); (2) Administering the Early Head Start -Child Care P artnership (EHS -CCP); and (3) Coordinating with Local Education Agencies. Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) OSSE receives the Head Start State Collaboration grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS) and leads the Head Start State Collaboration Office (HSSCO) which works to enhance state coordination and partnerships to meet the unique needs and challenges of low -income children and families in the Distric t. The HSSCO supports ongoing collaboration on crucial issues, such as family and community engagement, continuity of care for children, comprehensive services and supports and ongoing professional development for early learning professionals. Additionally , the HSSCO works in collaboration with the District's State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council (SECDCC) to address gaps in early care and education service delivery, improve the overall quality of delivery services to low income children and their families, and improve coordination of services and information exchange between various programs within the early care and education system. Administering the Early Head Start -Child Care Partnership In 2015, OSSE was awarded the E arly Head Start-Child Care Partnership (EHS -CCP) grant and used the funds to develop a neighborhood -based Quality Improvement Network (QIN) to build capacity, increase access and enhance the quality of care for infants and toddlers. The QIN is comprised of two hubs - Unite d Planning Organization (UPO) and Mary's Center. Mary's Center was replaced by Easterseals DC MD VA in 2019 when the QIN grant was re -competed. All services provided through this initiative are full -day and full -year. All facilities that participate in the QIN are required to meet EHS standards. In addition, OSSE received a federal expansion grant to support an additional 166 EHS -eligible children in March 2019. Accordingly, OSSE is maximizing the impact of the QIN by leveraging local, and federal funding t o increase the number of children birth to three years old receiving an EHS quality experience. Coordinating with Local Education Agencies : The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) emphasizes coordination and quality of Head Start programs . Local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving Title I funds must develop a written Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Head Start programs, and other early learning programs if feasible, on records, parent communication, staff training, student needs, transition, and services (ESSA Sec. 1119). OSSE had an ESSA Working Group to coordinate and FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 61 collaborate with the DCHSA and interested LEAs. The goal of the working group was to draft a model citywide MOA that outlines how LEAs will work with Head Start and other early childhood p rograms.3 LEAs applying for Title I funds and serving pre -K or kindergarten signed an MOA with HSAs as part of their Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) annual application to OSSE for federal funds. The working group provided a model, citywide MOA to ease the challenges of coordinating with the Head Start providers. LEAs had the option to sign the citywide MOA or sign individual MOAs with all District Head Start agencies sending students to their LEA. The final citywide MOA and supporting documents are post ed here.The District of Columbia has expanded and aligned efforts of both Early Head Start and Head Start programs to better meet the needs of children from infancy thr ough preschool age. Through this continuum of support, the District is focused on providing more young children access to high - quality early learning opportunities needed to succeed in school and beyond. 3 The National Head Start Association and Council of Chief State School Off icers provided a comprehensive toolkit and sample MOAs to help guide the work. These resources are available at https://www.nhsa.org/our - work/initiative/essa -toolkit . FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 62 Q24: Please provide a copy of the 201 9 State of Pre-K Report. RESPONSE: The 2019 State of Pre -K Report to the Council has been completed and is currently in EOM's internal clearance process per EOM protocols, and will be submitted to Council shortly. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 63 Q25: Describe to the impact of the expansion of infant and toddlers eligible to receiv e Early Intervention services . RESPONSE: OSSE provides early intervention services to infants and toddlers experiencing developmental delays through the Strong Start Program. As of July 1, 2018 , the eligibility criteria for services was expanded to 25% delay in one area of development. For FY19, out of the 1311 children found eligible, 325 children were identified with a 25% delay in one area and provided with early intervention services that they otherwise would not have received under the previous eligibility criteria. The change in eligibility has also contributed to the increase of the number of referrals made to the program. There was an increase of unduplicated referrals from FY18 to FY19 of 10.6% compared to an inc rease of 5.9% from FY17 to FY18. To prepare for the expansion of services, OSSE made changes in service coordination and provider availability. OSSE needed to address the need for efficient and streamlined service coordination. OSSE transitioned the servi ce coordination function into Strong Start and also developed three regions, each one with a team of service coordinators and a supervisor. Families are now served by one service coordinator during their entire period in early intervention allowing enhance d communication, ability to provide consistent and effective services for families in DC EIP, and an efficient distribution of cases to be able to continue to meet all federally mandated timelines for the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) - Part C. Strong Start has worked with all vendor agencies and Managed Care Organization ( MCOs ) to maintain a sufficient amount of early interventionists who provide early intervention services. Through the implementation of the Natural Learning Environment Practi ces approach OSSE has continued to build on the capacity of providers and service coordinators to address the developmental needs of all eligible children. Despite the increase in referrals, to this date Strong Start has been able to deliver early interven tion services with no gaps or shortages in services. For more on OSSE's work to implement the Natural Learning Environment Practices approach, please see Q27. Strong Start has continued to provide quality services and attained meet requirements status with the U.S Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) on all federal indicators even as the program services more children over time.

FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 71 Q27: What progress has early intervention made in implementin g the Natural Learning Environment Practices (NLEP) and what changes has OSSE seen as a result? RESPONSE: The District of Columbia Early Intervention Program, Strong Start, supports and complies with the federal law and regulations that require early inte rvention services to be family centered, community -based, and provided in the natural environment, to the maximum extent appropriate. Natural environments are more than places. The critical component of early intervention practice is to embed services an d supports into naturally occurring learning opportunities. Natural environments are settings where the child, family, and care providers participate in everyday routines and activities that are important to them and serve as important learning opportuniti es. Early intervention providers support families to promote functional participation in these activities. A provider coaching a mother to use techniques to help her son pick up and hold a spoon, fill it with yogurt and get it to his mouth during breakfast in the kitchen at their home so that he can learn to feed himself and enjoy a meal with his family is an example of providing interventions in a natural environment. Interventions within the context of a naturally occurring learning activity create opport unities for children to learn and practice skills that promote participation, build relationships; and get their needs and wants met. Progress to implement NLEP In January of 2018, Strong Start held the Natural Learning Environment Practices (NLEP) Learning Initiative Kick -Start meeting, where 108 early intervention providers and service coordinators attended. At this meeting we introduced providers to Strong Star t's plan to roll out a series of NLEP trainings over time, including the NLEP training series and the \"Coaching in Action\" book club series. Between March and September 2018 trainings and presentations for early interventionists, service coordinators and sister agencies were conducted in which topics included NLEP framework overview, evidence -based practices, interest -based learning and family routines, coaching interaction style, and teaming and primary service provider approach. Based on evaluation forms , 94% of the participants reported overall satisfaction with the trainings and on average 92% reported that the training increased their knowledge. To date, Strong Start has been able to fully implement all of the principles of NLEP with the exception of t he primary service provider (PSP) and teaming approach. Strong Start plans to fully implement this last principle in the summer of 2020 by requiring agencies that deliver services implement all principles of NLEP and specifically the PSP approach that requ ires one primary service provider to work in partnership with the family to address the outcomes listed in the Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) . The primary provider will be joined by other members of the intervention team, which includes a service co ordinator and potentially other trained professionals depending on the child's needs. These professionals may include occupational therapists, speech therapists, physical therapists, and developmental therapists. While the PSP and teaming approach are still in progress , Strong Start began incorporating teaming meetings for service coordinators during regional meetings in 2019 and in June 2019 supporting and attending meetings hosted by provider agencies. During teaming meetings service coordinators had t he opportunity to use real scenarios and case studies, present them to their FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 72 peers, and receive feedback using a teaming approach. This again built the capacity of our service coordinators to better serve our families using natural learning environment pra ctices. For provider agencies, the Strong Start clinical manager attended four meetings with agencies that have multiple disciplines, with therapists that have been trained in NLEP and are actively coaching in the community. The clinical manager served as an observer and helped to facilitate when necessary. The agencies have reported back to Strong Start that they are starting to meet with their team more regularly, using a teaming approach, and that this method has resulted in therapists feeling more com fortable in their skillset, more comfortable seeking support from other therapists and overall more acclimated to using a coaching interaction style in their work. Strong Start also implemented the Coaching Handbook Book study workgroup , and to date two cohorts have been completed with 16 early interventionists and 6 service coordinators . The focus of the book study was to provide early interventionists an opportunity to discuss and effectively team around aspects of the NLEP framework in a more in -depth and guided setting. In March 2019, Strong Start initiated monthly NLEP coaching reflection groups. Early interventionists, early childhood educators, and service coordinators were all invited to participate in teaming opportunities around current topics in the field of early intervention. The providers gave support and helped to build colleague capacity by way of using reflective questions. Over 50 individual early interventionists and service coordinators participated in the reflection groups in FY19 an d the groups have continued for FY20 on a monthly basis. Lastly, in FY19, the Strong Start clinical team updated and enhanced the pre -service requirements for all new early interventionists coming into DC EIP. Specifically, the new provider founda tions training now include all aspects of the Strong Start system focusing on the major components of the NLEP framework, with a cursory introduction to coaching and how services are rendered using this approach. Strong Start Evaluation Team In FY2019, Strong Start brought evaluation services in -house after previously being comprised of external contractors. This team of a speech -language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist , and special educator complete s initial eligibility evaluations and assessments, and IFSP's for children whose payer is DC Early Intervention Program. Additionally, the evaluation team will assist the program in providing training and support to early interventionists and agencies, as t he program moves towards fidelity with the NLEP framework. Outcomes Several positive outcomes have occurred as of a result of these implementation steps. First, OSSE has ensured that early intervention in DC is provided in a manner with consistent implementation that is based upon current evid ence-based practice research. Second, OSSE has created shared understanding and expectations for all early intervention providers in the District of Columbia. Third, a s a result of the feedback received durin g the NLEP trainings, Strong Start revised the New Hire Foundations Training content to reflect all aspects of the NLEP Framework and to set a foundation for providers who are new to DC Early Intervention. Fourth , NLEP supports parents and caretakers in un derstanding the critical role of everyday activity settings and child interests as the foundation for children's learning opportunities. We expect to be able FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 73 to develop stronger participatory goals for families that are embedded within their normal routine s which results in more practice on a particular skill.

Preschool and pre-K program attendance are not mandatory in DC. Therefore, if a parent exits early intervention services and does not move forward with school enrollment before age 5, OSSE will not have data related to that child's services in the interim unless parents provide i t. 4 According to the Court's February 15, 2017 Order , a transition is considered \"smooth and effective\" if (1) the transition begins no less than 90 days prior to the child's third birthday; (2) the child is provided with an IEP listing the services that are to be provided an d both the type of placement and a specific location for services by the child's third birthday; (3) there is no disruption in services between IDEA Part C and IDEA Part B services (that is, all special education and related services in the child's IEP mus t commence by the child's third birthday); and (4) IDEA Part B personnel are involved in the transition process. For the purpose of reporting to the Court, the District may report that there was no disruption in services as long as: all of the child's spec ial education services begin on the child's third birthday or, if that is a weekend or holiday, on the first school day after the child's third birthday (which, in the case of a child whose birthday falls during the summer and qualifies for extended school year (ESY) services, will be ESY services), and all related services should begin within 14 days of the child's third birthday (unless that period is within the summer and the child does not qualify for ESY services, in which case within 14 days of the fi rst day of school after the summer). It worth noting that this definition is distinct from the definition applied for federal reporting purposes.

RESPONSE : OSSE provides school leaders and teachers guidance around maintaining a language instruction educational program for English learners that is rooted in federal and local regulations. OSSE does this through guidance, professional development, in -personal te chnical assistance, and program supports. Title III, Part A Monitoring In winter 2018 and spring 2019, OSSE conducted on -site monitoring of LEAs receiving federal funding for English Learners under Title III, Part A grants, including a program and fiscal review. These reviews highlighted strengths and gaps in services, and as sisted in the development of targeted, meaningful technical assistance following the reviews, based on LEA needs. Monitoring was conducted through OSSE's risk -based monitoring framework to help reduce burden on LEAs and to focus OSSE's onsite monitoring ef forts on the highest -risk grantees across all federal grants. Under the Coordinated Risk -Based Monitoring framework, OSSE evaluated LEAs' compliance with fiscal and programmatic requirements under Title III and LEAs were given one of three designations: l ow-risk, medium -risk, or high -risk based. High -risk grantees received an onsite monitoring review. Each LEA participated in an on -site monitoring review of indicators and alignment of required activities that support English learners. After each visit, pa rticipating LEAs received findings of non -compliance in each applicable area. Supporting Teachers and Leaders of English Learners: Policy and Professional Development Supports During FY19, OSSE's division of Teaching and Learning provided supports for English learner (EL) students' achievement that encompassed two overarching areas: (1) EL policy and guidance and (2) professional development. EL Policy and Guidance EL policy and guidance supports in FY 2019 included the following: OSSE made updates to the OSSE EL policies and procedures document , which is the main policy and guidance document OSSE maintains to guide LEAs in servin g ELs. Updates include: o For the first time this guidance document is now translated in the top five languages spoken in DC, for easy access by families. o Increased guidance around EL identification procedures for students with previous enrollment in other DC schools. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 82 o New information about EL status for adult students transferring across programs, including guidance for scenarios in which students with EL status transfers between adult -serving programs and traditional pathways. o Streamlined procedures for re -identifying a student in 'EL Monitored' status. OSSE provided LEAs with a new resource to improve practices in informing parents/guardians of eligibility for EL services in a manner that meets federal requirements. OSSE released sample templates for the pa rent notification letter of EL status, which LEAs are required to provide to families within 30 days of EL screening ( or within two weeks of placement if not identified at the beginning of school). In response to LEAs' need for clarity on features of different program models for EL language instruction, OSSE provided written guidance on features of the five different EL program models used in DC in order to improve awareness and understanding of how EL program models are defined. OSSE conducted a series of training initiatives to increase LEAs' data literacy and usage of EL-data to improve their programming for EL students. Specifically, the OSSE Early Access to EL Data Qlik application provides hist orical and current data on EL students, including incoming transfer students. Key data available in this application include: current EL status, historic EL status, English language proficiency test (ACCESS) scores, ACCESS growth targets, and languages spo ken. To further the use of the application, enhancements for 2018 -19 included (1) adding data on re -identification of a student as EL and if the students was ever EL and (2) expanding access to school principals (in addition to LEA data managers, heads of school, ACCESS coordinators and EL coordinators). LEA staff were trained in -person and via webinar on: o How to navigate the application o How to use the application to prepare for incoming transfer EL students and to smooth their transition to a new school o How to use data in the application to plan staffing and schedules o How to use data in the application to understand EL students' trajectory in acquiring English and set English language development goals OSSE convened the State Title III Advisory Committee (six meetings per year) to provide input on key policy and guidance considerations, including EL exit criteria review, updating the home language survey, EL progress monitoring, and monitoring for exited ELs. OSSE revamped the webpage on OSSE EL policy and created a toolkit of policy and instructional resources. OSSE conducted state -level and LEA -level analysis of ELs students' academic and English language growth to create a landscape analys is for understanding the state of EL students in DC. State -level data were presented to internal and external stakeholders. The landscape analysis will serve as a foundation for creating an annual fact -base report on the state of English learners in DC. OSSE created LEA -level technical assistance for LEAs to use data to improve EL programs. Technical assistance sessions are being provided to LEAs in FY20. OSSE provides visualizations of state and local education agency -level EL data and tools to identify t rends in data related to EL achievement. Participants gain skills in analyzing FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 83 ACCESS and PARCC data to identify strengths and areas for growth in serving EL students; and how to guide data interpretation discussions with school -based staff. OSSE provided six EL policy and EL program webinars to build LEA capacity in the in the following areas: o Purpose and requirements for OSSE home language survey administration o Policy and procedures for conducting EL screening and program placement o Guidance on program mo dels for serving EL students o ELs & legal precedents for ELs' rights under federal civil rights and education law o Hiring and staffing guidance for building effective EL programs o Self-reflection tool for LEAs to assess their readiness in serving EL students OSSE revised the OSSE Home Language Survey, which is the first part of the two -step EL identification process, and released the new form for use on Dec. 19, 2019. The Home Language Survey is used to determine if the student is eligible to take an English language proficiency screener. The screener score determines if the student is identified as an English learner or not an English learner. Students who are identified as English learners have the right to participate in the English language instructional p rogram at school. Federal law requires schools to offer eligible students an English language instructional program so they may attain English language proficiency and achieve academic success . ESSA sec. 1112 requires local education agencies using Title I or Title III funds to provide a language instruction educational program and not later than 30 days into the school year, inform parents of an English learner identified for participation or participating in such a program. Activities included: o Obtaining input from the State Title III Advisory Committee, families and school staff on misconceptions and areas of confusion surrounding the content and implementation of the former Home Language Survey o Researching options for new survey questions and gathering stakeholder input o Revising the layout, instruction, and questions themselves to align with federal recommendations and stakeholder input o Obtaining translations into the top languages in DC EL Professional development EL-focused professional development consisted of (1) in -person training workshops (2) a 2 -day city-wide conference, (3) webinars, and (4) Start of School Summit trainings designed for educators and school leaders to addressed specific strategies for supporting EL student achievement. For th is first time, EL supports expanded to include new professional development geared specifically to dual language teachers and school leaders. (1) Twelve in -person professional learning opportunities, including several multi -day workshop series and a cohort ser ies were conducted. Dual language -focused offerings are marked with an asterisk. o English Language Acquisition 101, 102, 103 series, offered twice o Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) 3 -day intensive summer training FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 84 o What Teachers Need To Know About Teaching ELs 4 -day cohort series for teachers who are new to teaching EL students o Supporting Students with Interrupted Formal Education o Math: Skills and Strategies to Adapt for English Learners o Science: Skills and Strategies to Adapt for English Lear ners o Scaffolding Learning Through Language o The Language -Rich Classroom o New Dual Language Teacher 5 -day Summer Bootcamp* o Spanish Literacy Institute* o Leadership Institute for Dual Language School Leaders* o Dual Language Principles and Strategies Workshop* (2) The OSSE Multilingual Learner conference, a city -wide convening dedicated to supporting ELs in English language and dual language programs, was held. Over two days, more than 300 participants participated in a total of 40 workshop sessions were led by DC e ducators, as well as nationally and internationally - recognized researchers and educational leaders. (3) Nine webinars on special topics in EL programming and instruction were conducted, addressing the following topics: o ELs in STEM o Strategies to Support a nd Assess Listening o Strategies to Support and Assess Speaking o Strategies to Support and Assess Reading o Strategies to Support and Assess Writing o Family Engagement o Serving ELs in Pre -kindergarten (4) In conjunction with the OSSE Start of School Summit, two in-person workshops and two webinar -based workshops were provided to all LEAs on using EL data to improve programming for EL students: o How to use the Early Access to EL Data Qlik application and its data to ensure a smooth start of school for EL students o ACCESS Growth Scores and How to Use Them FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 85 Q31: In FY18 , OSSE awarded $1.6 million in early literacy grant s to organizations that provide literacy intervention in DCPS and public charter schools targeting third grade reading success . Please provide outcomes observed by these organizations as a result of this investment. RESPONSE : In FY18, OSSE awarded the early literacy grant as a two -year competitive grant to two (2) organizations: The Literacy Lab and Reading Partners. Each organ ization worked with DC Public Schools and/or public charter schools to implement interventions to increase reading outcomes for students in p re-Kindergarten through third grade across the District. The full amount was awarded at the beginning of FY18, and then awarded again at the beginning of FY19 for year 2 of the grant award. The Literacy Lab Amount awarded: $1,200,000.00 in both FY 18 and FY 19. Overview The Literacy Lab was able to expand its programs to place 52 full -time tutors in 15 schools. The program tutors are prepared through summer literacy training, and consisted of fulltime Americorps tutors and the Leading Men fellowship. This grant allowed Th e Literacy Lab to provide direct, evidence -based literacy interventions daily to achieve the goal of tutoring 1,117 students in early literacy skills. Literacy Lab shared the following outcome data with OSSE: FY18 Outcomes In total, 52 full -time tutors supported 1,117 students. An average of 52 percent of participating K-3 children made enough growth to surpass the target growth rate, which is correlated with grade reading proficiency and acceptance into a 4 year college. One in six students achieved grade level proficiency, including 42 percent of Kindergartners. In addition, Literacy Lab has noted that their program attracts people to education who might have not otherwise considered a career in the field. They provide intensive training and coachin g in evidence -based literacy instruction. Furthermore, 50 percent of tutors funded by the initiative are continuing at their placement schools either for a second year as a tutor with The Literacy Lab or as teaching residents. FY19 Outcomes During the 20 18-19 school year, The Literacy Lab placed 18 full time tutors in Pre -K, 32 tutors in grades K -3, and 12 Leading Men Fellows. The tutors participated in literacy training over the summer and received ongoing coaching. This grant allowed The Literacy Lab to provide direct, FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 86 evidence -based literacy interventions daily to achieve the goal of tutoring 1,125 students in early literacy skills. At the beginning of the 2018 -19 school year, 75% of pre -K students in classrooms served were \"far from target\" for Kindergarten readiness, according to the Preschool Early Literacy Indicators assessment. By the end of the year, that number had dropped to only 21%. At the same time, the percent of pre -K students in Literacy Lab tutors' classrooms who were \"on target\" fo r Kindergarten readiness quadrupled from fall to spring, growing from 15% to 60% as a result of tutors' daily literacy intervention. Leading Men Fellows focus on comprehension through a daily repeated read aloud intervention with their pre -K students. T he impact of this intervention can be seen in growth in their students' reading comprehension from fall to spring, based on scores from the Preschool Early Literacy Indicators assessment. In the fall, less than 10% of students served by Leading Men were \"o n target\" for Kindergarten readiness in comprehension. By the end of the year, this number had grown to 44% of students \"on target\". At the same time, the percent of students \"far from target\" dropped from 79% to only 36%. In addition, Literacy Lab has not ed that their program attracts people to education who might have not otherwise considered a career in the field. They provide intensive training and coaching in evidence -based literacy instruction. Reading Partners Amount awarded: $400,000.00 in both FY18 and FY19. Overview Reading Partners' goal is to help close the achievement gap among low -income youth at a system -wide level by producing measurable improvement in students' reading skills. During the 2017 -18 and 2018 -19 school year s, Reading Partners had three (3) overarching goals: (1) Produce measurable improvement in students' reading skills and proficiency; (2) Increase student academic behaviors in the classroom; and (3) Provide a high -quality literacy intervention program to local LEAs th at supports LEA and school goals for literacy improvement. Reading Partners shared the following outcomes data with OSSE: FY18 Outcomes During the 2017 -18 school year, Reading Partners engaged 19 schools to serve 962 students across DC, exceeding the en rollment goal of 925. These students received 90 minutes of one -on- one literacy tutoring each week. On average, students received 39 sessions (29.25 hours of tutoring) throughout the school year and maintained an average attendance rate of 92 percent. 95 percent of grade K -2 target students mastered grade -appropriate foundational literacy skills, putting them on track to read at or about grade level by third grade. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 87 75 percent of grade 3 target students demonstrated growth compared to a national group of peers in the same grade. FY19 Outcomes During the 2018 -19 school year, Reading Partners engaged 19 schools to serve 958 students across DC, exceeding the enrollment goal of 925. These students received 90 minutes of one -on- one literacy tutoring each week. Throughout the school year students maintained an average attendance rate of 89 percent. Outcomes data includes: 95 percent of K -2nd grade target students mastered grade -appropriate foundational literacy skills, putting them on track to read at or about g rade level by third grade. 75 percent of 3rd grade target students demonstrated growth compared to a national group of peers in the same grade. Average number of sessions was 25. Updates for FY20 In the fall of 2019, the FY20 Early Literacy Grant went through a new competition cycle. Beginning in October 2019, Literacy Lab was awarded $1,445,000.00 and Reading Partners was awarded $755,000.00. The FY20 grant will be a two -year grant cycle, similar to the previous cycle. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 88 Q32: Please provide the following information with regard to homeless students in DC public schools: a. How much funding , separate from UPSFF, did OSSE provide to each LEA in FY19 and FY20 to date to support homeless students and how was it used ? Please provide a description of professional d evelopment and training OSSE made available to school liaisons in FY19 and FY20 to date ? RESPONSE : Federal Funding - McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Grant (MKV) Program: OSSE Note the FY19 and FY20 amounts include continuation awards as part of multi -year grants. OSSE sub -granted these federal funds through a competitive process to LEAs that serve homeless students. Sub -grants must be used to supplement LEA strategies for children and youth experiencing homelessness that are intended to ensure immediate enrollment, educational stability, and equal access to the same free appropriate public education (FAPE) as provided to all other students. As described above, $199,640.00 was distributed to LEAs in FY19 for this purpose. Two LEAs, City Arts and Prep, and KIPP DC, ex ited the MKV grant program early in FY19 due to school closings and capacity issues. One new sub -grant was funded for FY20 using the same competitive process as described above. The one new sub -grant was awarded to Friendship PCS as a result of the FY20 M KV competition that was held in June 2019. Only one sub-grant was awarded for FY20 due to limited available funds. MKV sub -grants for FY20 in the amount of $211,640.01 (which includes carryover funds for FY20 continuing subgrants) was distributed to three continuing and one new LEA to provide supports to families experiencing homelessness as described above. A new Request for Applications (RFA) will be released in spring 2020 for the 2021 McKinney - Vento Homeless Education Grant Program competition to sub -grant available FY2021 funds. It is important to note that even if LEAs do not win a competitive grant, LEAs must ensure that children and youth experiencing homelessness have equal access to the same free, appropriate public education, including public preschool education, as provided to other children and youths, with or without this supplemental funding. Authorized by Title VII -B of the McKinney -Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, Section 726, as reauthorized on Dec. 10, 2015 by Title IX, FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 89 Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the law's specific purposes are to facilitate the enrollment, attendance, and success in school of children and youth experiencing homelessness. Local State level Funding : Local funding supports two program speciali sts who work with the Homeless Education Program (HEP) coordinator to : provide targeted support to District agencies serving students experiencing homelessness; oversee the federal grants funding for services to students experiencing homelessness; conduct ongoing training for homeless liaisons, school staff, and community partners; and collect information on the problems faced by children and youth experiencing homelessness, the progress of the SEA and LEAs in addressing those problems, and the success of locally implemented strategies intended to ensure that children and youth experiencing homelessness enroll, attend, and succeed in school. OSSE's Homeless Education Program (HEP) and Postsecondary & Career Education Division (PCE) partnered for a fourth year to provide the following postsecondary educational opportunities for students experiencing homelessness: Sponsored 23 students experiencing homelessness to attend a two -week residential summer program at American University. Participants also received college care packages, which provided all essential items to support their living in dorm rooms, attending college classroom lectures, engaging in hands -on activities, and completing group projects as part of their closing ceremony on the final day of AU programming. Additionally, 2019 was the first year that HEP and PCE provided seniors who successfully completed the AU program with a new laptop and software to support improving access to postsecondary opportunities. Purchased items to create college care packages for 24 students experiencing homelessness who were accepted and enrolled in colleges and universities for FY20. Recipients received travel luggage, a laptop, software, school supplies, a backpack, towel sets, personal hygiene products, and other items to promote their success in college. OSSE also hosted a send -off workshop and reception on July 31, 2019, in which the students received their college care packages, words of encouragement from OSSE managers and staff, information regarding financial aid and scholarship opportunities, essential contacts for on -campus supports for students experiencing homelessness, health and wellness information, and techniques for self -advocacy to support their educational success. The selected students are currentl y attending higher educational institutions such as Bowie State University, Lincoln University, Towson University and Montgomery College. Provided transportation assistance that allowed students experiencing homelessness and parents to participate in progr ams and services funded or supported through this project.

The conference was held November 2 -5, 2019, and 1600 pa rticipants attended the conference. NAEHCY connects educators, parents, advocates, researchers, and service providers to ensure school enrollment, attendance, and overall success for children and youth whose lives have been disrupted by the FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 91 lack of safe, p ermanent, and adequate housing. The annual conference provides an opportunity for attendees to obtain information on the latest evidence -based practices, resources and programs focusing on the education of children and youth experiencing homelessness. OSSE 's Homeless Education program (HEP) served as local organizers for the event. OSSE staff served as exhibitors to share pertinent information regarding families experiencing homelessness, self - care, and opportunities to promote entrepreneurship . FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 92 Q33: Descri be the professional development opportunities OSSE provided/offered to teachers in behavioral health and trauma -informed care in FY19 and FY20 to date . RESPONSE: During the 2018 -19 school year, and continuing into the 2019 -20 school year, OSSE offered a series of in -person trainings to elementary and secondary District educators that focused on Tier 1 interventions and supports for students. Tier 1 interventions an d supports are evidence -based strategies that are implemented across all classrooms and student populations, and they establish the foundation for delivering regular, proactive support and preventing unwanted behaviors. Additional trainings focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions for students. Professional development opportunities included a wide variety of strategies from the individual teacher and classroom level, all the way to school -wide implementation systems. These training opportunities were eit her provided by OSSE staff who were subject matter experts, or were provided by contracted vendors who were subject matter experts, using funds from the Student Fair Access to School Act. In addition to the series of professional development trainings, d uring the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE hosted its first School Climate Conference, and during the 2019 -20 school year, OSSE hosted its second School Climate Conference. These conferences provided robust opportunities for professional development for educators . More details are described below. The professional development trainings held throughout the year included: MTSS for Behavior: Improving Schools by Improving Systems Student behavioral challenges continue to be one of the biggest sources of stress w ithin a school community. In this training, participants learned how to align strategies and improve student behavior and relationships by using a Multi -Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) approach with a focus on prevention and responding effectively. MTSS i s a data driven decision -making framework for establishing the social, culture, academic , and behavioral supports needed for a school to be an effective learning environment for all. OSSE invited school teams who were representative of the school (all gr ades/departments, including an administrator) to join the cohort of early adopters: \"MTSS Champions: Improving Schools by Improving Systems.\" As a member of the cohort of early adopters, teams were able to participate in: Administrative pre-training webi nars with a focus on organizing resources to implement MTSS and aligning multiple initiatives within a multi -tiered framework Two days of team professional learning and facilitated action planning On-going coaching support Learning walks and observations from external coaches who provided support and feedback to strengthen implementation fidelity and guide action planning. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 93 All support was anchored to a valid and reliable measure of fidelity, the Tiered Fidelity Inventory. The Science of Behavior Participants in this training learned how to invest in proactive supports at the beginning of the school year to reduce additional challenges and costs later. The philosophy of this training is that behavior is not only about students exhibiting challenges ; it involves everyone in the school environment. This training took a scientific approach in examining the relationship between individuals' behavior and the elements of the environment , as once understood and put into practice, solutions are greater than problems and learning takes precedence over behavior. Conducting Functional Behavior Assessments and Writing Function -based Positive Behavior Support Plans - Two -Day Workshop After understanding the science of behavior, and implementing Tier 1 proactive strategies, educators are still often faced with students who require more intervention. This two -day Advanced Behavior Analysis professional development training examined the science of behavior more in depth, and also covered the federal requirements for these type of interventions. Participants examined and put into practice the steps for determining the function of behavior; documenting the process; and writing and implementing effective behavior intervention plans. This training targeted school -based s taff who were responsible for conducting Functional Behavior Assessments and writing function -based behavior plans. School -based teams were encouraged to attend together. Classroom Engagement Series: Strategies and Skills to Improve Student Behavior and Classroom Communities OSSE hosted a Tier 1 classroom strategies training for teachers and school teams. In the workshop, participants learned how to implement basic Tier 1 classroom management strategies by focusing on bolstering systems and procedures in their classrooms. The training reviewed: a) Tier 1 classroom checklists and key skills and abilities for classroom engagement, b) easily implementable restorative strategies to increase classroom culture, and c) discussion skills to include in classroom to increase student talk and collaboration. This workshop was open to all educators serving students Kindergarten through grade 12 in public and public charter schools in the District, and was found to be especially valuable for classroom teachers looking to increase classroom engagement. Starting with the Root: Strategies and Tools to Design Behavioral Interventions OSSE hosted a training for educators on how to use student behavioral data to design intervention plans. The training started with an overview of the Response to Intervention framework, and then dove into the step -by-step process of supporting students who need Tier 2 and Tier 3 behavior interventions. Using a functional behavior approach, the training focused on: An understanding of the ABC's o f behavior; Working knowledge of how to identify the function of student behavior; FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 94 Practice building a behavioral plan for specific students; and Resources and tools to help bolster intervention plans on the school campus. The workshop was intended for teachers, school deans, and behavior technicians serving in public and public charter schools in the District. The No -Nonsense Nurturer Workshop: Improving Classroom Management and Restorative Practices OSSE, in collaboration with CT3, hosted multiple No -Nonsense Nurturer Workshops for educators that focused on learning the theory and practices of classroom management and engagement. Participants reflected on relational approaches to classroom culture and managing student learning. The workshop included th ought -provoking classroom video investigations, lively discussions, opportunities for self -reflection and analysis, and role -plays and rehearsal to increase teachers' skills and confidence as effective No -Nonsense Nurturers. Leadership Workshop: No -Nonse nse Nurturer App roach to School Wide Discipline Policies OSSE, in collaboration with CT3, hosted a two -day workshop for school leaders and their teams to develop schoolwide discipline policies that are aligned with the No -Nonsense Nurturer approach. In this workshop, leadership teams: Reviewed existing school discipline documents, policies, and resources; Disaggregated and reviewed discipline data; Explored supports for classroom management and positive behavior systems; Learned how to conduct disciplina ry procedures using a culturally relevant and No - Nonsense Nurturing approach; Developed family engagement plans to support students struggling in classrooms; Built systems and procedures to set up focus rooms to replace in -school suspension; and Planned for implementation of behavior support systems through staff training. This workshop was intended for leadership teams (e.g., administrators, deans, counselors, team leads, etc.) serving in public and public charter schools in DC.

Each LEA that participated in the training received a n opportunity to complete a case consultation session with the partner. The consultation sessions were designed to support sustainability in competency areas around school -focused trauma informed care. During the 2018 -19 school year, over 100 District of FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 96 Columbia educators and other key stakeholders were trained in trauma informed care techniques. The types of trainings included: Introduction to Trauma Informed Care The trauma -informed care trainings were tailored to school -based educators and staff. Parti cipants took part in a session that introduced neurobiological foundations of trauma and were provided concrete skills for building trauma -informed classrooms which included an overview of (1) the concept of trauma, (2) a review of the impact of trauma on children/adolescents, (3) an overview of trauma informed care treatment models (e.g., trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy, trauma systems therapy, cognitive behavioral intervention for trauma in schools); and (4) Concepts such as trauma informed ca re and related approaches, that can be implemented in schools and in classrooms to create a trauma informed culture.

This training allowed teams to take a closer look at adverse childhood experiences (ACES) and their neurological outcomes and how to create trauma -informed communities, schools, and classrooms. Training Date Number of LEA's Number of Participants May 6 -8, 2019 5 18 Nonviolent Crisis Prevention In FY19, OSSE staff, who were certified trainers, continued to train LEA school -based staff in nonviolent crisis intervention using the evidence -based model developed by the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI). The model provides stakeholders with a proven framework for decision -making and problem -solving to prevent and, to the extent possible, de -escalate a person in behavioral crisis. Through the use of the model, all participants who attended OSSE's nonviolent crisis prevention training were provided the skills and strategies needed to safely manage assaultive and disruptive behavior. Objectives of the training included: Recognizing behaviors that may be exhibited by an individual in behavioral crisis; Understanding and applyin g de-escalation techniques; Gaining the tools needed to support individuals before, during and after a crisis; Understanding the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS); and Understanding the principles of nonviolent crisis interventi on in school settings. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 97 At the conclusion of each training participants were required to complete a course exam in order to receive their CPI certification. During the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE hosted 7 separate nonviolent intervention trainings where over 130 District of Columbia educators and other key stakeholders were certified in applying nonviolent crisis intervention techniques. These trainings were hos ted by OSSE staff from the Division of Systems and Supports, K -12 and the Division of Teaching and Learning. At the end of the 2018 -19 school year, the trainer certification expired for most of these OSSE trainers. At this time, the work shifted to the Div ision of Health and Wellness, where OSSE invested in train - the-trainer certification for staff members in non -violent crisis prevention and intervention ( through the CPI vendor), and, in partnership with the Mayor's Office, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA). These investments allow OSSE to offer CPI and MHFA certifications to school leaders, educators, and out of school time providers. OSSE's Division of Health and Wellness has scheduled bi -monthly CPI and quarterly MHFA training sessions for the 2019 -2020 sc hool year. Additionally, OSSE collaborated with DBH to develop a series of webinars for principals. The webinars focused on crisis prevention and intervention, multi -tiered intervention framework, and strategies for multi -disciplinary student support tea ming practices. Lastly, OSSE and DBH maintai n their collaborative efforts on the Kognito initiative which is the required mental health training course that District teachers and principals complete every two years pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a77 -1131. The progra m is informed by the experiences of teachers and school administrators. OSSE and DBH are continuing to collaborate with Kognito on communication and compliance strategies related to this behavioral training requirement for FY 20. OSSE School Climate Con ferences: May 2019 and December 2019 Conferences In May and December of 2019, the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) hosted its conferences on school climate. Both conferences convened educators and stakeholders from DC Public Schools, public charter schools and partner agencies to at tend and lead skill -building workshops, provide opportunities to network, and learn about best practices happening across the city. This conference featured various workshops on how to create school climates that are safe, promote effective teaching and l earning, and foster strong interpersonal relationships using a lens of equity and cultural competence. The workshops touched on one or more of the following content areas: Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) Restorative Justice Trauma Inf ormed Practices Mental Health Supports Social -Emotional Learning (SEL) Equity and Cultural Competence For the May 2019 conference, a total of 273 people participated in this event, representing 30 LEAs, 12 DC Government agencies, and other Community Based Organizations.

RESPONSE : Q34 Attachment - Restorative DC Whole School Implementation School Profiles SY2018 -19 The objectives of the Restorative DC project include: Building awareness of, and expertise in, the power of restorative practices across the education sector, including OSSE, LEAs, and community organizations; Promoting a shift from exclusionary discipline practices to a restorative approach in DC public and charter schools; Identi fying model schools and practices for replication throughout the District; and Strengthening the ability of students to positively contribute to a positive school culture. OSSE provides an array of differentiated programming as part of its restorative jus tice initiative. OSSE offers an array of programs and supports. The descriptions below follow with information on program participation, including the number of training hours and any metrics used to quantify program outcomes. Restorative DC - Whole Sch ool Program - The most intensive programming is the Restorative DC whole school program. This program contemplates a whole -school change that occurs in phases over three to five years. The experience begins with a school's own exploration and application p rocess and consultation with Restorative DC where they then receive initial technical assistance. Schools then move into a planning and preparation phase where future efforts and technical assistance are strategically mapped one year at a time in an imple mentation plan. Schools then proceed to implementation of the plan and maintenance of the whole school change. In SY2018 -19, Restorative DC provided whole school technical assistance to 16 Schools in 8 LEAs. See attachment for complete school profiles. Cur rently, in SY2019 -20, 13 schools are participating in whole school implementation.

Training includes the Restorative Schools Overview, as well as advanced topic workshops on circle keeping skills, trauma awareness and resilience, and restorative conversations. The Restorative DC team designed these trai nings to be highly participatory and experiential, largely using circle process along with a combination of exercises, roleplays, presentations, videos, work groups, hand -outs, and planning discussions, as well as a follow -up email of information, resource s, and reference materials. In SY2018 -2019, and continuing into SY2019 -20, OSSE provided professional development on the following topics in conjunction with the Restorative DC team: Restorative Schools Overview: This one -day experiential workshop introduced teachers, administrators, school staff, students, and all those who support them to restorative concepts and practices. Participants explore d the continuum of restorative practices, experienced proactive circles for strengthening relationships a nd social -emotional skill s. More fundamentally, participants came to see restorative approaches as a means of shifting school culture and climate, as well as addressing systems of power and oppression. Integrating these understandings and experiences of sc hool-based restorative practices learned from the day, the training concluded with an action planning session and a sharing of resources that exist to support those action plans. Restorative Communication: This two -day workshop was designed for educators, youth workers, and youth leaders , and it helped them to identify ways language is used during difficult or disciplinary conversations that may undermine intended outcomes, contradict our own values, and create disconnection with youth, peers, a nd colleagues. Aligned with the Positive Youth Development model, this training presented an empathy - and growth -mindset that fosters deeper understanding, cooperation, and working relationships. Restorative Practices for Younger Learners : This experienti al workshop for teachers, administrators, school staff, and early education workers translated restorative practices to the elementary school classroom by adapting proactive and responsive approaches to the developmental stages of K -8 students. Responsive Circle Keeping: This two -day skills workshop was designed for school staff who aim to incorporate responsive peacemaking circles into their school. The training began by outlining the range of formal and informal interventions available as alternatives to traditional punitive discipline, and focused on responsive circles, and then moved on to review more structured interventions for serious and complex incidents of harm. Participants learned that the keeper's role is to initiate a space that is respectful and safe, and to engage participants in sharing responsibility for the space and for their collective work. Participants practiced keeping mock circles using disciplinary scenarios drawn from the participants' real life experience and received feedback on their skills. Participants also learned how these restorative practices can be institutionalized and made to interface with DCPS Chapter 25 and their school's existing suspension policies. Following the two -day workshop, participants were asked to convene and FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 104 keep live responsive circles in coordination with a designated coach who then assessed their skills and offered feedback. Participants also took part in a regular, monthly one -hour peer support conference calls, following the training, for sharing, lea rning, and accountability. Restorative Practices and Special Education: During this training, participants learned how Restorative Justice is a philosophy and approach to building community and responding to harm with roots in indigenous traditions. They also discussed how it is increasingly applied in schools all around the country to manage classrooms and create inclusive, socially connected, and supportive learning environments. Students with special needs and trauma make a significant part of school po pulations and are disproportionately represented in school discipline cases. Even where there is no formal diagnosis, students have different capacities for sustained attention, social awareness, intellectual cognition, emotional regulation, memory, and ex pressive and receptive language. This one -day experiential workshop helped teachers, administrators, and special education staff identify and accommodate these differences as an essential part of preparing for, keeping, and following up on responsive inter ventions such as responsive circles. Trauma Awareness & Resilience: This training focused on harnessing brain science to implement trauma -informed and healing -centered restorative approaches. The natural functioning of our automatic and subconscious nervous system plays a significant role in much of the disruptive behaviors and conflicts that arise in schools, neighborhoods, and homes. In many of our individual bodies and communities, these nervous systems' reactions are amplified by layers of trauma, including individual, familial, collective, transgenerational, and/or systemic. This fundamentally affects the way students - and educators - are behaving and are able to learn, yet this remains largely unseen and misunderstood. This one -day interactive a nd self -reflective workshop offered educators, youth, and youth workers a space to share and integrate their experiences, as well as a new brain -informed lens for understanding the nervous system, trauma, and resilience in order to make their schools more emotionally safe, supportive and healing. As a result of the workshop, participants came away with greater understanding of behaviors and conflicts from a nervous system perspective and used restorative and brain -informed steps to support (self) -reconnecti on and resilience growth. The training also shared a few trauma - sensitive techniques for de -escalation and stress release, but note that participants are not yet prepared to address severe trauma responses absent further training and more inner practices a nd integration of healing techniques. Many additional resources for further trainings were shared following the workshop. Support Circle Keeping: In this training, participants learned that support circles are a structured process for engaging students wh o are struggling, have complex needs, or are returning to the school community after a long absence. Support circles bring together the student, family members, relevant school staff, social service providers, and others to provide a web of support to buil d relationships, identify needs, map resources, make a plan, check in with each other, share accountability, and celebrate successes in transition to stability. This workshop was designed for intermediate or advanced restorative justice practitioners who h ad an understanding of restorative justice philosophy as well as experience as a circle keeper. Participants learned how to prepare and provide follow -up, as well, as understand the structure and skills needed to implement an effective support circle. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 105 Academic/Content Circle Keeping: This workshop was designed for teachers, youth workers, youth, and other professionals who wished to utilize restoration circles to build community and cover academic content at their school/organization/agency. Participants l earned that the keeper's role is to initiate a space that is respectful and safe, as well as to engage participants in a shared responsibility for the space and for their collective work. Participants learned the underlying assumptions, primary features, a nd basic processes of community building and academic content circles through direct experience and reflection. Participants then had the opportunity to practice designing and keeping circles, receive feedback on their skills and were given an informal ass essment of their readiness to apply circles to their work. Participants received reference materials to guide implementation.

Summer 2019 Intensive Training - The 2019 Summer Intensive Trainings consisted of four sessions of a 4 -day training program to build a foundation of understanding and provide tools to implement Restorative Justice (RJ) in schools receiving technical assistance. In attendance were school leadership, teachers, restorative school coordinators, and restorative school implementation team members from each school in the SY 19 -20 cohort. Teams from 47 schools participated in the 2019 Summer Intensive Program. Teams were grouped together to meet grade -level specific needs, develop citywide network among educators, and provide critical planning time for school teams prior to pre -service week. All activities were funded by OSSE. See attached report for detailed breakdown of participants and what sc hools attended. Restorative Coaching Program Restorative DC, with support from OSSE, led a seven -month Restorative Coaching Program that was hosted by The SEED School of Washington.

RESPONSE: OSSE does not operate post -secondary transition programs directly, as these ar e conducted by LEAs or District's Rehabilitation Services Agency (RSA) ; therefore , OSSE is not able to provide the specific information requested above regarding students and staff. OSSE partners closely with RSA in its provision of support and services regarding the secondary transition needs of students. RSA serves as the lead District agency responsible for providing vocational rehabilitation, job training, and placement programs and services pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In this role, R SA provides transition services to eligible students pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Transition services include instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school a dult living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and provision of a functional vocational evaluation. In order to support LEAs with their responsibility to complete required transition planning activities under IDEA for st udents with disabilities who are of transition age, OSSE provides extensive LEA training and technical assistance related to secondary transition compliance and partners with RSA and other agencies to ensure awareness of requirements and best practices. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 121 Q43: How much federal IDEA funding was received in FY18 and FY19 by the District for DC foster children enrolled in out -of-District public schools in order to receive special education services? RESPONSE : As all other states, OSSE receives federal IDEA funding through a formula that is largely based on each state's relative total number of children in the general population who are of the same age as children with disabilities for whom each state ensures the availability of a free and appropriate education (FAPE) under IDEA. In the District, we ensure FAPE for children aged 3 through 21; therefore, DC's IDEA funding is based on the total number of all children aged 3 through 21 relative to other states. OSSE allocates IDEA funds according to the OSSE IDEA State Allocation Policy (June 26, 2017). See response to Q6 for the total amount OSSE pays tuition to surrounding county public schools for all DC foster children, including students with disabilities. OSSE ensures state -level oversight of students with IEPs through its implementation of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between OSSE, DCPS, and CFSA. The MOA was first created in September 2013. On Oct. 10, 2017, the MOA was reauthorized by all participating agencies. The MOA clarifies each participating agency's responsibility for District of Columbia wards receiving special education services while placed and attending schools in other jurisdictions. It is the intent of this agreement to ensure that school -aged children receiving special education services receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) and are monitored accordingly under federal and local laws and regulations. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 122 Q44: For SY 17-18, SY18-19, and SY19 -20 to date, please list all LEAs which have been found to have a significant discrepancy in representation of students with disabilities in regard to discipline rates. Provide which LEAs were found to have a \"significant discrepancy\" and a copy o f each LEA's self -study and policies and procedur es that OSSE required . Provide details about the action steps in the continuous improvement plans of any LEA issued a finding of noncompliance by OSSE. Provide copies of each self -study, submitted policie s/procedures, finding of noncompliance, and continuous improvement plan since SY15-16. RESPONSE : Q44 Attachment - Significant Discrepancy Guide FFY 2018 .pdf In the last fiscal year, there have not been any changes to the policies and practices established to ensure that LEAs do not discriminate against any students with disabilities. OSSE continues to ensure implementation of the following policies that are de signed to address this issue: 1) Policies and Procedures for Placement Review Guidance ; and 2) Prohibitions on Discrimination Against Children with Disabilities in the Charter School Application During the Enrollment Process Guidance . In addition , OSSE annually reviews data, based on an established calculation, to monitor discrepancies in discipline rates between students with disabilities and their non -disabled peers, and discrepancies in discipline rates for students with disabilities by race/et hnicity. Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an LEA may be identified as having a \"significant discrepancy\" based on the rates of suspension and expulsions of children with disabilities greater than ten (10) days in a s chool year, as compared to their nondisabled peers. If identified, LEAs must complete a review of policies and procedures to assess whether this rate of identification was due to policies and procedures that do not comply with regulatory requirements rela ting to the development and implementation of IEPs, the use of positive behavioral supports and interventions, and the appropriate implementation of procedural safeguards. OSSE then reviews the LEA's self -study and underlying documentation to make a final determination regarding compliance. If the LEA is found to have noncompliance, OSSE will issue a finding and require a continuous improvement plan. In SY 2018 -2019, based on data from SY 2017 -2018, the following three (3) LEAs were flagged for significant discrepancy: Friendship, Maya Angelou and KIPP. After careful review of the LEAs' self -studies, policies and procedures, OSSE determined that two ( 2) LEAs, KIPP and Maya Angelou had policies, procedures and practices that contribute d to the identified significant discrepancy. Both LEAs submitted plans to address systemic noncompliance in the area of significant discrepancy. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 123 Please note that annual significant discrepancy reviews are based on the previous school year's discipline data and are conducted each spring. Reviews of SY 2018 -2019 will be conducted in spring 2020 and reviews for SY 2019 -2020 will be conducted in spring 2021 . Attached is the self -study tool that the LEAs are required to complete. This guidance includes a procedural overview of the process and the actions steps required. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 124 Q45: Describe the training, support and oversight provided by OSSE during SY 18-19 and SY19- 20 to ensure that LEA's are appropriately serving students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. RESPONSE: In SY2018 -2019, and the first half of SY2019 -2020, OSSE provided a robust system of training and support to ensure that LEAs are appropriately serving students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. This was accomplished through a) foundational professional development trainings made available to all LEAs which focus on evidence -based practices for instruct ion and behavior support, b) specialized support through communities of practice and LEA - specific training and technical assistance, c) the Leadership Institute for Secondary Special Education (LISSE) through American University, d) the Special Education Enhancement Fund (SEEF) grant opportunity, e) a robust nonpublic placement oversight process, and f) a comprehensive system of support, resources, trainings, and convening to support secondary transition for students with disabilities. Professional Develo pment Training Opportunities During SY2018 -2019, the OSSE Division of Teaching and Learning (TAL) provided a robust calendar of professional development trainings which focused on evidence -based instructional practices and behavior support strategies to s upport all students, especially students with disabilities. The target audience for these trainings included not just special educators, but also school leaders and general educators, as most of our students with disabilities in the District spend the majo rity of their school day in general education settings. The TAL professional development training calendar was accessible to LEAs on the OSSE Events Calendar , in the weekly LEA Look Forward Newsletter, and on the TAL landing page on the OSSE website . More informati on on the types of training and support is outlined below. Following each training, OSSE conducted outreach to all participants, requesting participation in a feedback survey. Student Support Teams Training Student Support Teams (SST) are school -based pro blem -solving teams focused on meeting the needs of individual students. During the 2018 -19 school year, the SST trainings were attended by 42 educators representing 15 LEAs. In addition to the trainings, OSSE also developed SST model forms for referrals an d meetings. For the current 2019 -20 school year, there has been one training in October 2019. Currently, one additional training is scheduled for February 2020. The trainings focus on the following components of SST: (a) overview of SSTs and Response to I ntervention (RtI), (b) best practices for SSTs, (c) the SST process and troubleshooting discussion, (d) selecting interventions, (e) curriculum -based monitoring, and (f) deep -dive into instructional decision -making based on RtI data. Section 504 Training FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 125 The Section 504 regulations require an LEA to provide a \"Free Appropriate Public Education\" (FAPE) to each student with a qualifying disability who is enrolled in the LEA's jurisdiction. FAPE consists of the provision of regular or special education and r elated aids and services designed to meet the student's individual educational needs and ensure that students with disabilities are educated with their nondisabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Section 504 training was offered during the 2018-19 school year both as an in -person training and as a webinar . These Section 504 trainings were attended by representatives from 15 LEAs. Training was also offered on -site at the LEA by request. In addition to training sessions, OSSE provides a wealth of resources for LEAs and schools on how to implement a robust Section 504 program. These resources can be found on the OSSE website , where OSSE has expanded and revamped documents that give more guidance on best practices in the areas of Section 504 evaluation and eligibility determination. Positive Behavior Support To address positive behavior support and effective response to behavioral crises, OSSE offered a series of in -person trainings to elementary and secondary District educators. Trainings on positive behavioral interventions and supports, trauma informed care, and non -violent crisis prevention support effective instructional practices that allow students to remain in the l east restrictive environment, which often includes the general education classroom. Please refer to the Q33 response for more information on these programs. In addition, Restorative Justice practices support more constructive disciplinary responses in sch ools which in turn allows students to remain in the least restrictive environment. Please refer to the Q34 response for more information on Restorative Justice training and technical assistance initiatives. Please also refer to the Q73 response to learn mo re about OSSE's partnership with other DC Government agencies to support behavioral health training for educators. Monthly LEA Special Education Point of Contact Trainings During SY 18 -19 and thus far in SY 19 -20, OSSE continued to provide monthly trainings for LEA Special Education POCs. Each month provided training on particular areas of focus. The table below presents the training topics for each month.

RtI is a multi -tiered approach to the early identification and support of students with learning and behavior needs. The RtI process begins with high -quality instruction and universal screening of all children, in the general education classroom. Struggling l earners are provided with interventions at increasing levels of intensity to accelerate their rate of learning. These services may be provided by a variety of personnel, including general education teachers, special educators, and specialists. Progress is closely monitored to assess both the learning rate and level of performance of individual students. Educational decisions about the intensity and duration of interventions are based on individual student response to instruction. RtI is designed for use whe n making decisions in both general education and special education, creating a well -integrated system of instruction and intervention guided by child outcome data. The RtI Foundations training focused on providing educators with an understanding of the Rt I process and best practices for implementation. The Response to Intervention for General Education Teachers training and Response to Intervention for Middle and High Schools training both focus on contextual factors relevant to educators in those specific positions. Developing an Effective Response to Intervention System training provided school leaders with steps to create a system and research based tools and strategies for implementation. During SY2019 -20, Response to Intervention trainings are sched uled once every other month through July 2020. Leadership Institute for Secondary Special Education (LISSE) OSSE, in collaboration with the American University (AU) Institute for Innovation in Education (IIE), hosted the 2019 Leadership Institute in Secon dary Special Education (LISSE), formerly called the Master Teacher Cadre - Special Populations (MTC -S) program. The purpose of changing its name was to clearly separate this initiative from a closely named position in DCPS (Master Educator). The program ran from January through May 2019, with an orientation that took place in December 2018. In the fall of 2018, OSSE launched the 2019 LISSE application and provided orientation to the new cadre, with the professional development series beginning in January 201 9. This program builds on the inaugural summer 2015 Master Teacher Cadre for Secondary Educators of Special Populations (students with disabilities and English Learners), an initiative that OSSE and AU developed to support teacher leaders in DC public and public charter schools. The LISSE program provides a select group of DC teachers who work with secondary special education students with the resources and supports to develop leadership skills through participation in intensive professional development (PD ) aimed at supporting teachers' use of evidence -based practices (EBP), integrating the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Individualized Education Program goals within curricula for secondary students with disabilities. Through the course of PD session s, one -day workshops and a full -day institute, the LISSE provided support for participants to: (a) conduct an analysis of the areas of greatest need FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 128 in participants' schools relative to evidence -based practices and the Common Core State Standards (CCSS); ( b) develop a professional development (PD) plan (including instructional strategies and assessments) to address the school community needs of each participant; (c) implement each PD plan at an AU -based event and then an LEA -sponsored institute for DC secon dary special education teachers; and (d) evaluate the quality of each PD plan, its implementation, and its intended outcomes. The culmination of the 2019 LISSE was the professional development provided by the cadre at American University in May 2019, whe re educators from different LEAs were in attendance. Presentations by participants of the LISSE focused on teacher action research plans that could be used for professional development, and included these specific topics: Evidence Based Instructional Strat egies Teaching Self -Advocacy to Improve Outcomes for Special Education Students Literacy Practices to Support Students Across Content Beginning in September 2019, OSSE began recruitment for the 2020 LISSE cohort. Fifteen new participants were recruited from DCPS and charters and the orientation session was held on Dec. 7, 2019. There will be four full -day sessions and a culminating professional development presentation during January through May 2020. Placement Oversight Process Through the placement oversight process, OSSE coordinates with LEAs, parents, and other District government child -serving agencies and community partners to ensure that all District students receive free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the L east Restrictive Environment (LRE). In FY18, the team marked its tenth consecutive year of implementation of the state's Policy and Procedure for Placement Review, Revised , a policy aimed to support LEA in understanding their roles and responsibilities when considering LRE and a change in placement to a more restrictive environment outside the LEA for a child with a disability. Since its inception, the District's state -level p lacement oversight process has ensured timely guidance and support to IEP teams and LEA teams in implementing/exhausting appropriate support and strategies for children with disabilities before considering placement into a more restrictive separate school setting. This has aided in preventing inappropriate placements into nonpublic settings and supporting LEAs' abilities to serve children in less restrictive public settings. Additionally, through its training and technical assistance approach, OSSE has dev eloped a seamless route to connect LEAs with the appropriate supports in OSSE for further technical assistance and training. For example, through the placement process, should an LEA request additional training and technical assistance on behavioral interv ention models, OSSE will share information about upcoming trainings on trauma -informed care and crisis prevention institute trainings and/or provide an onsite consultation to support program design and implementation. Special Education Enhancement Fund (S EEF) Competitive Grant As part of OSSE's implementation of the Enhanced Special Education Services Act of 2014, OSSE used a portion of the SEEF funds for a competitive grant program, which included a FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 129 priority for applicants that proposed to improve capacit y to serve students in the least restrictive environment. The SEEF Competitive Grant was designed to improve academic outcomes, graduation rates, and postsecondary success of District of Columbia students with disabilities in public schools. OSSE announc ed the winners of the first round of the SEEF competitive grant in October 2017. Additional information for the six grantees awarded a SEEF competitive grant in Cohort 1, including project summaries, are available on OSSE's website here. In FY19 and FY20, OSSE provided continuation funding for Cohort 1 competitive grantees, in what will be a three -year grant period ending on Sept. 30, 2020 . In September 2018, OSSE also provided a second round of competitive grant funding to Cohort 2 of the SEEF competitive grant. Additional information for the six additional grantees in the second round can be found here. In FY20 and FY21, OSSE will provide continuation funding for Cohort 2 competitive grantees, in what we expect will be a three -year grant period ending on Sept. 30, 2021. On December 13, 2019, OSSE relea sed a request for applications for cohort 3 of the SEEF Competitive Grant FY 20. Applications were due on January 28, 2020. Secondary Transition In addition, OSSE has offered extensive LEA training and technical assistance related to secondary transition compliance and partners with RSA and other agencies to ensure awareness of requirements and best practices. Q54 describes OSSE's training opportunities to support secondary transition; these opportunities include: Student -led IEP Trainings; Nuts and Bol ts of Secondary Transition; Developing High -quality Transition Plans for Middle School Learners; Planning for Student Success: Secondary Transition Requirements and Best Practices; Secondary Transition Community of Practice; and DC Secondary Transition Ins titute. Developing High -quality Transition Plans for Middle School Learners Each month, OSSE's Division of Teaching and Learning offers Developing High -Quality Transition Plans for Middle School Learners, a professional development opportunity developed to support implementation of 2016 District regulations requiring that the first IEP in effect after a child with a disability reaches 14 years of age includes transition assessments and services. The introductory training will prepares special education te achers and leaders serving middle school students to develop high -quality, age -appropriate transition plans that meet these requirements. The training develops participants' ability to: Understand the legal requirements and evidence -based practices for developing transition plans for middle school students Write age -appropriate, individualized postsecondary goals for middle school students FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 130 Develop annual transition goals that are aligned with postsecondary goals Identify age -appropriate transition servic es that align with postsecondary goals Design a multi -year course of study that is appropriate for middle school students and aligns with postsecondary goals Secondary Transition Community of Practice (CoP) The DC Secondary Transition CoP is a space for c ollaborative, cross -functional work that supports DC youth with disabilities as they transition into a self -directed life. The CoP is a city - wide, cross section of stakeholders who come together monthly to strengthen our individual and collective ability f or action. OSSE hosts the Secondary Transition CoP, which is open to all LEAs and community stakeholders.

Participants in the DC Secondary Transition Institute will: Increase their knowledge of student -focused planning practices and rece ive tools and resources to support increased student involvement in the transition planning process; Increase their knowledge of how to foster interagency collaboration throughout the transition planning process; and Review and revise the LEA three -year strategic plan for improving secondary transition compliance and program quality that incorporates evidence -based practices and evaluation At the 2019 DC Secondary Transition Institute, held on Oct. 18, 2019, there were 104 participants representing 16 L EAs, 12 DCPS campuses, and 9 nonpublic schools. The content was provided by 23 contributors from 10 DC agencies, nonprofits, and service organizations. 10th Annual Voices of Change Conference For 10 years, OSSE has collaborated with DDS, the Kennedy Cent er, and other stakeholders to host the Voices of Change Conference. The event is organized by and for youth with disabilities. These students experience opportunities to learn, lead, and act through interactive performances, workshops, and activities. The conference features professional and youth artists, event planners and youth leaders, and it highlights a variety of careers in these industries. The youth who organize and participate in the conference: Interact with professionals from a wide range of career fields to increase their understanding of the universe of potential postsecondary options Serve as or learn from youth leaders with disabilities FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 132 The 10th annual conference was held on March 29, 2019. It was attended by: 407 students 116 educators 50 exhibitors 50 family members of SWDs 71 volunteers 8 speakers, sponsors, and facilitators Students with Disabilities in the District of Columbia Landscape Analysis As part of the commitment we made in our strategic plan to help accelerate academic out comes for students with disabilities, OSSE developed a comprehensive landscape analysis to help establish a shared understanding of the current state of students with disabilities in the District. Drawing from in -depth data analysis, focus groups and inter views as well as online research, we have examined who these students are, where they live and attend school, their current outcomes, their rates of identification and exit, key barriers hindering their progress, lessons learned from other states, and init ial recommendations for what we as the state education agency can do to address these barriers. We have included national benchmarks and comparisons to other states and urban districts where possible. We believe that sharing this comprehensive fact base is an important first step toward developing a shared, citywide agenda to accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities. The landscape analysis can be found on the OSSE website. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 133 Q46: LEAs that do not meet targets on the Office of Special Education Programs monitoring indicators must comp lete self -studies and develop Continuous Improvement Plans . How many LEAs completed self -studies in each of FY19 and FY20 to date ? Detail what actions are included in the Continuous Improvement Plans. RESPONSE : Attachment Q46: Disproportionate Representation Review Guide, FFY2018 Under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), in addition to being potentially identified as having a \"significant discrepancy\" ( see Q44 ), an LEA may also be potentially identified as having \"disproportionate representation\" of racial and ethnic groups in special education and related services that is the result of inappropriate identification. If identified, LEAs must complete a review of policies and procedures to assess whether this rate of representation was due to policies and procedures that do not comply with regulatory requirements. OSSE then reviews the LEA's self -assessment and underlying documentation to make a final determination regarding compliance. If the LEA is found to have noncompliance, OSSE will issue a finding and require an improvement plan. In SY 18 -19, there were 25 LEAs flagged for Disproportionate Representation reviews. Each LEA submitted its self -assessment for OSSE to review. Upon comp letion of the review, OSSE determined that all 25 LEAs had compliant policies, procedures, and practices , which did not result in inappropriate identification. As a result, the 25 LEAs were not required to submit a Continuous Improvement Plans (CIPs). FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 134 Q47: Provide an update on the work of the Advisory Panel on Special Education in FY19 and FY20 to date .

(b) A narrative description of any action items taken or recommendations made by the Panel. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 135 The panel identified two areas in their annual r eport for additional attention -parental procedural safeguards and parent survey. In response to these recommendations, OSSE and the State Advisory Panel on Special Education ( SAPSE) have engaged in the following activ ities in FY19 to FY20 to date. Parental Procedural Safeguards - SAPSE Recommendation 1 - SAPSE recommends that OSSE improve its ability to partner with educational organizations and agencies (e.g. Advocates for Justice and Education, Office of the Student Advocate, DC Office of the Ombudsman for Public Education, DC Special Education Cooperative, Children's Law Center, all DC agencies serving kids with special needs, etc.) in the District of Columbia who currently serve families and inform them when new ed ucational tools, documents, etc. are developed and released. OSSE Action - OSSE agrees that meaningful, productive partnerships with educational organizations and agencies that support the interest of students with disabilities is important. OSSE will continue to look at new and robust ways to engage with these stakeholders. Tow ards that aim, the SAPSE, along with the Student Advocate Office, cohosted a Town Hall on Special Education where families and community members learned about the Individual with Disability Education Act (IDEA), Parental Procedural Safeguards and additiona l community resources that can aid in the betterment of services provided to students with IEP's in June 2019. Further, OSSE committed in its updated strategic plan to more deeply focus on academic outcomes for students with disabilities. OSSE developed a comprehensive landscape analysis to help establish a shared understanding of the current state of students with disabilities in the District. We believe that sharing this comprehensive fact base with these partners is an important first step toward develo ping a shared, citywide agenda to accelerate academic outcomes for students with disabilities. SAPSE Recommendation 2 - SAPSE recommends that OSSE improve the ways in which it communicates with parents of students with disabilities. Specifically, OSSE shou ld: a) Create a stand -alone website for parents of students with disabilities. This site should include resources, videos, and information on topics ranging from early intervention through secondary transition and should use multiple modalities to share in formation, such as video modules blogs and social media (in multiple languages) that are parent friendly; b) Ensure that all materials generated for parents are accessible and parent - friendly. Specifically, SAPSE would like for OSSE to prioritize two docum ents in this work - The \"Procedural Safeguards\" and the \"Special Education Parent Information Brochure.\" SAPSE recommends that OSSE take the Procedural Safeguards document and create 2 -3 versions taking into account length and readability; c) Revise the Spe cial Education Parent Information Brochure to include more in -depth information. OSSE Action - FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 136 Consistent and clear communication with families is vital to increasing student achievement for students with disabilities. To support compliance with the Indiv iduals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and ensure that the rights of students with disabilities are protected, OSSE publishes a notice entitled \" Rights of Parents of Students with Disabilities: IDEA Part B Notice of Procedural Safeguards. \" This notice aids parents in understanding specific rights available to them and their child through IDEA and District of Columbia laws rega rding special education. It is also translated into multiple languages in accordance with the DC Language Access Act. OSSE also provides additional resources such as the Special Education Brochure which is an easy guide to allow stakeholders to further explore IDEA and additional parent friendly content. In September 2019, OSSE hosted its annual DC Paren t and Family Engagement Summit which focused deeply on students with disability. OSSE also provided services geared towards parents at EdFest in December 2019. Additionally, to support continuous improvement of our programs and offerings, OSSE has established an internal agency working group for special education. The team is comprised of agency leads with varying areas of expertise, allowing all special education items to be brought to the forefront of the agency. Parent Survey SAPSE Recommendatio n 3- SAPSE has the following 5 tier approach to managing the Parent Survey as well as outreach efforts they would like for OSSE to consider. They are identified as follows: 1. Utilize best practices to increase participation and access to the survey; e.g. modeling other states with a higher return rate, utilizing social media, etc. 2. OSSE should make it more transparent that individual responses will be kept confidential and add language to ensure confidentiality for parents - especially that their answers wi ll NOT be shared with their schools; 3. OSSE should explain to parents how the responses will be used and what outcomes the survey responses yielded (e.g., how are they using the responses to measure satisfaction with the program, what are their outcomes, etc .); 4. OSSE should share the survey results with the public and use them to recommend \"tangible\" changes in services/systems; 5. OSSE should provide parents with the opportunity to contribute to the development of the survey questions, and ensure that all the qu estions utilize parent -friendly language, and parents are permitted to provide further comments on their responses OSSE Action - The Parent Survey helps inform the training and resources OSSE provides for families regarding special education. Survey result s can be found on District of Columbia IDEA Part B Local education Agency Report for Fed eral Fiscal Year 2017 (July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018. Survey responses can also be found on the DC Part B, F FY 2017 State Performance Plan/Annual Performance Report. Although OSSE has met established targets reported to the Department of Education for the APR, and has also remained steadfast in our ability to produce a compliant survey without a decrease in response rates, response rates for the Parent Survey have remained relatively low. OSSE continues to meet established goals around satisfaction rates reported to the Department of FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 137 Education for the APR. OSSE continues to explore ways to maximize outreach e fforts, within the confines of FERPA and data privacy requirements, including broader online survey dissemination and distribution of surveys at the following events: Parent Summit, Secondary Transition Community of Practice Annual Retreat, EdFest DC, Stat e Advisory Panel on Special Education monthly meetings and quarterly DC Supporting Families Community of Practice meetings. See Q48 for more information. SAPSE/ OSSE Liaison Meetings - In order to ensure that disability -related policies, regulations and g uidelines are developed with input from SAPSE, OSSE continually met with an identified policy liaison on a monthly basis to discuss any upcoming policy changes in order to ensure the SAPSE has an opportunity to authentically engage in State education polic y work led by OSSE. During these meetings, existing and proposed policy are discussed upon request. OSSE also encourages the SAPSE to comment publicly on any rule or regulation proposed by the State regarding the education of children with disabilities. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 138 Q48: Describe the annual parent survey that OSSE sends out regarding special education. At a minimum, please include in your response how many surveys were sent out and completed in FY19; when the surveys are sent out to parents; and describe OSSE's communication and outreach to parents regarding the survey in FY19. What is OSSE doing to improve parent participation rates? RESPONSE: Annually OSSE collects data for the U.S. Department of Education's Annual Performance Report (APR), Indicator 8 (Parent Involvement) through a parent survey. This survey gathers input on the extent to which schools are facilitating parent involvement as a means of improving services and results for children with disabilities. OSSE is in the process of analyzing the most recent parent survey that was sent in July 2019 (fiscal year 2019/ federal fiscal year 2019), and expects it to be finalized by May 2020. The most recent survey administration with completed analysis is from the fiscal year 2018/ federal fiscal year 2018 administration. Parent surveys were mailed to all guardians with students receiving special education services, on July 5, 2018. This surve y was distributed in both English and Spanish. The survey was open for completion from July 5, 2018 through December 12, 2018. Parents had the option of completing the survey online or returning the hard copy survey that was mailed to each home. Online, OS SE offers the parent survey in all languages required in the DC Language Access Act: Amharic, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese. A total of 13,315 parents were invited to participate in the survey and 611 completed the survey. Of the respo ndents, 88.9 percent indicated that overall, schools were facilitating parent involvement as a means of improving services and results for students with disabilities. OSSE continues to meet established goals around satisfaction rates reported to the Depart ment of Education for the APR. OSSE continues to explore ways to maximize outreach efforts, within the confines of FERPA and data privacy requirements, including broader online survey dissemination and distribution of surveys at the following events: Paren t Summit, Secondary Transition Community of Practice Annual Retreat, EdFest DC, State Advisory Panel on Special Education monthly meetings and quarterly DC Supporting Families Community of Practice meetings. To learn more about the extent to which survey strategies are effective with all parent groups, OSSE also included optional items in the parent survey to collect extra demographic information from respondents. In addition, OSSE has revised the online survey tool to be more user -friendly and plans to f urther utilize social media to boost awareness and participation. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 139 Q49: How many due process hearings and state complaints did OSSE issue final orders for in FY18, FY19, FY20 to date ?

What analysis has OSSE conducted to date on the STAR rating system and how ratings are distributed across schools? RESPONSE : Each year in conjunction with the publication of the DC School Report Card, OSSE has released a statistical brief on the STAR Framework which includes a series of analyses, distributions, and correlations reviewing the results, as well as the interactions between student groups and metrics. Those are posted on the Data and Technical Resources tab of the DC School Report Card. The STAR Brief includes multiple distributions of the STAR Ratings as well as distributions of metric performance within the frameworks, reviews of the relationships between a school's student composition and the STAR score, analysis of growth metrics and STAR ratings, and a review of the chronic absenteeism metrics in the STAR Framework. STAR Framework Reports and Analyses 2019 STAR Framework Brief and Appendices : shares the citywide performance trends for frameworks, student groups, and metrics. The appendices share additional views and analyses of distributions and correlations including a review of distributions and correlations between frameworks, student group performance, sectors, and metrics. 2018 STAR Framework Report and Appendices : this report shares the citywide performance trends for frameworks, student groups, and metrics. 2018 STAR Analysis Exploring Distributions and Correlations : this report provides additional views and analyses of distributions and correlations including a review of distributions and correlations between frameworks, student group performance, sectors, and metrics. Additionally, OSSE publishes a cross tabulated data file each year that allows the user to download all of the data available on the report card and in the STAR Framework and disaggregate it at the school, LEA, and state level for cr oss-tabulated student groups. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 142 Q52: Provide an update of how OSSE is providing support to schools in the bottom 5% of schools in the STAR Framework. RESPONSE : The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requires OSSE to identify schools that perform at the bottom five percent of its statewide accountability system for Comprehensive Support (CS), type 1. OSSE identified these schools in 2018 and is in the process of investing $11 million in federal funding into those schools between SY18 -19 and SY20 -21 throug h the Investment in Schools grant . In year one of the grant (SY18 -19), 10 CS1 schools received funding to conduct a needs assessment, engage stakeholders in creating school improvement plan and school improvement implementation. All schools identified a s CS schools (Type I and Type 2) in Dec. 2018 were required to take the following actions: 1. Conduct a school level needs assessment with input from stakeholders 2. Complete a resource equity analysis at the LEA level to analyze resource distribution at all sc hools, if applicable6; 3. Develop a School Improvement Plan with input from stakeholders; 4. Have the plan approved by the LEA and OSSE (and the Public Charter School Board (PCSB ), if a charter); 5. Participate in periodic monitoring of the plan by OSSE (and PCSB if a charter); and 6. Participate in state -level intervention if the plan is not successful after three years, or with an extension, after four years. All of the school improvement plans are publicly available on OSSE's website . CS1 schools are in their second year of Investment in Schools grant funding which involves schools' implementing per their approved school improvement plans. Of the 10 CS1 scho ols identified in Dec. 2018, two have closed. Therefore , eight CS schools are being funded in SY2019 -20. 6 The Resource Equity Analysis is designed for an LEA to analyze how resources are allocated to CS school(s) as compared to the other schools in the LEA. Therefore, if an LEA with a CS school is a single -site LEA, this requirement is not applic able FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 143 Special Education Transportation Q53: With regard to special education transportation, please provide the following information for SY2018-2019: (a) Any actions taken over the last year or planned for the next year to improve the special education transportation system; (b) The current policy for providing transportation for special education students who must arrive to school early or late for extracurricula r transportation; (c) The number of special education students receiving transportation services from OSSE - DOT; (d) The number of special education students receiving transportation services from contractors; (e) The percentage of buses that arrived at school on time, broken down by month; (f) The percentage of bus ride times that exceeded one hour, broken down by month ; (g) The number of complaints received regarding special education transportation, broken down by month and subject matter of complaint; (h) The average number of days it took to resolve complaints regarding special education transportation, broken down by month and subject matter of complaint; (i) The number of buses currently in service and their average age; and, (j) The number of vans currently in service and their aver age age. (k) The number of vehicles owned or leased by the District. RESPONSE : (a) Any actions taken over the last year or planned for the next year to improve the special education transportation system; FY19 Actions Completed In January 2019, OSSE DOT converted 200 frontline staff from part time to full time employees. This conversion afforded 200 additional employees with full benefits, yearly incentives, a higher hourly wage while addressing the need for the increasing number of staff to support students attending schools whose calendars span either 11 months or 12 months. In addition to the conversion, all school bus drivers and school bus attendants received a salary increase designed to create pay par ity among similarly pla ced positions in DC government. DOT offered 190 professional development opportunities covering over 20 topics for front line staff in FY19. To supplement onsite training, DOT also utilized virtual trainings that are displayed at the terminals as refresh er and best practice reminders. DOT implemented a customer service training program for all staff that provides practical skills and tools for employees to use as standards of behavior when communicating with parents, students, LEAs, stakeholders and coll eagues. This program empowers employees to interact with students, families and each other in a caring and compassionate way. Participants are provided with interactive activities and practical tools to establish and sustain a culture of service FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 144 excellence . DOT has trained over 64% of its entire workforce in Communicate with Heart (CWH) to date to include executive team members, frontline managers, central office staff, bus drivers and bus attendants using a train the trainer model to support peer to peer t raining. Remaining staff will be trained in FY20. To supplement this training, DOT also launched the CWH Recognition Program which acknowledges employees from each terminal and headquarters that display CWH techniques with internal and external stakeholder s. OSSE DOT prepared a solicitation to procure 144 new buses equipped with cameras to monitor safety on the bus and to aid in the investigation of school bus incidents and accidents. DOT also awarded a contract and production began for 25 new vans equipp ed with cameras for student transportation. OSSE DOT continued its ongoing partnerships with LEAs to increase community awareness in order to better inform children and families about student transportation services. DOT conducted approximately 200 school visits to assess the quality of transportation services and to remedy any issues and participated in numerous community events. In FY19, OSSE DOT and the Department of General Services (DGS) finalized its architectural plans for the W Street Terminal (1601 W. Street NE). The project timeline was updated by DGS with a new completion date of 2022 for the terminal to be fully operational. In the interim, the terminal is being used as training space for staff and will later be used as swing space while the 5th Street Terminal is being renovated . Actions Planned for FY20 OSSE DOT will pilot and fully launch the Parent Portal which will allow stakeholders to submit complaints utilizing an online submission process. The system is intended to streamline the complaint intake process. OSSE DOT also plans to procure and pilot a more reliable, efficient and user - friendly Student Ridership Tracking System and GPS. This new system will enhance routing and reporting for all stops in a bus journey (arriving/ departing homes, schools, terminals), while easing the existing burden of utilizing multiple systems. (b) The current policy for providing transpo rtation for special education students who must arrive to school early or late for extracurricular transportation; In addition to the daily school route, OSSE DOT provides transportation for eligible students to activities that are necessary for the provision of FAPE as specified in the student's IEP (e.g. secondary transition activities, education -related activities). To initiate transportation to such activities, LEAs shall submit the a ppropriate completed special accommodations request within five (5) business days of the IEP Team decision and at least ten (10) business days in advance of the activity. If the activity occurs after school hours, LEAs are responsible for making arrangemen ts for transportation from the activity to the student's residence, subject to FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 145 reimbursement from OSSE DOT. OSSE -DOT publishes its Special Education T ransportation Policy on the OSSE website. (c) The number of special education students receiving transportation services from OSSE -DOT; On average in the 2018 -2019 school year, OSSE DOT provided services to 3,233 students, which includes 60 students who received parent reimbursement or received Metro cards for the DC One Card through the agency. This is a two percent decrease than the average number of students served last school year. (d) The number of special education studen ts receiving transportation services from contractors; OSSE DOT contracts with an external transportation compan y to support operational needs in providing transportation to eligible students in the District. OSSE DOT does this in instances where a stude nt may need an individualized route due to unusual circumstances.

(j) The number of vans currently in service and their average age. There are 17 vans currently in service with an average age of 7 years old. Of the 17 vans, 9 are used to transport students, the remaining 8 are used by the fleet maintenance team. (k) The number of vehicles owned or leased by the District. DOT owns 622 school buses, 17 vans and 14 passenger vehicles which include pick -up trucks, mini vans and compact cars. OSSE DOT leases four mechanic trucks, one for each terminal. DOT has submitted a requisition to procure 144 school buses and 25 vans in the 2018 -2019 FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 148 school year. DOT anti cipates placing the 25 vans in service for student t ransportation in the 2019 -20 school year. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 149 Q54: In FY19 and FY20 to date , how has OSSE taken steps to remedy each of the top three compla int issues received regarding special education transportation in FY19? RESPONSE: The top three complaints are (1) early/late bus; (2) unprofessional conduct; and (3) student not picked up. To address the early/late bus complaints, the first step was to ensure that parents/guardians are aware that according to the OSSE DOT transportation policy, a bus can arrive up to 15 minutes before or after the scheduled pick -up time and still be on time. While this is standard practice for the door -to-door transportation industry, not all parent/guardians may be fully aware of the policy. DOT has continued to communicate to LEAs, schools and parents the importance of providing accurate contact information and emphasize procedures regarding pick up and drop offs. Specifically, at the start of the 2019 -20 school year, OSSE communicated directly to parents for the first time to notify if we had previously transported their child but had not yet received a stu dent's transportation request form (TRF). This would allow parents to work with the school proactively instead of waiting until a student was not picked up. DOT educates stakeholders through system trainings, webinars, OSSE's annual Start of School Summit, the Parent and Family Engagement Summit as well as through verification calls at the start of the school year. The greatest contributor to buses arriving outside of the 30 -minute window is staff shortage and absenteeism which typically result s in OSSE dr ivers and attendants being required to cover more than one route or \"doubling up\" routes, which impacts timeliness . . OSSE DOT has continued to aggressively recruit bus drivers and attendants in order to decrease service delay . During the 2018 -2019 start of school, DOT implemented an attendance incentive, Back to School Bucks, to encourage staff to come to work daily and on -time without any stakeholder complaints. This incentive was awarded to 841 staff, which is 600 more staff that were qualified to receive this award t han the previous school year. OSSE DOT will continue its education campaign among bus staff about the importance of consistency for the student population that OSSE DOT serves and the impact to those students whe n they do not arrive on time. To address the missed bus complaints, as described above, OSSE DOT has been working to improve the accuracy of student data as well as to streamline the student routing process. Many missed pick -ups are due to wrong addresses or inaccurate student ridership information (for example, a student may be picked up at different locations on different days of the week). OSSE DOT increased communication regarding the need for accurate information to LEAs and school officials through t he Start of School Summit and other Start of School communications such as the agency newsletter and during TOTE training. OSSE DOT has been working to improve bus staff documentation of wrong addresses or students not riding in order to improve the proces s of updating that information with LEAs, and to expedite the time it takes to correct the information in the routing process. Additionally, OSSE DOT is working to strengthen relationships with school staff about student attendance in order to improve trac king as well. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 150 To address unprofessional conduct complaints, OSSE DOT hired a lead Compliance Specialist dedicated to tracking unprofessional complaints. OSSE DOT has begun to develop a systematic way to track repeat concerns which include unprofessional complaints in order to conduct follow up training with staff and provide additional supports as needed. Additionally, DOT continued to train its staff in \"Communicate with Heart\" \u2014a customer service training program developed by the Cleveland Clinic. This p rogram empowers employees to interact with students, families and each other in a caring and compassionate way. DOT also continued training staff in \"Right Response\", a curriculum that provides bus drivers and attendants' additional skills on interacting with students and parents, focusing on proactive strategies to manage the environment. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 151 Q55: Please provide an update on the Transportation Advisory Council. At a minimum, please include the list of representatives serving on the Council; the number of meeting s held in FY19 and FY20 to date ; priorities identified by the Council; and what changes to improve special education transportation that OSSE -DOT has undertaken as a result of the Advisory Council. RESPONSE: The goal of the Transportation Advisory Council (TAC) is to work with a cohort of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and knowledge of special education services for students with disabilities. Members share ideas and make recommendations for the purpose of supporting transportation services to ensure students successfully begin and end their school day with best in class transportation service. Below is our current member list. Name Affiliation Role Yvette Rosendo OSSE Member Doreen Hodges DC Family Voices Member Emily Daggett Parent Member Catherine Decker St Coletta of Greater Washington Member Charles DeSantis Parent Member Shara Greer Children's Law Center Member Amy Alvord Ivymount Member During school year 2018 -2019 the TAC conducted a total of three (3) meetings. The TAC focused on the following priorities: Parent communication and route status information o Bridging the gap on communication with parents and terminal staff. Parent outreach and inclement weather information o Improved dissemination of pertinent information to parents such as route status and inclement weather information. Provided an update on the Parent Handbook process and when the document will be finalized and made available. LEA training and resources/ new system o Developing a parent portal and other interactive ways for parents/ guardians to receive information pertaining to their child and his/her transport ation. o Coordinated the feedback process for new LEA system. OSSE DOT has begun to incorporate these recommendations and has plans for further action. For example, OSSE DOT has implemented techniques to communicate with parents such as posting transporta tion information at schools and community events. Based on TAC feedback, DOT has also implemented a test group of parents to test all new external facing processes and systems. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 152 Q56: Describe any technology upgrades OSSE -DOT has taken in FY19 and FY20 to date to better track buses and communicate with parents and schools regarding arrivals and pick - ups. RESPONSE : The past year OSSE DOT has made strong progress on technology systems by improving IT processes and procedures. OSSE DOT continued its quarterly aud iting process to monitor the functionality of installed push -to-talk phones on all buses so that drivers have an easy, direct connection to dispatchers. Based on this quarterly audit, DOTs Data and Technology team are able to identify which units are worki ng properly, which buses do not have units installed and which units are not working based on equipment failure or user error in order to make improvements. OSSE DOT completed the transition to the Salesforce database, compliance and contact management sy stems and LEA/ schools portal. The initial transition to Salesforce began in October 2018 and the LEA/school portal launched in March 2019. Since then the system has improved the integration of student, school and routing data. OSSE DOT's Data and Technolo gy team completed the upgrade of the Trapeze, Routing and Scheduling system. The upgraded system has been fully integrated with the Salesforce database. This integration and system enhancement allows the Parent Resource Center to provide parents with more comprehensive and up -to-date information. In addition, LEAs have the ability to see their student's transportation profile at a glance. OSSE DOT also implemented a centralized ticketing system where all staff can submit and track technology issues in a timely manner. Lastly, with the implementation of the Kronos application, all drivers and attendants are able to independently report their time and attendance. Staff are now able to check their time and related matters on their phone. This has improve d payroll reconciliation and processing time. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 153 Q57: Please provide an update on OSSE -DOT's efforts to reduce the number of vacancies with regard to drivers and aides. Also provide for SY 19-20, the number of drivers/aides needed and how many of each is cu rrently employed . RESPONSE: There are several strategies that OSSE DOT is employing to ensure that the agency has the appropriate number of drivers and attendants to serve all eligible students who require transportation. OSSE DOT In collaboration with OSSE HR, continued its hiring c ampaign in FY19. This recruitment effort resulted in the hiring of 61 bus drivers and 37 bus attendants during FY19 ending the fiscal year with a 5.54% vacancy rate. In September 2018, the driver bench was ten percent, by the end of the school year it incr eased by eight percent to a total of 18 percent, exceeding the target. This was also an eight percent increase from the end of last school year. The attendant bench was six percent in September 2018, which is a three percent increase from the same time las t year. However, due to the growing increased need for 1:1 aide accommodations, the attendant bench was -2% by the end of the school year. Driver and attendant benches refer to the number of staff available for support in the event the permanently assigne d staff are unavailable. It is important to note, driver and attendant benches can easily shift due to absence, extended leave, turnover and fluctuating route counts based on student enrollment. DOT continues to actively recruit bus drivers and attendants and put forth aggressive efforts to onboard staff as quickly as possible. As of December 19, 2019, OSSE DOT had 62 vacancies; 36 of these vacancies have candidates selected. The remaining 26 vacancies include 6 bus drivers, 11 attendants and 9 administr ative positions. Although OSSE DOT continues to actively recruit bus drivers and attendants, maintaining staffing levels to support the increased numbers of students despite turnover and retention continues to be a challenge. To provide additional support , OSSE DOT outsourced some routes to contractors. This necessity has continued in SY19 -20, with OSSE DOT outsourcing an average of 17 routes per month to contractors, which is a 56 percent increase then the 11 external contractors needed the same time last school year. The data below does not include the number of contractor routes, and only includes routes driven by OSSE DOT staff on OSSE DOT owned vehicles. Month Average # of routes Average # of drivers needed (includes 10% bench) Average # of Drivers employed & active Average # of drivers present each day Average # of attendants needed (includes 10% bench and 1:1 aides) Average # of attendants employed & active Average # of attendants present each day Aug-19 453 498 582 547 592 570 519 Sep-19 523 575 583 527 667 570 505 Oct-19 524 576 586 531 672 573 513 FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 154 Nov-19 524 576 580 517 674 577 509 Dec-18 528 581 584 511 679 573 500 Data only reflects DCPS regular school days Note: Standard business practice for a fleet business is to have a bench of 10 percent more drivers than routes on any given day. OSSE DOT also implemented this practice for its bus attendants. In addition to the 10 percent bench implemented for bus attendants, some students (average of 87) need a one -to-one aide which increases the numbers of attendants needed from the standard practice of one attendant per route. Therefore, the number of attendants needed is 10 percent greater than the number of routes plus the number of one -to-one aides. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 155 Post-Secondary Education and Career Education Q58: Provide the list of schools that are considered Microsoft Imagine Academies. Please detail OSSE's efforts in FY19 to expand the number of Microsoft Imagine Academies to increase students' digital literacy and better prepare them for college and careers.

Please provide the Committee the following: (a) The cost of administering this program in FY17 , FY18 , FY19 , and FY20 to date ; (b) How many students in gr ade 11 and grade 12 took advantage of this program for each of the above years; and (c) The District's average SAT scores for FY17, FY18, FY19, and FY20 to date . (d) What steps does OSSE take to support students' preparations for college admission exams? RESPONSE : In 2012, the Council of the District of Columbia passed the \"Raising the Expectations for Education Outcomes Omnibus Act of 2012\" (D.C. Law 19 -142) which requires each student attending a public high school to take the SAT or ACT before graduating. Bec ause the costs of both tests (over $40 per student) can be a barrier for students, OSSE provides all juniors and seniors who attend public high school in the District the opportunity to take the SAT without costs, through SAT School Day. During the fall se mester, seniors take the SAT on a given day, and juniors do so during the spring semester. If an eligible student is present at school on SAT School Day, he or she is required to take the exam. The table below summarizes the cost of administering SAT School Day and the number of students participating. Fiscal Year Administration Cost Number * Includes students who took SAT test on SAT School Day who self-reported as a junior, senior, or did not report grade. ** The number of juniors and seniors (based on OSSE -verified data) participating on SAT School Day dates in the 2019 -20 school year are not yet available. Some students took the SAT on more than one test administration in a fiscal year. Therefore the number of SAT tests taken exceeds the number of SAT participants. The average test scores reported here represent the average of all scores even when a student participated in testing on more than one day. The table includes two test groups - All Test Takers and SAT School Day participants. Both represent public and public charter school students enrolled in grades 11 and 12 during the fiscal year reported. SAT School Day participants are test takers who participate in SAT School Day test dates. All test takers includes students in grades 11 and 12 that take the SAT on any date in the reported fiscal year.

In FY 2019, based on limited outcomes and changing best practices OSSE began exploring other avenues of supporting students' preparations for col lege admission exams. OSSE continued to: (1) provide the opportunity to take the SAT twice by funding SAT School Day for juniors and seniors, (2) support advanced coursework opportunities by funding dual enrollment and advanced placement examination fees, and (3) support summer bridge programs for sophomores and juniors. High -quality secondary education prepares students for college entrance exams and postsecondary coursework, and OSSE contributes to this preparation by supporting DC's LEAs and schools in adopting rigorous standards and coursework, and by supporting their work to measure student achievement and growth using PARCC and DC Science assessments in high school. Scoring a 3+ on PARCC assessments is an indicator that students are approaching colleg e-ready, and scoring a 4 or 5 indicates college readiness. Schools and LEAs can use this data to better understand students and groups that require additional support to be adequately prepared for their postsecondary choices. ACT Though OSSE provides SAT School Day for all juniors and seniors, LEAs and schools are able to obtain free or reduced price vouchers directly from ACT for students to take the ACT exam. ACT deems students eligible to receive vouchers if they are considered eligible for the Free and Reduced Meals Program (FARMS). If the student's school does not participate in SAT School Day, schools can request that OSSE assume the costs of the ACT for non -FARMS students. To date, two schools have made this request (Goodwill PCS and Kingsman Academy ). FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 158 Q60: Provide an update on the OSSE Scholars Program in FY19 and FY20 to date . At a minimum, in your response, please include: (a) The number of students who applied to the OSSE Scholars Program; (b) The number of students who were accepted to the OSSE Scholars Program; (c) The cost of the program per student; (d) A description of how long students attend each program option; Activities and opportunities students experience through the OSSE Scholars Program; (e) A description of OSSE's efforts in terms of student recruitmen t and outreach; and (f) What outcomes have been obse rved as a result of the program? RESPONSE : The OSSE Scholars Program was created in spring of 2012 as an academic enrichment opportunity for high -achieving, low -income District of Columbia high school stud ents with funding support from the U.S. Department of Education's College Access Challenge Grant (CACG), which ended in 2015. Through partnerships with selective postsecondary universities, this program has continued and exposes high school sophomores and juniors to university campuses, various academic disciplines, and peers from a wide variety of backgrounds. The OSSE Scholars Program is briefly described below: Interested students submit an application during the fall (including an essay, income verification, and transcript), and complete an interview. OSSE staff conducts interviews with all eligible applicants and makes final selections. Once students have been accepted as OSSE Scholars, they apply directly to university programs. Students may on ly attend one university program within a given summer. OSSE Scholars is a need -based program and as such OSSE funds all program costs, as well as travel to and from each student's selected program. Accepted students and their parents attend at least one informational session prior to attending their program. Scholars also receive essay writing assistance and college and career counseling assistance. (a-c) The table below summarizes applications, acceptances, and costs for the OSSE Scholars Program in 20 18, 2019, and 2020: Summer 2018 Summer 2019 Summer 2020 Number of students who applied to the OSSE Scholars Program 148 117 240 Number of students who were accepted to the OSSE Scholars Program 47 (17 DCPS, 30 public charter school) 44 (20 DCPS, 24 public charter school) 38 (15 DCPS, 23 public charter school) Total cost of the program $267,033.35 $ 245,996.09 $224,618 Average cost per student* $ 5,681.56 $ 6,307.59 + $ 5911 FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 159 Summer 2018 Summer 2019 Summer 2020 * Costs include tuition, travel, and educational supplies. The summer 2020 calculation is an estimate based on the agreements currently available with postsecondary institutions, and will change once invoices are available following program completion. + In summer 2019, 39 students were able to attend, which is the number us ed to calculate average cost per student. (d) Length of the program In summer 2019, students attended programs at 13 postsecondary institutions including: Barnard College, Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Duke University, Emory University, Harvard University, Northwestern University, Smith College, Stanford University, Syracuse University, University of Chicago, and University of Pennsylvania. Students apply to different programs at each institution, and the length varies for ea ch program and scholar. In summer 2019, there were 20 program date ranges between June and August among the 39 scholars' program selections , but all programs run between two (2) and eight (8) weeks. Activities and opportunities students experience through the OSSE Scholars Program Students experience a variety of activities and opportunities through the OSSE Scholars Program. Prior to the summer experience, OSSE staff members provide a series of regu lar workshops and meetings to ensure OSSE Scholars are fully prepared. Pre -summer activities offered to Scholars include: New Student/Parent Orientation - OSSE Staff members introduce the expectations of OSSE Scholars and share details about deadlines. Travel Orientation - OSSE Staff members meets with students and parents about the intricacies of travel. Many of the Scholars have never traveled on an airplane before). Peer Orientation - Scholars alumni meet and discuss their experience with new Scholars. On-going and frequent 1:1 meetings with Scholars for essay writing and application assistance. Once students arrive on campus, students are exposed to: College level academic courses; College professors and staff; College residence halls and college resi dent life; and Opportunities to explore the surrounding areas, and participate in exploration activities and other cultural exposure activities. (e) OSSE's efforts in recruitment and outreach OSSE's recruitment and outreach efforts involve working with high school counselors and LEA staff to share information about the program and explain the application process. OSSE staff also works with high school counselors to help them better understand selection criteria and thus recommend the best candidates for the program. OSSE staff also visits high schools to hold informational sessions with interested or eligible students. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 160 (f) Program Outcomes Every year OSSE administers surveys in order to measure student feelings and expectations around postsecondary educa tion related to their experience as an OSSE Scholar. Overall, participants indicate that this experience increases their awareness and challenges their assumptions about college. 2019 OSSE Scholars gave the following feedback: \"My experience as an OSSE Sch olar has positively influenced my approach to making a smart college choice.\" - 79 percent Strongly Agree, 15.2 percent Agree \"After participating in OSSE Scholars, I have a better understanding of what will be expected of me in college.\" - 78 percent Stro ngly Agree, 25 percent Agree \"After participating in OSSE Scholars, I feel more confident in my ability to apply to selective and highly selective universities.\" - 59 percent Strongly Agree, 25 percent Agree \"After attending their summer program, I am interested in attending this college after high school.\" - 47 percent St rongly Agree, 19 percent Agree FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 161 Q61: Please provide the number of dual enrollment seats and individual student enrollments OSSE funded in SY18-19 and SY19 -20 to date . RESPONSE : Studen ts participate in dual enrollment courses through their LEA. OSSE currently funds dual enrollment in two ways. In the first, OSSE awards competitive grants to fund dual enrollment programs with institutions of higher education (IHE s) that establish partnership agreements with LEAs through the Dual Enrollment Scholarship. IHEs are then reimbursed per student, per course, using these grant funds. The second, called the DC Dual Enrollment Consortium, began in the 2019 -20 school year. Th e Consortium is designed to provide additional dual enrollment opportunities for all students, but particularly students attending small LEAs that may otherwise not be able to establish strong partnerships with multiple IHEs. The following numbers detail student participation in OSSE -funded dual enrollment programs for SY2018 -19, and SY2019 -20 (to -date). The 2019 -20 school year is the first year of enrollment through the Dual Enrollment Consortium. This means beginning the 2019 -20 school year, students ma y be enrolled in programming provided by the Dual Enrollment Scholarship and the Dual Enrollment Consortium.

RESPONSE : Q62 Attachment - DCTAG.xlsx FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 164 Q63: OSSE set a postsecondary enrollment goal in its most recent strategic plan. Describe the steps OSSE is taking in achieving that goal. RESPONSE : In its 2019 -2023 strategic plan, OSSE set the ambitious goal that 1,100 additional students would enroll in postsecondary institutions by 2023 on a path to completing a two or four year degree . OSSE set this goal recognizing that in the DC region, the strong majority of jobs require some level of postsecondary education. Annually measuring progress will motivate continual improvement and maintai n a sense of urgency as DC supports more students along the pathway to meaningful work and family -sustaining wages. The District administers PARCC annually to measure progress towards college and career ready expectations. Although the District has made steady gains over the past four years on PARCC, more progress is needed across all grades and subgroups of students to ensure more students are ready to succeed in college. In FY19, the agency took multiple steps that support achieving this goal. First, the agency began sharing actionable postsecondary enrollment data by adding 6 - and 12 - month postsecondary enrollment rates to the DC School Report Card, in addition to the existing college and career readiness indicators. This allows community and educatio n partners to use this information at the school, LEA, and state -level to ask questions, make decisions about programming and supports, and identify any gaps among students accessing postsecondary education. This data will be available annually, including metrics displaying postsecondary enrollment rates for previous graduates from the prior two years. The metrics show the six - month and twelve -month postsecondary enrollment rates aggregated by state, LEA, and school levels for all students as well as by stu dent groups. There are many facets to postsecondary enrollment, and cost can be a key barrier for students and families. So, OSSE continued its work building the education ecosystem's capacity to address this barrier. Together with our partners we suppor ted FAFSA completion work across all LEA's and schools, conducted outreach around the DC Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) and other financial aid options, and maintained postsecondary access supports for students in particular groups - such as students exp eriencing homelessness. Specifically, OSSE's Postsecondary and Career Education (PCE) division provided three workshops on college selection, financial aid and FAFSA completion. In addition, PCE continued to produce the DCTAG quarterly e -newsletter, TAGT ALK. DCTAG, and also gave 96 presentations at college fairs, high schools, college access organizations, and other events that reached over 6,900 attendees (including both students and parents). Second, OSSE promotes college access in various ways that in clude funding and direct program coordination. OSSE funds programs that expose low -income students to college -based and academically rigorous programs such as Dual Enrollment, Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, and by providing funding for SAT and ACT exams. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 165 Further, the agency coordinates programs such as the OSSE Scholars program, which provides high-achieving, academically -motivated students who exhibit financial need with the opportunity to attend selective summer college p rograms, the College Conversations program, and the Adult College Completion (ACC) Initiative. College Conversations is an invite -only non -traditional college fair created to address the issue of student \"undermatching\" at the postsecondary level. This opp ortunity exposes invited students to more selective colleges and universities that students may not be familiar with but may be a better fit for their abilities and offer greater financial aid. Students gain exposure to the more nuanced admissions processe s of selective colleges and universities. The ACC Initiative seeks to encourage first -time adult college students and adult learners who attended college and left without obtaining a degree to earn postsecondary credentials. It includes periodic college fa irs and partnerships with programs such as Southern New Hampshire University's College for America Programs. OSSE focuses on increasing college persistence and completion rates for students attending public schools in DC by implementing programs that prom ote FAFSA and college application completion, information sharing for students and educators around making smart college choices, and supporting summer bridge programs with a local university to help ensure students are academically ready to be successful in a postsecondary setting. Last, the agency is investing in setting high expectations by working with stakeholders to create high-quality programs of study through its career and technical education programs. These programs ensure that each student in pa rticipating LEAs may choose from multiple postsecondary pathways that lead to high -demand, high -wage careers for this region. Further, they offer multiple on -ramps to postsecondary education, including certificate, apprenticeship, and work -based learning p rograms, while acknowledging that not all careers require a traditional two- or four -year degree. The agency's postsecondary enrollment goal is one of three goals in the strategic plan that aim to reduce the achievement gap among students in DC; it is als o a leading indicator for postsecondary completion. In the next few years, the agency and its partners will focus on the students most proximate to postsecondary enrollment (high school students), but in the future, successes related to the other goals of expanding access to high -quality early childhood programs and academic growth at the elementary and secondary level will ultimately ensure more DC students are prepared for the postsecondary pathways of their choice. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 166 Q64: The District established the DC Re-Engagement Center (REC) to reconnect youth ages 16 -24 to educational programs. Please provide an update on RECs activities and outcomes in FY19. Also include the RECs latest report. RESPONSE : Q64 Attachm ent - DC ReEngagement Center FY1 9 Annual Report .pdf The DC ReEngagement Center (REC) is a centralized District service through which out -of- school youth between the ages of 16 and 24 can reconnect to educational options and other critical services to support their attainment of a high school diploma o r equivalency. OSSE spearheads this effort with support from DOES, Raise DC's Disconnected Youth Change Network, schools, CBOs, and other key partner agencies. In fall of 2018, the ReEngagement Center moved into the Office of Neighborhood and Safety Engage ment building at 100 42nd Street, NE. In an effort to successfully reconnect youth to school, ReEngagement Center specialists complete the following steps: Perform an assessment of academic and non -academic needs to develop individualized reengagement pl ans; Provide assistance identifying \"best fit\" educational options, including District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, community based organizations, and faith based organizations; Provide support during the re -enrollment process (colle cting documents, accompanying youth on program visits, and connecting youth to resources that address reengagement barriers); and Provide ongoing support for at least one year after enrollment occurs. Number of Disconnected Youth Served in FY19 In FY19, the ReEngagement Center conducted 284 short intakes, conducted 249 full intakes (which includes a full intake interview that identifies barriers to enrollment and retention, a staff review of clients' past academic history, and student completion of the eCASAS assessment to determine literacy and numeracy levels), and successfully reconnected 191 youth to an education program. The \"stick rate,\" is another one of the REC's core outcomes which measures a student's six and 12 month persistence at the program they were enrolled in through the REC. The calculation is run once per quarter and is averaged across quarters using a weighted average of quarterly stick rates, which controls for variation in the number of youth in each cohort based on their dat e of enrollment. When constructing this measure, there is a distinction between clients who have remained engaged, or active , with the ReEngagement Center (successfully contacted by their case manager at least once per month) and those clients who are inactive for a variety of reasons (including but not limited to refusing services or changing contact information without notifying a case manager). Weighted \"Stick Rates\" for FY18 Q4 through FY19Q4 are presented in the table below. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 167 DC ReEngagement Center Weighted Stick Rates (FY18Q4 through FY19Q4) 6 Months 12 Months Active7 and Inactive8 Clients 66.67% 47.95% Active Clients Only 73.68% 57.31% The six month stick rate describes the percentage of youth who, six months after enrolling for the first time since coming to the ReEngagement Center, were still enrolled or had earned a credential. Youth are included in this calculation if their 180th day since being first enrolled occurs in the quarter the calculation was computed. The ReEngagement Center did not meet its targets for both enrollments and stick rate in FY19. We believe that this is due to staff transitions and a strong labor market for c lients. It is also important to note that while the targets were missed, the stick rate increased significantly from last year (each category increased between ten and 20 percentage points), and is moving toward the target. For example, the DC ReEngagement Center's twelve month, weighted stick rate for active clients increased from 35.66 percent in the FY 2018 annual report to 57.31 percent in the FY 2019 annual report. This increase is related to deliberate steps taken to increase focus on the stick rates at the staff -level, as well as the ongoing development of additional tools that will support future increases. Partnerships The success of the DC ReEngagement Center is due to the many partnerships formed throughout the District. Below are some of the highlighted agencies that have contributed to the overall success of the ReEngagement Center (a full list of partnerships is in the attached report): Co-located i ntakes in Columbia Heights: The ReEngagement Center's bilingual specialist continues to conduct intakes as needed in Columbia Heights. This co -location addresses the need to provide service to youth who are not able or willing to come to the Northeast location. Department of Human Services (DHS): The ReEngagement Center participates in the bi - weekly coordinated entry youth housing meetings and is an assessment site for the youth and single adult housing assessments. DHS staff co -locate at the ReEngagement Center to support clients' who need to access TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, and other DHS administered benefits. Lastly, The ReEngagement Center is a primary TANF vendor which means that DHS can assign TANF customers who are eligible for REC services to the REC, t hereby making those clients eligible for additional financial incentives through the TANF grant for consistently engaging with the REC and/or their relevant educational placement. 7 \"Active clients\" are those clients who have a successful check in with their assigned ReEngagement Center Specialist at least once per month. 8 \"Inactive clients\" are those clients who: have invalid contact information, have refused services, have not made successful contact with their assigned ReEngagement Center Specialist in 90 days, have moved out of state, are incarcerated, deceased, or have earned a secondary credential. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 168 Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement's (ONSE) Pathways Program: Thi s initiative aims to decrease criminal justice involvement and improve the outcomes of those most likely to be the victim or perpetrator of a violent crime. The ReEngagement Center partners with the Pathways Program to provide educational assessments, plan ning, and referrals; as well as barrier identification and remediation for all Pathways participants. OSSE's Division of Early Learning and the Department of Human Services: ReEngagement Center Specialists have been trained to complete the full application process needed to issue child -care vouchers at the REC to youth parents who identify child -care as a barrier to re -enrollment. Department of Employment Services (DOES): DOES makes referrals to the REC, assists eligible ReEngagement Center clients in part icipating in the Career Connections employment program and the Marion Barry Summer Youth Employment Program (MBSYEP), provided multiple interns under the Project Empowerment program and the MBSYEP, and provided employment and job readiness services for REC clients through the American Job Center. Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services (DYRS): DYRS refers clients in need of educational support to the ReEngagement Center and REC staff provide onsite intakes at DYRS's Achievement Centers twice a month . Marketing and Canvassing In FY 2019 the ReEngagement Center focused its marketing and outreach efforts on a summer - long grassroots campaign to reach various audiences, including youth eligible for services as well as friends and family who might make referrals. This included ReEngagement Specialists and a team of current and former clients who were assigned to the REC through the MBSYEP attending dozens of community events and canvassing neighborhoods in need of services throughout the District. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 169 Q65: What programs were offered by OSSE in FY19 to assist District residents in achieving their high school equivalency? RESPONSE: The District of Columbia, through OSSE, offers residents multiple pathways through secondary education, including waivers for local education agencies (LEAs) to offer competency -based education programs, as well as funding for GED, National External Diploma Program (NEDP), and basic education programs for adult learners. Specifically, OSSE assists District residents in achieving their high school equivalency in two ways - (1) direct service at OSSE's GED Program Office, and (2) federal and local sub -grants to programs that provide basic education and preparation for two high school equivalency assessments - the GED and the NEDP. Both options support pathways to a secondary credential, either a traditional high school diploma or a state diploma.9 Since the state diploma option was enacted, each adult learner who passes all sections of the GED has received a state diploma, and lea rners who complete an NEDP have received either a high school diploma or state diploma, depending on the entity that supported their NEDP completion (see Program Support below). Between October 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019, OSSE awarded 297 State High S chool diplomas to residents who passed all sections of the GED and 32 State High School diplomas to residents who successfully completed the NEDP for a grand total of 329 State Diplomas earned. GED Program Office The DC GED Program Office is an official G ED\u00ae testing center and serves as the single source in DC for administering the GED\u00ae Tests via computer and endorsing candidates who successfully pass the GED Tests to receive the state diploma. This office informs adult educators and learners about the GED requirements, and provides professional development, technical assistance, and resources to GED instructional programs to support students' success in GED programs. Since FY 2016 individuals who passed the GED received state diplomas. Program Funding and Support OSSE's Adult and Family Education (AFE) team supports LEAs and community -based organizations in the District that offer the NEDP. The NEDP awards a secondary credential to adults who successfully demonstrate academic and life -skill competencies that have been determined to be what every high school student should know or be able to do. The AFE team works with Comprehensive Adult Stud ent Assessment Systems (CASAS), NEDP National Office, DC Public Schools (DCPS), the DC Public Charter Schools, and community -based organizations to expand the NEDP option in the District of Columbia. 9 In FY 2016, the DC State Board of Education approved OSSE's proposal to award a District of Columbia State Diploma for the District's adult learners who had passed the GED exam or successfully completed the National External Diploma Program (NEDP) requirements. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 170 It is important to note that not all residents who comp lete an NEDP earn a state diploma, as some NEDP programs are offered through LEAs that award a high school diploma. For this reason, NEDP completers and NEDP completers with a state diploma are different metrics.10 10 Please note, the Adult Education team is federally funded and s ubmits a federal Annual Performance Report based on the federal fiscal year (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019), which cites related, but different counts for residents earning credentials. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 171 Q66: Please provide and update on the Adult and Family Education (AFE) grant . RESPONSE : In FY 2019, OSSE AFE, in collaboration with the WIC, awarded Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) and WIC Career Pathways funding to 10 sub -grantees to implement the Integrated Education and Training (IE&T) service models introduced in the FY 2017 grant competition. These sub -grantees include: Academy of Hope Public Charter School Briya Public Charter School Catholic Charities Congress Heights Community Training and Development Corporation Four Walls Career and Technical Education Center Latin American Youth Center Opportunities Industrialization Center - DC So Others Might Eat (SOME) YouthBuild Public Charter School YWCA - NCA The IE&T models implemented by the 10 providers include the provision of adult education and literacy, workforce preparation, and training services for a specific occupation or occupational cluster to 1,000 District residents for educational and career advancement. IE&T programs provide adult learners with an opportunity to enhance their literacy and numeracy skills or to earn a secondary school credential while working towards acquiring an entry level and/or industry recognized certification. Reporting The grant is a federal grant, and AFE reports to the Nat ional Reporting System (NRS) annually on metrics required by the Department of Education.11 These learners can be broken down into the following categories (as defined by AEFLA): In total, 1,144 adult learners received services in OSSE AFE funded programs i n FY19. o Of this number, 1,062 learners met the National Reporting System (NRS) guidelines of having a valid assessment and 12 or more instructional hours in the program year to be reportable to the US Department of Education. o The remaining 82 adult learn ers engaged in one to 11 instructional hours. For FY 2019, OSSE AFE negotiated a measurable skill gains performance target of 43 percent for all ABE and ESL Educational Functioning Levels (EFLs). This target represents the proposed percentage of adult learners making a measurable skill gain (e.g. achieving an educational functioning level gain, acquiring a secondary school diploma or its equivalent, or exiting a program below the postsecondary level and enrolling in postsecondary education and training 11 Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE) National Rep orting System as of Jul. 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 172 during the program year). OSSE AFE exceeded its target of 4 3 percent, with 529 of 1,062 ( 49.8 percent) of students enrolled in an OSSE AFE funded program achieving a g ain. This reflects a 3.3 percentage point, increase over the percentage of students with measurable skill gains in FY18 - (42.6 percent).

Please provide the number of students referred through the Data Vault to each of the following OSSE subgrantees in FY19 . If referrals were also made to other groups through the Data Vault, please add rows for each of them. RESPONSE : The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) requires many District agencies to work together on implementation of the DC WIOA Unified State Plan, to ensure that: Every DC resident is ready, able, and empowered to discover and attain their fullest potential through lifelong learning, sustained em ployment, and economic security. Businesses are connected to the skilled DC residents they need to compete globally, are full participants in the workforce system, and are able to drive the District's economic growth. Residents and businesses in all eight wards are supported by a system that includes coordinated, cohesive, and integrated government agencies and partners working to help communities thrive. The DC Data Vault was created in 2015 as a transactional data system that helps the District to focus on better serving customers by improving interagency collaboration and streamline, coordinate and integrate the prov ision of education, training and other related services to District residents. Since inception, 4 ,971 unduplicated clients have been served via the Data Vault. WIOA core partner agencies including the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Depart ment of Employment Services, Department on Disability Services/Rehabilitation Services Administration, and Department of Human Services are working together to use the DC Data FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 174 Vault.

(f) In FY19, for each office or program that used the Data Vault, how many total referrals did the office or program make through the Data Vault to external organizations for the purpose of taking a CASAS test or other literacy service s? How many such referrals were made in FY20? Three OSSE AFE providers (Four Walls Career and Technical Education Center, OIC -DC, and YWCA -NCA) serve as onsite provider partners at each of the American Job Centers. The FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 176 agencies provide assessment and lear ning needs screening services to District residents at the American Job Centers. DOES American Job Center staff primarily use the DC Data Vault to make referrals for CASAS assessment services or to provide information and access to District residents about available education and training options. As other agencies and programs are added to the Data Vault and increase usage, these numbers are expected to increase. In FY19 (10/1/18 - 9/30/19): 1,169 referrals were made for assessment services. 67 referrals were made for literacy or IE&T services. Total : 1,236 referrals During the first quarter in FY20 (10/1/19 - 12/31/19): 88 referrals were made for assessment services. 13 referrals were made for literacy or IE&T services.

FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 179 My School DC Q68: Please provide an update on the OSSE budget and operations for MySchool DC. Please include the following information: (a) What changes, if any, were made to MySchool DC in FY19? (b) What changes, if any, will be or have been made in FY20? RESPONSE: My School DC tracks the percentage of applicants that enroll (accept a seat) at schools where they were matched or made a waitlist offer through the common lottery system, yet only some students who receive an opportunity to enroll in a school from the lottery actually do so. For the 2018 -19 school year, approximately 8800 out of the roughly 16,000 applicants (58 percent) matched. Also, approximately 3,300 students enrolled in a DCPS or public charter school based on a waitlist offer. Note that these students could have also received an initial match that they later declined. A remaining 9,000 students declined an opportunity to enroll, whether that enrollment offer stemmed from an initia l match or a waitlist offer. These data are not yet available for the 2019 -20 school year. (a) What changes, if any, were made to MySchool DC in FY19? In FY19, My School DC maintained the implementation of the common lottery and outreach program while enhancing the program in the following ways: Increased LEA participation in My School DC, adding Mary McLeod Bethune, Ida B. Wells Middle School, Bard High School Early College, Mundo Verde - Calle Ocho campus and Lee Montessori - East End campus. Changed application to accommodate closures and late changes to school landscape in the My School DC application such as schools closed, schools taken over to be operated by other LEAs with ensuing changes to feeder pathways, and schools with grades added or remo ved. Expanded outreach preceding EdFEST significantly boosting individual attendance for the citywide school fair. Changed operational strategy and technology to improve triage of the queue of callers, and increased number of calls taken on the My School DC hotline to over 18,000. Enhanced partnerships and outreach strategies to at -risk families encouraging recognition of the deadlines for lottery applications and increasing the proportion of at -risk applicants in before those deadlines. (b) What changes, if any, will be or have been made in FY20? In FY20, My School DC's will: - Dedicate significant resources to implementing a pilot which will provide advantage in the lottery for at -risk students at one school and tracking outcomes. - Increase participation in My School DC adding Latin American Montessori Bilingual PCS, The Social Justice School, The Sojourner Truth School, the I Dream Academy, and Girls Global Academy. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 180 - Implement the ability for applicants to do a live chat with staff members to resolve small errors quickly without waiting on a hotline call response. - Prepar e to implement one -to-one text messaging for applicants that receive waitlist offers in order to prevent missed opportunities. - Prepar e to enhance the matching algorithm so that it provides additional information about data errors to allow for faster resolution; accommodate new priorities for matching: allows for automatic allocation of seats for at -risk students and weightings; has a defined support owner and support procedures for operational assistance and defect resolution; and is cloud -based for increased security and reliability. - Create second five -year strategic plan for My School DC with the Common Lottery Board. My School DC's operating budget comes from a variety of sources, including local, federal and intra-district contributions to support personnel and non -personnel costs. The table below compares the FY19 and FY20 approved budgets: Funding Source PS vs Budget* Approved FTE FY 2020 Approved FTE My School DC LOCAL 7.0 * MSDC' operating budget includes additional funding sources (i.e. federal & intra -district). The total revised FY20 budget for MSDC is approximately $2.55M. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 181 Q69: Provide the Committee with the following data for each My School DC lotteries operated for SY 18-19 and SY 19-20: (a) The number of participating schools; (b) The total seats are available broken down by school/campus and grade level at the beginning of the lottery period; (c) The number of applications were submitted by the first deadline; (d) The match rate for applications submitted in the first round (i.e., how many families got their first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on); (e) The percent of families that accepted their match; (f) The average number of schools parents/guardians select (12 being the most); (g) The number of seats that were still available at the end of the lottery p eriod broken down by school/campus and grade level; and (h) A response to if the system is more streamlined and transparent with only one round (versus two in previous years). RESPONSE: Q69 Attachment - MSDC (a -d, f and g).xlsx (e) The percent of families t hat accepted their match; My School DC tracks the percentage of applicants that enroll (accept a seat) at schools where they were matched or made a waitlist offer through the common lottery system, yet only some students who receive an opportunity to enroll in a school from the lottery actually do so. For the 2018 -19 school year, it was approximately 8800 out of the roughly 16,000 (58 percent) of initially matched students that accepted their offer . Also, approximately 3,300 students enrolled in a DC PS or public charter school based on a waitlist offer. Note that these students could have also received an initial match that they later declined. A remaining 9,000 students declined an opportunity to enroll, whether that enrollment offer stemmed from an initial match or a waitlist offer. These data are not yet available for the 2019 -20 school year. (h) A response to if the system is more streamlined and transparent with only one round (versus two in previous years). In FY15, the My School DC team recommended and the Common Lottery Board voted to eliminate Round 2 in the lottery and replace it with a ranked post -lottery application. This change has expedited results for families and schools after the main lottery round . Families have applied earlier each year (i.e. a higher percentage of applications in before the deadline). The family can see their results and waitlist position in real -time after the initial lottery round, increasing and expediting transparency. In ord er to maintain the \"waitlist cleaning\" function that Round 2 formerly served for schools, we implemented a ranking feature in the post -lottery period. Schools can advertise and fill open seats more quickly with this round structure. My School DC has receiv ed no negative feedback since the implementation of this change several years ago. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 182 Q70: Describe My School DC's efforts to provide training and outreach to D.C.

What new work was completed in FY19? Please also describe the training made available to LEAs on crisis response and intervention and which LEAs participated. RESPONSE : OSSE has continued to collaborate with DC Department of Health (DC Health) and DC Department of Behavioral Health (DBH) in the development and delivery of services to children and youth in the District. In FY19, the system of care efforts and holistic ap proaches to student health in the District have continued and expanded through the work of the Coordinating Council on School Behavioral Health. The goal of the expansion of the School Behavioral Health Program is to integrate school and community -based pr ovider services to ensure all schools provide prevention, intervention, and intensive mental health supports. Led by DBH, the four -year expansion effort is in partnership with education agencies, schools, community providers, parents, youth, and education advocates. Leadership from OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness serve as members of the Coordinating Council and as co -chairs for the implementation and data/evaluation sub - committees. The implementation committee, comprised of leadership from OSSE's Div ision of Health & Wellness, DBH, DCPS, and DC Health, is focused on identifying the mental health needs assessment for the District, scoping out the sequence of implementation tasks for executing the expansion plan, and establishing standard benchmarks for year to year. The selected needs assessment - the School Strengthening Tool - was adapted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) School Health Index and is a self -assessment and planning guide tha t enables school teams to: identify the strengths and weaknesses of the school's policies and programs for promoting health and safety; develop an action plan for improving student health and safety; and involve teachers, parents, students, and the community in improving school policies, programs, and services OSSE members of the implementation committee operationalized the self -assessment process, created online accounts for School Behavioral Health Coo rdinators and CBO Clinicians, provided individualized communication to each school/CBO partner, and developed an annual work plan template. Each work plan submitted by a school/CBO partner indicated self - assessment scores in four areas: (1) School Counseli ng, Psychological, and Social Services; (2) Social and Emotional Climate; (3) Employee Wellness and Health Promotion; and (4) Family Engagement. Four additional open -ended questions outline the current mental health needs of the school and the resources av ailable to support improvements. The work plan outlines the school's FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 189 goals for the year across the three tiers of intervention - prevention and mental health promotion, early intervention, and direct services. The work plan supports coordination and collab oration among all of the behavioral health providers within each school, and assists with goal alignment and reducing duplication of services. The data/evaluation sub -committee led and made recommendations to rank schools according to mental health need, and track progress towards defined outcome goals. Additionally in FY19, OSSE and DBH completed infrastructure development for Project Advancing Wellness and Resilience Education (AWARE), a five year $8.8 million dollar grant awarded to OSSE by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This grant opportunity, which complements the significant local investment in school mental health, allows OSSE and DBH to deepen the partnership with three large LEAs (DCPS, KIPP, and Fr iendship Public Charter School) to support the development of multi -tiered systems of mental health supports for students, educators, and school communities. Trauma - responsive practices and family engagement are key elements of the model of care. In FY1 9, OSSE and DBH hired key personnel to support 15 Project AWARE schools to increase their readiness and ability to implement the multi -tiered model of prevention, early intervention, and treatment services. OSSE also selected the Center for Health and Heal th Care in Schools (CHHCS) and faculty from the Department of Prevention and Community Health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at The George Washington University, to support first year data collection initiatives. The GW team supported OSSE in conducting a baseline evaluation on students' self -reported access to a trusted adult and knowledge of campus safety net team members. The team also provided technical assistance to LEA teams on their mental health referral flow process. Both local a nd federal investments supported the selection of CHHCS to execute the District's school -based behavioral health Community of Practice (DC CoP). The DC CoP advances the citywide school behavioral health expansion and Project AWARE by inviting school behavi oral health coordinators and community -based clinicians to participate in a peer learning environment aimed at building the capacity to implement high -quality school -based behavioral health systems. The DC CoP served as an essential link to and across mult iple District efforts focused on school -based behavioral health. In September 2019, the DC CoP hosted the official launch event for city leaders, LEA and school administrators, and school - and community -based behavioral health providers. This event was use d to further identify best practices and strategies for building a comprehensive school behavioral health system, areas of concern, excitement, challenges, strengths, and needs related to the city -wide behavioral health expansion as reported by attendees. On the subject of training and trauma -informed practices, OSSE invested in train -the-trainer certification for staff members in non -violent crisis prevention and intervention (CPI), and, in partnership with the Mayor's Office, Mental Health First Aid (M HFA). These investments allow OSSE to offer CPI and MHFA certifications to school leaders, educators, and out -of-school time providers. OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness has scheduled bi -monthly CPI and quarterly FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 190 MHFA training sessions for the 2019 -2020 school year. Additionally, OSSE collaborated with DBH to develop a series of webinars for principals. The webinars focused on crisis prevention and intervention, multi -tiered intervention framework, and strategies for multi -disciplinary student support te aming practices. Lastly, OSSE and DBH continued to collaborate with Kognito on communication and compliance strategies related to behavioral health training requirements in FY19. For further information regarding other trauma, behavioral health, restorat ive justice, and crisis prevention trainings, please see OSSE's response to Q33 and Q34. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 191 Q74: Provide the key findings of the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and include how many students participated in the survey. Please also discuss any changes or improvements that were made to YRBS questionnaire or administration for SY 18 -19. Please also discuss steps OSSE will take to review and share YRBS data with schools and stakeholders, including translating data to action. RESPONSE: The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is administered biennially to District public and public charter middle and high schools. In FY19, OSSE administered the 2019 YRBS to 107 District middle and high schools. Following internal review and data analysis, OSSE plans to release the 2019 DC YRBS Report in spring 2020. While the 2019 data collection efforts were underway, OSSE continued to utilize data collected from the 2017 YRBS to support and inform health behaviors of District youth, including releasing of new resour ces for schools, students, and families; providing presentations to local and national partners; and continuing YRBS data sharing partnerships with District government agencies to support research and collaborative utilization of the data. More details are provided below. Administration of the 2019 YRBS In the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE partnered with a vendor to administer the 2019 YRBS between the months of February and June. OSSE continues to be one of the few states in the country to administer the YRBS using a census methodology, rather than a sample methodology. By collecting YRBS data using this approach, OSSE is able to collect a uniquely rich dataset, allowing for statewide disaggregated subgroup analysis. While parents and guardians may return a simple opt -out form to their child's school to exemp t them from the survey, and each student is free to choose whether to complete the survey, OSSE aims to administer it to every middle and high school student in the District, resulting in high participation rates. With the passage of the LGBTQ Health Data Collection Amendment Act of 2018, all public and public charter middle and high schools are now required to participate in the YRBS, which helped OSSE achieve higher participation rates in the 2019 survey administration. In this administration cycle, 107 of the 115 eligible public and public charter middle and high schools administered the survey, with 23,244 District students participating. The school participation rate increased significantly from 85 percent to 93 percent at the middle school level betw een 2017 and 2019. The percentage of students completing the survey also increased at both the middle and high school levels, by seven percent at participating high schools and by two percent at participating middle schools. These increases in participatio n led to higher overall response rates (calculated by multiplying the school participation rate by the student response rate) in the 2019 YRBS cycle, with a gain of eight percent at both the middle and high school levels. See the table below comparing 2017 to 2019 participation rates. 2017 vs. 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey Response Rate FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 192 For the 2019 YRBS, OSSE made several strategic updates to the survey questionnaire, data collection process, and plans for school -level data sharing. Changes to the survey questionnaire were informed by input from OSSE's School -Based Health Data Working Gr oup, a collaborative cohort of stakeholders from DCPS, Public Charter School Board (PCSB), Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), DC Health, and various youth -focused advocacy organizations and community based organizations in the District. At the guidan ce of the School -Based Health Data Working Group and in response to changes in local discipline legislation, OSSE amended the both the middle and high school survey questionnaires. Questions related to personal appearance (gender expression), dating and relationships, demographics, and discipline were added to the middle and high school surveys. These additions were made to more fully capture the LGBTQ community, dating violence and abuse, and school discipline practices experienced by youth. The followin g multiple -choice questions were added to the 2019 middle school and high school YRBS questionnaires: Middle School (MS) or High School (HS) Survey Question Answer choices HS During the past 12 months, how many times did someone do sexual things to you that you did not want to do by pressuring you, lying to you, making promises about the future, threatening to end your relationship, or threatening to spread rumors about you? 0 times, 1 time, 2 or 3 times, 4 or 5 times, 6 or more times HS & MS A person' s appearance, style, dress, or the way they walk or talk may affect how people describe them. How do you think other people at school would describe you? Very feminine, mostly feminine, somewhat feminine, equally feminine and masculine, somewhat masculine, mostly masculine, very masculine Administratio n Year # Eligible High Schools # Schools Participating # School Refusals School Participation Rate # Students Enrolled # Students Participating #Questionnaire s Usable after data editing Student Response Rate Overall Response Rate High School 2017 37 34 3 92% 12,863 77% *The overall response rate is calculated by multiplying the school participation rate by the student response rate . FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 193 Middle School (MS) or High School (HS) Survey Question Answer choices HS & MS During the past 12 months, how many times did someone you were dating or going out with purposely try to control you or emotionally hurt you?

(Include in -school suspension, out - of-school suspension and expulsion). 0 times, 1 tim e, 2 or 3 times, 4 or 5 times, 6 or more times MS Have you ever been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when you did not want to? Yes, No MS During the past 12 months, have you seen or heard people where you live be violent and abusive? (This i s not 'play fighting' but could include serious hitting, shouting, throwing items, yelling, or name calling.) Yes, No MS When was the last time you saw a dentist for a check - up, exam, teeth cleaning, or other dental work? During the past 12 months, betwee n 12 and 24 months ago, more than 24 months ago, never, not sure In 2019, OSSE also piloted a slightly modified version of a question pertainin g to identifying as transgender on the middle school questionnaire . This question was adjusted for a lower read ing level. The modified question is below: Middle School (MS) or High School (HS) Survey Question Answer choices MS A transgender person is someone who does not feel the same inside as the sex they were born with. Are you transgender? No, I am not transgender; yes, I am transgender; I do not know if I am transgender; I do not know what this question is asking In addition to these changes, OSSE also translated the YRBS middle and high school surveys into Spanish for the first time since taking over administration of the YRBS in 2007. Reporting on the 2019 YRBS OSSE received the 2019 YRBS raw and weighted data files from analysts at CDC in December 2019. Consistent with OSSE's commitment to provide timely, actionable data to stakeholders, the agency will publish the results of the 2019 survey to guide policy interventions and direct supports that can make a real , positive difference in the lives of the District's youngest residents. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 194 OSSE publicly shared 2019 YRBS summary data files in January 2020 outlining District aggregate respons e rates for all questions. In spring 2020, OSSE will release the 2019 DC YRBS Report outlining 2019 statewide analysis and results alongside ten -year trend data. At the same time, OSSE will distribute aggregate LEA -and school -level data files to participat ing LEAs in an effort to help administrators understand their students' unique health risks. This is done to support LEAs in understanding the health of their student populations so that they may formulate targeted interventions, policies, and actions as a result of the data. OSSE will expand its LEA - and school -level 2019 reports to include LEA and school aggregate data for every survey question rather than a subset of questions, as was done in 2017 when OSSE first delivered this level of reporting to LEAs and schools. Additionally, OSSE will continue to create and release YRBS resources, presentations, and factsheets using 2019 YRBS data to support LEAs and schools on key health risks identified in the YRBS by providing additional targeted analysis of sp ecific issue areas and recommend community - and school -based resources available to support students in those areas. OSSE plans to continue utilizing YRBS data to drive technical assistance priorities at the District level in addition to targetin g needs ac ross particular LEAs. FY19 Resources, Presentations, and Research Supported by 2017 YRBS Data OSSE's primary strategy for addressing the health issues identified through the YRBS is to create linkages between schools and community -based youth development organizations and sister government agencies that are working on the ground to address a range of emotional, social, and mental health concerns (e.g., violence, suicide attempts, substance use). OSSE's goal is to utilize and share its health data and to c reate and sustain partnerships that contribute to the prevention and early intervention necessary to promote positive health behaviors and outcomes for all District youth. In FY19, OSSE published a new YRBS factsheet highlighting important sexual health d ata from the 2017 YRBS. This new factsheet compares local and national YRBS trends related to sexual health risk behaviors and offers a list of community - and school -based sexual health resources available to students, families, and schools in the District . This new factsheet complements two earlier factsheets released in FY18 that highlight key 2017 YRBS data and resources related to school attendance and mental health. All three factsheets and other YRBS resources were distributed to schools, community pa rtners, and at public events or presentations. They are als o available on the OSSE website . OSSE plans to produce new public -facing reports, factsheets, resources, and presentations in FY20 utilizing 2019 YRBS data. Additionally, in FY19 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) utilized 2017 YRBS data collected in the District and 18 other states or large urban school districts to create a research brief on the violence, victimization, substance use, suicide risk, and sexual behaviors among high school transgender youth in the United States. The inclusion of the District's data in this research brief was made possible because of OSSE's continued incorporation of questionnaire related to sexual orientation, gender identify, and gender expression in the DC YRBS. Collecting these data supports the District's collective goal to improve awareness and FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 195 acceptance of LGBTQ youth and to direct programming to address their unique needs. This LGBTQ data is especially rich in the District because OSSE administers the YRBS using the census methodology, with a goal of reaching every student attend ing a public or public charter middle or school. The research brief is available on the CDC website . OSSE is also committed to making YRBS data available to District government agency pa rtners, such as DC Health. By sharing these data, OSSE and DC Health are able to better understanding the risk behaviors among District youth and improve research, programming, supports, and outreach to youth. Through a data sharing agreement with OSSE, DC Health analyzed 2017 YRBS data in FY19 to identify risk factors related to exchange sex among District high school students. DC Health presented this research at the National Epidemic Intelligence Service Conference in May 2019 and it is available on the CDC website . In FY19, OSSE's Division of Health & Wellness continued to share results of the 2017 YRBS through a series of presentations and workshops at the local an d national level. At the local level, OSSE presented YRBS findings to child health providers at Children's National Health System through a series of three meetings. OSSE also shared 2017 YRBS findings with citywide stakeholders and practitioners at a regu larly-held Epidemiological Outcomes Working Group meeting hosted by the Department of Behavioral Health. In addition to this, OSSE led an interactive workshop with District school social workers at the School Social Work Association 2019 annual conference. OSSE also met with a group of student activists at Thurgood Marshall Academy called Pathways 2 Power. At this meeting, OSSE shared youth risk behavior data points and heard student input on school climate, school safety, and gun violence. Finally, OSSE hosted two community -wide meetings where YRBS data was utilized in an effort to create and sustain partnerships: the annual OSSE School Health Summit and the fall 2019 School -Based Health Data Working Group meeting. In addition to local presentations and w orkshops, OSSE expanded its outreach in FY19 to national stakeholders through several webinars and in -person presentations. The purpose of this effort was to share OSSE's best practices regarding YRBS data collection, analysis, and reporting with national stakeholders. OSSE also intended to demonstrate the value of the YRBS as a tool to monitor health risk behaviors and to build data -driven school health supports. In FY19, OSSE presented on the 2017 DC YRBS at the American School Health Association (ASHA) N ational Conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. OSSE also presented on multiple national webinars hosted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National coalition of STD Directors.

(d.) Detail any technical assistance OSSE provides to organizations implementing these programs. OSSE provides technical assistance for schools participating in the School Nutrition Programs, which include th e School Breakfast Program (SBP), National School Lunch Program (NSLP), Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), Afterschool Snack Program, Special Milk Program (SMP), Farm to School, and Food Distribution. All School Food Authorities (SFAs) are provided supports which include content -specific materials and resources, guidance documents, webinars, and in -person trainings. In addition to this, at least one -third of District SFAs receive more targeted supports which includes off -site and on -site review and technical assistance of their school nutrition programs. At the request of SFAs and as identified by OSSE, an additional subgroup of SFAs receive highly customized support that includes in -depth and targeted technical assistance, review, and direct coach ing. OSSE's Nutrition Program team provides additional technical assistance to any SFA that requests support throughout the year. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 199 Similar technical assistance is given to all SFSP sponsors and all CACFP participants and sponsors. Coordinated training happens monthly with OSSE's Division of Early Learning, which allows for a broader reach to program participants. In FY19, OSSE continu ed to administer the DC Healthy Tots Act and additional non -participating child development facilities were provided assistance to help them start CACFP in their organization, which has continued in FY19. This work is further detailed in the annual 2019 OSSE CACFP Report . OSSE continues to engage with Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) sponsors to gather feedback on how the state agency can better assist them. Based on these surveys, OSSE continues to evolve the annual SFSP sponsor training to focus on topic areas that sponsors identify as challenges and opportunities to enhance participation in and quality of the program.. Training during FY20 will also be divided into experienced sponsors and new sponsors in order to provide targeted assistance. Additionally, technical assistance for the SFSP includes weekly office hours for sponsors to receive individualized assistance. Throughout the summer, OSSE provides weekly SFSP operational tips and guidance via email to encourage sponsor engagement. In preparation for summer 2020, OSSE will lead planning sessions with returning sponsors as well as key agency and organizational partners to develop program improvement and promotion strategies. This wo rk is further detailed in the joint 2019 OSSE -DPR DC Free Summer Meals Report. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 200 Q77: Provide a list of all the school gardens (school, location, grant funding received) for the name of the individual respo nsible for maintaining the garden, any programming as a result, and data on the use of the school gardens. RESPONSE : Q77 Attachment - Schools Gardens.xlsx OSSE primarily collects data on school gardens through the School Health Profile, a self - reported school -based health questionnaire completed annually by all public schools and public charter schools, as required by the Healthy Schools Act (D.C. Official C ode \u00a7 38 -826.02). The School Health Profile data, along with the School Garden Assessment Tool and School Garden Registration data, provide OSSE with a broad picture of the School Gardens Program activities across the District. In the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE received 34 responses to the School Garden Assessment, 95 responses to the School Garden Registration, and 216 responses to the mandatory School Health Profiles. According to the responses submitted to OSSE in the 2019 School Health Profiles, there were 110 public and public charter campuses in the District with active school gardens during the 2018 -19 school year. Beginning with the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE utilized the School Health Profile as its sole data source to calculate the total number of public and public charter schools with gardens in the District. This was done in order to streamline the data collection process for schools and to more accurately validate school garden data. Previously, OSSE used a mixture of survey and site -visit method s to calculate the total number of school gardens, including coordinating with District private schools and schools that did not complete the School Health Profile. In the 2018 -19 school year, OSSE only used School Health Profile data and did not include D istrict private schools or schools that did not complete the School Health Profile in its total of schools with gardens. Due to this, the total number of District schools with gardens appears smaller beginning with the 2018 -19 school year. Schools that in dicated they had a school garden on the 2019 School Health Profile were later sent a link to the School Garden Registration survey to provide more information to OSSE. According to the School Garden Registration data, in the 2018 -19 school year 767 teacher s taught at least five garden -based lessons (an increase of 165 teachers from the 2017 -2018 school year) and 14,743 students were exposed to 10 or more hours of garden -based education (an increase of 126 students from the 2017 -18 school year). FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 201 Q78: According to the data collected and available to OSSE, what is the current compliance rate among LEAs for completing health education and physical education requirements in the District? RESPONSE: According to the data collected from the annual School Health Profile for school year 2018 - 2019: Physical Education Grade Level Physical Education Minute Requirements Number of Schools Meeting Requirement Percent of Schools Meeting Requirement K-5 Average of 150 minutes per week 21 13% 6-8 Average of 225 minutes per week 18 23% Physical Activity Grade Level Physical Activity Minute Requirements Number of Schools Meeting Requirement Percent of Schools Meeting Requirement K-5 50% of Physical Education Minutes devoted to Physical Activity 150 96% 6-8 50% of Physical Education Minutes devoted to Physical Activity 70 90% All data in the School Health Profile are self -reported annually by each District public and public charter school. Ninety -nine percent (99%) of applicable schools (excluding adult education schools and schools that did not participate in the National Scho ol Lunch Program) completed the School Health Profile in 2019. A list of schools that completed the mandatory School Health Profiles is reflected on the OSSE website . OSSE includes the total number of physical activity minutes per week for grades K -12 on the DC School Report Card . The DC School Report Card physical activity total reflects the average minutes per week of student physical activity within both recess and physical education class. Beginning with the 2020 School Health Profile, schools will be required to report their compliance with the new physical education minute requirements, per the Healthy Students Ame ndment Act of 2018. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 202 Q79: What was the average amount of time LEAs dedicated to physical education and health education during SY14 -15, SY15 -16, SY17 -18, and SY18 -19? RESPONSE: According to the annual School Health Profile data, schools dedicated the time outlined below to physical education and health education per Week of Physical Education in Grades K -5 and 6 -8, SY2013 133 SY2018 -2019* 86 144 *Beginning with the 2019 School Health Profile, schools were permitted to report a greater value for their average minutes per week for physical education. Previously, schools could report 0 to 225 minutes per week of physical education. Beginning with the 2019 School Health Profile, schools c ould report 0 to 450 minutes per week of physical education. This change was made at the request of schools that provide a greater amount of physical education per week. Average Minutes per Week of Health Education in Grades K -5 and 6 -8, SY2013 71 SY2018 -2019** 63 117 **Beginning with the 2019 School Health Profile, schools were permitted to report a greater value for their average minutes per week for health education. Previously, schools could report 0 to 125 minutes per week of health education. Beginning with the 20 19 School Health Profile, schools could report 0 to 450 minutes per week of health education. This change was made at the request of schools that provide a greater amount of health education per week. Beginning with the 2020 School Health Profile, school s will be required to report their compliance with the new physical education requirements, per the Healthy Students Amendment Act of 2018. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 203 Q80: Describe OSSE's efforts in FY19 and FY20 to increase participation in the Child and Adult Care Food Program and promote health and wellness through Healthy Tots programming and funding. RESPONSE: The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the Healthy Tots Act provide an important funding stream that not only increases access to food for children in the District, but also supports child development facilities in becoming financially stronger by tapping into available funding sources. CACFP provides nearly 5 million meals to children in the District of Columbia through an investment of approximately $10 million. Most eligible child development facilities in the District participate in the CACFP. OSSE plays a key role in supporting access to balanced and nutritious meals for children in the District. OSSE provides over $50 million per year in local and USDA funding to support schools, child development facilities, adult day cares, summer meal programs, and other programs with healthy meals that feed District of Columbia residents. Through CACF P, child development facilities in the District can be reimbursed for up to four meals per day, which includes local funding for a fourth meal. The Healthy Tots Act ensures facilities have access to CACFP and additional local reimbursements beyond federal funding. The Healthy Tots Act establishes additional local funding for meals (breakfast, lunch, or supper) served by child development facilities that: (1) participate in CACFP ; and (2) meet the USDA meal requirements. These Healthy Tots Act reimbursements are detailed below: Add10 : Child development facilities participating in the CACFP may request an additional 10 cents ($0.10) for each eligible breakfast, lunch, and supper served to an eligible child. ( 5A DCMR \u00a71001.2) Local5 : Child development faciliti es participating in CACFP may request an additional 5 cents ($0.05) per lunch or supper when at least one meal component is comprised of a locally sourced food item, as defined in section 101(3) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38 -821.01) and unprocessed foods, as defined in section 101(10)(A) of the Healthy Schools Act of 2010 (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 38 -821.01) . Locally grown and unprocessed foods include milk. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.4 -5) Day4 : in CACFP that have maximized the number of daily meal services eligible for CACFP reimbursements allowed two (2) meals and one (1) snack or one (1) meal and two (2) snacks, reimbursements from the Healthy Tots Fund are made available to facilities for an additional meal to each enrolled and participating child, if 75 percent of the children enrolled and attending the child development facility are District residents and at least 50 percent of the enrolled and attending children are eligible for sub sidized child care. (5A DCMR \u00a71001.7) The Healthy Tots Act requires licensed child development facilities to participate in CACFP if 50 percent or more of enrolled children are eligible for subsidized child care for at least six FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 204 continuous months (D.C. Of ficial Code \u00a7 38 -282.01(a)). Facilities that are mandated to participate in CACFP receive extensive outreach and technical assistance from OSSE if they are not yet enrolled, including: Initial and subsequent notifications from OSSE outlining participation requirements and options for the facility; Introductory in -person technical assistance visit and orientation with the facility to provide face -to-face assistance with Healthy Tots Act and CACFP compliance; Training and reoccurring technical assistance fr om OSSE throughout the entire CACFP application process, including a minimum of two in -person technical assistance visits during the full application process; and Individual and group CACFP trainings for child development facilities at individual facilitie s and OSSE headquarters. Beyond working directly with child development facilities to enroll in CACFP, OSSE also provides support and guidance to facilities on health and wellness, including through OSSE's Step by Step Guide for Implementing Wellness Guidelines , direct technical assistance on health initiatives, and wellness challenges for child development facilities to educate them on the Wellness Guidelines. The Wellness Guidelines serve as a rubric for facilities to establish a high - quality environment of to tal wellness for children in facilities and may be used as a tool for creating a wellness policy action plan. The Wellness Guidelines cover six topics: 1. Providing effective nutrition and healthy eating education 2. Serving tasty, healthy meals 3. Promoting physical activity 4. Enhancing facility environmental sustainability 5. Ensuring wellness professional development for staff 6. Partnering with families to promote facility wellness Additionally, in FY19 the Healthy Tots Wellness Grant awarded $526,558 to five com munity based organizations to support the dissemination of healthy eating, physical activity, and wellness programming in the District's early child care community. These five community based organizations touched over 60 child development facilities with programming and/or the Early Learning Market Share. Grantees targeted facilities in Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and served over 2,600 children, staff, and families in FY19. The OSSE Division of Health and Wellness Healthy Tots Program and the Healthy Tots Wellness Grantees led the following initiatives to increase participation healthy eating and promote health and wellness within the District's child development facilities: Training and technical assistance for increasing the amount of local food items purchased for meal programs and menu planning; FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 205 Biweekly deliveries of fresh local produce to 42 child development facilities through the Early Learning Market Share program, so facilities can serve l ocally grown and locally processed or unprocessed foods at least once per week during breakfast, lunch, or snack; Offering approximately 850 hours of technical assistance and training provided to child development facility staff on implementing structured programming and procuring materials and supplies; Coaching on developmentally appropriate and structured nutrition education and/or physical activity programs; Providing garden design maps, planting plans and materials, and age -appropriate curricula for ch ild development facilities to integrate garden - and nature -based play into early learning classrooms; Onsite training and technical assistance to implement family -style dining mandated by CACFP; Targeted assistance to support coordination of health and wel lness family engagement events, experiences, and outreach; Targeted support for implementing a staff wellness program to support nutrition, physical activity, mindfulness, stress management, and the formation of healthy habits; Piloting the USDA CACFP Inf ant Meal Pattern Training, providing participants with detailed guidance on serving infant meals, including parents in the center meal program and supporting breastfeeding in child development facilities and homes; and Disseminating CACFP meal training too lkits to support CACFP staff in providing tailored and comprehensive technical assistance to participants. In October 2019, the OSSE Division of Health and Wellness hosted the Healthy Tots Wellness Grant Symposium at the OSSE headquarters. The purpose of the Symposium was to reflect on the activities that took place during the inaugural Healthy Tots Wellness Grant period. This event provided a space for approximately 40 attendees and grantees to dialogue on the state of Early Childhood Wellness in the Dist rict through reflection on best practices and lessons learned and an exploration of potential future collaborations. OSSE leadership and division members, child development facilities, past grant applicants, community based organizations, and national partners were all invited to the Symposium. Poster presentations and moderated panel presenters included staff from American University, City Blossoms, Community Foodworks, Good Karma (The Center for Social and Emotional Wellness), and Washington Tennis and Ed ucation Foundation. More details on CACFP are available in the 2019 OSSE CACFP Repor t and more details on the Healthy Tots Program are available on the OSSE website . FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 206 Q81: The following questions are in reference to the Youth Suicide Prevention and School Climate Survey Amendment Act of 2016. (a) Section 3 requires the implementation of a pilot program for collecting school climate data through surveys. Provide the number of sc hools that participated in the pilot program for each year of the pilot (b) Describe any challenges with the implementation of the current pilot. (c) Describe any school climate surveys that OSSE currently administers and what they measure. (d) What measures is OSSE taking to comply with the recommendation requirement in the Youth Suicide prevention and School Climate Survey Amendment Act of 2016? RESPONSE: (a) Section 3 requires the implementation of a pilot program for collecting school climate data through surveys. P rovide the number of schools that participated in the pilot for each year of the pilot. Beginning in SY2016 -17, OSSE implemented a pilot school climate survey program at select public and public charter schools in the District. OSSE partnered with Child T rends, Safe School Certification, and the DC Office of Human Rights to utilize a school climate survey tool developed by the U.S. Department of Education to fulfill the pilot program requirements. OSSE is in its fourth and final data collection and grant funding cycle for the sc hool climate pilot. In SY2016 -17, 26 schools participated in the pilot school climate survey (17 DCPS , 9 Public Charter); in SY2017 -18, 18 schools participated in the pilot school climate survey (11 DCPS , 7 Public Chart er); in SY201 8-19, 12 schools participated in the pilot school climate survey (7 DCPS, 5 Public Charter); and in SY 19-2020, it is anticipated that 9 schools will participate in the pilot school climate survey (7 DCPS , 2 Public Charter) (b) Describe any challenges with the implementation of the current pilot. It is important to note that the pilot program is intended to provide insight and essential takeaways that could inform a plan to develop an expanded school climate survey tool. The data is not a complete, census level, representation of school climate in the District. Because schools voluntarily choose to participate and there is no random selection process, the pilot survey sample is not representative of all students served in the District. The annual 2019 School Climate Report analyzes data across all participating schools. The report includes an introduction of the relevant statute, an overview of school climate policy and programs undertaken by OSSE, a brief analysis of the administration of the survey, notable findings of th e survey, and recommendations on next steps. The appendix of the report includes the pilot school climate survey questionnaire. This pilot program informed OSSE's work in developing a plan to expand school climate surveys to all public and public charter s chools serving grades 6 -12. This plan was submitted to the DC Council in December 2019. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 207 In the four years of administration, OSSE and its partners have collected valuable feedback from schools and insights on subjects such as ease of survey administration and administration tools, communication with school leadership and families, barriers to scheduling survey administration, testing and data collection fatigue, and data utilization and application for school climate planning. This information is valuable for understanding why a school may be hesitant to administer a school climate survey and utilize the data for planning purposes. In the first year of the project, 26 schools participated in the pilot school climate survey project, but that number droppe d to 18 schools in the second year and 12 schools in the third year. The schools that withdrew cited changes in school leadership, classroom time burden, staff time burden, and survey/testing fatigue as reasons to withdraw. OSSE and its partners actively engaged directly with these schools, and will continue to actively engage during the fourth and final data collection cycle to coach all remaining schools on the value of participating the project. Additionally, OSSE acknowledges that the collection of th e survey data is only one step in making it useful to schools. Beyond the collection and distribution of data itself, participating schools must be available and willing to review, analyze, interpret, and fully understand the data in order to successfully use it as a school climate planning instrument. In each year of the project, Child Trends has provided the pilot schools with individualized school climate reports and direct engagement, coaching, technical assistance, and scheduling support in an effort to assist schools in understanding and utilizing the data. OSSE has also encountered data collection hurdles due to student data privacy protections under FERPA. The surveys are administered digitally and made available to school leadership. Due to the sensitive data collected through the surveys, OSSE has had difficulty working with a digital survey platform that: (1) can easily collect and produce this data; (2) is affordable for this portfolio; (3) is willing to adhere to requirements under FERPA; and (4) is easy for proctors and students to use and understand. The raw data collected from climate surveys must also be analyzed and suppressed before being shared with school leadership due to sensitivity of responses on issues of race, sexual orientation, or other indicators that may make a student identifiable. Currently, OSSE and Child Trends review, interpret, and clean the raw data. OSSE and Child Trends then present suppressed aggregate data to schools in a format that is usable and easy to understan d. Schools do not receive raw school climate data. (c) Describe any other school climate surveys that OSSE currently administers and what they measure. In FY19, the OSSE Division of Teaching and Learning continued to execute a data -driven approach to supp orting restorative justice in partnership with Restorative DC, a project of SchoolTalk Inc. Through this work, OSSE offered expanded professional development and technical assistance to school leadership teams, encouraging schools to leverage school climat e survey data to build safe and effective learning environments through positive relationships, connection, and accountability. For more information on restorative justice, see Q34. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 208 In FY19, to inform a plan to expand the use of school climate surveys in all public and public charter schools supporting grades 6 -12 beginning in the 2020 -21 school year, OSSE sent a survey to all 37 District LEAs that serve grades 6 -12 to determine their current use or non -use of school climate surveys as defined by the Act. Respondents that indicated they administer a school climate survey were asked to: (1) identify the survey used; (2) note whether the survey instrument covers the domains of environment, engagement, and safety; and (3) indicate whether the instrument used an internet -based platform. OSSE also asked the respondents to identify the biggest challenges in administering a school climate survey, and for those currently administering a survey, OSSE asked those LEAs to share the purposes for which the data are utilized in the school or LEA setting. The high -level results from the survey of LEAs were as follows: 30 (81 percent) of LEAs serving grades 6 -12 responded; Of the 30 LEAs that responded to the questionnaire, 23 (77 percent) indicated they administered a school climate survey in at least one middle or high school; Of the 23 LEAs that administer a school climate survey, 17 (74 percent) indicated that the survey tool that they used included the domains of engagement, safety, and environment; and Of the 23 LE As that administer a school climate survey, 17 (74 percent) indicated that their survey was administered using an internet -based platform. (d) What steps is OSSE taking to further comply with the recommendation requirement in the Youth Suicide prevention and School Climate Survey Amendment Act of 2016? The Youth Suicide Prevention and School Climate Survey Amendment Act requires OSSE to provide a plan to DC Council by December 1, 2019 to expand school climate surveys to DCPS and public charter schools servin g any grade 6 -12, beginning in school year 2020 -21. OSSE met this requirement and submitted the plan to DC Council in December 2019. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 209 Q82: Please provide an update on OSSE's implementation of an environmental literacy program. RESPONSE: Pursuant to the Environmental Literacy Specialist Pilot Program Amendment Act of 2015 (Section 4101 of the FY16 Budget Support Act of 2015) , OSSE continued opportunities and initiatives for District teachers and organizations to advance environmental liter acy in the District, guided by implementation of the DC Environmental Literacy Plan, as described below. Environmental Literacy Leadership Cadre OSSE continued working with its Environmental Literacy Leadership Cadre (ELLC), a group of individuals from e lementary schools across the District who will be responsible for: (1) developing a plan to implement the Environmental Literacy Framework at their schools; and (2) coordinating its implementation. The ELLC meets monthly to discuss environmental education best practices, how the Environmental Literacy Framework supports teaching the Next Generation Science Standards, implementation of school garden and recycling/composting projects, and additional resources available to support schools. There have been thre e cohorts of ELLC since 2016. In March 2019, OSSE successfully recruited 10 new elementary schools for Cohort 3, and began the first year of monthly meetings in September 2019. OSSE continues to engage schools from Cohort 1 (formed in 2016) and Cohort 2 (f ormed in 2018) as \"alumni schools.\" These 30 alumni elementary schools continue to receive limited support from OSSE to ensure continuity and sustainability of environmental literacy efforts for almost 7,300 students. Environmental Literacy Advancement Grants To support environmental programming efforts at the Cadre schools, OSSE offers a grant opportunity for nonprofit organizations, strategically emphasizing the physical environment and community involvement components of the Whole School, Whole Commun ity, and Whole Child (WSCC) model to provide environmental education programs in the areas of air quality/climate change, water, land, resource conservation, or health. In the most recent round of awards, OSSE awarded approximately $215,000 in grants to th ree nonprofit organizations, who partnered with four additional organizations, to support the following: recycling and composting experiences, watershed explorations and American shad (DC's state fish) restoration activities, and school - based studies of ai r pollution and tree canopy. Grantees provided programs to the entire grade level at the cadre schools, as well as some classes at alumni cadre schools. Capital LEAF (Leaders in Environmental Actions for our Future) Program Building upon preliminary work by the DC Environmental Education Consortium, OSSE engaged a stakeholder group to finalize the development of a state -level recognition program for green, healthy, sustainable schools, which will serve as a precursor to national recognition from the U.S. D epartment of Education's Green Ribbon Schools program. OSSE intends to increase visibility of schools' environmental literacy efforts in the areas of energy conservation, schoolyard habitat, health and nutrition, transportation, waste reduction and recycli ng, and physical environment through lenses of administrative leadership, staff involvement, and student FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 210 environmental audits and action projects. OSSE will conduct a field test of the application materials in FY20. In spring 2019, DOEE released the Susta inable DC Plan 2.0, which now includes a section that specifically highlights education as an important component of the District's sustainability strategy. OSSE co -chaired the workgroup that focused on jobs, economy, and education. Education action items included in the Sustainable DC Plan 2.0 directly align with the DC Environmental Literacy Plan and regional environmental literacy goals from the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. In FY20, OSSE will revise the DC Environmental Literacy Plan and provide the new plan and environmental education report to DC Council in September 2020.

Please provide this information for Q86 - I, II, III.xlsx FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 215 Non-Public Tuition Q87: Provide a narrative description on how the budget for Non -Public Tuition is formulated for each Fiscal Year. Which services are funded using this money for each student (i.e. tuition, transportation, etc.)? Who is eligible for funding under non -public tuition? How are students identified and evaluated for use of this funding? RESPONSE: The budget for Non -Public Tuition is established based upon a review of expenditures from three prior years and any rate increases from the placement schools. The OSSE Nonpublic Payment Unit (NPU) is responsible for processing and approving tuition, resid ential services, room and board, various related services, including student evaluations and assessments, and travel expenses between the District residential schools outside of the District, all in accordance with services as documented on the students ' Individual Educational Programs (IEPs). The OSSE Nonpublic Tuition Fund covers costs in three categories related to students, aged 3 - 22, who have been identified by an LEA as eligible to receive special education services under IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 et seq. (2004), that are documented in an IEP: Students who are placed into a nonpublic school by the LEA; Students in the care of CFSA, DYRS, or Court Social Services (CSS) are placed for non - educational reasons and are educated in schools outside of the Dis trict; and; Students who are placed by a Court Order, a Hearing Officer Determination (HOD) or a Settlement Agreement (SA). If an LEA anticipates that a student may require a more restrictive nonpublic school placement, the LEA must notify OSSE to initiate the placement review. If at the conclusion of the placement process the IEP determines a nonpublic school is needed for a student, OSSE is responsible for identifying a location assignment (nonpublic school) for the student. If students are placed for non-educational reasons by sister agencies, such as CFSA, and DYRS, OSSE funds the educational portion of the placement via the Non -Public Tuition budget .

FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 222 Q92: What were the major accomplishments of the Commission in FY19 and FY20 ? RESPONSE: Q92 Attachment - FY19 HELC Quarterly Reports.pdf Major accomplishments of the Higher Education Licensure Commission (HELC) in FY19 are discussed below. In FY19, the Commission received 321 applications (up from 287 in FY18). For information regarding the approval and denial of applications, please see th e Commission's quarterly reports. Engagement with Regulatory Community In FY19, the HELC, serving as the District of Columbia's State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans' education benefits under contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), achieved the highest possible rating of \"Satisfactory\" in the evaluation of the work performed. The Commission revamped the tracking logs to better manage work flow, initiated contact with the DC Apprenticeship Council, and met with Cioffi Consulting to discuss the proposed funding model for all SAAs across the country. Additionally, the SAA Specialist was a panelist during the Association of Veterans Educat ion Certifying Officials conference. The HELC staff responds to hundreds of phone calls and emails monthly from institutions seeking approval, students seeking assistance with locating their academic records, and our regulatory counterparts seeking input on best practice recommendations. As a standard operating practice staff responds promptly and with accuracy. This practice contributes to staff's credibility with the community. The HELC has maintained working relationships with team members at other DC government agencies (Employment Services, Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, Office of the Attorney General, and Mayors Office of Veterans Affairs), as well as the US Department of Education and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, to ensure consistency in practice and compliance with local and federal laws. HELC staff participated in national regulatory conferences/trainings this year in order to meet and learn from our counterparts in other jurisdictions, including: Council on Licensure Enforcement and Reg ulation (CLEAR), the Federation of Associations of Regulatory Boards (FARB), the National Association of State Approving Agencies for Veterans benefits (NASAA), and the National Association of State Administrators and Supervisors of Private Schools (NASASP S). HELC staff serve on committees, special taskforces and participate in focus groups as members of National Association of State Approving Agencies ( NASAA ), the National Association of State Administrators and Supervisors of Private Schools (NASASPS ), Council on Licensure Enforcement and Regulation ( CLEAR ), and State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements ( SARA ). Additionally, the HELC executive director serves as chairperson of the Southern Regional Education Board -State Authorization Reciprocity Agreemen ts (SREB - SARA) steering committee. In FY19, the executive director, by invitation, presented at two national meetings (SARA Annual Conference and State Authorization Network) to share best practices in the areas of distance education regulation, establ ishing cross collaboration with sister regulatory agencies, and ensuring compliance with local requirements and participated in a FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 223 roundtable discussion representing state higher education regulators on the topic of safeguarding academic records. HELC staf f members are subscribed to National Association of State Administrators and Supervisors of Private Schools (NASASPS) Yahoo -groups, SREB -SARA and NASAA listservs, which provide immediate access to receive and share valuable information with counterparts nationwide. The HELC also hosts New Applicant Workshops every other month and provides technical assistance to potential licensees. Additionally, HELC staff members continue to liaise with other regulatory bodies in the District to ensure congruence (e.g. DC Board of Nursing, Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Administration (HEPRA), and the DC Board of Barbering and Cosmetology). Licensure Process In FY 2019, the HELC working in conjunction with the OSSE Office of the Chief Information Technology O fficer, published institution profile pages and updated the Annual Data Survey reporting tool. The Commission also began systems improvements to internal database designed to track and manages the day -to-day operations of the unit. Provided training to th e Commissioners The Commission had one new member this year, who received onboarding training. During Work meetings the Commission welcomed special presentations from HELC staff regarding the GI Bill education benefits, the OSSE Division of Teaching and Learning responsible for teacher credentialing, and a report of the findings of a University of Maryland Masters of Public Policy student who researched the high -demand occupations in the District to correlate the possible education and training needs. Compliance Monitoring As the need arises, staff confront institutions suspected of non -compliance and work to facilitate establishing compliance. Four administrative hearings were held in FY19, Two cases were referred to the Office of the Attorney General , and Several notices of unlicensed activity were sent to institutions found to operating in the District of Columbia without authorization. In addition to denying licensure and applications seeking approval to operate, the Commission has imposed fines t o institutions deemed non -compliant. Seven (7) site evaluations were conducted this fiscal year. Additionally, a standard operating procedure for the site evaluation process was drafted to include the revision of associated forms and policies. The Commission also facilitated the recruitment of and training of site evaluators. The Commission created a databank of 17 qualified evaluators that could potentially serve for the 2020 evaluations. Public Relations and Communication This fiscal year the goal for public relations and communications was to increase the awareness about the Commission's work. This was accomplished in the following ways: FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 224 Published a Commission Actions In -brief through the Commission webpages, and a link to the HELC website is also included in the OSSE LEA Look Forward as well as a mass email communication sent to the HELC authorized institutions and ANCs. Published an Annual Report and Resource Guide . Established a relationship with the education reporter for the Washington Post, should they need a local source to contribute to relevant subject content. Created a link from the Career Pathways site to the HELC site. Regulatory Changes The HELC, through OSSE anticipates promulgating the Commission's regulations governing non-degree and degree granting institutions to reflect postsecondary industry best practices. Updat ing the regulations and codifying operating procedures will clarify and improve the standards used to evaluate institutions and standardize the Commission's procedures. The work will ensure that the Commission is operating based on best practices and will eliminate unnecessary ambiguity.

How much of this allotment has been spent? RESPONSE : OSSE did not award/close any new credit enhancements in FY19 and FY20 as of Dec. 23, 2019. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 231 General Questions Q96: Provide a current organization chart for OSSE and the name of the employee responsible for the management of each office/program. If applicable, please provide a narrative explanation of any organizational changes made during FY19 or to date in FY20. RESPONSE: Q96 Attachment - OSSE Organizational Chart.pdf In FY19, OSSE created a new deputy superintendent role to oversee the agency's Operations, Data, Assessment and Research, and Systems Technology functions. Sara Meyers, former assistant superinten dent for operations, serves as deputy superintendent. This creation of the deputy superintendent role is a recognition of the importance of the work of these three divisions. The purpose of this change is to add leadership capacity to strengthen and improv e coordination in these functions. OSSE recognizes that it is more important than ever that we continue to make significant progress in our technology and data practices. There were no new organizational changes made during FY20 to date. There were also t wo realignments across teams in FY19, both designed to strengthen the management and effectiveness of their respective functions. In May 2019, the Nonpublic Tuition and Medicaid Recovery Unit moved from the Division of Systems and Supports, K -12, into the Division of Operations, which houses the agency -wide finance and administrative functions. This shift was designed to allow for greater alignment across finance -related functions and to allow OSSE to better capture and leverage Medicaid income to accelerat e progress for DC students. The realignment did not result in changes to staffing levels. In September 2019, OSSE finalized a second realignment, shifting the office of Data Management and Applications from the Division of Data Assessments, and Research (DAR), into the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO). This shift was also designed to allow for greater alignment between existing technical resources in support of OSSE's strategic pillar to create and share actionable data. The change did not res ult in changes to staffing levels. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 232 Q97: Provide the agency's performance plan for FY19. Did OSSE meet the objectives set forth in the FY19 performance plan? Please provide a narrative description of what actions the agency undertook to meet the key performance indicators, including an explanation as to why any indicators were not met. RESPONSE : Q97 Attachment 1 - FY19 OSSE Performance Plan.pdf Q97 Attachment Plan.pdf OSSE In FY19, OSSE continued to prioritize and make progress toward achieving several of the strategic objectives outlined in the FY18 performance plan. In conjunction with the release of the 2019 -2023 Strategic Plan, OSSE's objectives were supported by five st rategic initiatives: Accountability System & School Report Card Manage a smooth and effective launch of the school new report cards and STAR accountability system to schools and parents by December 2018. Support schools, parents, and the community in understanding how to use the new tool by developing tools and other resources. Expand access to infant and toddler seats Maintaining the District's investment over a three year period , OSSE will continue to incentivize child development providers to increas e the supply of child care services for infants and toddlers throughout the District, creating 1,000 quality new slots by 2020. OSSE will provide grants that aid in the 1) establishment of new or renovation of existing child development facilities serving infants and toddlers and 2) offer technical assistance and training to child development facility operators to support compliance with the licensure requirements for efficient and effective operations. Maximize the impact of OSSE's grantmaking Maximize how OSSE grants support outcomes for students and families. Internally, this includes implementing intentional and effective systems and a new training initiative to support staff to make, manage, and learn from our grants. Externally, this includes launch ing a forecast to enable strategic planning and engagement for upcoming FY20 grants. Strengthen recruitment Develop new and strengthened supports for managers in response to manager and employee feedback, including a manager training on employee relation s issues (employee discipline, medical and disability - related benefits), regular manager communities of practice, systematic coaching and mentoring opportunities, and a regular manager orientation. Systems and data support for District Residency Framework Expanding and solidify OSSE and Office of Enrollment and Residency (OER) policies, leveraging My School DC for outreach and data insights, and rolling out a first -ever case management system for end - to-end management of residency work streams including ti ps, investigations, and tuition collection. Of these strategic initiatives, those around the STAR Framework and DC School Report Card and agency grantmaking were fully realized in FY19; the remaining three are part of larger, multi -year areas FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 233 of work in w hich the agency continues to devote significant focus in FY20. In expanding access to child care for infants and toddlers, the Access to Quality Child Care Expansion Grant awarded more than $1,500,000 in sub -grant funding between March 2018 and the end of FY19. This significant investment of funds helped child development providers in creating 249 infant and toddler seats in Wards 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8. With regard to recruitment, the OSSE Talent team made strides to strengthen the agency's human capital, insti tuting manager coaching and staff mentoring programs, initiating several new professional development trainings, improving orientation for new staff members, and creating space for staff to support each other through a community of practice. Finally, the O ffice of Enrollment & Residency (OER) embarked on a broader outreach campaign that included a successful digital advertising campaign and the leveraging of community events, including EdFest, to grow awareness of the District's residency policies. OER also continued to add new information for stakeholders to its website, released a handbook to better support LEAs, and conducted data analysis to assess the source of collected tips and failed residency documents. In addition to the five strategic initiatives, OSSE's work also focused heavily on sixteen key performance indicators (KPIs) that represent the most critical functions of the agency. OSSE met eleven of sixteen of these targets and, at the time of writing, still awaits data on two metrics with reportin g cycles that differ from that of the District's fiscal year. The three KPIs that were not met in FY20 were as follows: Percent of all students graduating from high school in four years FY19 GOAL 79% FY19 ACTUAL 66% Statewide graduation rates for the Dis trict decreased year -over-year, primarily as a result of a lower rate within District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS ). Percent of all students at college and career ready level in mathematics on statewide assessment FY19 GOAL 32% FY19 ACTUAL 31% While the percentage of students performing at college and career -ready levels on the state mathematics assessment continued to rise in FY19 , the rate did not yet meet the FY19 goal. Percent of childhood and development programs that meet \"Quality\" and \"High -Quality\" designations FY19 GOAL 55% FY19 ACTUAL 43% Outcomes for this metric shifted in FY19 due to changes in the calculation methodology used in the new Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). 43% reflects the more rigorous Capital Quality system, which relies on observational assessments on a rubri c and replaces the previous accreditation - based \"Going for the Gold,\" which was less stringent. Under Capital Quality, FY19 data was calculated using a numerator representing the number of facilities that earned a Quality or High -Quality designation and a denominator representing the total number of subsidy providing facilities participating in the Capital Quality program. In previous years, this metric used Going for the Gold data. OSSE has implemented and expanded a number of initiatives (outlined above ) to strengthen quality across our subsidy providers and help them meet this new and more rigorous bar. We expect to see these efforts pay greater dividends in future years. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 234 OSSE -DOT Although OSSE DOT did not meet its FY19 target for calls answered, there has been noticeable improvements with a 4.6% increase in performance this year over last year. In Q54, OSSE DOT discusses the steps taken to address some of the most common reasons for calls - early/late bus complaints and missed bus complaints. Further, t here was a 12% increase in the number of miles traveled this school year compared to last year, despite the slight decline in the number of students transported. Although the target was not met, this year's results yielded a 29% decrease in preventa ble accidents per 100,000 over the previous year. OSSE DOT continued to actively recruit school bus drivers and attendants to ensure there are enough staff to cover routes in an effort to offset employee absence, extended leave and staff turnover as well as fluctuating route counts based on student needs. OSSE DOT achieved its highest On-time performance (OTP ) at 93% in March 2019, which is the highest performance in the last three years. In Q57, OSSE DOT discuss the efforts taken to reduce vacancies with regard to drivers and aides. OSSE DOT converted 200 staff from part time to full time in January 2019. This drove up the cost to compensate employees included in this conversion whenever they receive overtime hours. Additionally, all school bus drivers and school bus attendants received a salary increase designed to create pay parody among similarly placed positions. This too results in more accrued overtime costs as needed. Although the variable cost target was not met due to this increase in salaries, there was a much greater positive impact on staff. FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 235 Q98: Provide the agency's performance plan for FY20. 1 - FY20 OSSE DOT Performance Plan.pdf FY2019 Performance Oversight Questions Office of the State Superintendent of Education 236 Q99: Explain the impact on your agency of any legislation passed at the federal level during FY19 or FY20, to date. Please include comment on the recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. RESPONSE : The 116th Congress has not passed authorizing legislation that impacts the agency's work. H.R. 1865 funded federal education programs for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2020. OSSE looks forward to the timely passage of federal appropriations legislation for Fiscal Ye ar 2021. OSSE continues to fulfill its obligations as required by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) as the state education agency. In line with ESSA requirements for states to assess students in grades 3 -5, 6-8, and once in high school in Science, the District of Columbia administered a fully operational assessment in Science in the spring of 2019 and reported results on the assessment in December 2019.

If the matter requires placing the employee on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), the manager may elect to do so within a specified timeframe. The employee may be placed on the PIP for 30, 60, or 90 days to allow them ample time for improvement. If the employee fails to improve their performance during the PIP process, the manager then has the right to reassign, demote, or terminate the employee from their position. Please not e that during this performance cycle, bus drivers, attendants, and attorneys were excluded from the standard citywide performance process.

List and describe any allegations recei ved by the agency in FY19 and FY20, to date, whether or not those allegations were resolved. RESPONSE: OSSE takes claims of sexual harassment or misconduct very seriously. OSSE's procedures for investigating allegations of sexual harassment, or misconduct committed by or against its employees, are consistent with the procedures set forth in Mayor's Order 20 17-313, dated December 18, 2017. In cases where claims are substantiated in part or in whole, OSSE will issue and implement a formal plan of action, which could result in disciplinary action up to and including adverse action and/or removal. When an alleg ation of sexual harassment or misconduct is made, the Sexual Harassment Officer (SHO) or alternative Sexual Harassment Officer (ASHO) is tasked with reviewing the allegation and determining a plan of action. Depending on the nature of the complaint, immedi ate action may be required, such as separating the alleged harasser from the complainant. If immediate action is not required, the SHO or ASHO must move on to interviewing the complainant, harasser, and witnesses. If any follow -up interviews are required , those interviews are scheduled accordingly. The SHO or ASHO will gather all evidence for evaluation, document the investigation, and then report their findings to the agency General Counsel. If further action is required against any individual based on the findings, the agency General Counsel will provide the report to agency leadership and the Mayor's Office of Legal Counsel MOLC. Complaints to EEO Counselors In FY19, there were two (2) complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of sex (which includes sexual harassment & right to breastfeed), gender identity/expression and sexual orientation received by OSSE's EEO counselors. In FY20 to date, there have been zero complaints alleging discrimination on those grounds. It is worth noting that for a llegations of sexual harassment, complainants are able to bypass EEO counseling and file a formal complaint directly with the Office of Human Rights. Additionally, complainants are able to seek EEO counseling, for any of the protected traits, outside of their own agency. These EEO matters were handled by the agency in accordance with policy and protocol.
