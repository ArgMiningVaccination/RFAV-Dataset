Upon confirmation of the risk level, the ICDS Plan must communicate the risk level to the Trans -Disciplinary Care Team. 2.5.3.2.2.6. The ICDS Plan must continuously evaluate a Beneficiary's assignment to the stratification level as it may need to be adjusted over time due to changes in the Beneficiary's need(s), progress in meeting ICP goals and outcomes, etc. 2.5.3.2.2.7. If as a result, a change in the risk stratification level is warranted, the ICDS P lan must identify the reason(s) for changing the Beneficiary's C are M anagement risk stratification level assignment (e.g., achieving goals in the ICP, change in health status, etc.); discuss the proposed action with the Beneficiary and the Trans -Disciplinary Care T eam, as appropriate; provide reasonable notice about the change in the risk level to the Beneficiary and the Trans -Disciplinary Care Team; and revise the communication plan, if necessary. 2.5.3.2.3.

In the interest of administrative simplicity and non -duplication of areas of the ODI authority, ODM 's emphasis is on the assurance of access to and quality of care. ODM will focus only on a limited number of indicators and related standards to monitor plan performance. The five indicators and standards for this Contract period are identified below. The source for each indicator will be the quarterly and annual ICDS Plan cost reports. The report period that will be used to determine compliance will be the annual ICDS Plan cost report. 2.13.3.2. The ODM Methods for ICDS Financial Performance Measures includes information on definitions for and calculations of the following financial performance indicators: 2.13.3.2.1. Indicator: Current Ratio Standard: Current Ratio is not to fall below 1.00 as determined from the annual ICDS Plan Cost Report submitted to ODM. 2.13.3.2.2. Indicator: Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) 118 Standard: If an ICDS Plan has an MLR between eighty - five percent ( 85%) and ninety percent ( 90%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the ICDS Plans, ODM and CMS may require a corrective action plan. 2.13.3.2.3. Indicator: Indicator: Administrative Expense Ratio Standard: Administrative Expense Ratio is not to exceed fifteen percent ( 15%), as determined from the annual ICDS Plan cost report submitted to ODM 2.13.3.2.4.

Failure to meet the standard s above will result in ODM requiring the ICDS Plan to complete a corrective action plan (CAP) and specifying the date by which compliance must be demonstrated. Failure to meet the standard or otherwise comply with the CAP by the specified date will result in penalties as outlined in Section 2.1.6 unless ODM determines that the deficiency does n ot potentially jeopardize access to or quality of care or affect the ICDS Plan's ability to meet administrative requirements (e.g., prompt pay requirements). Justifiable reasons for noncompliance may include one -time events (e.g., ICDS P lan investment in information system products). 2.13.3.3.2. If Financial Statements are not submitted to the ODI by the due date , the ICDS Plan continues to be obligated to submit the report to ODM by ODI's originally specified due date unless the ICDS Plan requests and is granted an extension by ODM . 2.13.3.3.3. Failure to submit complete quarterly and annual Financial Statements on a timely basis will be deemed a failure to meet the standards and will be subject to the noncompliance penalties listed above for the indicators above in Section 2.13.3.2 including those outlined in the 119 Compliance Assessment Policy document . The penalties will take effect at the first of the month following the month in which the determination was made that the ICDS Plan was noncompliant for failing to s ubmit financial reports timely. 2.13.3.3.4.

Descriptions and amounts should be disclosed. Please note that \"significant penalty\" for this purpose is any penalty greater than twenty percent ( 20%). Also, enter the a mortized cost of the investment, the market value of the investment, and the amount of the penalty. 2.13.4. Reinsurance Requirements . Each ICDS Plan must carry reinsurance coverage as required by OAC 5160- 58-01.1(A) and 5160- 26-09 from a licensed commercial carri er to protect against inpatient- related medical expenses incurred by ICDS Beneficiaries. 2.13.4.1.

Any reinsurance agreements which cover expenses to be paid for continued benefits in the e vent of insolvency must include Beneficiaries as a covered class. 2.13.4.8. Reinsurance requirements for partial -risk arrangements may differ from those specified in this paragraph. 2.13.4.9. The annual deductible or retention amount for such insurance must be specified in the reinsurance agreement and must not exceed $100,000.00, unless ODM has provided the ICDS Plan with prior approval in writing for a higher deductible amount or alternate re insurance arrangement. Except for transplant services, and as provided below, this reinsurance must cover, at a minimum, eighty percent ( 80%) of inpatient costs incurred by one Beneficiary in one year, in excess of $100,000.00 unless ODM has provided the ICDS Plan with prior approval in writing for a higher deductible amount or alternate reinsurance arrangement. 2.13.4.10.

If the ICDS Plan does not have more than 75,000 Beneficiaries in Ohio, but does have more tha n 75,000 Beneficiaries between Ohio and other states, ODM may consider alternate reinsurance arrangements. However, depending on the corporate structures of the ICDS Plan, other forms of security may be required in addition to reinsurance. These other se curity tools may include parental guarantees, letters of credit, or performance bonds. In determining whether or not the request will be approved, the ODM may consider any or all of the following: 2.13.4.11.1.

Specifically, the ICDS E nrollment rules, the varying levels o f need of the Beneficiaries , the existing Medicaid waivers , and the alignment of incentives to promote HCBS alternative to nursing facility placement were used to determine the rate structure described within this S ection. 4.2.1.2. Regions : Since the choice of ICD S Plans will vary by region and the underlying service utilization varied by region, the ICDS Plan rates will vary by the regions listed in the rate report . 4.2.1.3. The Rate Cells for the Medicaid Component are stratified by Region, and level of care, as follows: 4.2.1.3.1. Community Well: The Community Well category represents those Beneficiaries who do not meet the nursing facility level of care (NFLOC ) standard (including the transition rul es) as described later in this Section. Within the Community Well category, capitation rates vary by the following age groups: 18 -44, 45-64, and 65+. 4.2.1.3.2. Nursing Facility Level of Care 4.2.1.3.3. The NFLOC category represents those Beneficiaries that are eligible for, or who are enrolled in, one of the Ohio Medicaid home - and community -based (HCBS) wai ver programs (Assisting Living, Choices, Home Care, PASSPORT, and Transitions II) ; or are a long -term NF resident with 100 or more consecutive days in a NF (gaps in NF care of fifteen ( 15) days or less count toward the consecutive day requirement). 4.2.1.3.3.1. The number of NF days is based on Medicare and Medicaid days and includes leave days, which are days when the NFs are paid for a Beneficiary who was discharged from the NF to the hospital but is expected to return to the NF. Once a Medicaid recipient achieves th e 100th NF day (regardless of payor), the Beneficiary will be assigned to the NFLOC rate cell in the subsequent month and the plan would then be paid the higher rate associated with this population. 4.2.1.3.3.2. NF residents that have been in a NF for one hundred (100) or more days immediately preceding that Beneficiary's 133 Enrollment in the ICDS Plan program will be classified into the NFLOC rate cell on the first day of E nrollment. 4.2.1.3.3.3. For the NFLOC rate cell, there is a single rating category for each contracting region. 4.2.1.3.3.4. The rates were developed using data from the following NFLOC population groups: Institutional, Community Waiver ages 18-44, Community Waiver ages 45- 64, and Community Waiver age 65+. 4.2.1.4. Transitional Rules 4.2.1.4.1. Beneficiaries who had met the criteria for inclusion in the NFLOC rate cell, but later do not, will be transitioned to the Community Well rate cell . The ICDS Plan will continue to receive the NFLOC capitation rate for three (3) full months following the change in categorization. Beginning with the fourth month, the plan will receive the Community Well capitation rate. ICDS Plans are required to submit files documenting beneficiaries' eligibility for the NFLOC rate cell and disch arge dates in accordance with specifications provided by ODM. 4.2.1.4.2. Beneficiaries initially in the Community Well category, but who later require care in a NF on a long term basis, will be assigned to the NFLOC rate cell in the month following the Beneficiary 's 100th NF day. 4.2.1.4.3. Beneficiaries initially i n the Community Well category who move to Community Waiver will be assigned to the NFLOC rate cell in the month following the enrollment in the waiver. 4.2.1.5. Member Enrollment Mix Adjustment (MEMA) . To address the potential variations in risk among the participating M yCare Ohio ICDS P lans, the S tate will be using a MEM A for the Medicaid portion of the capitation. A MEMA will enable the State to better match payment to risk by recognizing the relative risk/cost differences of major and objectively identifiable population groups included in each NFLOC rate cell. 4.2.1.5.1. The selected population groups that will be used for this adjustment are as follow s: Institutional, Community Waiver 18 -44, Community Waiver 45-64, and Community W aiver 65+. The MEMA will provide more revenue to ICDS P lans that have a greater proportion of high risk/cost Beneficiaries (Institutional and Community Waiver 18-44 Beneficiaries ) and, conversely, provide less revenue to ICDS P lans that have a lower propor tion of high risk/cost Beneficiaries (Community Waiver 45 -64, and Community Waiver 65+). Being budget neutral, the 134 MEMA will not increase or decrease the State's total amount of committed capitation revenue. This feature will be incorporated into the rate s starting in the fourth month of MyCare Ohio enrollment for each region. 4.2.1.5.2. Updates to the MEMA will be made effective January and July of each year. 4.2.1.5.3. Relative cost factors are assigned to each of the population groups that comprise the NFLOC rate cell. Thes e relative cost factors are developed by comparing the population group rate to the NFLOC rate. For example, if Institutional Beneficiaries cost $4,000, and the NFLOC rate is $2,000, the relative cost factor is 2.00 ($4,000/$2,000). This same process is repeated for every population group that comprises the NFLOC. The development of the relative cost factors is region- specific, where the rate for a population group in a region is compared to the NFLOC for that same region. 4.2.1.5.4. The State will analyze actual ICD S Plan E nrollment data at selected points in time and determine the E nrollment mix of each ICDS Plan. The State will multiply each ICDS Plan's E nrollment mix by the respective relative cost factors to determine each ICDS Plan's Beneficiary risk plan factor. 4.2.1.5.5. The State w ill initially adjust the ICDS Plans' C apitation Rates by the respective Beneficiary risk plan factor applicable to each ICDS P lan. To ensure that the Beneficiary mix adjustments do not increase or decrease the total value of capitation r evenue, the State w ill take a final step to ensure budget neutrality. In this final step, the State w ill compute the total value of capitation revenue before and after the Beneficiary mix adjustment. If the Beneficiary mix adjusted revenue is greater than or less than the pre -mix adjusted revenue, each of the ICDS Plans' rates will be adjusted by a single budget -neutral factor. 4.2.1.5.6. MEMA factors will be determined on a regional basis, where each of the region's NFLOC rates will be adjusted using the E nrollment attraction patterns specific to that region. 4.2.1.5.7. The use of the MEMA factor is subject to change and may be a temporary feature used for the initial rating periods of the program only until another method for accounting for variations in health risk is introduc ed or until it is determined that the population in each ICDS P lan has stabilized to a point where further adjustments for risk/acuity differences are deemed unnecessary . 4.2.1.6. Demonstration Beneficiaries 135 4.2.1.6.1. Enrollment policies, including those for P assive E nrollme nt, are described in Section 2.3. 4.2.1.6.2. Beneficiaries will have the option to choose not to receive Medicare services through the ICDS Plan. 4.2.2. Underlying Rate Structure for Medicare Component of the Capitation Rate 4.2.2.1. Medicare will pay the ICDS Plan a monthly capitation amount for the Medicare Parts A/B services (the Medicare A/B Component), risk adjusted using the Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC Model and the CMS -HCC ESRD Model, except as specified in Section 4.2.5. Medicare will also pay the ICDS Plan a monthly capitation amount for Medicare Part D services, risk adjusted using the Part D RxHCC Model (the Medicare Part D Component). 4.2.2.2. Medicare A/B Component 4.2.2.2.1. The Medicare baseline spending for Parts A/B services are a blend of the Medicare Fee -For-Service ( FFS) standardized county rates and the Medicare Advantage projected payment rates for each year, weighted by the proportion of the target population projected to otherwise be in each program in the absence of the Demonstration. The FFS county rates will generally reflect amounts published with the April Medicare Advantage Final Rate Announcement, adjusted to fully incorporate more current hospital wage index and physician geographic practice cost index information; in this Demonstration, this adjustment will be fully applied to the FFS county rates in 2014, but the adjustment will otherwise use the same methodologies and timelines used to make the analogous adjustments in Medicare Advantage. CMS may also further adjust the Medicare FFS standardized county ra tes as necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration. To the extent that the published FFS county rates do not conform with current law in effect for Medicare during an applicable payment month, and to the extent that such nonconforma nce would have a significant fiscal impact on the Demonstration, CMS will update the baseline (and therefore the corresponding payment rate) to calculate and apply an accurate payment rate for such month. Such update may take place retroactively, as needed . 4.2.2.2.2. Separate baselines will exist for Beneficiaries meeting the Medicare ESRD criteria. For Beneficiaries with ESRD in the dialysis or transplant status phases, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the ESRD dialysis state rate. For Beneficiaries in the f unctioning graft status phase, the Medicare Parts A/B baseline will be the Medicare Advantage 3 .5% 136 bonus county rate (benchmark) for the applicable county as of January 2015 (for CY 2014 the baseline was the 3 -star county rate) . 4.2.2.2.3. Both baseline spending and payment rates under the Demonstration for Medicare Parts A/B services will be calculated as per member per month (PMPM) standardized amounts for each county participating in the Demonstration for each year. Beneficiary risk scores will be applied to the s tandardized payment rates at the time of payment. 4.2.2.2.4. The Medicare A/B Component will be updated annually consistent with annual FFS estimates and Medicare Advantage rates released each year with the annual rate announcement. 4.2.2.2.5. If a Beneficiary elects to receive the Medicare hospice benefit, the Beneficiary may remain in the IC DS Pl an, but will obtain the hospice service through the Medicare FFS benefit and the ICDS P lan would no longer receive the Medicare Parts A/B Component for that Beneficiary as described in this S ection. Medicare hospice services and hospice drugs and all other Original Medicare services would be pai d for under Medicare FFS. ICDS P lans and providers of hospice services would be required to coordinate these services with the rest of the Beneficiary's care. ICDS Plans would continue to receive the Medicare Part D Component for all non- hospice covered drugs. Election of hospice services does not change the Medicaid Component. 4.2.2.3. Medicare Part D 4.2.2.3.1. The Medicare Part D Component is comprised of the Part D direct s ubsidy set at the Part D national average monthly bid amount (NAMBA) for the calendar year , as well as the CMS -estimate d average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts; th ese payments will be reconciled after the end of each payment year in the same manner as for all Part D sponsors. 4.2.2.3.2. The monthly Medicare Part D Component for a Beneficiary can be calculated by multiply ing the Part D NAMBA by the RxHCC risk score assigned to the Beneficiary , and then adding to this the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and federal reinsurance amounts . 4.2.3. Aggregate Savings Percentages 137 4.2.3.1. Aggregate savings percentages will be applied equally, as follows, to the baseline spending amounts for the Medicare A/B Component and the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate herein . 4.2.3.1.1. Demonstration Year 1: 1 % 4.2.3.1.2. Demonstration Year 2: 2 % 4.2.3.1.3. Demonstration Year 3: 4 % 4.2.3.1.4. Demonst ration Year 4: 4% 4.2.3.1.5. Demonstration Year 5: 4% 4.2.3.2. Except as otherwise specified, r ate updates will take place on January 1st of each calendar year. 4.2.3.3. Savings percentages will not be applied to the Part D C omponent. CMS will monitor Part D c osts closely on an ongoing basis. Any material change in Part D costs relative to the baseline may be factored into future year savings percentages. 4.2.4. Risk Adjustment Methodology 4.2.4.1. Medicare Parts A/B: The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be risk adjusted based on the risk profile of each Beneficiary . Except as specified in Section 4.2.5, the existing Medicare Advantage CMS -HCC and CMS -HCC ESRD risk adjustment methodology will be used for the Demonstration. 4.2.4.2. Coding Intensity Adjustment Factor 4.2.4.2.1. In calendar year 2014, CMS will calculate and apply a coding intensity adjustment reflective of all Demonstration Beneficiaries except as indicated in Section 4.2.5. This will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment proportional to the anticipated proportion of Demonstration Beneficiaries in 2014 with Medicare Advantage experience in 2013. Operationally CMS will still apply the coding intensity adjustment factor to the risk scores but will increase the Medicare A/B FFS baseline for non- ESRD Beneficiaries and Beneficiaries with an ESRD status of functioning graft, to offset this. 4.2.4.2.2. After calendar year 2014, CMS will apply the prevailing Medicare Advantage coding intensity adjustment to all Demonstration Beneficiaries . 4.2.4.2.3. The coding intensity adjustment factor will not be applied during the Demonstration to risk scores for Beneficiaries with an ESRD status of dialysis or transplant, consistent with Medicare Advantage policy. 138 4.2.4.3. Medicare Part D: The Medicare Part D national average bid amount will be risk adjusted in accordance with existing Part D RxHCC methodology . The estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost - sharing subsidy and Federal reinsurance amounts will not be risk adjusted. 4.2.5. Medicaid: Fo r the Medicaid Component of the capitated rate, ODM will rely on the methodology described in Section 4.2.1 to account for differences in risk among the eligible population 4.2.6. Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) 4.2.6.1. Medical loss ratio Guarantee: The ICDS Plan has a target MLR of eighty - five percent (85%). 4.2.6.1.1. If an ICDS Plan has an MLR between eighty -five percent (85%) and ninety percent (90%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the ICDS Plans , ODM and CMS may require a corrective action plan. 4.2.6.1.2. If an IC DS Plan has an MLR below eighty -five percent (85%) of the joint Medicare and Medicaid payment to the ICDS Plans, the ICDS plan must remit the amount by which the eighty -five percent ( 85%) threshold exceeds the ICDS Plan's actual MLR multiplied by the total capitation rate revenue of the contract. Any collected remittances would be distributed proportionally back to the Medicaid and Medicare programs on a percent of premium basis. The MLR calculation shall be determined as set forth below; however, ODM and CMS may adopt NAIC reporting standards and protocols after giving written notice to the ICDS Plan . 4.2.6.2. MLR will be based on the 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 422.2400 et seq except that the numerator in the MLR calculation will include: 4.2.6.2.1. All Covered Services required in the D emonstration under Section 2.4; 4.2.6.2.2. Any services purchased in lieu of more costly Covered Services and consistent with the objectives of the Demonstration ; and 4.2.6.2.3. Care Coordination Expense. That portion of the personnel costs for care coordinators whose primary duty is direct Beneficiary contact that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a benefit expense. The portion of the personnel costs for ICDS Plan 's medical director that is attributable to this Contract shall be included as a benefit expens e. 4.2.6.3. The revenue used in the MLR calculation will consist of the Capitation Payments due from ODM and CMS for services provided during the coverage 139 year. Revenue will include amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.3 regardless of whether the ICDS Plan actually receives the amount in Section 4.3.7. 4.2.6.4. Data Submission. The ICDS Plan shall submit to ODM and CMS, in the form and manner prescribed by ODM and CMS, the necessary data to calculate and verify the MLR within seven (7) months after the end of the coverage year. 4.2.6.5. Medical Loss Ratio Calculation. Within ninety (90) days following the six (6) month claims run- out period following the coverage year, ODM and CMS shall calculate the MLR by dividing the benefit expense by the revenue. The MLR shall be expressed as a percentage rounded to the second decimal point. The ICDS Plan shall have sixty (60) days to review the MLR calculation. Each Party shall have the right to review all data and methodologies used to calculate the MLR. 4.2.6.6. Coverage Year. The first cove rage year shall be May 2014 through December 2015. Following December 2015, the coverage year shall be the calendar year. The MLR calculation shall be prepared using all data available from the coverage year, including IBNP and six (6) months of run- out for benefit expense (excluding sub- capitation paid during the run- out months). 4.3. Payment Terms 4.3.1. CMS and ODM will each make monthly, prospective capitation payments to the ICDS Plan . The ODM will categorize Beneficiaries according to the process outlined i n Section 4.2. The Medicaid Component for each RC will be the product of the number of Beneficiaries in each category multiplied by the payment rate for that RC , with a MEMA adjustment . The Medicare Parts A/B Component will be the product of the Beneficiar y's CMS -HCC risk score multiplied by the relevant standard county payment rate (or the ESRD dialysis state rate or the Medicare Advantage 3 -star county rate by the HCC ESRD risk score, as applicable). The Medicare Part D Component will be the product of the Beneficiary's RxHCC risk score multiplied by the Part D N AMBA , with the addition of the estimated average monthly prospective payment amount for the low income cost -sharing subsidy and f ederal reinsurance amounts. 4.3.2. For the Medicaid c omponent of the rate a ll regions will receive a MEMA adjustment after three (3) months of experience, based on an E nrollment snapshot received in the third month of P assive E nrollment. After the initial application, MEMA refreshes will take place semi -annually, starting January 2015 for all regions as reflected in the table in Section 4.1.2. 4.3.3. Beneficiary contribution to care amounts will be deducted from the Medicaid Component of the monthly capitation payment amount . 140 4.3.4. Timing of Capitation Payments 4.3.4.1. The timing of the capitation p ayment will be in accordance with ODM's capitation payment schedule. The payment cycle will be run prospectively and the payment will be released during the current month. 4.3.5. Beneficiary Cost Sharing 4.3.5.1. The ICDS Plan will not charge any premiums for services u nder this Contract. The ICDS Plan will not assess any cost sharing for services beyond the pharmacy cost sharing described herein . 4.3.5.2. For drugs and pharmacy products (including both those covered by Medicare Part D and Ohio Medicaid) , the ICDS Plan will be permitted to charge co-payments to Beneficiaries currently eligible to make such payments. Co -pays charged by the ICDS Plan for Part D and Medicaid drugs must not exceed the applicable amounts for brand and generic drugs established yearl y by CMS under the Part D Low Income Subsidy, although the ICDS Plan may elect to reduce this cost sharing for all Beneficiaries to encourage medication adherence. 4.3.6. Modifications to Capitation Rates 4.3.6.1. CMS and ODM will jointly notify the ICDS Plan in advance and in writing of any proposed changes to the capitation rates , and the ICDS Plan shall accept such changes as payment in full as described in Section 4.4. 4.3.6.2. Rates will be updated using a similar process for each calendar year. Subject to Section 4.2.2, c hanges to the Medicare and Medicaid baselines outside of the annual Medicare Advantage and Part D rate announcement will be made only if and when CMS and ODM jointly determine the change is necessary to calculate accurate payment rates for the Demonstration . Such changes may be based on the following factors: shifts in enrollment assumptions; major changes or discrepancies in f ederal law and/or Ohio policy compared to assumptions about Federal law and/or Ohio law or policy used in the development of baseline estimates ; and changes in coding intensity . 4.3.6.3. For changes solely affecting the Medicare program baseline, CMS will update baselines by amounts identified by the independent Office of the Actuary necessary to best effectuate accurate payment rates for each month. 4.3.6.4. Subject to Section 4.2.2, if other statutory changes enacted after the annual baseline determination and rate development process are jointly determined by CMS and ODM to have a material change in baseline estimates for any given payment year, baseline estimates and corresponding standardized payment rates shall be updated outside of the annual rate development process. 141 4.3.6.5. Changes to the savings percentages will be made if and when CMS and the ODM jointly determine that changes in Part D spending have resulted in materially higher or lower savings that need to be recouped through higher or lower savings percentages applied to the Medicare A/B baselines. 4.3.7. Quality Withhold Policy for Medicaid and Medicare A/B Components of the Integrated, Risk- Adjusted Rat e 4.3.7.1. Under the Demonstration, both CMS and ODM will withhold a percentage of their respective components of the capitation rate, with the exception of the Part D Component amounts . The withheld amounts will be repaid subject to the ICDS Plan 's performance con sistent with established quality thresholds. 4.3.7.2. CMS and ODM will evaluate the ICDS Plan 's performance according to the specified metrics required in order to earn back the quality withhold for a given year. 4.3.7.3. Whether or not the ICDS Plan has met the quality requirements in a given year will be made public. 4.3.7.4. Additional specifications regarding the quality withholds, including more detailed specifications, required thresholds and other information regarding the methodology will be made available in future techn ical guidance. 4.3.8. Withhold Measures in Demonstration Year 1: 4.3.8.1. Table A -2 below identifie s the withhold measures for Demonstration Year 1. Together, these will be utilized for a one percent ( 1%) withhold. 4.3.8.2. Because Demonstration Year 1 crosses calendar and contract years, the ICDS Plan will be evaluated to determine whether it has met required withhold requirements at the end of both CY 2014 and CY 2015. The determination in CY 2014 will be based solely on those measures that can appropriate be calculated based on actual enrollment volume during CY 2014. Consistent with such evaluations, the withheld amounts will be repaid separately for each calendar year.

(Note: Part D payments will not be subject to a quality withhold, however the ICDS Plan will be required to adhere to quality reporting requirements that currently exist under Part D.) 4.3.10. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 4.3.10.1. All payments to the ICDS Plan are conditioned on compliance with the provisions below and all other applicable provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 4.3.11. Suspension of Payments 4.3.11.1. ODM may suspend payments to ICDS Plan s in accordance with 42 C .F.R. 455.23, et seq . as determined necessary or appropriate by ODM . 4.3.12. Transitions between Rating Categories and Risk Score Changes 4.3.12.1. Rating Category Changes 4.3.12.1.1. The Medicaid Component will be adjusted using the methodology described in Section 4.2.1.5. 4.3.12.2. Medicare Risk Score Changes 4.3.12.2.1. Medicare CMS -HCC ESRD , and CMS -RxHCC risk scores will be updated consistent with prevailing Medicare Advantage regulations and processes. 4.3.13. Reconciliation 4.3.13.1. CMS and ODM will prescribe a process to reconcile enrollment and capitation payments for the ICDS Plan that will take into consideration the following circumstances: transitions between rating category ; retroactive changes in eligibility or rating categories ; changes in CMS -HCC and RxHCC risk scores; and changes through new E nrollment, disenrollment, or death. The reconciliation may identify underpayments or overpayments to the ICDS Plan. The ICDS Plan may also report any discrepancies to ODM. The ICDS Plan and ODM will work together to resolve these discrepancies. 4.3.14. Medicaid Component Reconciliation 147 4.3.14.1. The HIPAA 820 (Monthly Remittance Advice) will contain the following: a capitation payment for each Beneficiary listed on the HIPAA 834F, a capitation payment/recoupment for changes li HIPAA 834C, any other capitation payment/recoupment, and deliver payment/recoupment from the previous calendar month. Reconciliation for any discrepancies between the HIPAA 834 and HIPAA 820 is due and must be submitted, as instructed by ODM, no later than sixty (60) days after the issuance of the HIPAA 834F. Please reference the Processing Dates for Calendar Year memo that is issued annually. 4.3.14.2. In the event of changes in the processing dates, the due date will be adjusted accordingly. All r econciliation requests must be submitted in the format specified by ODM. ODM may reject reconciliation requests that are submitted after the due date. Reconciliation requests submitted after the due date will be processed at the discretion of ODM. Recoupme nts, date of death, duplicative payments made to the same plan due to multiple IDs will always be processed . 4.3.15. Medicare Capitation Reconciliation 4.3.15.1. Medicare capitation reconciliation will comply with prevailing Medicare Advantage and Part D regulations and processes. 4.3.16. Audits/Monitoring 4.3.16.1. CMS and ODM will conduct periodic audits to validate RC assignments or other coding. Audits may be conducted by a peer review organization or other entity assigned this responsibility by CMS and ODM. 4.4. Payment in Full 4.4.1. The ICDS Plan must accept, as payment in full for all Covered Services, the Capitation R ate(s) and the terms and conditions of payment set forth herein. 4.4.2.

Data Use Attestation The ICDS Plan shall restrict its use and disclosure of Medicare data obtained from CMS and ODM information systems (listed in Attachment A) to those purposes directly related to the administration of the Medicare/Medicaid managed care and/or outpatient prescription drug benefits for which it has contracted with the CMS and ODM to administer. The ICDS Plan shall only maintain data obtained from CMS and O DM information systems that are needed to administer the Medicare/Medicaid managed care and/or outpatient prescription drug benefits that it has contracted with CMS and ODM to administer. The ICD S Plan (or its First Tier, Downstream or other Related Entities) may not re -use or provide other entities access to the CMS information system, or data obtained from the system or ODM, to support any line of business other than the Medicare/Medicaid manage d care and/or outpatient prescription drug benefit for which the ICDS Plan contracted with CMS and ODM. The ICDS Plan further attests that it shall limit the use of information it obtains from its Medicare -Medicaid Beneficiaries to those purposes directly related to the administration of such plan. The ICDS Plan acknowledges two exceptions to this limitation. First, the ICDS Plan may provide its Medicare -Medicaid Beneficiaries information about non - health related services after obtaining consent from the Beneficiaries . Second, the ICDS Plan may provide information about health -related services without obtaining prior Beneficiary consent, as long as the ICDS Plan affords the Beneficiary an opportunity to elect not to receive such information. CMS may terminate the ICDS Plan's access to the CMS data systems immediately upon determining that the ICDS Plan has used its access to a data system, data obtained from such systems, or data supplied by its Medicare -Medicaid Beneficiaries beyond the scope for which CMS and the ODM have authorized under this agreement. A termination of this data use agreement may result in CMS or ODM terminating the ICDS Plan's Medicare -Medicaid contract(s) on the basis that it is no longer qualified as an ICDS Plan. This agreement shall remain in effect as long as the ICDS Plan remains an ICDS Plan sponsor. This agreement excludes any public use files or other publicly available reports or files that CMS or ODM make available to the general public on their websites.
