We stop pollution to enhance the safety of our drinking water, protect healthy river habitats, and enhance public use and enjoyment. Potomac Riverkeeper Network support SB 0273 to restrict the use and disposal of products that contain PFAS compounds. PFAS is a class of over 9000 chemical compounds that are considered \"forever\" compounds because they do not break down easily. In the last decade, an increasing number of inde pendent research has identified hazards of PFAS contamination to our health . Unfortunately, EPA has yet to fully acknowledge the toxicity of all PFAS chemicals to humans nor has EPA iss ued toxicity standards; therefore, it is left up to the States to protect its citizens from exposure of PFAS pollutants. SB 0273 is a necessary first step in our fight against this new public health risk. Stop the cycle of PFAS contamination. PFAS compounds have been around since the 1950 's. Two particular PFAS pollutants, PFOA and PFOS, were found to be toxic to human s by the 1970s according to researchers at 3M and later by Dupont . These two compounds (PFOA/PFOS) have been put into products that citizens across the world use and therefore have p olluting our environment and poisoning our bodies . The Federal government has known about the toxic nature of PFAS chemicals since 1998 and yet we still do not have adequate protections for the people of this nation. The CDC and The Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have identified four routes of PFAS exposure to our bodies : eating and drinking foods with PFAS, breathing in dust from products with PFAS and applying beauty products to the skin. SB0273 begins to stop the PFAS pollution cycle. PFAS in products that we use everyday flow through our bodies and washed down the drain into public sewer systems . The wastewater treatment plants do not have the ability to filter out PFAS and therefore discharge into rivers and streams through out Marylan d. Sample results collected by Upper Potomac Riverkeeper of wastewater treatment plants in Washington County showed high levels of PFAS with no obvious industrial source . The PFAS cycle continues with public water suppl ies using surface water polluted by PFAS as a public source of drinking water , where PFAS is not filtered ou t. The cycle continues with low-income families keeping fish c aught out of Maryland streams that are polluted with PFAS to feed their families. In October 2021, MDE released a press release about a fish consumption advisory for Piscataway Creek in Prince George's County because of PFAS pollution. The PFAS contamination continues with biosolids from those same wastewater plants containing con centrated PFAS pollutants to be used as fertilizer on our cr ops for human consumption o r to feed our livest ock that eventually pollutants our bodies . Why is this bill needed? It is up to the States to pass laws that will begin to protect people from more PFAS poisoning. The prices of food at the grocery st ore have been increasing more than many families can afford and the use of fast food to feed families has grown exponentially. Th e food wrap pers from fast food chains are just one example of how PFAS is impacting families. Our children are a t greater risk of building up higher levels of PFAS in their blood ; which can complicate their health as they get older , all because they will be exposed to food packaging with PFAS throughout their childhood. We all love the idea of stain r esistant carpets and ru gs so that we can clean those messes up. And we love that clean carpeted area where our children and grandchildren can play at such young ages. But the dust from those stain resistant carpet products are loaded wit h PFAS and breathed in by families unknowingly adding to the PFAS pollution in their s ystem. Firefighters and other first responders in Maryland do not need another reason to be concern about the health and safety of their job. It is already harmful enough to be in the presence of burning buildings and chemicals from cars and planes to also be poisoned by a product that is used frequently for difficult fires. When PFAS chemicals are incinerated, they pollute the air of surrounding communities because PFAS is not destroyed by burning. When PFAS chemicals are landfilled, they can leach into our groundwater, putting our drinking water further at risk. What does this bill do? Stops the use of firefighting foam or AFFF containing PFAS Stops the use of food packaging products that contain PFAS Stops the use of rugs and carpets that have PFAS in the product. Protects o ur air and water from the mass disposal of these products by incineration or landfill. Bill SB0273 is the f irst step for Maryland in stopping the cycle of PFAS contamination and one step closer to better healt h for Maryland citizens. Potomac Riverkeeper Network urge s a favorable report. Brent Walls, Riverkeeper PFAS CHEMICALS - PROHIBITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS (GEORGE 'WALTER' TAYLOR ACT) Bill Sponsor: Senator Elfreth Committee: Education, He alth, and Environmental Affairs Coalition Person Submitting: Cecilia Plante , co-chair Position: FAVORABLE I am submitting this testimony in favor of SB0273 on behalf of the Maryland Legislative Coalition. The Maryland Legislative Coalition is an association of activists - individuals and grassroots groups in every district in the state . We are unpaid citizen lobbyists and our Coalition supports well over 30 ,000 members. PFAS chemicals are 'forever chemicals' since they never break down. PFAS chemicals are used in firefighting foam, food packaging, rugs and carpets. They are polluting our drinking water and are accumulating in our bodies. They have been linked to cancer and other serious illnesses. This bill, if passed, would prevent the mass incineration or landfilling of PFAS chemicals. It would also prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of products containing PFAS chemicals, such as rugs an d carpets, food packaging and firefighting foam. We are poisoning ourselves and our children. Think of the future effects of this poison as it continues to accumulate in our children. We must stop the use of these toxic chemicals immediately. We suppor t this bill and recommend a FAVORABLE report in committee . SB0273_ Favorable PFAS Written FAVSB0273: Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee February 2nd, 2022 Claire Miller, Maryland Campaign for Environmental Human Rights FAVORABLE Chairman Senator Pinsky , Vice-Chair Senator Kagan, and members of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee I'm writing to ask for you to vote for and pass SB0273, because PF AS contamination poses serious risks for the public health of Marylanders. As citizens, we rely on our government to protect us from harm in our environment and from the goods and services we consume. It is very disturbing that PF AS, also known as forever chemicals, have infiltrated our drinking water and our seafood in Maryland, and the public is exposed to these chemicals in consumer products like cookware and in food packaging. The federal government failed to regulate these chemicals, so it is up to the state to act. The Maryland Department of the Environment found PF AS in 75% of the drinking water it tested. W e also know of contamination in and around more than a dozen military sites in the state and in seafood and oysters in our creeks. Recent studies also found high levels of PF AS chemicals in seafood, drinking water , and at various military sites in Maryland . Exposure to PF AS is linked to cancer and other severe illnesses including liver and kidney disease, hormone disruption, immune suppression, reproductive problems and developmental issues. Other states have already taken action and it is time for Maryland to do the same. SB0273 restricts the use and disposal of PF AS chemicals in Maryland Stops the use of PF AS in firefighting foam (like CA, CT , IL, ME, NH, NY , VT, WA), food packaging (like CA, CT , ME, MN, NY , VT, WA), and in rugs and carpets (like Lowes and Home Depot). In all of these areas there are safer alternatives to PFAS. Protects our air and water by banning the mass disposal of these chemicals by incineration (NY) and landfilling (CA). Requires disclosure that firefighter gear contains PF AS when selling it in the state including jackets, pants, shoes, gloves, helmets and respiratory equipment. The public in Maryland depends on our government to protect us from harmful chemicals. W e have evidence of both the harm these chemicals cause and that it exists in our drinking water and our food supply . Your constituents and the people of Maryland are relying on you to take action and restrict the use and disposal of PF AS chemicals in Maryland. We ask that you vote favorably on SB-0273 and support the firefighters and the public to restrict the use and disposal of PF AS chemicals in Maryland.

We thank the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee for the opportunity to provide test imony for SB273 - Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act). ANS supports SB273 . As we navigate today's public health, social, and economic crises, it is critical to support the passage of SB273 . This bill prohibits the manufacture, sale, use, distribution, and disposal of certain products - firefighting foams, food packaging and new r ugs and carpets - containing PFAS chemicals. The bill also requires notification of PFAS in firefighting gear and prohibits the disposal of PFAS chemicals in landfills or by incineration. As defined in the bill, PFAS chemicals are fluorinated organic chemi cals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom, including perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These human - made chemicals are used in a variety of products, including non -stick pots and pans, rugs and carpets, food packaging, firefigh ting foam, and making products grease -proof or water -resistant. PFAS do not break down in human bodies or in the environment. Rather, these \"forever chemicals\" continue to threaten environmental and human health as they pollute waterways and drinking wate r. PFAS have also been linked to cancer and other adverse human health effects. Maryland PIRG notes that the MDE has found PFAS in 75% of the drinking water that the agency has tested. PFAS contamination also has been detected in and around various militar y sites and in seafood.1 The passage of this bill would provide a necessary step forward for Maryland in mitigating the environmental and public health risk presented by the continuing manufacture, sale, and use of PFAS chemicals. ANS and our 28,000 memb ers and supporters recommend that the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee support the passage of SB273 .

Senate Bill 273 Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Date: February 2, 2022 Position: Support To: Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs From: Doug Myers, Maryland Senior Scientist Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) SUPPORTS SB 273 which bans or restricts sale and distribution of certain products containing PFAS intentionally added for its flame retardant properties including firefighting foam, carpet and food packaging. The bill also establishes containment and disposal criteria for firefighting foam, where necessary, to protect waters of the state and groundwater. CBF continues to follow the science of emerging chemicals like PFAS realizing its widespread use, potential environmental and human health hazards, and particularly, its persistence in the environment, the quality that has led to the moniker \"Forever Chemical.\" As in the past with organohaline pesticides, industrial solvents, and Polychlorinated Bipheyls (PCBs), these legacy chemicals create costly cleanup requirements, sometimes leading to hurdles for property transfers and creating decades-long risks to the surrounding environment and to human health. PFAS health effects in both humans and other animals include reproductive, developmental, endocrine and cardiovascular diseases.1 US Geologic Survey scientists have discovered PFAS in fish tissues throughout the bay watershed.2 The provisions of this bill are consistent with EPA's emerging PFAS Action Plan.3 CBF urges the Committee's FAVORABLE report on SB 273.

For fifty years we've stood up to powerful interests whenever they threaten our health and safety, our fi nancial security, or our right to fully participate in our democratic society. We support SB273 to restrict the use and disposal of PFAS chemicals. We thank Sen. Elfreth for introducing the bill and Senators Lam, Beidle, and Bailey for co -sponsoring this important bi - partisan legislation. PFAS chemicals are polluting our waterways and drinking water and putting public health at risk. This bill does not ban PFAS in all uses. This bill is based on existing laws in other states and market trends, catching Maryland up with some of our peers in addressing this growing crisis. There are safer alternatives to PFAS chemicals in the products restricted in this bill. Our nation's leading experts on PFAS exposure have called for regulating these chemicals as a class and stopping non-essential uses because of the risks they pose to public healt h. We face an uphill battle to clean up PFAS from our communities and waterways. In order to address the problem, we need to stop new contamination, which this bill can help do. In the years to come, the state will be facing challenges to address PFAS con tamination through testing and remediation. What's in the bill: Stops the use of PFAS in: Firefighting foam Food packaging Rugs and carpets. Requires notification for PFAS in firefighting gear. Prevents the mass disposal of PFAS chemicals by incineration and landfilling. The threat of \"forever chemicals\" Seemingly every week we are hearing about more communities who have been exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water. The Mar yland Department of the Environment (MDE) found PFAS in 75% of the drinking water i t has tested. We also know of contamination in and around more than a dozen military sites in the state and in Oct. 2021, MDE issued their first fish consumption advisory for PFAS in Piscataway Creek leading to Prince George's County filing suit against chemical manufacturers 3M and DuPont . Independent testing has also found alarming levels of PFAS in water and seafood . Last month, Maryland PIRG Foundation released a report, The Threat of \"Forev er Chemicals,\" which outlines known contamination in Maryland, impacts, and potential state actions. Maryland PIRG, 2022 PFAS are still widespread in both production and use. Safeguarding against PFAS chemicals as a class is the best way to protect human health. Trying to re gulate one chemical at a time will only leave us in an endless game of whack -a-mole. Marylanders deserve the same public health protections from PFAS that we see in other states. Maryland firefighters shouldn't have to suffer and die from exposure to toxic chemicals, especially when there are safer alternatives. In addition to supporting this critical legislation, we hope the legislature will take further action on PFAS. We need to ensure Maryland has the legal framework to hold polluting industries accoun table for the pollution they produce and the harm they cause, we need robust water testing to identify the extent of the problem, and we need to clean up contamination where it exists. Firefighting In particular, the use of firefighting foams containing P FAS, no longer makes sense. PFAS foam puts our water at risk. It also endangers our firefighters, who are at increased cancer risk due to exposure to PFAS. In fact, cancer is the leading cause of death among firefighters in the United States, according to the Firefighter Cancer Support Network and the International Association of Fire Fighters. There are already safer alternatives to PFAS foam on th e market . Six states (WA, CA, CO, NH, NY, VT), the U.S. Military and the EU are already moving away from using PFAS fire fighting foam completely. Congress has directed the Department of Defense to end the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS by 2024 , and to immediately quit using it during training exercises. Multiple states (including CA, CO, NY) have laws on the books which include a provision to require notification for firefighting personal protective equipment (PPE) that contains PFAS. Food Packaging A 2017 study found grease -proof PFAS coatings on 46% of food -contact papers (such as hamburger wrappers) and 20% of paperboard samples (such as french fry boxes) collected from fast food restaurants throughout the United States. 7 states have restricted PFAS in food packaging and due to public demand, major retailers are eliminating PFAS from key product lines. But there are laggards in the market. In order to ensure we protect the public it is time for state action. Grocery chains including Giant, Whole Foods, Trade r Joe's, Food Lion, Stop & Shop, Amazon, and Hannaford's have all committed to eliminating PFAS from their packaging. Fast food chains McDonald's , Burger King, Chipotle, Taco Bell, Panera, Wendy's, and Sweetgreen have all made commitments to phase out PFAS food packaging, and testing has confirmed that PFAS use is not universal in fast food food packaging. As of November 2021, 18 retailers selling food or food packaging have announced steps to reduce or eliminate PFAS in food packaging at their more than 77,000 stores. Rugs and Carpets A 2008 report from the Ecology Center found PFAS in half of the carpet samples tested. Since that time, Shaw Industries, the largest carpet manufacturer in t he world and Interface , the largest commercial carpet manufacturer in the world, both stopped using PFAS. Lowe's has stopped selling residential carpets containing PFAS, and Home Depot has stopped selling both residential and commercial wall -to-wall carpets that contain PFAS chemicals. Indications are that much of the carpet and rug industry has moved away from PFAS, though some is still found. Green Science Policy Institute has published a list of carpet manufacturers that are PFAS -free Maryland PIRG, 2022 Significant progress has been made on aftermarket treatments as well as upholstery. California's Department of Toxics Substances Control has found that aftermarket treatments are \" significant sources of human and ecological PFAS exposures, \" and has done some work on identifying safer alternatives . In 2021 Maine and Vermont passed laws to ban PFAS in carpets, rugs and aftermarket treatments. Washington has identified PFAS in carpets, rug, leather and textile furnishings, and aftermarket treatments as priority products under its new Safer Products law in order to pursue restrictions. California has declared carpets and rugs containing PFAS as priority products under its Safer Consumer Products law . Incineration and Landfilling EPA notes that disposing of PFAS in landfills has many unknowns, such as how the waste will interact with landfill liners and the possibility of chemicals escaping into the environment. Though high temperatures potentially can destroy PFAS, EPA notes that more research is needed to understand the environmental impacts of this approach. Incomplete destruction could create byproducts that might be chemicals of concern, which would cause concentrated harm on communities near incinerators . Given that all currently availa ble disposal and destruction options involve a large degree of uncertainty about how much environmental and health protection they provide, the best approach is to securely store PFAS and PFAS -containing substances.

Maryland PIRG, 2022 ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND AND FACTS Video Clip from Bloomberg News PFAS are harmful to public health. Even low levels of exposure to PFAS are linked to a r ange of health damages, including: Harm to the kidneys, leading to chronic kidney disease or kidney cancer,1 Reduced antibody responses to vaccinations in both children and adults,2 and Increased risk of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, low birth weight and childhood obesity Newer types of PFAS are no safer for human health and the environment than older PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS.3 New PFAS travel more easily through water, resulti ng in widespread exposure, and thus may pose more risks to human and environmental health.4 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that two newer PFAS chemicals create many of the same health impacts as older PFAS.5 EPA determined the toxici ty of the PFAS known as GenX is in the same range as PFOA, the legacy PFAS it replaced.6 Hundreds of public health experts around the globe have expressed concern about the health impacts of continuing to produce and use all varieties of PFAS.7 1 Kidney disease: Anoop Shankar, Jie Xiao, and Alan Ducatman, \"Perfluoroalkyl chemicals and chronic kidney disease in US adults ,\" American Journal of Epidemiology, 174(8), DOI: 10.1093/aje/kwr171, 26 August 2011, archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20210311183344/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3218627 /; DCEG Staff, National Cancer Institute, Environmental Pol lutant, PFOA, Associated with Increased Risk of Kidney Cancer, 20 September 2020, archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20210725190158/h ttps://dceg.cancer.gov/news -events/news/2020/pfoa -kidney exposures to perfluorinated compounds in infancy predict attenuated vaccine antibody co ncentrations at age response in and . 3 Anna Reade, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Scientific Basis for Managing PFAS as a Chemical Class (blog), 30 June 202 0, archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20210514051247/https://www.nrdc.org/experts/anna -reade/scientific -basismanaging -pfas-chemical - class . 4 Li et al., \"Short -chain per - and polyfluoralkyl substances in aquatic systems: occurrence, impacts and treatment,\" Chemical Engineering Journal, 15 January 2020, https://doi. org/10.1016/j.cej.2019.122506, available at https:// www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/ S1385894719319096 . 5 Anna Reade, Natural Resources Defense Council, EPA Finds Replacements for Toxic \"Teflon\" Chemicals Toxic, 15 November 2018, Fact Sheet: Human Health Toxicity Asse ssment -2021.pdf . 7 Arlene Blum et al., \" The Madrid statement on poly - and perfluoroalkyl substances, (PFASs),\" Environmental Health Perspectives, 123(5), 1 May https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1509934 . Maryland PIRG, 2022 Many dri nking water sources in Maryland are contaminated with PFAS. In late 2019, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) tested for contamination from legacy PFAS at water treatment plants that provide drinking water to 70% of Maryland's population.8 Approximately 75% of the samples had quantifiable levels of PFOA and PFOS.9 The two highest readings were from Westminster and Hampstead, both in Carroll County.10 Testing by the U.S. Department of Defense has found PFAS in drinking water at or near a dozen military facilities in Maryland11 PFAS also contaminate groundwater and seafood in Maryland. PFAS contamination at military sites in Maryland often is traceable to the use of firefighting foam.12 PFAS from firefighting foam have leached into shallow groundwater, potentially flowing from th ere into nearby rivers and streams. PFAS contamination has been found in groundwater at eight military facilities in six counties in Maryland.13 Testing found nine different types of PFAS in striped bass, crabs and oysters from the Potomac River and St. In igoes Creek in southern Maryland.14 MDE has detected PFAS in three species of fish from Piscataway Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River in Prince George's County, and has warned people to limit their intake of particular species caught in the creek.15 How PFAS enter our bodies CONTAMINATED WATER: Drinking water contaminated with PFAS is one of the most common exposure routes.16 WORKPLACE EXPOSURE: Workers who make products with PFAS and military personnel or firefighters who work with firefighting foam may be particularly at risk for exposure.17 For example, these individuals may inhale or swallow PFAS -contaminated dust.18 They may also absorb PFAS through their skin.19 8 Maryland Department of the Env ironment, Understanding the Occurrence of Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Maryland's Public Drinking Water Sources, archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20210720143939/https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Water/water_supply/Documents/PFAS_Public_Water_Sy stem_ StudyPhase1Report.pdf . 9 Ibid., p. 10 Ibid., p. 4. 11 Environmental Work Group, PFAS Contamination Map, 6 January 2021, available at https:// www.ewg.org/interactive maps/pfas_contamination/ map/ . 12 Patuxent River Restoration Advisory Board, PFAS Update: Naval Air Station Patuxent River and Webster Outlying Field, 28 April 2021, available at https://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/Enviro nmental/PDFs/env_restoration/nas_patuxent_river/NAS_Patuxent_River_RAB_ Presentation_202104.pdf , p. 9. 13 Maryland Department of the Environment, Public Health: Maryland and PFAS, accessed 7 September 2021, archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20210815110952/https://mde.maryland.gov/PublicHealth/Pages/PFAS -Landing -Page.aspx . 14 Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, Mo re PFAS Found in Maryland Water and Seafood, 16 November at http://web.archive.org/web/20210812170801/https://www.peer. org/more -pfas-found -in-maryland -water -and-seafood/ . 15 Maryland Department of the Environment, Department of the Environment Issues First Fish Consumption Advisory for PFAS (press release), 15 first fish consumption advisory because of PFAS,\" Baltimore Sun, 17 October 2021, Justice, Breaking October 2020, archived at http://web.archive.org/web/20210904011701/https://earthjustice.org/ features/breaking -down -toxic-pfas. 17 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) a nd Your Health, human exposure to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs): From external exposure to human blood,\" Environment January DOI: https://doi. org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105244 . Maryland 2022 CONSUMER PRODUCTS: People can be exposed to PFAS through a variety of consumer produ cts. PFAS migrate from consumer products, resulting in toxic exposure. As stain -resistant furniture and carpets and waterproof clothing break down, they produce dust that can be inhaled or swallowed.20 CONTAMINATED FOOD: Food may be contaminated with PFAS if it is raised in contaminated soil, fertilized with contaminated sewage sludge, or irrigated with contaminated water.21 PFAS have been found in fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables.22 Processing equipment and packaging that contain PF AS may also add PFAS to food.23 One analysis of fast food packaging in the U.S. found that 46% of paper used to package food (for example, to wrap hamburgers) and 20% of paperboard (such as for french fry boxes) contained PFAS.24 EXPOSURE IN UTERO OR THROUGH BREASTMILK: Babies can be ex posed to PFAS before they are born, if the mother has been exposed to PFAS. Infants may be exposed to PFAS through their mother's breast milk.25 For example, a 2021 study found PFAS in all breastmilk samples collected from 50 nursing mothers in the U.S.26 20 Sam Hall, Duke, Nicholas School of the Envi ronment, PFAS Found in NC House Dust, https://web.archive.org/ web/20211111052347/https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/ pfas/research Miller, \"State investigating 'very startling' levels of PFAS chemicals on central Maine dairy farm,\" Press Herald, 29 July 2020, Kwiatkowski et al., \"Scientific basis for managing PFAS as a chemical class,\" Environmental Science and Technology L etters, 7(8), doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00255 . 23 Food and Drug Administration, Question and Answers on PFAS in Food, 26 August 2021, archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20210911034206/https://www.fda.gov/food/ -food/questions -andanswers -pfas-food; 21, archived at http://web.archive.org/ web/20210905042523/https://www.epa.gov/pfas/ basic -information - pfas. 24 Laura Schaider et al., \"Fluorinated compounds in U.S. fast food packaging,\" Environmental Science & Technology Letters as an exposure pathway Environmental Science Techn Zheng et - and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in breast milk: concerning tre nds for current -use Environmental Science Technology 55(11):7510 \"Walter\" Taylor Act The threat of \"forever chemicals \" A common class of chemicals, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, are used in a variety of products including rugs, food packaging, and non-stick pans. They are also used in some fire fighting foams and manufacturing to make things greaseproof and water resistant. PFAS are often called 'forever chemicals' because they don't break down in our bodies or our environment, and they have been linked to negative health impacts. When PFAS end up in our food and water, it puts our health at risk. Elevated levels of PFAS in blood has been associated with health concerns , including: Cancer; Thyroid disruption; and, Reduced vaccine response According to an August 2020 report from the nation and world's leading PFAS experts PFAS should be regulated as a class in order to protect health: \"Managing PFAS one-by-one is neither feasible nor cost-ecient. More comprehensive solutions are needed, given that traditional approaches have failed to control widespread exposures to PFAS and resulted in inadequate public health protection. We suggest class-based options to more comprehensively and eciently reduce PFAS exposure. \" PFAS in Maryland The Maryland Department of Environment has found PFAS in 75% of the drinking water they have tested. There is known contamination in and around more than a dozen military sites and in seafood in Maryland. This fall, the Maryland Department of Environment issued their first fish consumption advisory for PFAS . Firefighters, active military and their families, and children are most at risk of PFAS exposure, but everyone is at risk. This bill addresses: Certain types of firefighting foam are a major source of PFAS contamination but safer PFAS-free foams exist and have been adopted around the U.S. and the world. CA, CO, CT, IL, ME, NH, NY, VT, and WA have all banned the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS. PFAS chemicals are sometimes used in food packaging . From hamburger wrappers to microwave popcorn bags, safer alternatives already exist. CA, CT, ME, MN, NY, VT, and WA have all banned food packaging containing PFAS . Rugs and carpets can be treated with PFAS. Manufacturing with PFAS poses environmental, public health, and worker safety concerns. The chemicals can also leach into household dust putting our families at risk. Home Depot and Lowes have stopped selling rugs and carpets with PFAS, and states are following suit, but not fast enough.

We strongly support SB273, which aims to prohibit the manufacturing, use, sale, and unsafe disposal of harmful per - or poly- fluoroalkyl (PF AS) chemical additives in firefighting foam, food packaging, rugs, and carpets. PF AS comprise thousands of man-made compounds that persist in the environment, contaminate water and soil, and bioaccumulate in humans and animals (T able 1). Table 1. Sour ces of Human Exposur e to PF AS 1 Surface, ground, public utility , and well water Contaminated soil or dust\u2014landfills, disposal sites Food chain\u2014seafood and livestock exposed to PF AS Maternal to fetal transfer in utero, and breast milk and formula feeding in neonates and infants Nonstick cookware Cleaning and personal care products\u2014shampoo, floss, cosmetics PFAS-containing consumer food packaging\u2014pizza boxes, fast food wrappers, microwaveable popcorn bags PFAS-coated rugs, carpets, upholstery and fabrics Workplace\u2014Fire and Rescue, manufacturing and electroplating facilities The continued manufacturing, use, incineration, and landfill disposal of these compounds pose an increasing threat to public and environmental health. It is a step in the right direction to address PF AS as a class of chemicals, rather than individually , as there are thousands of compounds in this class and their collective impact from exposure in-utero to adulthood likely causes the greatest harm. PF AS chemicals have been detected in blood, urine, breast milk, umbilical cord blood, lungs, kidney , liver , and brain tissue. 2 Although the toxicity and health effects of the vast majority of PF AS compounds have yet to be investigated or definitively identified, based on available research, there is reason to be concerned about the implications for short- and long-term human exposure to these chemicals (T able 2). Table 2. Potential Effects of PF AS Compounds on Human Health 3 High Certainty Low Certainty Altered thyroid hormones Inflammatory bowel disease Increased total and LDL cholesterol levels Low sperm count and mobility Liver inflammation and fat deposition Pregnancy-related high blood pressure Kidney cancer Decreased fecundity Reduced response to vaccines Obesity Low birth weight Accelerated puberty In the paragraphs below , we highlight several areas in which research studies have noted concerning findings related to the human health ef fects of elevated PF AS serum levels. Immune system dysfunction and infection susceptibility . The U.S National Toxicology Program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have all recognized that PF AS chemicals have the potential to adversely alter the human immune system and increase our risk of developing hypersensitivity disorders (e.g., asthma, eczema) and infectious diseases. 4 Relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing body of science has shown that high levels of PF AS exposure may decrease vaccine ef ficacy and increase susceptibility to infections in both adults and children. Furthermore, high levels of certain PF AS have been associated with a greater likelihood of hospitalization and progression to intensive care or death due to COVID-19. 5 As we attempt to prevent the spread and severity of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics, protecting the public from further exposure to harmful PFAS chemicals plays an important role.Cancer susceptibility . PFAS chemicals, particularly perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), have been suggested to increase the risk of various cancers. The World Health Or ganization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified PFOA as a possible human carcinogen. A review of multiple research studies found that the increase in cancer risk per 10 ng/mL serum PFOA was 16% for kidney cancer and 3% for testicular cancer . 6 Other studies of individuals with high exposures to PFOA, such as those living near chemical and manufacturing plants, have also found associations between PFOA and testicular , kidney , prostate, and ovarian cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 7,8 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is continuing to study the risks posed by PF AS on ovarian, endometrial, prostate, and thyroid cancers, and childhood leukemia. 9 Given the considerable potential for PF AS to be linked to mechanisms underlying the development of cancer , supported by numerous laboratory and epidemiological studies, it is crucial to minimize and ultimately eliminate our exposure to PF AS. Health and development of the fetus, infant, newborn and childr en. Studies have consistently demonstrated that PF AS easily circulates from maternal blood through the placenta to the developing fetus. 10 Particular ly concerning is the suggestion of PF AS-induced improper placental development and function, which could negatively impact maternal and fetal acute and latent health outcomes such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and low birth weight. In addition, children born to mothers with elevated umbilical cord blood PF AS levels were noted to be at increased risk for infectious diseases such as throat and airway infections and diarrheal illnesses. 11,12 Effect on Fir efighters and the Community . Firefighters are more likely to die from cancer than a fire, and exposure to high amounts of PF AS, such as those found in firefighting foam and uniforms, is associated with adverse health outcomes including cancers. Before starting medical school, I, Angela Geiger , volunteered at my small mountain town' s fire department, which routinely deployed firefighting foam to extinguish regularly scheduled real fire training sessions. Because of the department' s proximity to my house, foam that was used in these training sessions drained directly into the ground and ultimately the wells that supplied drinking water to my house, my neighbors' homes, and residents downstream. I am sure that I am not the only person who finds this very disturbing, and I am deeply saddened by the thought that my family , community , and the people I worked with are at increased risk of cancer and other adverse health outcomes due to chemicals in firefighting foam and firefighter 's gear . As members of the healthcare community , we strongly support and ur ge favorable action on the Geor ge \"W alter\" Taylor Act (SB0273/HB0275) which undertakes smart, common-sense actions to mitigate the wide-ranging health concerns associated with PF AS exposure. Passage of this bill will protect the health and well-being of all Marylanders, especially those at highest risk of harm: our first responders, the elderly , and pregnant women, newborns, infants, and children.Respectfully submitted, Vennela Avula, Medical Student Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine vavula1@jhmi.edu Joyce Cheng, Medical Student Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine jcheng63@jhmi.edu Angela Geiger , Medical Student University of Maryland School of Medicine angelageiger@som.umaryland.edu Gwen DuBois, MD, MPH President, CPSR Elise Riley , MD F ACP Board Member , CPSR Snehal T.

We urge you to support Senate Bill 273 to prohibit use of PFAS ch emicals firefighting foam, carpets, and food packaging. Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAs) are highly fluorinated industrial chemicals that have been linked to serious illnesses including: testicular, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancer ; reproductive problems; and, low birth weights as well as weakened immunity amongst children . Furthermore, these chemicals remain in our bodies for years and rarely break down in the environment - which is why PFAs are often referred to as \"forever chemicals.\" Severa l states have enacted lower limits on the PFA amount allowed in water than is currently required by the EPA, banned PFAs in food packaging, or banned the use of fire - fighting foam that contains PFAs . Rugs and carpeting have been found to be sources of significant and widespread human and ecological PFAS exposures . These types of pervasive environmental threats impact our whole population, but unfortunately they also tend to be disproportiona tely harmful to minorities and families with lower incomes , who because of systemic racism or other social inequit ies may have fewer choices in where they live , where they can shop, or the products they are able to afford. We urge you to give Senate Bill 273 a favorable report. SB273 - PFAS (2022 Session) State Circle | Annapolis, Maryland www.baltimorecountymd.gov JOHN A. OLSZEWSKI, J R. JOEL N. BELLER County Executive Acting Director of Government Affairs JOSHUA M. GREENBERG Associate Director of Government Affairs MIA R. GOGEL Associate Director of Government Affairs BILL NO.: SB 273 TITLE: Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) SPONSOR: Senator Elfreth COMMITTEE: Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs POSITION: SUPPORT DATE: February 2nd, 2022 Baltimore County SUPPORTS Senate Bill 273 - Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) . This legislation would prohibit a person from using, manufacturing, or knowingly selling certain products that contain added PFAS chemical s in the State. According to the CDC, exposure to PFAS may interfere with the body's natural hormones, increase cholesterol levels, affect the immune system and increase the risk of some cancers. As it currently stands, a majority of Americans have PFAS i n their bloodstream. Firefighting foams are known to contain PFAS. When used, the foams introduce PFAS into underground or nearby water systems, contaminating our environment and poisoning our residents. By restricting the use of these foams, we can limit their introduction into the State's ecosystem. Last session, Baltimore County strongly advocated for tighter regulation of PFAS usage. The County was proud to see this legislation pass and lead the way for additional measures this session. SB 273 would res trict the use of firefighting foam, rugs and carpets, and food packing that contain PFAS. Prohibiting the use, manufacturing and sale of these items will help keep Maryland's waterways clean and safe for all residents. Accordingly, Baltimore County request s a FAVORABLE report on SB 273. For more information, please contact Joel Beller , Acting Director of Government Founded in 1892, the Sierra Club is America's oldest and largest [national] grassroots environmental organization. The Maryland Chapter has over 70,000 members and supporters, an d the Sierra Club nationwide has over 800,000 members and nearly four million supporters. Committee: Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Testimony on: SB273 \"Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George 'Walter' Taylor Act)\" Position: Support Hearing Date: February 2 , 2022 The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club supports SB 273, which, beginning in 2023, would prohibit use, manufacturing, and distribution of certain fire -fighting foam that contains intentionally added PFAS chemicals, as well as manufacture or sales of rugs, carpet, and certain food packaging that contain these chemicals. PFASs, per - or polyfluor oalkyl substances, are bioaccumulating, environmentally mobile, and environmentally persistent. Many of the compounds in this group of chemicals have been proved to be toxic to people and they threaten our bay and other waters, and the productive fisheries , tourism, and recreation they support. The restrictions in the bill are practical steps to protect public and environmental health and are consistent with actions in other states and nations. States with enforceable drinking water standards include Mass achusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and Maine; and states with proposed standards include Arizona, Iowa, Kentucky, and Rhode Island. Other states have adopted guidance and/or notification levels for PFAS in drinking water. These states include Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Mexico, and Ohio. Abroad, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants added two well -studied PFAS compounds (PFOA and PFOS) to an nex A elimination and annex B restriction, respectively.1 PFAS have been investigated for adverse immune, metabolic, carcinogenic, and developmental effects . PFAS compounds have characteristics under the United Nations Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals2 that include: \"suspected of causing cancer,\" \"may damage the child,\" \"may damage fertility or the unborn child,\" \"causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure,\" \" toxic to aquatic life w ith long -lasting from predominately long -chained PFAS to short -chained PFASs in an effort to reduce pollution and 1 PFAS are a group of man made substances, PFOA and PFOS are part of this group of substances and have been studied extensively See also https://www.epa.gov/ground -water -and-drinking -water/drinking Classific ation and Labelling of Chemicals is the industry standard for communication on hazardous chemicals toxicity. However , continuing research has found that both long and short -chained PFAS display toxic effects. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 implemented a phase -out of AFFF in firefighting foams at military instillations by 2024.3 Rugs and carpets. Consumer products treated with PFAS, such as rugs or carpets, can produce polluted dust that can be ingested or inhaled. Upon entering the body, PFAS will accumulate. Major retailers Home Depot and Lowes banned PFAS from rug sales in 2019 and 2020, respec tively. Food packaging. PFAS are often added to food packaging and \"can migrate from fluorochemical -treated food contact papers into food -simulants such as butter, water, vinegar, and water/ethanol mixtures, indicating a direct exposure route to humans.\"4 Fast food industry leaders such as McDonald's have made commitments to phase out PFAS food packaging,5 though its 2025 goal will fall short in states with bans on PFAS in food containers that will be implemented in 2022. Many other food retailers and g rocery suppliers have made similar pledges, and the trend is expected to continue as public concern continues.6 PFAS mass waste . Disposal of PFAS -treated items leads to further concerns over expensive systems that should be maintained and monitored at ta xpayer expense to prevent further pollution. Landfills are required to adhere to strict standards that include expensive leaching contamination liners, monitoring, and maintenance. Alternatively, incineration produces an extremely hazardous product - toxic gaseous hydrogen fluoride. Though industry is taking steps due to consumer concerns and action on the federal level is hopefully on the horizon, Maryland should join other states in a leadership role and ensure reasonable protections are establ ished. The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club urges a favorable report on this bill for its potential to reduce risks to human and environmental health. We request a favorable report.

This bill would put meaningful restrictions on the use of PFAS, ultimately prohibiting PFAS use in fire-fighting foam, rugs and carpets, and food packaging for direct food contact. Because of the strong fluorine-carbon bonds, many of these substances are recalcitrant in the environment and persist for years. Additionally, many (e.g., PFOA and PFOS) bioaccumulate in the tissues of wildlife, some to levels that could cause overt toxicity. In fact, levels of these substances have been found in the tissues of marine mammals in the Arctic and in many species of birds. These substances have been in the eggs, blood, and livers of birds across the globe, with concentrations especially pronounced in industrial areas in North America, Europe, and east Asia.1 PFAS have been shown to reduce hatching success in species of birds such as Double-crested Cormorant2, and Little Ringed Plover3. PFAS has been found in blood of Northern Cardinal in Hawaii, 4 Snow Buntings in Svalbard5, and American Flamingos on the island of Bonaire in the 1 Bonisoli-Alquati, Andrea, PFAS concentrations in birds. https://www.bonisolialquatilab.com/pfas-concentrations-in-birds.html 2 Sedlak, Meg, et al, Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs) in San Francisco Bay: Synthesis and Strategy, June 2018, https://www.sfei.org/sites/default/files/biblio_files/PFAS%20Synthesis%20and%20Strategy.pdf 3 Yoo, Hoon, et al Perfluoroalkyl acids in the egg yolk of birds from Lake Shihwa, Korea.

We support SB 273. This bill addresses the use of harmful chemicals known as PFAS. They are also known as \"forever chemicals\" because they do not break down in the environment. PFAs are dangerous to human health because their presence is linked to cancer, reproductive and develop mental harms, and reduced effectiveness of vaccines. PFAS are used in non -stick cookware like pans, fabric stain -protective coatings, fast -food packaging, etc. PFAs have been found in the tap water of 49 states across the U.S. This bill stops the u se of PFAS in food packaging (following the lead of NY, WA, ME), as well as in rugs and carpets (like VT). It holds polluters accountable by ensuring that chemical manufacturers are legally and financially responsible for contamination of our waterways from PFAS. This bill also protects our air and water by banning the mass disposal of these chemicals by incineration (following NY lead). We respectfully request a favorable report. SB273 PFAS Chemicals-EHEA-GCAN-FAV.docx.pdf Date:Wed, Feb 2, 2022 Dear Chairman and Committee Members: The Greenbelt Climate Action Network (GCAN) is writing in support of SB273 PFASChemicals-Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act). GCAN's mission is to educate residents about climate change, \"systemic\" solutions, how they can changetheir behaviors to be more sustainable, and take personal, local, systemic, and political action. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have terrifying health effects, including liver damage, immunesystem damage, low infant birth rate, and even cancer. 95% of Americans have measurableconcentrations of these \"forever chemicals\" in their blood.Whilewe're all exposed to some degree,those most at risk from being harmed by PFAS are communities of color and low-income communities.The Union of Concerned Scientists notes that these communities \"bear the economic and biologicalburden\" of the government's lack of responsiveness to concerns about this toxic class of chemicals.Getting PFAS chemicals out of products would be a first step to decreasing exposure. PFAS chemicals are everywhere, and they are really bad for us. Since Climate Change affects all issues,Climate Change could make the PFAS crisis even worse. Floods and hurricanes spread contaminants.Increased forest fires increase the use of PFAS containing fire fighting foam. According to Risk andInsurance, storms spurred by Climate Change could move PFAS around the globe. They also add thatPFAS exposure is setting up to be the next asbestos in terms of liability. So not only are people putting toxic chemicals directly into their bodies when they eat food fromPFAS-coated wrappers, especially hot and greasy foods like french fries, which make it more likely PFASwill be transferred from the wrapper to the food they consumed. Butdata from the EnvironmentalProtection Agency has revealed that PFAS chemicals are contributing to the climate crisis as theirproduction involves the emission of potent greenhouse gasses.According to Toxic Free Future, PFASutilized in the manufacture of food packaging leads to the release of GHGs, specifically HCFC-21, or R 22.HCFC-22 emissions are banned worldwide under the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 internationalenvironmental treaty, because the chemical is so destructive to the ozone layer. An article in TheGuardian says \"The plant of the PFAS manufacturer Daikin in Decatur, Alabama, released about 240,000 pounds of HCFC-22 in 2019 - the equivalent of more than 1bn pounds of carbon dioxide, or what wouldbe released from driving 125,000 cars every day for a year. Many of the nation's top 50 HCFC-22 pollutersare 'forever chemical' manufacturers. A loophole in the Montreal treaty allows companies to releaseHCFC-22 when it's used as an intermediate in production of another chemical, such as PFAS.\" The Maryland Department of the Environment found PFAS in 75% of the drinking water it tested. Wealso know of contamination in and around more than a dozen military sites in the state and in someseafood. Anglers who fish Piscataway Creek off the Potomac River have been warnedto limit theirconsumption of what they catchafter Maryland regulatorsdiscovered elevated levels of PFAS in fishdownstream of Joint Base Andrews. And we know this is just the tip of the iceberg. We hope Maryland will join 10 other states in taking clear action to restrict PFAS, and that in the future,you will build on this first step by restricting disposal of PFAS chemicals in Maryland. The GreenbeltClimate Action Network recommends a FAVORABLE report for SB273, theGeorge \"Walter\" Taylor Act. People Planet Prosperity January 31, 2022 Senator and Committee Chair Paul Pinsky Members of the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee RE: Support for SB273, Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Dear Chair Pinsky and Members of the Senate, We are writing in support of SB273, the George \"Walter\" Taylor Act. The Baltimore Commission on Sustainability is a body appointed by the Mayor to oversee the creation and implementation of the Baltimore Sustainability Plan. The 2019 Baltimore Sustainability Plan addresses a wide range of social, economic and environmental goals for the City, and it does so through an equity lens. The Baltimore Commission on Sustainability has a strong interest in the success of SB273. PFAS, also known as \"forever chemicals\" contaminate our water, and from there get into our food system. This bill is important for equity in Baltimore - because those with the least resources have the least access to reliable medical care to deal with the ways that PFAS can harm health, including including liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, high cholesterol, obesity, hormone suppression and cancer. While PFAS are being phased out in many areas, legislation is needed to speed this up. We urge the Committee to support SB273.

They never break down. They are used in firefighting foam, food packaging, rugs and carpets. They are polluting our drinking water and are accumulating in our bodies. They have been linked to cancer and other serious illnesses. This bill, if passed, would prevent the mass incineration or landfilling of PFAS chemicals. It would also prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of products containing PFAS chemicals, such as rugs and carpets, food packaging and firefighting foam. Please vote favorably on SB0273. Our lives depend on it. Nanci Wilkinson Environmental Justice Ministry Cedar Lane DoTheMostGood Maryland Team Committee : Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Testimony on : SB 0273 - Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter \" Taylor Act) Position: Favorable Hearing Date : February 2 , 202 2 Bill Contact: Senator Sarah Elfreth DoTheMostGoo d (DTMG) is a progressive grass -roots organization with more than 3000 members who live in all districts in Montgomery Count y and in several neighboring jurisdict ions. DTMG supports legislation and activities that keep all the members of our communities healthy and safe in a clean environment. DTMG strongly supports SB0273 because PFAS \"forever\" chemicals in food packaging, rugs and carpets, and firefighting foam pollute our environment and are harmful to human health. PFAS substances are a family of potentially thousands of synthetic perfluoroalky and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals . PFAS a re known as \"forever chemicals\" because they are extremely persistent in the environment and in our bodies. PFAS chemicals have been used extensively in various industries because of their ability to repel oil and water. The y can be found in Teflon nonsti ck products, stains and water repellants, paints, cleaning products, food packaging , and firefighting foams. PFAS chemicals can easily migrate into the air, dust, food, soil and water. People can also be exposed to them through food packaging and industrial exposure. A growing body of science has shown that PFAS chemicals build up in our bodies and that v ery small d oses of PFAS can cause liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, high cholesterol, obesity, hormone suppression , and several forms of cancer . Nearly all Americans, including newborn babies, have PFAS in their blood . Studies by the Environmental Working Group found PFAS contamination on at least 11 military bases in Maryland and in several drinking water sources . Several original forms of \"long chain\" PFAS chemicals were phased out, but recent studies by Auburn University of newer \"short chain\" replacements show that they may be even more dangerous, supporting scientists' growing agreement that the entire class of PFAS chemicals is hazardous to human health. SB0273 will protect all Maryland residents from these dangerous chemicals by prohibiting the use, manufacture, or sale of Class B fire -fighting foam, carpets and rugs, and food packaging that contain PFAS chemicals. In cases where fire -fighting foam containing PFAS is required by federal law, SB0273 will require that its use be documented and that it not be released to the environment through runoff and that it cannot be disposed by any method, such as incineration, landfills, or other means that could release the PFAS to the environment or contaminate water supplies. Therefore , passage of SB0273 will prevent exposure of Maryland residents for further exposure to PFAS from three of the main sources of PFAS in our lives. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration have been slow to ac t on limiting dangerous PFAS chemicals. Other states have already proposed or enacted limits on PFAS. Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and other states have already proposed or enacted limits on PFAS in drinking water that are significantly lower than the EPA's advisory level. Washington and Maine have banned PFAS in food packaging and at least five states have restricted use of PFAS -based fire -fighting foam. California was the first state to require utilities to test tap water for PFAS and inform the ir customers. SB0273 is a sound, science -based approach to limiting exposure of Maryland residents to this dangerous class of chemicals. Therefore , DTMG strongly supports SB0273 and urges a FAVORABLE report on this bill. Respectfully submitted , Olivia Box 7045 \u00b7 GetInfo@MdPHA.org www.mdpha.org 443.475.0242 Mission: To improve public health in Maryland through education and advocacy Vision: Healthy Marylanders living in Healthy Communities SB 273 - Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Hearing Date: 2/2/2022 Committee: Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Position: SUPPORT Chairperson Pinsky and members of the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee: The Maryland Public Health Association would like to express support for SB 273 , sponsored by Senator Elfreth . This bill wil l restrict the use and disposal of PFAS chemicals in Maryland. In 2016, the American Public Health Association (APHA) published the policy statement, Reducing Human Exposure to High ly Fluorinated Chemicals to Protect Public Health .\" \"All PFASs share problematic properties with legacy long -chain PFOA an d PFOS and could be considered 'regrettable substitutions.' Manufacturers and purchasers should instead select non-PFAS technologies whenever possible.\" The policy statement also details several health outcomes linked with exposure to chemicals in the PFAS category including high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, developmental toxicity, thyroid disease, testicular and kidney cancers, and pregnancy -related hypertension . SB 273 stops the use of PFAS in: o Firefighting foam o Food packaging o Rugs and carpets. Requires notification for PFAS in firefighting gear. Prevents the mass disposal of PFAS chemicals by incineration and landfill ing. These measures will make significant progress in limiting exposures of PFAS to Marylanders. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) found PFAS in 75% of the drinking water it has tested. The APHA statement discusses drinking water con tamination: \"PFAS Maryland Public Health Association (MdPHA) PO Box 7045 \u00b7 6801 Oak GetInfo@MdPHA.org www.mdpha.org 443.475.0242 contamination exceeds the EPA's advisory level in the drinking water of an estimated 6 million, and likely many more, American residents. Drinking water contamination has been linked to firefighting foams used at military sites and airpo rts, industrial sites (including PFAS manufacturers and companies that use PFASs in their products), and wastewater treatment plants. Such sources of contamination are often located in low -income communities, in some cases with few environmental controls, which creates an environmental justice issue. \" Eliminating PFAS in firefighting foams that this bill establishes will reduce drinking water contamination. This provision will also be a protective step for firefighters, whose leading cause of death is cance r. The provisions in this bill will also protect another population of concern, children, through the elimination of PFAS in rugs and carpets. Young children crawl on and inhale dust from carpets, and because of their increased inhalation rates , children often ingest disproportionately higher doses of PFASs than adults, which can have detrimental impacts on their developing organ systems. As a state, it is our duty to ensure the strongest protections against toxic exposures across the entire population where we live, work, and play. One of the strongest interventions we can take to prevent environmentally caused diseases like cancer are pre venting or eliminating exposures to contaminants. T en states have already taken strong action to stop using PFAS in food packaging, rugs and carpets, or firefighting foam . It is time for Maryland to join them. Thank you for your consideration. We urge a favorable report on SB 273 . The Maryland Public Health Association (MdPHA) is a nonprofit, statewide organization of public health professionals dedicated to improving the lives of all Marylanders through education, advocacy, and collaboration. We support public policies consistent with our vision of healthy Marylanders living in healthy, equitable, communities. MdPHA is the state affiliate of the American Public Health Association, a nearly 145 -year -old professional organization dedicated to improving population health and reducing the health disparities that plague our state and our nation. Testimony In Support of SB 273 - HB 275 - Final - Uploaded by: Rich Ceruolo Position: FAV January 28, 202 2 Maryland Senate 11 Bladen St. Annapolis, MD. 21401 In Support of SB 273: Environment - PFAS - Prohibitions and R eqs. - George Taylor Act . Good day members of th e Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. We are an organization of military and non -military families with over 1300 members and fully support we am writing to you today as parents and lovers of the environment and to offer our support for SB 273 reduc ing or eliminating the use of PFAS across the state of Maryland. PFAS is a chemical commonly used for many household items already in our homes. This group of chemicals is used in the production of a range of products including; lifejackets, non -stick pans, carpeting and firefighting foam chemicals. They do also exist in personal care products like sunscreens, shaving creams and cosmetics like mascara. PFAS are problematic because they are toxic to humans due to their very slow rate of decay and can remain in the planets ecosystem for decades before they begin to decompose in any way. Studies have shown that these chemicals have already entered the drinking supplies of major cities across the country including New York, and Chicago according to the Centers for Disease Control and many environmental wa tchdog groups. Please support this legislation so that we can start the long process of removing this toxic substance from our everyday lives and hopefully work to remove it from our drinking water, waterways and our local ecosystem. Patchwork solution s seldom work well. We need policy that is bold, wide reaching, and can make a positive impact across the state. And maybe help to influence our regional / DELMARVA neighbors, and positively impact their environmental policies. Please support SB 273 / HB 275 and return a favorable report. Thank you for your time, and for considering our testimony today. Mr. Richard Ceruolo | richceruolo@gmail.com Parent , Lead A dvocate and Director of Public Policy Parent Advocacy Consortium | https://www.facebook.com/groups/ParentAdvocacyConsortium Elfreth_FAV_SB273.pdf Uploaded by: Sarah Elfreth Favor of SB 0273 Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Chairman Pinsky, Vice -Chair Kagan, and members of the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, I respectfully request a favorable report of Senate Bill 0273 - a bill to ensure that Maryland, like other leading States, takes the necessary actions to protect Marylanders and our environment from exposure to toxic PFAs chemicals. This legislation will focus on three mechanisms that pose the highest risk of exposure for Marylanders to these chemicals: firefighting foam, carpets, and food packag ing. Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAs) are a class of highly fluorinated industrial chemicals that have been linked to serious illnesses including: testicular, kidney, liver and pancreatic cancer ; reproductive problems; elevated cholest erol; thyroid dysfunction; and, low birth weights as well as weakened immunity amongst children1. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) measured quantifiable amounts of PFAs in 75% of drinking water tested in 20212. Furthermore, these chemicals remain in our bodies for years and rarely break down in the environment - which is why PFAs are often referred to as \"forever chemicals.\" In response to this nationwide crisis, many states are taking action to protect citizens from these \"forever chemical s\". Several states have enacted lower limits on the acceptable amount of PFAS allowed in municipal drinking water than is currently required by the EPA. States such as Washington, New York, and Maine have banned PFAs foams and food packaging entirely. At l east fifteen states have banned the use of fire -fighting foam that contains PFAs. California is the first state to require utilities to test tap water for PFA. Within the past year, Maine has passed comprehensive bipartisan legislation that will ban all PFAs-laden products and chemicals in the state by 2030. The Federal Government has also begun the process of addressing this problem by administering a phase out of PFAs at airports and military bases. Most recently, the implementation of the FY21 National D efense Authorization Act made major strides in protecting the environment around military installations. 1 The Environmental Working Group (https://www.ewg.org/pfaschemicals /) 2 The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) (https://mde.maryland.gov/Pu blicHealth/Documents/PFAS%20Public%20Water%20System%20Study_Phase1Report.pd f) Regarding firefighting foam: this legislation will prohibit PFAs -based foam after January 2023, and require stringent oversight for instances where the use of this foam is required under federal law. This Committee is no stranger to this specific issue, as illustrated with the passage of Senate Bill 420 in the 2020 legislative session to begin the process of ensuring that firefighting foam containing PFAs chemicals was not used for training purposes. The bill will also ensure that this harmful foam is not disposed of in a landfill or through incineration, thus further ensuring the protection of our environment. Regarding rugs and carpets: this legis lation will prohibit the sale or manufacturing of rugs that contain PFAS chemicals. The 2018 California Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report summarizes the prevalence of PFAs in carpets, stating that: \"carpets and rugs [are] sources of significant and widespread human and ecological PFAs exposures. Carpets and rugs constitute nearly half of all floor coverings in U.S. homes and workplaces. A large percentage of the PFASs produced worldwide are used to treat carpets, rugs, and other home textiles to confer stain -, soil -, oil- or water -resistance.3\" Regarding food packaging: this legislation will prohibit the sale or manufacturing of food packaging that contain intentionally added PFA chemicals after January, 2023. The use of PFAs in food packaging is wide -spread; for instance, one could find PFAs on the inside of canned goods, within microwave popcorn bags, and - in many instances - fast food packaging. The market is reacting positively to the progress other states have achieved and many retailers have taken action to protect consumers from exposure to PFAs, including: Giant, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Food Lion, Stop and Shop, Amazon, and Hannafords have all committed to eliminating PFAS from their packaging. McDonald's, Chipotle, Taco Bell, Paner a, Cava, and Sweetgreen have all made commitments to phase out PFAS food packaging. Home Depot and Lowes have announced their commitment to end sales of carpeting treated with PFAS and Staples has announced a policy to eliminate PFAs from stores. Lastly, this legislation also includes uncodified language to require the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to report on the work they are doing on this important issue as it relates to testing and remediation, as well as requiring MDE and MDH t o develop an action plan to ensure that there is a plan moving forward to minimize exposure. In the past, this Committee has heard testimony regarding the limitation and needed regulation of PFAS chemicals throughout Maryland communities. Once again, I r espectfully request a favorable report of Senate Bill 0273 to ensure that Marylanders and our environment are protected from exposure to toxic, \"forever\" PFAs chemicals. 3 Department of Toxic Conduit Street, Annapolis, MD 21401 410.269.0043 www.mdcounties.org Senate Bill 273 Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) MACo Position: SUPPORT WITH Butchko Date: February 2, 2022 To: Education, Health, & Environmental Affairs Committee The Maryland Association of Counties (MACo) SUPPORTS SB 273 WITH AMENDMENTS . The bill provides increased restrictions on the sale and use of class B fire -fighting foam that contains intentionally added per - and poly -fluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS chemicals\"). MACo supports additional action to limit the spread of PFAS into the environment but believes that there are more sensible policy solutions as Maryland transitions to \"green\" fire fighting foam. SB 273 prohibits the sale or use of PFAS foam after January 1, 202 3, and outlines stricter disposal requirements. MACo is informed by local firefighting departments that the cost of foam without PFAS is becoming increasingly cost -competitive compared to foam with added PFAS chemicals. However, some firefighting departments have an existing stock of previously purchased foam that may not be used up prior to the implementation of the ban. One firefighting truck alone could currently house upward s of $20,000 worth of foam. If properly maintained, that foam could last for several years. MACo has been working to identify amendments which would effectively ban PFAS foams going forward while recognizing the current limitations of local fire departments. Two possible solutions were identified which seem to strike that balance. First, amend ing the bill to allow for the PFAS foams after the ban. This would allow local fire departments to more reasonably transition to PFAS -free alternatives. The second possibl e solution would be to establish a buyback program that would go into effect in tandem with the ban. This would give local fire departments the ability to adequately dispose of any remaining P FAS foam, while not subject ing them to an unfunde d mandate. Counties agree that it is time to transition away from the use of PFAS chemicals, but that transition should be done in a safe and sensible manner. Accordingly, MACo urges the Committee to issue a report of FAVORABLE WITH AMENDMENTS for SB 273. MD PFAS SB 273 final Elizabeth Olds Position: UNF1 LEGISLATIVE POSITION: UNFAVORABLE Senate Bill 273 Environment - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Senate Committee on Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs February 2, 2022 The Honorable Paul Pinsky , Chair, Senate Committee on Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs The Honorable Cheryl Kagan , Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Dear Chair Pinsky, Vice Chair Wilson , and Members of the Committee: The American Forest & Paper Associationi (AF&PA) appreciates the opportunity to share our perspective on Senate Bill 273 on behalf of our members and their employees who are an integral part of the circular economy. In Maryland , the forest products industry employs nearly 6,000 individuals in facilities that produce packaging, sales displays, corrugated boxes and other prod ucts with an annual payroll of over $374 million. ii Senate Bill 273 seeks to ban food packaging that contains any amount or type of intentionally -added PFAS. AF&PA would like to weigh -in specifically on the food packaging language ; we do not offer a position on the firefighting foam or floor coverings sections of the bill. During the prev ious session, our industry offered several amendments to similar pieces of PFAS legislation (SB 195 and HB 22). Unfortunately, it appears some of our constructive language regarding compliance time extension and the definitions of \"i ntentionally -added\" and \"food packaging\" was not incorporated into this bill . Therefore, we must oppose SB 273. Please find att ached to this letter our previous amendment language regarding the following issues outlined in greater detail below : 1. Extend the compliance time 2. Amend the definition of \"intentionally -added\" for consistency with other state and federal standards and set a de minimis amount for clarity 3. Amend the definition of food package to not include the food or beverage product but just the food packaging itself AF&PA Members ' Commitment to Safe Chemistry AF&PA members are committed to ensuring the safety of their products, including the safety of chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. AF&PA believes chemical and product -related legislation and regulations should be protective of health, cost -effective and based on the best available science. 2 AF&PA member companies use only modern short -chain PFAS chemistries that have been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe for use in food packaging through the food contact notification process. These chemistries do not have toxicity profiles of the PFAS of concern -- PFOA and PFOS, which the FDA banned in 2016. Based on our knowledge of our members' practices, intent ional use of FDA -approved PFAS in limited applications for grease and moisture resistance is nominal compared with the total production of paper products. Even for these remaining limited uses, there are ongoing efforts to find alternatives to PFAS. 1. Extend the compliance time. AF&PA encourages extending the compliance period in SB 273 to January 1, 202 4, to accommodate our industry's ongoing voluntary phase -out programs. 2. Amend the definition of \"intentionally -added\" for consistency with other state and federal standards and set a de minimis amount for clarity . AF&PA encourages states to avoid duplicative and sometimes conflicting regulatory efforts. Chemicals in products should be regulated at the federal, not the state level. It is essential that products moving in interstate commerce be subject to uniform standards. The FDA is the proper agency to develop standards and ensure food packaging is safe. 3. Amend the definition of food package to include only the food packaging designed for direct food contact, and not the food or beverage product . While t he definition of food packaging in SB 273 covers packaging for direct food contact, it also includes overly broad language for food pack aging that does not have direct food contact, including food and beverage product s contained within a food package to which a n ad ditional food package is applied. We believe only packaging designed for direct food contac t should be regulated under SB 273 . Conclusion We encourage the Committee to avoid measures that would result in unintended consequences and penalize paper -based packaging. We look forward to continuing our work with the State of Maryland.

SB 273 Environment PFAS Chemicals Cecil County C Uploaded by: Katie Lewis Position: UNF Government Relations Committee Meeting Cecil County Chamber of Commerce Elkton, Maryland LEGISLATIVE POSITION: OPPOSE Senate Bill 273 Environment -PFAS Chemicals -Prohibitions and Requirements Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee February 1, 202 2 Dear Chairman Pinsky and Members of the Committee: On behalf of the four hundred and fifty Cecil County Chamber members who represent over fifteen thousand employees we are writing to you to express our strong opposition to SB 273 which would prohibit the use, manufacturing, or knowing sale or distribution of products, including fire -fighting f oam, carpet/rugs and food packaging, that contain intentionally added PFAS chemicals. The bill would require this prohibition to take effect on January 1, 202 3, or what amounts to less than one year after its potential enactment. Fluorinated chemicals, ot herwise known as per -and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are a large and diverse family of chemistry that make possible the use of products that are central to our everyday lives including, but certainly not limited to: electronics, aircraft, alternativ e energy, medical devices and building/construction materials. However, not all PFAS are created equal. Each individual chemistry has its own unique properties and uses. Fluoropolymers, for example, are a distinct class within the broad PFAS group. High molecular weight fluoropolymers are highly stable, too large to be bioavailable, and do not have the potential to become widespread in the environment. Data shows that the properties of fluoropolymers present low health and environmental hazards, and the s cientific community considers these materials to be inert. Unfortunately, the definition of PFAS as drafted in Senate Bill 273 is extremely broad and amounts to an all -out ban, without considering the differences in chemical classes, some of which have b een widely recognized as having low health and environmental risk. Product bans often result in a myriad of unintended consequences that should be further explored. The legislation would take effect on January 1, 202 3, less than one year after its potenti al enactment. It proposes to do this without an established regulatory process and timeline. As a result, it would be unrealistic to assume that manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will have the alternatives and tools required to comply with the law , particularly in such a short period of time. As well, in the absence of regulatory assessment on the performance of PFAS alternatives, there is no way to demonstrate that their replacement would represent an improvement over the current product. W. L. Gore & Associates is the largest private sector employer in Cecil County with approximately 2,900 Associates working in Cecil County. Gore uses a type of PFAS, fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), to make a variety of products of societ al value including implantable medical devices, waterproof and breathable membranes, fuel cell components, filtration and venting products used in emission controls and products used in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the definition of PFAS containe d in the legislation is extremely broad, there is the potential for untended restriction of these useful fluoropolymers. For these reasons, the Chamber respectfully requests an unfavorable report on Senate Bill 273. Do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further service to you on this critically important proposed legislation. Thank you for your attention and consideration . Members of Cecil County Chamber Government Relations 273 Environment -PFAS Chemicals- Prohibitions and Requirements Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee Wednesday , February 2, 2022 Dear Chairma n Pinsky and Members of the Committee: Founded in 1968, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce is the leading voice for business in Maryland. We are a statewide coalition of more than 5, 500 members and federated partners working to develop and promote strong public policy that ensures sustained economic recovery and growth for Maryland businesses, employees , and families. If passed, SB 273 would prohibit the use, manufacturing , or kno wing sale or distribution of products, including fire -fighting foam, carpet/rugs and food packaging, that contain intentionally added PFAS chemicals .

The procedures and timeline for transitioning certain retail pr oducts, January 1, 2023, is unrealistic and does not allow adequate time to develop a regulatory proces s to evaluate chemistries used in consumer products. The proposed definition of food package found in 91901 is very broad and could be interpreted to cover a wide range of durable food processing equipment, such a s tubing, refrigerators, ovens and refrigerated rail cars. W. L. Gore & Associates - A Maryland Manufacturer W. L. Gore & Associates is a privately held company employing m ore than 2,900 peop le working in 13 manufacturing facilities in Cecil County Maryland. Gore has be en a presence in Maryl and since 1973 and we are the largest private sector employer in Cecil County. We us e high molecular weight fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (\"PTF E\") to manufacture a wide varie ty of products of high societal value including implantable medical de vices, GORETEX m embranes, filtr ation and venting used in emission controls, fuel cell components, products used in the pharmaceut ical industry, and aerospace cables and aircraft sealing. PFAS (per and polyfluoro alkyl substances) Definition The PFAS group includes thousands of different substances with very different properties, and different PFAS are used in a wide variety of products. While we do not m ake or sell firefighting foam, carpet, or food packaging, we are concerned abou t the potential for unintended restriction of fluorop olymers associated with legislation based on broad definitions of PFAS. Fluoropolymers are a d istinct class within the broad group . High molecular weig ht fluoropolymers like PTFE are highly stable, too larg e to be bioavailable, and do no t have the potential to become widespread in the environment. While these fluoropolymers do contain one or more fully fluorinated carbon atoms, data show that their properties prese nt low health and environmental hazards. i The scientific community 2 considers these materials to be inert. The iner tness of PTFE h as already been recognized in the Maryland regulations: \"Fluoropolymer material (FPM) me ans an inert fluorinated chemic al that includes polytetrafluoroethylene or similar materials and is proce ssed with other materials to p roduce products that are temperature resistant, chemically inert, and weather durable.\" COMAR 26.11 .19.30B(5) We have observed that many gro ups who are working to address im portant health and environmental topics use the broad term PFAS, when they are most interested i n a distinct subgroup of PFAS (e.g., perfluoroalkyl acids such as PFOA). Many of the issues raised focus on specific properties such as: water solubility (mobility), toxicity, the potential for a substance to bioaccumulate, and the propensity for a substance to degrade into othe r substances o f concern. Because they are large, immobile , and inert materials, fluoropo lymers like PTFE are di fferent from the PFAS that are the source of potential environmental concern. The cu rrent legislative definition of \"PFAS Chemicals\" in 61601 is not overb road, because it is limited to a small number of PFAS used in firefighting foam. The proposed amendment, however, would broaden the defin ition of PFAS Chemicals to cover all PFAS, including fluoropolymers. We suggest that the definition of \"PFAS Chemicals\" ex clude high molecular weight fluoropolymers such as PT FE, or that it be narrowed to c over the classes of PFAS typically used in carpet treatments and food packaging treatments. To exclude fluoropolymers, the definition of PFAS Chemical in 1 6160(D) and cou ld be as follows: \"PFAS means nonpolymeric per an d polyfluoroalkyl substances t hat are a group of manmade chemicals that contain at least two fluori nated carbon atoms, excluding g ases and volatile liquids. PFAS include PFOA and PFOS. Procedures and Timelines for Transitioning Retail Products We note that for rugs and carpets (61604.1(B)) and for food pa ckaging (91902(D)), the legislation is proposed to go into effect on January 1, 2023. In the absence of a regulatory assessment on the performance of alternatives, the re is no means to demonstrate t hat any replacements for the restricted PFAS will provide the necessary p erformance or represent an imp rovement over the curre nt product. Also, without regulatory guidance on how to establish compliance (e.g . appropriate analytical methods), manufacturers, distributors and retailers will lack the tools t hat they need to demonstrate compliance, especially in such a short time frame. If the intention is to improve the environmen tal profile of certain consumer products, Gore believes a better approach would be to develop legislation that establishes a regulatory process to evaluate c hemistries used in consumer pro ducts. One recent example of such a regulatory program is \"Safer Pro ducts for Washington\" establish ed in 2019 by the \"Pollution Prevention for Healthy People and Puget Sound Act.\" https://ecology.wa.gov/Wa steToxics/Reducingtoxic chemicals/Saferproducts 3 Food Packaging Definition The proposed definition of food package found in 91901 is very broad and could be interpreted to cover a wide range of durable food processing equipment, such as tubing , refrigerators, ovens and refrigerated rail cars. Because of their inertne ss and purity, fluoropolymers su ch as PTFE are authorized for use in articles intended to come int o contact with food. 21 CFR 177.1550. It is our understanding that the PFAS typically used in single use consumer food packaging (e.g. microwave popcorn bags, fast food wrappers) are not fluoropolymers. As d iscussed above, due to the complexity of this topic, we believe the legis lation should seek to establish a regulatory program rather than effect a legislative ban. In addition to narrowing the definition of PF AS, we suggest that the food package definition be narrowed to focus on high volu me food packaging that is typi cally thrown away after a single shortterm use. We are not experts in t his area, but think the language could be modified along the following lines to achieve the distinction between d isposable packaging and durabl e products: 91901(c) \"Disposable or Single Us e Food Package\" means a packa ge or packaging component that is designed for a single short term direct food contact use, such as food wrappers and bags, bottles, straws, disposable cups, and lids, disposable cutlery, plates and takea way containers, including: . . .\" Summary Our concerns with SB 273 include: 1. Not all PFAS are the same and th e definition of PFAS in these b ills is overly broad and could lead to unintended consequences. 2. Gore has 2,900 Associates working in 13 plants in Cecil County manufacturing products of high societal value using a type of fluoropolymers (e.g., ePTFE/PTFE ) that are considered to present low health and environmental hazards. 3. The bills' procedures and time lines for transitioning retail pr oducts are unrealistic. In the absence of a regulatory assessmen t on the performance of altern atives, there is no means to demonstrate that any replacement s for the PFAS that will be an improvement over the current product. Also, without regulator y guidance on how to establish and demonstrate compliance, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers will lack the tools they need to comply, especially in a short time frame. 4. The proposed definition of food packaging found in 91901 is ve ry broad and could be interpreted to cover a wide range of durable food processing eq uipment such as tubing, refrigerators, ovens and refrigerated rail cars. i Henry BJ et al., 2018. A Critical Review of the Application o f Polymer of Low Concern and Regulatory Criteria to Fluoropolymers. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Manage ment Volume 14, Number 3, pp. 316334. Unfavorable Testimony UNF January 31, 2022 Subject: Testimony to Maryland Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee on Senate Bill # 0273 (HB 0275) Honorable Chairman Pinsky and Members of this Committee: My name is Mitch Hubert. Thank you for the opportunity to address your committee today. I hold degrees in both Biology and Chemistry and have been working in the Firefighting Foam industry for more than 40 years as a formulation chemist and fire fighter. I am here today representing the Fire Fighting Foam Coalition (FFFC) to urge you to reconsider Senate Bill 0273. Our coalition is made up of foam manufacturers from throughout the world who fully support efforts to reduce the use of PFAS foams and are w orking feverishly to develop and improve non-fluorinated alternatives . All of the foam manufacturers that are members of FFFC make fluorine -free foams and fully support a timely transition to these products wherever possible. Unfortunately, t here are stil l fire scenarios and industry segments where the current technology utilized in fluorine -free foams falls short of providing the type of performance that can assure that large catastrophic fires can be successfully fought and extinguished, and which provid e a measure of safety for firefighters and other first responders. As such the proposed legislation could hamper and possibly prevent firefighting efforts in these high hazard applications. Sadly, we are faced with legacy issues of fluorinated surfactants that were released to the environment from firefighting foams largely through testing and fire training, much of which was mandated through laws and standards. What is important at this juncture is to minimize any additional discharges. Banning the use of fluorinated foams for testing and training can largely accomplish this goal. While we continue to make advances in fluorine -free foam technology, we are still not at the point where those products can be considered as drop -in replacements. This is substa ntiated by a recent study conducted by the National Fire Protection Association Research Foundation in a rather extensive testing program on the effectiveness of fluorine -free foams. The conclusion of that report, which is published and can be made availab le, is that there is more work to do with these products in some fire scenarios. The proposed legislation would require most foam users in the state to have transitioned to fluorine -free foams by January 202 3, which we consider to be extremely challenging . Recently proposed foa m regulations in the European Union and New Zealand provide for a 5 -year transition period. We urge you to reconsider this bill and allow the continued use and sale of fluorinated firefighting foams for areas where we simply do n ot have drop -in replacements. These very specific exemptions would include refineries, chemical facilities, bulk fuel loading terminals and fixed foam suppression systems. Meanwhile we in the foam industry and within government research grants will contin ue the task of improving firefighting foams that do not contain PFAS chemicals. Respectfully submitted, Mitch Hubert Technical Director Fire Fighting Foam Coalition (FFFC) Unfavorable Testimony Uploaded by: Shawn 2022 The Honorable Paul Pinsky, Chair Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee Miller Senate Office Building, 2W Annapolis, Maryland 21401 Re: Senate Bill 273 - PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act) Dear Chair Pinsky and Committee Members: The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE or Department) has reviewed SB 273, PFAS Chemicals - Prohibitions and Requirements (George \"Walter\" Taylor Act), and would like to provide some information about this legislation. The bill would ban the use, manufacture, sale, or distribution of Class B fire-fighting foam, except as authorized under federal law, that contains intentionally added per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemical on or after January 1, 2023. The bill eliminates the current statutory exemption for fire-fighting foams used at the Baltimore Washington International Airport. A person who sells personal protective equipment (PPE) that contain PFAS chemicals worn by fire-fighting personnel in the performance of fire and rescue activities would be required to provide written notice to the purchaser that includes a statement that the PPE contains PFAS chemicals, and the reason why, and both the seller and purchaser must keep the notice for at least 3 years after the date of sale. Additionally, the bill would ban the use, manufacture, sale, or distribution of carpets or rugs and food packaging or any product in a food package that contains \"intentionally added\" PFAS chemicals on or after January 1, 2023. Persons subject to these product bans would be required to establish a certificate of compliance demonstrating compliance with the ban and must provide the certificate of compliance to MDE within 30 days of a request. The bill would also ban the disposal of Class B fire-fighting foam with \"intentionally added\" PFAS through incineration or in a landfill. In late 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published interim guidance on the destruction and disposal of PFAS and materials containing PFAS. In the guidance, EPA evaluated thermal treatment, landfilling, and underground injection, identified data gaps and uncertainties with the destruction and disposal alternatives. EPA did not make direct recommendations on the PFAS destruction and disposal alternatives that should be used, but provided information so managers of PFAS or PFAS-containing materials can make informed decisions in the evaluation of existing destruction and disposal options. The document is available on EPA's website at epa.gov/pfas/interim-guidance-destroying-and-disposing-certain-pfas-and-pfas-containing-materials-are-not . Under SB 273, a person authorized to use Class B fire-fighting foam with PFAS would be prohibited from releasing the foam directly to the environment and must fully contain all releases, implement containment measures, dispose of all waste, report the release to MDE, and maintain documentation on these measures. Failure of a person to meet these requirements does not preclude the use of foam if the failure to not release or contain the foam was a result of factors beyond the control of the person. MDE, the Maryland Attorney General, a State's Attorney, county attorney or city attorney would be authorized to request documentation from any person required to maintain documentation verifying their compliance, and the person to whom the request is made must provide the documentation upon request. The bill would authorize MDE to develop regulations to enforce the ban on Class B fire-fighting foam, fire-fighting PPE, and carpets or rugs that contain intentionally added PFAS chemicals, and the release and containment requirements for persons authorized to use Class B fire-fighting foam with \"intentionally added\" PFAS chemicals. (MDE already has the authority to adopt regulations to enforce the proposed ban on a food package with intentionally added PFAS chemicals under existing \u00a79-1907 of the Environment Article.) The bill contains penalty provisions for violators of the bill's requirements. Further, SB 273 would establish two new reporting requirements for MDE. On or before December 31, 2022, MDE would be required to report to the General Assembly on the results of any testing for PFAS chemicals conducted in waters of the state, any plan for further testing for PFAS chemicals in waters of the state, and any plan for remediation and public education in areas where the water has been found to be contaminated by PFAS chemicals. Since the information required to be included in this report will need to be compiled from different programs within MDE, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to complete the report in the 5-month period provided. Lastly, MDE and the Maryland Department of Health would be required to coordinate with other relevant state agencies, the federal government, local governments, and the public to prepare and submit by December 31, 2023 a PFAS Action Plan to the General Assembly that identifies strategies, actions, and funding alternatives for, among other things, minimizing public and environmental exposures to PFAS and cleaning up historical releases of PFAS. It would take a significant amount of effort to coordinate with and identify various relevant stakeholders and to conduct literature review of PFAS research, which is constantly evolving. MDE has been sampling PFAS in public water systems starting in 2020, and continuing through 2022. MDE is also sampling fish and shellfish tissue to determine the levels of bioaccumulation. MDE works with the EPA to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense sites in Maryland are assessed, remediated and monitored wherever PFAS are present. More information regarding MDE's PFAS-related activities can be found online at mde.maryland.gov/PublicHealth/Pages/PFAS-Landing-Page.aspx . According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there are nearly 5,000 different PFAS compounds. SB 273 would ban any Class B fire-fighting foam, carpet or rug, and food packaging and place notification requirements on fire-fighting PPE that contains one of 5,000 different chemicals. MDE would need to establish a new regulatory program to enforce these provisions for several products not currently regulated by the Department. This bill would increase MDE workload by creating the following new responsibilities: conducting research to identify brands and the manufacturers, distributors, retailers, or industry users of Class B fire-fighting foam, carpet or rug, food packaging, and fire-fighting PPE; adopting regulations to implement the bill's provisions; overseeing persons with unused Class B firefighting foam to ensure the product is stored in an environmentally safe manner; and conducting targeted inspection and other enforcement actions as needed. MDE currently has adequate and sufficient staff and resources to conduct its mission effectively and efficiently. Any additional legislatively-mandated program or regulation, such as this, will likely hamper our efficiency, force us to divert resources away from current core competencies and likely disrupt customer service and/or diminish services. 2Thank you for your consideration. We will continue to monitor SB 273 during the committee's deliberations, and I am available to answer any questions you may have.
