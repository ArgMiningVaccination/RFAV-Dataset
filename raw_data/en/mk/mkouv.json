It is believed that the practice emerged from the observation of the body's natural healing processes and the patterns of energy flow. Central to acupuncture is the concept of \"Qi\" (pronounced as \"chee\"). In Chinese philosophy, Qi is the vital life energy that circulates within the body, maintaining health, vitality, and overall balance. The flow of Qi travels through specific pathways called \"meridians.\" According to traditional Chinese medicine, illnesses or ailments arise when there is an imbalance or blockage of Qi in these meridians. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very thin needles at specific points, known as \"acupuncture points,\" located along the meridians. These points are believed to be gateways to influence, redirect, or balance the flow of Qi. The number of needles used, their specific locations, and the depth of insertion can vary based on the patient's condition and the practitioner's assessment. We're pleased to announce that we do provide coverage for acupuncture treatments!
