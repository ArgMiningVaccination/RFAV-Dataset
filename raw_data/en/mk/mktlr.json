The new vaccination site will operate from 8 AM to 6 PM, Friday through Tuesday each week, offering approximately 1,000 shots per day. \"It's going to take all of us to bring back the city we know and love. With that, I would like to wish a warm whale-come to the American Museum of Natural History,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio. \"The City thanks you for your partnership in getting every New Yorker vaccinated.\" As part of our City's focus on vaccine equity, the recovery of NYC, and the return to work for City employees and cultural staff, this location will include set-aside appointments for local NYCHA residents and staff, as well as union staff, such as DC37 workers who work in cultural fields, and Museum staff. The site will also offer appointments for the general public. Additional days and appointments will be available as supply increases citywide. Eligible New Yorkers can now make an appointment at this location by using [nyc.gov/vaccinefinder](http://www.nyc.gov/vaccinefinder) or by calling 877-VAX-4NYC. \"With more than 5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, and ongoing vaccination efforts expanding every week, a safe, healthy re-opening of our City is on the horizon, which is why we're continuing to double down on our strategies that have worked, adding new sites and new ways to access the vaccine,\" said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Melanie Hartzog. \"We're thrilled that the Museum of Natural History is joining this fight on the forefront of science, and we look forward to the day we can together look back on this moment in history - preserved as yet another diorama for generations of students to visit and reflect upon.\" \"The American Museum of Natural History is an iconic monument to science and discovery,\" said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi. \"Serving as a setting for our historic vaccination campaign is both exciting and perfectly fitting.\" \"As president of the American Museum of Natural History, an institution dedicated to fostering scientific knowledge and understanding and to providing access to that information, I cannot think of a more important manifestation of our mission in action,\" said Ellen V. Futter, President of the American Museum of Natural History. \"We are pleased to be part of this historic effort which is so important for the health and welfare of our fellow New Yorkers and for the recovery of our City.\" \"Our cultural institutions are the jewels of New York City. There is simply no recovery without their reopening,\" said Henry Garrido, Executive Director, District Council 37, AFSCME. \"That's why it's critical the people who make them run are protected. Granting these workers priority for vaccination appointments helps everyone, and we thank Mayor de Blasio for making it happen.\" \"Thanks to the advocacy of the American Museum of Natural History, the Upper West Side of Manhattan will finally get a dedicated vaccine spot, \" said Assemblymember Linda B. Rosenthal. \"By now, when eligibility has expanded to include everyone and we have a surplus of doses available, each community should have its own vaccine location. After months of demanding the City open an Upper West Side location, my constituents and I are pleased that AMNH will help fill this vital need and get shots in arms "}
