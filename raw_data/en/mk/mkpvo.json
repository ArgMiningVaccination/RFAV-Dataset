This urgent need to 'get away' is becoming an increasing reality. Pencil yourself 'in' Even though I am working long hours each day in Bali, my body and mind have welcomed the break from the digital world that has become a necessity in modern life. We schedule everything for work and family on our calendar...but 'me' time is even more important than most of what we put on our to-do list. So, I'm making a commitment to myself when I'm back in Charleston: one hour each week of total inward escape. I'm booking a month ahead to be sure! The power of healing touch Our body has the ability to recharge quickly if we remember to nurture ourselves. Just 60 minutes to reflect, detox or beautify gives powerful health-promoting experiences and makes us more productive when we return to the busy-ness of life. The healing powers of touch therapy, like Reiki and massage, has benefits that go beyond the realm of the physical. Our mind and soul need this respite also. I hope you are taking time to nurture yourself. The good vibes and also the not-so-good vibes connect us all. A commitment to personal health and wellbeing, creates positive energy to share with family and community. Be good to yourself and spread the love! In gratitude and peace, ~ Kathryn FREE treatments during Design Walk Stop by Seeking Indigo during Design Walk Thursday night, April 17 from 6 - 8pm.
