For practical information about using BNT162b2 patients should read the Information for UK recipients or contact their doctor or healthcar e practi tioner. What is BNT162 b2 and what is it used for? BNT162b2 is a vaccine indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus , in individuals 1 2 years of age and older . How does BNT162 b2 work? When a person is given BNT162b2, it triggers the body to natural ly produce antibodies and stimulates immune cells to protec t against COVID -19. How is BNT162 b2 used? The pharmaceutical form of this medicine is an injection. Following dilution with saline, BNT162b2 is given to you by an authorised practitioner as an intramuscular injection into the muscle at the top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle) . You should receive t wo doses (each 0.3mL) given 21 days apart. For further information on how BNT162b2 is used, refer to the Information for UK Healthcare Professionals and the Inform ation for UK recipients available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) website. This vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription. If a person has any questions concerning the vaccine, they should ask the administering healthcare practitioner. What benefits of BNT162 b2 have been shown in studies? BNT162b2 has been studied in approximately 43,000 individuals 16 years of age and older who were equally allocated to the vaccine or a placebo . Those who received vaccination with BNT162b2 had a reduction in the rate of COVID -19 illness compared to those who received placebo (8 cases of COVID -19 illness in the vaccinated group compared to 162 cases in the placebo group ). These results were observed 7 days followin g the second dose in study participants with no evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection . A similar benefit of the vaccine was observed in subjects with one or more other medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID -19 disease , such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or asthma . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 3 What are the possible side effects of BNT162b2? The most common side effects with BNT162 b2 (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) were pain at the injection site, tiredness , headache, m uscle pain , chills, joint pain and fever. Adverse events were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination . Why was BNT162 b2 approved? It was concluded that BNT162 b2 has been shown to be effective in the prevention of COVID -19. Furthermore, the side effects observed with use of this vaccine are considered to be similar to those seen with other vaccines . Therefore, the MHRA concluded that the benefits are greater than the risks and recommended that this medicine can be authorised for temporary supply during the COVID -19 pandemic . What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of BNT162 b2? All new medicines approved require a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to ensure they are used as safely as possible. An RMP has been agreed for the use of BNT162 b2 in the UK . Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the Information for UK Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients , including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients. All side effects reported by patients/healthcare professionals are continuously monitored. Any new safety signals identified will be reviewed and, if necess ary, appropriate regulatory action will be taken. The MHRA has also put in place a n additional proactive safety monitoring plan for all COVID -19 vaccines to enable rapid analysis of safety information which is important during a pandemic. Other informati on about BNT162 b2 Authorisation for the temporary supply of BNT162 b2 was granted in the UK on 1 December 2020. The full public assessment report for BNT162 b2 follows this summary. This summary was last updated in June 2021 .

PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation TABLE OF CONTENTS I INTRODUCTION ................................ ................................ ................................ ......... 5 II NON RECOMMENDATION ................................ ................................ ................................ ........... 50 TABLE OF CONTENT OF THE ............................... 51 Annex 1 ................................ PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 5 I INTRODUCTION This report is based on the information provided by the company in a rolling data submission procedure and it covers the authorisation for temporary supply of BNT162b2. At the time of writing, the main clinical study is still on -going and addi tional data is being collected. Due to differences in the collection date, the data and information in this report may differ from that contained in documents relating to BNT162b2 released by other regulatory authorities. Quality aspects of the vaccine are reviewed on a batch -specific basis. In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Chin a and in January 2020, a novel coronavirus was discovered as the underlying cause. Infections by the virus, named SARS -CoV -2, and the resul ting disease, COVID -19, have spread globally. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the COVID -19 outbreak to be a pandemic. At the time of this report, the number of COVID -19 cases in the UK is estimated at 1. 64 million and more than 60,000 deaths have been attributed to the disease. These numbers continue to rise. The elderly and those with pre -existing medical conditions are at a n increased risk of severe disease and death from COVID -19. Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention to decrease risk and reduce spread of the SARS -CoV -2 virus. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is leading the Government's deployment of vaccinations against COVID -19. In order to save l ives, and to reduce the number of people who need hospital treatment due to COVID -19, the DHSC have sought to deploy a safe and effective vaccination as soon as possible. In a letter dated November 17th 2020 , the DHSC request ed authori sation , on a temporary basis, of its proposed supply of a vaccine manufactured by Pfizer/Bio NTech collaboration , named \" COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 \", under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, (\"the Regulations\") . Following an extensive review of the quality, safety and efficacy data, COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been authori sed for temporary supply in the UK for the following indication: active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. The active substance of the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is a multi -dose concentrate of RNA -containing lipid nanoparticles formulated in salin e and sucrose to be diluted for intramuscular (IM) administration. A single vial contains 5 doses of 30 micrograms of BNT162b2 RNA (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). COVID -19 Vaccine is messenger RN A (mRNA) produced by cell -free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates . COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 encodes viral spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2, with two point mutations inserted to lock S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation (P2 S) . It is formulated an nanoparticle of nucleoside - modified mRNA uridine. into lipid nanoparticle s enables transfection of the mRNA into host cells after intramuscular injection. During mixing of the RNA and the dissolved lipids, the lipids form the nanoparticles encapsulating the RNA. After injection, the lipid nanoparticles are taken up by the cells, and the RNA is released into the cytosol. In the cytosol, the RNA is translated into the encoded viral protein. The viral spike (S) protein antigen induces an adaptive immune PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 6 response through neutrali sing antibodies. Furthermore , as the expressed spike (S) protein is being degraded intracellularly, the resulting peptides can be presented at the cell surface, triggering a specific T cell -mediated immune response with activity against the virus and infected cells . The authorisation is for an identified batch of the vaccine (provided certain conditions are met), together with future batches, which will each be approved by MHRA on a batch - specific basis. These conditions are published on the MHRA website . The MHRA has been assured that acceptable standards of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) are in place for this product at all sites responsible for the manufacture, assembly and batch release of this product. A Risk Management Plan (RMP) and a summary of the pha rmacovigilance system have been provided with this application and are satisfactory. This batch , and any future batches, of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 are subject to Qualified Person (QP) certification and batch evaluation by an independent control laboratory before the vaccine is release d into the UK. The COVID -19 Vaccine Benefit Risk Expert Working Group (Vaccine BR EWG) have met several times to review and discuss the quality , safety and efficacy aspects in relation to batches of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . The manufacturer , Pfizer/BioNTech, was also invited to a separate meeting with the quality subgroup of the Vaccine BR EWG to review and discuss questions related to manufacture and control of the product . The Vaccine BR EWG gave advice to the Commission of Human Medicines (CHM) on 11th September 2020, 8th October 2020, 27th October 2020 , 28th November 2020 and 30th November 2020 , regarding the requirements for authorisation for the temporary supply of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . The requirements for quality, safety and efficacy were considered, taking into account the urgent public health need and risk to life , the pandemic situation and a lack of COVID -19 vaccines. As well as data on quality, safety and efficacy, specific mitigations and condition s on the product were discussed to ensure adequate standards of quality and safety are met. The CHM concluded that the proposed sup ply of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older , is recommended to be suitable for approval under Regulation 174 provided the company meets the conditions set out by the MHRA. Authorisation for the temporary supply of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was granted in the UK on 1 December 2020. This report covers data received and reviewed for this authorisation only. This authorisation is valid until expressly withdrawn by MHRA or upon issue of a marketing authorisation. Whilst an acceptable level of information has been received to provide assurance that appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy have been met for authorisation of specific batches for temporary supply under Regulation 174 of the Regulations , it should be noted that COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 remains under review as MHRA continue s to receive data from the company as it becomes available. This will include, f or example, long-term follow -up efficacy and safety data. Further information that is received by the PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 7 MHRA will be reviewed as part of the ongoing assessment for this product and updates will be made to this PAR to reflect that in due course. On 4 June 2021 the MHRA gra nted an extension of indication to 'the active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus, in individuals 12 years of age and older '.

Eur . quality standards II.2 ACTIVE SUBSTANCE Drug Substance (BNT162b2 RNA) BNT162b2 drug substance is a single -stranded, 5' -capped mRNA encoding the full -length viral protein of SARS -CoV -2. The optimised codon sequence encoding the spike glycoprotein antigen of the SARS -CoV -2 virus results in a protein expressed with two proline mutations that fix the S1S2 spike protein in a pre -fusion conformation to increase potentia l to elicit virus neutrali sing antibodies. In addition , the RNA contains common structural elements optimi sed for mediating high RNA modified N1- methylpseudouridine (m1TP) in the RNA synthesis which increases RNA persistence in- vivo through dampening of innate immune response to itself . The 5 prime end is capped with a structure which will not activate the innate immune system .

This utili sed principles described in ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development and was based on the available scientific knowledge and the manufacturer's prior experience with similar RNA -lipid nanoparticle vaccines, as well as risk assessments and development s tudies. The characteri stics of the drug product were provided , as well as formulation de velopment and process characterisation studies . The development history , including process changes have been summarised. The manufacturer has described their approach to defining critical quality attributes and the rationale for their criticality decisions , as well as their process risk assessment strategy and methodology, which was accompanied by a description of the manufacturer's product development and characterisation strategy . Operating ranges have been define d and the manufacture r is working on the validation of the final commercial process, which follows process optimisation . A quality target product profile for the finished product has been established taking into consideration the World Health Organization's \"WHO Target Product Profiles for COVID - 19 Vaccines \". Development studies have been submitted which support the compatibility of the vaccine with the container closure and the unpreserved sodium chloride 0 .9% diluent as well as commonly used needles and syringes. The manufacturer has performed a comparability assessment of batches used in the clinical trial programme and batches representative of manufacturing changes occurring during product development, such as introduction of new manufacturing sites, process changes and increas e in batch scale. In addition to release te sting, the manufacturer also investigated several extended characterisation test parameters. These data will be supplemented as further experience with the manufacturing process accumula tes. The recommendation for the batch which is the subject of this assessment was based on a direct comparison of the batch release results with the results for the clinically qualified batches . Manufacture of the product A description of the manufacturing method for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been provided and consists of : thawing and dilution of the drug substance, lipid nanoparticle formation upon mixing organic and aqueous phases (where specialised equipment is used for LNP formation ), buffer exchange, concentration, filtration , formulation, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, visual inspection, labelling and freezing , and storage packaging and shipment. In-process monitoring and control are performed . In-process controls and process parameters for each manufacturing step are provided and criticality has been assigned . Further in-process details are expected from the manufacturer however the information provided to date are acceptable . As part of the control of the product, o nce vials are manufactured, they undergo 100% visual inspection for defects . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 10 A condition of authorisation under this regulation is that the manufacturer will provide further data on the drug product manufacturing process as it is scaled up . Excipients The excipients phosphate dihydrate, monobasic potassium phosphate and water for injection are all of Ph. Eur. grades, which are acceptable. In addition to th ose excipients, the vaccine contains four lipids, of which two are used in approved medicinal products (cholesterol and 1,2 -distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine, hereafter termed DSPC) and two are considered novel in that they have not been used in an authorised medicinal product in the UK : ALC -0315 ((4 lipids are intended to encapsulate the mRNA in the form of a lipid nanoparticle to aid cell entry and stability of the RNA/lipid nanoparticles. ALC -0315 is the functional cationic lipid component of the drug product. When incorporated in lipid nanoparticles , it helps regulate the endosomal release of the RNA. During drug product manufacturing, introduction of an aqueous RNA solution to an ethanolic lipi d mixture containing ALC -0315 at a specific pH leads to an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged RNA backbone and the positively charged cationic lipid. This electrostatic interaction leads to encapsulation of RNA drug substance resulting with particle formation. Once the lipid nanoparticle is taken up by the cell, the low pH of the endosome renders the LNP fusogenic and allows the release of the RNA into the cytosol . The primary function of the PEGylated lipid ALC -0159 is to form a protective hydrophilic layer that sterically stabili ses the LNP which contributes to storage stability and reduces non - specific binding to proteins. As higher PEG content can reduce cellular uptake and interaction with the endosomal membrane , PEG co ntent is controlled . Cholesterol is included in the formulation to support bilayer structures in the lipid nanoparticle and to provide mobility of the lipid components within the lipid nanoparticle structure. The specification for the conventional lipid, cholesterol, is considered acceptable for the purpose of this application. DSPC is a phospholipid component intended to provide a stable bilayer -forming structure to balance the non -bilayer propensity of the cationic lipid. DSPC is a non -pharmacopeial excipient and an adequate specification has been provided. The controls in place for the excipients are considered suitable for this application. Excipients of human and animal origin No excipients of animal or human origin are used in the finished product. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 11 Novel excipients ALC -0315 is a cationic lipid and is critical to the self -assembly process of the particle itself, the ability of the particle to be taken up into cells and the escape of the RNA from the endosome. ALC -0159 is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid conjugate (i .e. PEGylated lipid). Finished Product Control The product specification includes relevant control parameters considering the nature of the product and its manufacturing process. Batch release data for this batch ha ve been evaluated comparing the results with the clinically qualified ranges from batches used in the clinical trial programme . Independent Batch testing Independent batch testing is required fo r vaccines and provides additional assurance of quality before a batch is made available to the market. Independent batch testing is a function that is undertaken by an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL) and, under Regulation 174A, the UKs Nation al Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) is responsible for this function. Each batch will be independently tested prior to deployment. Independent batch testing is product -specific and highly technical: it requires specific materials and documentation from the manufacturer and comprises laboratory -based testing and review of the manufacturer's test data. If all tests meet the product specifications a certificate of compliance is issued by the OMCL. Chara cterisation of impurities The impurity profile of the BNT162b2 drug product is based primarily on the impurity profile of the materials used for its manufacture. The manufacturer has described four identifi ed drug product manufacturing process -related impurities. A safe ty risk assessment for each of these four potential impurities has been performed and they are below the safety threshold given the intended product administration schedule. Process -impurities from the sucrose, phosphate and chloride salts used in the fin al drug product formulation are controlled through testing and specifications ensuring compliance to relevant compendial monographs . This is acceptable. The lipid impurities are controlled through the acceptance criteria used for their manufacture. No cri tical issues have been identified with respect to the lipids that would preclude the emergency use of the vaccine. Reference standards or materials The manufacturer has defined reference materials that are used in the determination of drug product content and in the determination of lipid content for the four lipids used for nanoparticle formation . These methods are considered conventional and uncomplicated to perform . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 12 Container closure system Overall, the container closure system has been well described and complies with the relevant quality standards of the Ph.Eur . The vaccine requires storage at ultra -low temperature conditions and the rubber septum is punctured at least 6 times to reconstitute the product and recover 5 doses from the vial. The manufacturer has provided details of adequate testing to provide evidence that the self -sealing capacity of the elastomeric closure is retained upon freezing and repeated thawing of product , even though the storage requirements do not permit this . The testing also accounted for the recommended needles for diluent addition. Stability The manufacturer has provided all stability data available to date. Information on the stability of batches used in clinical trials has been used to support conclusions on product storage and storage conditions . Based on the stability information currently available , a shelf -life of 6 months at -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C can be accepted for this vaccine , with the following storage conditions: - Store in a freezer at -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C. Store in the thermal container at -90\u00baC to -60\u00baC. Store in the original package in order to pr otect from light. After removal from frozen storage, the undiluted vaccine can be stored for up to 5 days (120 hours) at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C and up to 2 hours at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C, prior to use. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re -frozen. During storage, it is recommended that exposure to room light is minimised , and exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light avoided . Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. After dilution with unpreserved normal saline , the vaccine sh ould be store d at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C and use d as soon a s practically possible . Since the vaccine do es not contain a preservative , once the stopper has first been punctured on addition of the diluent, the vial should be used within 6 hours as is recommended by WHO guidance . After 6 hours , any unused vaccine left in the vial should be discarded . Depl oyment of this vaccine is subject to the conditions of this Regulation 174 approval . Suitable post approval stability commitments have been provided to continue stability testing on batches of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 , including for the batch concerning this Regulation 174 application . The manufacturer has committed to provide these data to the MHRA on an on -going basis as it becomes available. Handling of Pfizer Vaccine BNT162b2 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs ) are complex particles made of four lipid components that entrap the mRNA . Because of this complexity LNPs are potentially fragile to degradation and damage through inappropriate handling. The published storage conditions are qualified by the data reviewed by the MHRA . Long term storage : It must be stored frozen at ultra-low temperature ( ULT ). After removal from frozen storage , it has a shelf life of up to 120 hours at 2 -8 \u00baC before being diluted (label to be added once box removed from freezer) . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 13 In addition to the 120-hour period at 2-8 \u00baC, an undiluted vial can be stored for 2 hours at up to 25 \u00baC. This is intended to qualify removing the vial from the fridge for up to two hours immediately before it is diluted in preparation for use. It is not intended to qualify ad hoc removal from fridge within the 120 -hour period with a view to then replacing back into stock were it not to be used. Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be refrozen. Before dilution the vial must be inverted gently 10 times without shaking ( to avoid foaming ). Once the specified diluent is added , the vial must be inverted gently 10 times without shaking (to avoid foaming ). Once diluted, the vials should be marked with the dilution date and time. Transportation by motor vehicle of diluted vaccine away from the site of dilution is not currently supported by any relevant stability data . After dilution the vaccine should be used as soon as is practically possible and within 6 hours of dilution; it can be stored at 2 -25 \u00baC during this period. It woul d not normally be considered good practice to store diluted product for 6 hours at 25 \u00baC before being administered. Similarly , there are no data supporting multiple temperature cycling within that 6 hours that would qualify the product being repeatedly re moved and replaced into a fridge , as doses are administered over the course of 6 hours. Following dilution , vials should be used in the shortest time period possible. II.4 Regulation 174 Authorisation for temporary supply of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 under this Regulation 174 has been given following review of batch analytical data by MHRA. Independent batch release by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) will be performed on all batche s to be supplied to the UK . The quality data currently available for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 can be accepted as sufficient with specific conditions in place. There are no scientific objections arising from this review to the authorisation for temporary supply for this product under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicine Regulations . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 14 III NON -CLINICAL ASPECTS III.1 Introduction COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has been developed for use in healthy subjects to prevent COVID -19 on exposure to SARS -CoV -2. The vaccine has as its active agent messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), made by transcription of a DNA template, encoding for the fu ll-length spike (S) protein of SARS CoV -2 with two point mutations, to lock S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is given as two intramuscular injections (IM), 21 days apart, of the same dose of 30 g mR NA. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is made up of the mRNA component with 4 lipid components forming nanoparticles, of which two are novel and not used before in pharmaceutical products in the UK. The lipids function to encapsulate, stabilise the mRNA and mediate its delivery to cells. The following non -clinical studies were submitted with this application: Pharmacology Study 20 -0211: In vitro expression of BNT162b2 drug substance and drug product Study R -20-0085: COVID -19: Immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in mice Study R -20-0112: Characterizing the immunophenotype in spleen and lymph node of mice treated with SARS -CoV -2 vaccine candidates Study VR -VTR -10671: BNT162b2 immunogenicity and evaluation of protection challenge in rhe sus macaques Pharmacokinetics Study PF -07302048: Single dose -0315 and ALC -0159 following intravenous bolus injection of a nanoparticle formulation in rats Study R -20-0072: Biodistribution of BNT162b2 using the luciferase pro tein as a surrogate marker protein after intramuscular injection in mice. Toxicology Study 38166: Repeat -dose toxicity study of three LNP -formulated RNA platforms encoding for viral proteins by repeated intramuscular administration to Wistar Han rats Study 20GR142: 17 -day Intramuscular Toxicity Study of BNT162b2 and BNT162b3 in Wistar Ha n Rats These studies were conducted in accordance with current Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). III.2 Pharmacology This vaccine acts by intracellular translation of mRNA to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein to induce an immune response, a humoral neutralizing an tibody response and Th1 -type CD4+ and CD8+ cellular response, to block virus infection and kill virus infected cells, respectively. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 15 The vaccine was tested for its ability to result in S protein expression in a mammalian cell population in vitro, for its immunogenicity in mice in two studies, and in one study in rhesus monkeys, including its capacity to prevent disease after challenge with SARS Cov -2 virus in rhesus monkeys. The vaccine also induced an immune response in rats in the two toxicity studies.

The initial demonstration of in vitro expression in HEK293 cells confirmed that transfection and subsequent protein expression could take place, including in cells incubated with the nanoparticle presentation of the vaccine. In Study R-20-085, four groups of eight female mice were immuni sed once by the IM route on day 0 with 0.2 \u00b5g, 1 \u00b5g or 5 \u00b5g RNA/animal of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, or with a control. Antibody response was assessed at days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Study R -20-0112 aim ed to characteri se T- and B -cell responses in the spleen, lymph nodes and blood of BNT162b2 immunised mice. It characteri sed changes in the myeloid cell compartment, determined the ability of CD8+ T -cells to react to cells presenting the vaccine - encoded an tigen, and determined antibody responses. In Studies R -20-085 and R -20-0112 in mice, a dose -response effect was seen in the IgG responses specific for the SARS CoV -2 S1 protein fragment and its receptor binding domain. A high and dose -dependent pseudovirus neutralising antibody response was confir med. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cellular responses with a Th1 pattern of response (e.g. production of IFN -) were observed. Booster responses were not evaluated in these studies. Study VR-VTR -10671 was performed in male rhesus macaques aged 2 -4 years vaccinat ed with 30 g COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2, 100 g COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 or a control. Results mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 was immunogenic, eliciting IgG responses after a single dose, which were boosted by a second dose. It also sho wed a dose - response. At 30 g BNT162, the neutrali sing geometric mean titre in a SARS -CoV -2 neutralization assay was compared to that seen in convalescent serum (HCS) from humans recovered from SARS CoV -2 infection/COVID -19 and found to be ~8 -times higher. Seven days after Dose 2 of 100 g, the neutralising GMT reached 18 -times that of the HCS panel and PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 16 remained 3.3 -times higher than this benchmark five weeks after the last immunisation. In monkeys, the cellular immune response was characterised as a strong ly Th1 -biased CD4+ T cell response with a concurrent interferon - (IFN)+ CD8+ T cell response. For the challenge portion of the study, SARS -CoV -2 challenge was performed on the COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 -immuni sed animals (100 \u00b5g/animal dose level ) and on animals dosed with a control. Upon challenge with SARS CoV -2, the resulting clinical pattern in monkeys was unremarkable and no signs of clinical illness resulted from this exposure. Total viral RNA (genomic and subgenomic RNA) was detected in bro nchoalveolar lavage fluid of control monkeys but not detected in monkeys immuni sed with BNT162b2; in the nasal swabs viral RNA was detected in monkeys given BNT162 but clearance was faster than in controls . This is evidence of the beneficial effect of this vaccine. In lung tissues, control monkeys had evidence of some pulmonary disease indicated by their increased scores on computed tomography scans with a suggestion of recovery in those scores at day 10 th at were less than those at day 3; in contrast, the monkeys given COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 had lower scores than controls. The absence of secondary pharmacology and safety pharmacology studies is acceptable for a vaccine and is in line with relevant regulatory guidance (WHO Guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, 2005). The guidance does not mention secondary pharmacodynamics: however, it does state that if data from other studies suggest that the vaccine may affect physiological functions (central nervous system, renal, respiratory or cardiovascular system functions), safety pharmacology studies should be incorporated into the toxicity assessment. This does not apply for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . There are no major public health co ncerns identified. Since this authorisation the manufacturer has provided further information on the methodology used to determine anti - spike protein antibodies in mice which has been reviewed as part of the ongoing assessment for this product. Th ese data are not discussed here. III.3 Pharmaco kinetics The active substance of COVID is N1 -methylpseudouridine expressing -length -CoV -2 spike protein with two proline mutations (P2 S) to lock the transmembrane protein in an antigenically optimal prefusion conformation. The vaccine is formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNP is composed lipids used as excipients in the LNP formulation, two are naturally occurring (cholesterol an d DSPC) and will be metabolised and excreted like their endogenous counterparts. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 and are generally not considered necessary to support the development and licensure of vac cine products for infectious diseases (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014). The ADME profile of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 included evaluation of the PK and metabolism of the two novel lipid excipients (ALC -0315 and ALC -0159) in the LNP and potential in vivo biodis tribution using luciferase expression as a surrogate reporter. Absorption No absorption studies were conducted for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 since the route of administration is intramuscular (IM) . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 17 The \" Single dose pharmacokinetics study of ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 following intravenous bolus injection of a nanoparticle formulation in rats\" was conducted to assess the PK and metabolism of the two novel lipid excipients (ALC -0315 and ALC -0159). This study used LNPs containing surrogate luciferase RNA, with the lipid composition being identical to BNT162b2, to investigate the in vivo disposition of ALC -0159 and ALC -0315. Concentrations of ALC -0159 dropped approximately 8000 - and >250 -fold in plasma and liver, respectively, during this 2 -week stud y. For ALC -0315, the elimination of the molecule from plasma and liver was slower, but concentrations fell approximately 7000 - and 4 -fold in two weeks for plasma and liver, respectively. Overall, the apparent terminal t\u00bd in plasma and liver were similar in both tissues and were 2 -3 and 6 -8 days for ALC -0159 and ALC - 0315, respectively. The apparent terminal t\u00bd in plasma likely represents the re -distribution of the respective lipids from the tissues into which they have distributed as the LNP , back to plasma where they are eliminated. Distribution Study R -20-0072 evaluated the in vivo potential biodistribution of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in mice using luciferase expression as a surrogate reporter. Protein expression was demonstrated at the site of injection and to a lesser extent, and more transiently, in the liver after mice received an IM injection of RNA encoding luciferase in an LNP f ormulation like BNT162b2. Luciferase expression was identified at the injection site at 6 hours after injection and diminished to near baseline levels by day 9. Expression in the liver was also present at 6 hours after injection and was not detected by 48 hours after injection. Information regarding the potential distribution of the test articles to sites other than the injection site following IM administration has been provided and is under review as part of the ongoing rolling assessment. Metabolism The in vitro metabolism of ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 was evaluated in blood, liver microsomes, S9 fractions, and hepatocytes from mice, rats, monkeys, and humans. The in vivo metabolism was examined in rat plasma, urine, faeces, and liver samples fr om the PK study. Metabolism of ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 appears to occur slowly in vitro and in vivo . ALC -0315 and ALC -0159 are metabolised by hydrolytic metabolism of the ester and amide functionalities, respectively, and this hydrolytic metabolism is observ ed across the species evaluated. Excretion No excretion studies have been conducted with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . In the PK study, it appears that 50% of ALC -0159 was eliminated unchanged in faeces. Metabolism played a role in the elimination of ALC -0315, as little to no unchanged material was detected in either urine or faeces. Investigations of urine, faeces and plasma from the rat PK study identified a series of ester cleavage products of ALC -0315. The manufacturer has proposed that this likel y represents the primary clearance mechanism acting on this molecule, although no quantitative data is available to confirm this hypothesis. In vitro , ALC -0159 was metaboli sed slowly by hydrolytic metabolism of the amide functionality. Pharmacokinetic dr ug interactions No PK drug interaction studies have been conducted with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . This is acceptable and in line with relevant guidelines (WHO 2005; WHO 2014). PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 18 III.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity No single dose toxicity studies have been performed. This is acceptable and in line with relevant guidelines (WHO 2005; WHO 2014). Repeat -dose toxicity Study 38166 was a GLP -compliant repeat -dose study performed in rats to evaluate toxicity of the LNP and mRNA platform used in BNT162b2. Study 20GR142 was a GLP -compliant repeat -dose study performed in rats to evaluate toxicity of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BN T162b2. In Study 38166 , male female Wistar rats were given BNT162b2 as IM injection(s) into the hind limb on three occasions each a week apart (dosing days 1, 8 and 15). Different doses (10, 30, and 100 g) were tested; the lower doses were given as a single injection of 20 -70 L, while the highest dose (100 g) a nd controls were given as two injections (one in each hindlimb) of 100 L each. The control was phosphate buffered saline/300 mM sucrose, corresponding to the storage buffer of the vaccine product. Each group had 18 male and 18 female rats, assigned as 10 to the main study, 5 for recovery groups and 3 as additional animals for cytokine analyses. The recovery period was 3 weeks after the last dose. Necropsy was performed on study day 17, ~48 hours after the last dose, and after the 3 -week recovery period. No unscheduled deaths were observed . Dosing was considered well tolerated and did not present any signs of systemic toxicity; there was a slight increase in body temperature in the hours after dosing and some loss in body weight over the same period but these were not of a magnitude to be considered adverse. Local inflammatory reactions were observed at the intramuscular injection site. Injection site changes noted were of oedema, erythema, and induration, more severe and more frequent after the second and /or third doses compared to the first; however, these resolved prior to subsequent dosing and were fully recovered at the end of the 3 -week recovery period. Macroscopic findings at the injection sites included induration or thickening, occasion ally accompanied by encrustation, which was noted for nearly all rats. This correlated microscopically with inflammation and variable fibrosis, oedema, and myofibre degeneration. Inflammation at the injection site was accompanied by elevations in circulati ng white blood cells and acute phase proteins (fibrinogen, alpha -2 macroglobulin, and alpha -1 acid glycoprotein). Inflammation was occasionally evident extending into tissues adjacent to the injection site. There was enlargement of the draining (iliac) ly mph nodes evident at the end of dosing. This correlated with increased cellularity of germinal centres and increased plasma cells in the draining (iliac) lymph node and is an anticipated immune response to the administered vaccine. Enlargement of spleen and increased spleen weights correlated microscopically to increased haematopoiesis and increased haematopoiesis was also evident in the bone marrow. These findings are likely secondary to the immune/inflammatory responses to the vaccine. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 19 At the end of the recovery period, injection sites were normal, clinical pathology findings and macroscopic observations had resolved and there was evidence of recovery of the injection site inflammation on microscopy. Microscopic vacuolation of portal h epatocytes was present . There were no elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). There were elevations in gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT) in all vaccinated rats, but there were no macroscopic or microscopic findings consistent with cholestasis or hepat obiliary injury to explain the increased GGT activity, which was completely resolved at the end of the 3 -week recovery period. The vacuolation may be related to hepatic distribution of the pegylated lipid in the LNP. No changes were seen in serum cytokine concentrations. Additional ADME data has been received since this authorisation and has been reviewed as part of the ongoing assessment for this product. This data is not discussed here. There were no effects noted on ophthalmological and auditory assess ments, nor on external appearance or behaviour; in particular, gait was normal meaning that the changes seen did not affect the rats' mobility. No vaccine -related changes were seen in serum cytokine concentrations. Testing for immunogenicity showed that COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 elicited a specific IgG antibody response to SARS CoV -2 spike protein directed against the S1 fragment and the receptor binding domain. A neutralizing antibody response was also observed with the vaccine in a pseudovirus neutralization assay. In conclusion, COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was well tolerated, and produced inflammatory changes at the injection sites and the draining lymph nodes, increased haematopoiesis in the bone marrow a nd spleen, and clinical pathology changes consistent with an immune response or inflammation in the injection sites. The findings in this study are typical of those expected with dosing of LNP encapsulated mRNA vaccines. Study 20GR142 had the objective to determine toxicity in rats given COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . This study was in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice. Two candidate vaccines were tested; however, results are presented here only for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . Male and female Wistar Han rats were given BNT162b2 as an IM injection into the hind limb on three occasions, each a week apart (dosing days 1, 8 and 15). Necropsy was performed on study day 17, ~48 hours after the last dose, and after the 3 -week recovery period. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 was supplied at 0.5 mg/ml, and the dose volume was 60 L, to give 30 g per dose. Control rats received saline . Each group contained 15 males and 15 females. All rats given COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 survived to their scheduled necropsy: there were no changes noted in clinical signs or body weight changes noted. A reduction in food intake was noted on days 4 and 11 (to 0.83x controls) and there was an incre ase in mean body temperature post -dose on day 1 (up to 0.54\u00b0C), day 8 (up to 0.98\u00b0C) and day 15 (up to 1.03\u00b0C) compared to controls. At injection sites, there were instances of oedema and erythema on days 1 (maximum of slight oedema and very slight eryth ema), 8 (maximum of moderate oedema and very slight erythema) and 15 (maximum of moderate oedema and very slight erythema) which fully resolved and were not noted prior to dosing on days 8 and 15. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 20 Haematological tests showed higher white blood cells (up t o 2.95x controls), primarily involving neutrophils (up to 6.80x controls), monocytes (up to 3.30x controls), and large unstained cells, LUC, (up to 13.2x controls) and slightly higher eosinophils and basophils on days 4 and 17. White blood cells were highe r on day 17 as compared with day 4. There were transiently lower reticulocytes on day 4 (to 0.27x controls) in both sexes and higher reticulocytes on day 17 (up to 1.31x controls) in females only. Lower red blood cell mass parameters (to 0.90x controls) we re present on days 4 and 17. There were lower A:G ratios (to 0.82x) on days 4 and 17. Higher fibrinogen was noted on day 17 (up to 2.49x) compared to controls, consistent with an acute phase response. The acute phase proteins alpha -1-acid glycoprotein (up to 39x on day 17) and alpha -2 macroglobulin (up to 71x on Day 17) were elevated on days 4 and 17 with higher concentrations in males. There were no changes urinalysis parameters. At post -mortem there were higher absolute and relative spleen weights in vaccinated rats (up to 1.42x in males and to 1.62x in females). There were no other changes in organ weights. Macroscopic findings included enlarged draining lymph nodes and pale/dark firm injection sites in a minority of vaccinated rats. The dosing is re ported as tolerated without inducing any systemic toxicity and with all changes consistent with an inflammatory response and immune activation: findings are consistent with those typically associated with dosing of lipid nanoparticle -encapsulated mRNA vacc ines. Since this authorisation the manufacturer has provided the final study report which has been reviewed as part of the ongoing assessment for this product and is not discussed here. Toxicokinetics No toxicokinetic studies have been performed with the vaccine. This is consistent with WHO guidelines on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005) . Genotoxicity No genotoxicity studies are planned for BNT162b2, as the components of all vaccine constructs are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have genotoxic potential (WHO, 2005). Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity studies with BNT162b2 have not been conducted as the components of all vaccine constructs are lipids and RNA that are not expected to have carcinogenic or tumorigenic potential. Carcinogenicity testing is generally not considered necessary to support the development and licensure of vaccine products f or infectious diseases (WHO, 2005). Reproductive and developmental toxicity Fertility and early embryonic development and embryofoetal development In the general toxicity studies, macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of male and female reproductive tissues showed no evidence of toxicity. A combined fertility and developmental study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) in rats is ongoing. Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function No such studies have been done. Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated No such studies have been done. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 21 Local tolerance No such studies have been done. The assessments made as part of the general toxicity study should suffice and a separate study is not needed. Other toxicity studies No such studies have been done. Toxicity conclusions The Public Assessment Report summarises the initial assessment at the time of approval in December 2020. The text in the original report remains unchanged. Our advice is regularly updated on the basis of significant new data and our latest advice can be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics on this page and the Summary of Coronavirus Yellow Card reporting . The absence of reproductive toxicity data is a reflection of the speed of development to first identify and select COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 for clinical testing and its rapid development to meet the ongoing urgent health need. In principle, a decision on licensing a vaccine could be taken in these circumstances without data from reproductive toxicity studies animals, but there are studies ongoing and these will be provided when available. In the conte xt of supply under Regulation 174, it is considered that sufficient reassurance of safe use of the vaccine in pregnant women cannot be provided at the present time: however, use in women of childbearing potential could be supported provided healthcare prof essionals are advised to rule out known or suspected pregnancy prior to vaccination. Women who are breastfeeding should also not be vaccinated. These judgements reflect the absence of data at the present time and do not reflect a specific finding of conce rn. Adequate advice with regard to women of childbearing potential, pregnant women and breastfeeding women has been provided in both the Information for UK Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients . III.5 Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment It is agreed that, in accordance with CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 entitled, \"Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use\" published 01 June 2006, due to their nature, vaccines and lipids are unlikely to result in a signif icant risk to the environment. Therefore, an environmental risk assessment is not provided in this application. This is acceptable. III.6 Discussion and conclus ion on the non -clinical aspects The non -clinical data currently available for COVID -19 mRNA Vac cine BNT162b2 can be accepted as sufficient with specific mitigations in place. There are no scientific objections arising from this review to the authorisation for temporary supply for this product under Regulation 174 . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 22 IV CLINICAL ASPECTS IV.1 Introduction The following clinical studies were submitted with this application: BNT162 -01: An on -going multi -site, Phase I/II, -part, dose -escalation trial investigating the safety and immunogenicity of four different prophylactic SARS - CoV -2 RNA vacci nes against COVID -19 using different dosing regimens in healthy adults. C4591001 : on -going phase 1/2/3, placebo -controlled, randomised, observer -blind, dose finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of SARS -CoV -2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID -19 in healthy individuals. The product will be referred to as BNT162b2 in this clinical review for ease of reading. Table 1: Overview of the clinical studies All studies were conducted in line with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). IV. 2 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetic data have been submitted for this application and none were required. As the mode action of vaccines is dependent on immunologic pr ocesses and not pharmacological effects , studies to determine serum concentrations of antigens are not needed for an reports for each bioanalytical assay have been provided. These PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 23 include ELISpot assay, intracellular cytokine staining and PCR. Overall, the methods are considered acceptable and fit for purpose. Methods Study BNT162 -01 Part A of this study investigated the humoral and cell mediated immune responses to BNT162b2 in 60 participants aged 18 -55 years who received 2 doses of either 1 \u00b5g, 3 \u00b5g, 10 \u00b5g, 20 \u00b5g or 30 \u00b5g separated by 21 days. Older adults aged 56 -85 years are also enrolled. Humoral immunogenicity assessments measured by neutralising and binding antibody assays are performed at baseline and at 7 and 21 days after Dose 1 and at 7, 14, 21, 28, 63, and 162 days after Dose 2. Evaluation of the T cell response by ELISpot and by intracellular cytokine staining visualised with fluorescence is planned at baseline and at Day 29. Additional exploratory evaluation of the T -cell response is also planned at later time points up to 162 days after Dose 2 . The study population includes male and female adult participants deemed healthy and without COVID -19 symptoms or evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection within 30 days prior to entering the study. In Pa rt B of this study expansion cohorts including healthy and immunocompromised adults (n=150) are planned, with additional blood draws up to 2 years including evaluation of the T cell response. ADCC activity will also be investigated as an exploratory object ive. Study C4591001 In phase 1 humoral immunogenicity responses to BNT162b2 were investigated in 90 participants aged 18 -55 years and 65 -85 years who were randomised to 10 g, 20 g, 30 g or placebo, as a 2 -dose schedule separated by 21 days. Neutralis ing titres and IgG antigen - binding levels (S1 and RBD) were measured on days 7 and 21 (pre -dose 2) after dose 1; 7 and 14 days and 1 month after Dose 2. Measurements will also be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months after Dose 2 . In Phase 2, immunogenicity was assessed at baseline and 1 month, after completion of vaccination in subjects aged 18 -85 years . Assessments will also be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of vaccination. In Phase 3, exploratory immunogenicity assessments are planned at time points up to 24 months. In addition, immune responses were measured 1 month after a visit due to COVID -19 illness. To facilitate interpretation of immunogenicity data generated in Study C4591001, a human convalescent seru m (HCS) panel was obtained from Sanguine Biosciences (Sherman Oaks, CA), MT Group (Van Nuys, CA), and Pfizer Occupational Health and Wellness (Pearl River, NY). The 38 sera in the panel were collected from SARS -CoV -2 infected or COVID -19 diagnosed individu als 18 to 83 years of age 14 days after PCR -confirmed diagnosis at a time when they were asymptomatic. The serum donors had predominantly had symptomatic infections (35 of 38) including 1 who had been hospitali sed. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 24 Results Immunogenicity data for BNT162b2 are currently available up to 1 month after the second vaccine dose. Humoral response Phase 1 The humoral immunogenicity results from phase 1 participants in study BNT162 -01 and C4591001 reflected the results seen in th e larger phase 2 population described below. Phase 2 Three hundred and sixty subjects were enrolled in phase 2 of study C4591001. Of these, 335 were included in the post Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population: 168 in the BNT162b2 arm and 167 in the p lacebo arm. In the Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population, 52% of participants were male; 85% were White and 10% were Black or African American. The median age was 56 years (range 18-85). BNT162b2 elicited robust SARS -CoV -2 neutralisation and S1 -binding antibody responses at 1 month after dose 2. SARS -Cov-2 neutralising titres and S1 -binding antibody concentrations were higher in younger subjects (18 -55years) compared with the older subjects (56 -85years). Neutralising geometric mean titres ( GMTs ) for younger and older participants at 1 month after Dose 2 were comparable to panel of SARS -CoV -2 infection/COVID -19 human convalescent sera. Table 2: Summary Geometric Mean Titres /Concentrations - Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 25 Table 3: Summary of Geometric Mean Fold Rises from before vaccination to each subsequent time point - Phase 2 - Dose 2 Evaluable Immunogenicity Population Cellular response Cell mediated immunity data are available from study BNT162 -01 in a limited number of subjects aged 18 -55 years. At the data -cut-off, evaluable ELIS pot data were available from 39 participants across dose levels of BNT162b2. Evaluable intracellular cytokine staining and fluorescence -activated cell sorting data were availa ble from 36 participants across dose levels. The data, albeit with a limited number of subjects per cohort, suggest that BNT162b 2 can induce de novo Class I and Class II T cell immune responses in most of the vaccinated subjects with a prime and booster r egimen even at low vaccine dose level s as evidenced by an IFN ELIS pot assay. The data suggest that the response may be attributed to various epitopes across the spike protein sequence, within and outside the RBD, but dose levels may not always directly co rrelate with the induced cellular immunogenicity and the existence of some reactivity at baseline in some participants may be due to a level of cross -reactivity with antigens to which those participants had previously been exposed, probably related to conserved regions in the sequence represented by the SARS -CoV -2-FL-S pool 2. For BNT162b2 dose level s of 10, 20 and 30 \u00b5g tended to induce higher CD4 and CD8 T cell responses that the lower dose level s. In some individuals , (3/9 for the 30 \u00b5g dose) CD8+ T cell responses to sequences in the S -protein peptide pool 2 prior to vaccination were detected indicating pre -formed cross -reactive T cells recognizing conserved epitopes in the SARS - CoV -2 spike protein .

Each dot represents the sum of normali sed mean spot count from duplicate wells stimulated with two peptide pools corresponding to the full length of the wild type S protein for one participant, after subtraction of the medium -only control. a, Ratios above post -dose data points are the number of subjects with detectable CD4+ or CD8+ T -cell response within the total number of tested participants per dose level. b, S protein -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses in all participants with a posi tive response to S protein (n=22 for CD4+ and n=19 for CD8+ responses) and their baseline CEFT - and CEF -specific T -cell responses. Horizontal lines represent the median of each dose level. CMV = Cytomegalovirus; leukocyte antigen; INF = interferon. Most participants show a modest increase in cytokine -producing antigen -specific T cells reaching levels comparable to the l evels observed in convalescent COVID -19 patients as measured by intracellular cytokine staining. A few outliers with a higher than average increase in cytokine -producing T cells skew the response above the levels observed in samples from convalescent COVID -19 patients. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 27 There is high variability in the response as probably is to be expected but not much of a dose response between the 10, 20 and 30 \u00b5g groups for participants receiving BNT162b2. The detection of IFN and IL -2, but only minor IL -4 production i s reassuring, indicating a favourable Th1 profile.

Methods Study participants were subjects 12 years of age (with at least 40% > 55 years of age ); healthy or with pre -existing stable disease ; at higher risk of acquiring COVID -19 (e.g. use of mass transportation, relevant demographics, frontline essential workers) . The main causes for exclusion were a previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19, a known or suspected immunodeficiency , therapy with immunosuppress ants, pregnancy or breast feeding. Subjects with a h istory of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction (e .g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the study intervention(s) were also excluded from the study. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic BNT162b2 against confirmed COVID -19 in participants without evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection before vaccination and in all participants (with and without evidence of infection before vaccination ). One key secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy against confirmed severe COVID -19 in the same populations . The presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection was determined on the basis of a positive nasal swab using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and/or a serum sample positive N-binding antibod ies. PAR COVID -19 vaccine BNT162 28 Subjec ts in a 1:1 ratio to BNT162b2 vaccine ( 2 doses of 30 g by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle separated by 21 days ) or a placebo (2 doses of 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection) A site -based randomisation was stratified by age (55 vs >55 years). In this observer blinded study, the study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the test products were unblinded but a ll othe r study and site personnel, including the investigator, staff, and participants, were blinded to study product assignment. The first primary endpoint was the incidence of confirmed COVID -19 per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants with no serological or virological evidence (up to 7 days after receipt of the last dose) of SARS -CoV -2 infection . The second primary endpoint was identical except the incidence was calculated in all participants (with and without evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 7 days after receipt of the last dose ). Confirmed COVID -19 was defined as the presence of at least 1 of the following symptoms and SARS -CoV -2 NAAT positive test during, or within 4 days before or after, the symptomatic period: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased shortness of breath; chills; new or increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhoea; vomiting. Confirmed severe C OVID -19 was defined as confirmed COVID -19 and the presence of at least 1 of the following: clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, heart rate 125 beats per minute; SpO2 93% on room air at sea level, or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg); respiratory failure ; shock ; significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; admission to an ICU; death. All participants were provided with a thermometer and asked to complete a COVID -19 illness e -diary. If a participant develop ed acute respiratory illness symptoms (or other specified symptoms), they were instructed to contact the site, and a COVID -19 illness and subsequent conv alescent visit occur red. A nasal swab was taken for SARS -CoV -2 antigen . All potential COVID -19 illness events were reviewed by 3 blinded case reviewers. The statistical analysis of vaccine efficacy (VE) used a Bayesian approach, with decisions based on t he posterior probability of VE > 30%. With assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the last dose of investigational product, a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID - 19 cases provide approximately 90% power to conclude true VE >30% with high probab ility. This would be achieved with 17,600 evaluable participants per group or 21,999 vaccine recipients randomi sed in a 1:1 ratio with placebo, for a total sample size of 43,998, based on the assumption of a 1.3% illness rate per year in the placebo group, accrual of 164 primary - endpoint cases within 6 months, and 20% of the participants being non -evaluable or having serological evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2, potentially making them immune to further infection. The primary analysis set was the Evaluable efficacy (7 days) , defined as all eligible randomi sed participants who receive d all vaccination(s) as randomi sed, with Dose 2 received within the predefined window (within 19 -42 days after Dose 1) and ha d no other imp ortant protocol deviations as determined by the clinician on or before 7 days after Dose 2. A secondary analysis set was the Evaluable efficacy (14 days), which was defined in a similar way and used for analyses of efficacy 14 days after Dose 2. VE was es timated using the formula 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness from 7 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years follow -up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 29 The posterior probability (P [VE >30%|data]) was computed using a beta -binomial model and a specified minimally informative beta distribution as prior. Missing efficacy data were not imputed . The 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for VE w as derived using the Clopper -Pearson method as described by Agresti (the exact method). Four interim analyses (IA) were initially planned and were to be performed by an unblinded statistical team after accrual of at least 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases. For admi nistrative reasons the first interim analysis was removed in a protocol amendment. At these IAs, futility and VE with respect to the first primary endpoint were to be assessed. Results The study enrolled participants in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, Germany , South Africa and Turkey. The date of first subject first visit of the phase 1 of the study occurred on 29 April 2020 . The first efficacy interim analysis was performed after 94 COVID -19 cases had accrued and the data cut -off for th is analysis was 4 November 2020, by which point 43325 participants had been randomised in the phase 2/3 (21653 BNT162b2 vs 21672 placebo). The pre - specified criterion for overwhelming efficacy was met; the posterior probability that VE>30% was >0.9999, higher than the suc cess threshold of 0.995 required to declare overwhelming efficacy at an interim analysis. The point estimate for VE was 95.5% with a 95% credible interval ranging from 88.8 to 98.4%. The second and final analysis was performed after 170 COVID -19 cases had accrued and the data cut -off for this analysis was 14 November 2020, by which point 43 651 participants had been randomised (21 823 BNT162b2 vs 21 828 placebo). Only the data relevant to the final analysis are described here. Study population PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 30 Table 4: Participant disposition The study enrolled about half male and half female participants (Table 4) . These were mainly White (83%), with a small proportion of Black or African American (9%). The vast majority of the recruitment was in the US (77% ), followed by Argentina (14%) and Brazil (7%). As site-based randomisation was used to ensure balance of vaccine group assignment within each site, vaccine allocation was balanced within countries. The population included a very small number of children and adolescents 12 to 15 years old (88; 0.2%), a larger number of adolescents 16 -17 year old (283; 0.8%) and 22% (N=8018) elderly subjects 65 years, up to 91 years (89 years in the vaccine arm). The median age was 52 years. Overall, 46% of the participa nts had at least one comorbidity that increases the risk of severe COVID -19 disease: e.g. asthma, BMI 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension; 35% of the participants were obese and another 35% were PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 31 overweight. The demographi cs were well -balanced across the vaccine and placebo arms (Table 5) . Table 5: Demographic characteristics (Subjects Without Evidence of Infection Prior to 7 Days After Dose 2 - Evaluable Efficacy (7 Days) Population) Primary efficacy endpoint Out of the 170 COVID -19 cases, 8 were reported in the vaccine arm and 162 in the place bo arm (Table 6) . The pre -specified criterion for success was met; the posterior probability that VE>30% was >0.9999, higher than the success threshold of 0.986 required to declare success at the final analysis. The point estimate for VE was 95.0% with a 9 5% credible interval ranging from 90.3 -97.6%. The 95% confidence interval ranged from 90.0 -97.9%. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 32 Table 6: First COVID -19 Occurrence From 7 Days After Dose 2 - Subjects Without Evidence of Infection Prior to 7 Days After Dose 2 - Evaluable Efficacy Popula tion (7 Days) Similar results were observed in the all -available efficacy population, which included subjects who did not receive Dose 2 within the predefined window (within 19 -42 days after Dose 1) or had another important protocol deviation on or before 7 days after Dose 2. Three additional COVID -19 cases were reported in the placebo arm but none in the vaccine arm. Similar results were also shown in the all -comer population (second primary endpoint), including all participants with and without ev idence of SARS -CoV -2 infection up to 7 days after receipt of the last dose; the VE was 94.6% with a 95% credible interval ranging from 89.9 to 97.3%. The results were consistent across various subgroups, with VE>90% in almost all analyses, and the confidence interval lower bounds demonstrated efficacy independently in all subgroups including subjects 65 years, Black/African American subjects, obese subjects and subjects at risk due to comorbidities. Secondary efficacy endpoints The first two sec ondary endpoints included only cases observed from 14 days after Dose 2 in populations comparable to those of the primary endpoints. In subjects without evidence of infection prior to 14 Days after Dose 2, VE was 94.2% with a 95% credible interval of 88.7 to 97.2%; similar results were shown in subjects with or without evidence of prior infections. The total number of severe cases in the Evaluable efficacy population (7 days) of subjects without evidence of infection prior to 7 Days after Dose 2 is very sm all: 1 in the vaccine arm vs 3 in the placebo arm (VE = 66.4% with a broad 95% credible interval of -124.8 to 96.3%). However, considering all cases after the first dose (1 vs 9 cases, respectively) also provides evidence of an effect on severe cases (VE = 88.9% with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 20.1 to 99.7%). PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 33 Additional analysis The early onset of protection is illustrated in the figure below, which displays cumulative incidence for the first COVID -19 occurrence after Dose 1 among all vaccinated participants. Disease incidence is similar in the vaccine and placebo arms until approximately 12 days after Dose 1, at which point the curves diverge, with cases steadily accumulating in the placebo arm while remaining virtually flat in the vaccine arm. Figure 7: Cumulative Incidence Curves for the First COVID -19 Occurrence After Dose 1 - Dose 1 All -Available Efficacy Population IV.5 Clinical safety Safety population and e xposure Clinical safety data were submitted from the Phase 2/3 part of study c4591001 . Non-serious adverse events (AEs) were actively elicited until 1 month after Dose 2. Serious AEs (SAEs) will be actively elicited until 6 months after Dose 2. AEs and SAEs will be collected as appropriate until 24 months after Dose 2 . In the Phase 2/3 part, 43,448 participants had received at least one dose of study intervention , of which 21,720 participants had received at least one 30 \u00b5g dose of BNT162b2. Of the Phase 2/3 safety population , 34,532 participants had a t least one month of safety follow -up post-Dose 2 (17,274 participants received BNT162b2 ) and 19,067 participants had at least 2 months of safety follow -up post-Dose 2 (9531 received BNT162b2 ). In addition, safety data were submitted from the Phase 1 study BNT162 -01 and the Phase 1 part of Study c4591001 ; a total of 36 participants received at least one 30 \u00b5g dose of BNT162b2 during Phase 1. The baseline demographic characteristics of the safety population are presented below in Table 7 . PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 34 Table 7: Demographic characteristics - Phase 2/3 ( All Subjects) - Safety Population PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 35 In the subgroup > 55 years of age, the median age was 65 years. Data on baseline co - morbidities were also submitted according to the Charlson Comorbidity Index . Aroun d 21% of the safety had any co -morbidity , including diabetes ( 8.4%), chronic pulmonary disease ( 7.8%) and any malignancy (3.7%). Baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive status was defined as having a positive N -binding antibody test result or positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result on the day of Dose 1. A total of 1125 participants in Phase 2/3 were identified as baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive , of which 545 received BNT162b2 and 580 received placebo. The baseline characteristics of the safety population are sufficiently gener alisable to the UK population . The safety population, exposure and length of follow -up are acceptable for authorisation for temporary supply under Regulation 174 . Safety data corresponding to longer follow -up will be submitted as laid out in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) . Local and systemic reactogenicity Local and s ystemic reactogenicity data were planned to be collected by e -diary for at least the first 6000 parti cipants enrolled in Phase 2/3. The final subset included 8 214 participants , of whom 4108 had received BNT162b2. E-diary transmission rates were above 90% in the BNT162b2 arm for each of the 7 days post -Dose 1, and above 80% for each of the 7 days post-Dose 2 (except the day of Dose 2 which was 76%). Local reaction events were solici ted for up to 7 days following each dose according to FDA criteria (Table 8) : Table 8: Local reaction grading scale (FDA criteria) PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 36 Table 9: Local Reactions, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Any Dose - Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis - Safety Population The commonest local reaction (Table 9) was pain, reported by more than 84% of the reactogenicity subset after BNT162b2 , and mostly mild or moderate . The frequenc ies of local reactions were similar after Doses 1 and 2 . The median onset of the solicited local reactions was the day of vaccination until 2 days post -Dose , and the median duration was 1 to 2 days. The local reactogenicity results were analysed by age (16 -55 years; >55 years). The profiles were generally similar . However, t he frequency of moderate pain after any dose was increased for younger participants compared to older participants (40.4% vs 23.6%) . Local reactions were also solicited in 100 participants aged 12 to 15 years: 48 participants after Dose 1 and Dose 2 of BNT162b2 and 52 participants after Dose 1 and Dose 2 of placebo. The available local reactogenicity profile in the aged 12 to 15 years group was consistent with that observed in the 16 to 55 years group. The reactogenici ty subset included 318 baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive participants of whom 154 received BNT162b2 and 164 rec eived placebo. T he local reactogenicity profile in this subgroup was consistent with that of the overall reactogenicity subset. Based on the local reactogenicity data, the following local reactions are considered to be adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and have been included in the Information for Healthcare PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 37 Professionals and the Information for UK recipients : Injection site pain (very common), injection site swelling (common) and injection site erythema (common). Systemic events were solicited for up to 7 days following each dose according to FDA criteria (Table 10) : Table 10: Systemic event grading scale (FDA criteria) In addition, participants took their own oral temperature daily (and additionally when fever was suspected) during the 7 -day reporting period. Fever was defined as follows: Mild (38.0 to 38.4\u00b0C ); Moderate (>38.4 to 38.9\u00b0C ); Severe to 40.0\u00b0C ) and Grade 4 (> 40.0\u00b0C ). The use of antipyretic or pain medication was also documented. Table 11: Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Any Dose - Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis - Safety Population PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 38 Apart from vomiting and diarrhoea, all the solicited systemic events were reported significantly more frequently after BNT162b2 compared to placebo. Anti-pyretic or pain medication was also used more often. The m edian onset for most systemic events after either dose of BNT162b2 was 1 to 2 days post -Dose and m edian duration was one day. The systemic reactogenicity results were analysed by age (16 -55 ye ars; >55 years). The frequency and severity of systemic events were increased in the younger group compared to the older group , and post-Dose 2 compared to post-Dose 1 as shown below: PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 39 Figure 8: Participants Reporting Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, W ithin 7 Days After Each Dose, by Age Group - Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis - Safety Population Age Group: 16 -55 Years Figure 9: Participants Reporting Systemic Events, by Maximum Severity, Within 7 Days After Each Dose, by Age Group - Reactogenicity Subset for Phase 2/3 Analysis - Safety Population Age Group: >55 Years PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 40 Systemic reactogenicity events were also solicited in 100 participants aged 12 to 15 years, 48 participants after Dose 1 and Dose 2 of BNT162b2 and 52 participants a fter Dose 1 and Dose 2 of placebo. The available systemic reactogenicity profile in the aged 12 to 15 years group was consistent with that observed in the 16 to 55 years group. The reactogenicity subset included 318 baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive participa nts of whom 154 received BNT162b2 and 164 received placebo. The systemic reactogenicity profile in this subgroup was consistent with that of the overall reactogenicity subset . Based on the systemic reactogenicity data, the following systemic events are considered to be ADRs and have been included in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients: headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, chills and pyrexia (all very common). Adverse events An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. A summary of adverse ev ents (AEs) is shown below: Table 12: Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date (14NOV2020) - Phase 2/3 (All Subjects) - Safety Population AE data are also provided for the safety population of 37,586 participants with a median of 2 months follow -up after Dose 2 , and 19,067 participants with at least 2 months follow -up after Dose 2 . The AE summary profile s in these populations were consistent with that of the 'All subjects' population. This suggests that most of the related AEs occurr ed soon after vaccination. AE s ummary profiles were provided by age (16 -55 years; >55 years) ; AEs were PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 41 reported more frequent ly in the younger group than the older group , with a greater difference after BNT162b2 compared to after placebo : 28.8% vs 12.6%. This reflects the reactogenicity profile . For the subgroup of Black or African American participants (9.1% ), the AE su mmary profile was consistent with that of the overall safety population . AE data were evaluated at the preferred term level , and with reference to AE listings which included information on onset, duration , severity, seriousness, relatedness and resolution , as well as investigator free text. AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) are summarised below : Table 13: Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From Dose 1 to Data Cutoff Date (14NOV2020), by System Organ Class - Phase 2/3 (All subjects) - Safety Population System Organ Class Vaccine group (as administered ) BNT162b2 (30 \u00b5g) (N = 21621) n (%) Placebo (N = 21631) n (%) Any event 5770 (26.7) 2638 (12.2) Blood and lymp hatic system disorders 90 (0.4) 17 (0.1) Cardiac disorders 52 (0.2) 44 (0.2) Congenital, familial and genetic disorders 2 (0.0) 0 Ear and labyrinth disorders 61 (0.3) 41 (0.2) Endocrine disorders 12 (0.1) 4 (0.0) Eye disorders 54 (0.2) 44 (0.2) Gastrointestinal disorders 617 (2.9) 403 (1.9) General disorders and administration site conditions 4007 (18.5) 829 ( 3.8) Hepatobiliary disorders 14 (0.1) 5 (0.0) Immune system disorders 26 (0.1) 22 (0.1) Infections and infestations 322 (1.5) 320 (1.5) Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 184 (0.9) 220 (1.0) Investigations 145 (0.7) 40 (0.2) Metabolism and nutrition disorders 86 (0.4) 61 (0.3) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 1511 (7.0) 435 (2.0) Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) 29 (0.1) 31 (0.1) Nervous system disorders 1277 (5.9) 501 (2.3) Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 0 2 (0.0) Product issues 1 (0.0) 1 (0.0) Psychiatric disorders 84 (0.4) 58 (0.3) Renal and urinary disorders 30 (0.1) 24 (0.1) Reproductive system and breast disorders 35 (0.2) 36 (0.2) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 187 (0.9) 169 (0.8) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 196 (0.9) 136 (0.6) Social circumstances 3 (0.0) 0 Surgical and medical procedures 29 (0.1) 21 (0.1) PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 42 Uncoded term 38 (0.2) 23 (0.1) Vascular disorders 65 (0.3) 69 (0.3) Note: MedDRA (v23.1) coding dictionary applied.

N = number of subjects in the specified group. This value is the denominator for the percentage calculations. n = Number of subjects repor ting at least 1 occurrence of the specified event. For \"any event\", n = number of subjects reporting at least 1 occurrence of any event. The imbalance in the SOC of Blood and lymphatic system disorders was driven by lymphadenopathy events, reported by 70 (0.3%) participants after BNT162b2 vs 7 (0.0%) after placebo. Most events were transient and non -serious. Lymphadenopathy is known to be associated with vaccines and is related to the immune response. In the non -clinical rat repeat dose toxicity studies, there was enlargement of the draining lymph nodes at the end of dosing. Lymp hadenopathy has been included as an ADR in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients with a frequency of uncommon. The imbalance in the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders was d riven by nausea events , reported by 238 (1.1%) participants after BNT162b2 vs 75 (0.3%) after placebo. Nausea has been included as an ADR in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients with a frequency of common. The imbalance in the SOC o f General disorders and administration site conditions was driven by the following events: injection site pain, fatigue, pyrexia, chills, pain, injection site erythema, injection site swelling and malaise. Based on the local and systemic reactogenicity data (see above under 'Local and systemic reactogenicity') the following events from this SOC are considered ADRs: Injection site pain (very common), fatigue (very common), chills (very common), pyrexia (very common), injection site swelling (common) and injection site erythema (common). These events have been inc luded as ADRs in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients . Malaise was reported by 104 (0.5% ) participants after BNT162b2 vs 18 (0.1%) after placebo and is included as an ADR in the Information for Healthcare Profe ssionals and the Information for UK recipients with a frequency of uncommon. The imbalances in the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Nervous system disorders are driven by myalgia, arthralgia and headache. These are considered ADRs and are included in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients at frequencies that correspond to the solicited systemic reactogenicity events . Within the S OC of Immune system disorders , six participants repor ted Drug hypersensitivity after BNT162b2 compared to one after placebo . One participant reported Drug hypersensitivity and Urticaria on the day of Dose 1 of BNT162b2 ; both events were of moderate severity and lasted one day. Another participant reported a Drug hypersensitivity event 23 days after D ose 1 of BNT162b2 . The other five Drug hypersensitivity events were documented by investigators as reactions to other drugs. Five p articipants report ed Immunisation reactions after BNT162b2 compared to none after placebo ; all were associated with other systemic reactogenicity events and n one were associated with events that would indicate hypersensitivity. Post -authorisation monitoring for hypersensitivity events will be conducted. Severe events were reported by 240 (1.1%) participants after vaccination with BNT162b2 compared to 139 (0.6%) participants after placebo arm . The imbalance in the proportion of PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 43 participants reporting at least one severe AE was driven by the SOCs of General disorders and administration site conditions , Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and Nervous system disorders , and within these SOCs, the events of pyrexia, fatigue, injection site pain, chills, pain, myalgia and headache. These AEs reflect the local and systemic reactogenicity profile and are considered ADRs . The prop ortion of participants who reported at least one Grade 4 (life -threatening) AE was low and balanced between the treatment groups: 21 (0.1%) after BNT162b2 vs 24 (0.1%) after placebo. After evaluation, n o specific concerns were raised. Immediate AEs were those collected within 30 minutes hours after administration. Immediate AEs were reported after Dose 1 by 101 (0.5%) participants after BNT162b2 vs 77 (0.4%) after placebo. Immediate AEs were reported after Dose 2 by 57 (0.3%) participants after BNT162b2 vs 46 (0.2%) after placebo. The predominant immediate event was injection site pain. No participant reported an immediate allergic reaction after either dose of BNT162b2. The safety population included 1125 baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive participants of whom 545 received BNT162b2 and 580 received placebo. On comparison of AE data with that of the 'All subjects' , there is no indication of a worse safety profile in baseline positive participants. Serious adverse events A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention, that resulted in death, was life -threatening, required inpatient hospitali sation, resulted in persistent disability/incapacity or was a congenital abnormality /birth defect. SAE reporting may have also been appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitali sation but may jeopardi se the participant or may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. Two deaths were reported in participants that received BNT162b2 in Phase 2/3 of study c4591001 ; narratives were provided . A participant died 3 days after Dose 1; the provisional cause of death was atherosclerotic disease. A participant experienced cardiac arrest 60 days after Dose 2 and died 3 days later. There were 4 deaths in participants that received placebo in Phase 2/3. There were no deaths during study BNT162 -01 or phase 1 of study c4591001. During Phase 2/3 of study c4591001, SAEs were reported by 126 (0.6%) partic ipants after BNT162b2 compared to 111 participants (0.5%) after placebo. SAE data were evaluated at the preferred term level, and with reference to AE listings which included information on onset, duration, severity, relatedness and resolution, as well as investigator free text. There was one SAE of anaphylaxis 9 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 ; this was due to a bee sting. No significant concerns are raised. On comparison of SAE data of baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive participants with the 'All subjects' SAE data, there is no indication of a worse safety profile in baseline positive participants. Laboratory findings Routine laboratory testing of haematology and clinical chemistry parameters was only conducted for Study BNT162 -01 and Phase 1 of study c4591001. Transient increases in C - reactive protein and t ransient decreases in lymphocyte count were observed in a dose PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 44 dependant manner , and no clinical impact was observed . These effects are related to the mode of action of the vaccine. No related investigational AEs were reported during Phase 2/3. Safety in special populations Pregnancy is reported for a total of 23 participants during study c4591001 ; no outcome data are available. The results of the non -clinical developmental and reproductive toxicity study will not be available until early 2021. Therefore , BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy . However, use in women of childbearing potential can be supported provided healthcare professionals are advised to rule out known or suspected pregnancy prior to vaccination. As a precautionary measure, women of childbearing potential are advised to avoid becoming pregnant until at least 2 months after vaccination. It is unknown whether BNT162b2 is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, it is recommended that BNT162b2 should not be administered to women who are breastfeeding. Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients reflect these recommendations . Use in pregnancy and lactation is included as missing information in the RMP. Use in pregnancy will be investigated as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. Adolescents aged 16 to 17 years were eligible for Study c4591001 following p rotocol amendment 6 , and adolescents aged 12 to 15 years were eligible for Study c4591001 following protocol amendment 7. The safety population include d 283 participants aged 16 to 17 years. Furthermore, the reactogenicity profile was characterised in 100 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the results of which can be extrapolated to adolescents aged 16 to 17 years. These data support use in recipients over 16 years of age . Individuals who receive treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents or systemic corticosteroids, or were planned to receive such treatment, were not eligible for inclusion in Study c4591001. Although 120 participants with HIV were included in the phase 3 part of Study c4591001, analyses of safety are not yet available for this subgroup. Use in immunosuppressed individuals will be investigated as part of the pharmacovigilance plan. Safety related to interactions No data are availab le on use with concomitant vaccines, including influenza vaccines. According to the protocol for Study c4591001, administration of vaccine or placebo was not permitted within 14 days before or after influenza vaccines, or within 28 days before or after other non -study vaccines. Discontinuations due to adverse events During the phase 2/3 part of Study c4591001, 37 (0.2%) participants were discontinued due to adverse events after at least one dose of BNT162b2 compared to 30 (0.1%) participants after at least one dose of placebo. Evaluations of AEs that resulted in discontinuation raise no significant concerns. IV.6 Risk Management Plan (RMP) Every new medicine that is authorised has a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in place to ensure PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 45 the medicine is used as safety as possible. An RMP details important risks for the medicine and how more information can be obtained about these. This includes important identified risks which have been demonstrated to be associated with the medicine and require additional measures as part of the authorisation to minimise any potential risk to users. Important potential risks are those where there is a potential association with the product but that this has not been confirmed and further information needs to be collected to establish whether this risk exits. Missing information topics are typically those which have not been fully evaluated in the clinical trials and are relevant to the use of t he product and require further information to be gathered. The following section describes the RMP that has been agreed for the safe use of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 . In addition to routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation measures, the MHRA has requested that all COVID -19 vaccines carry out further ad hoc pharmacovigilance activities specific to the pandemic situation. This includes more frequent safety signal detection with additional epidemiological analysis of potential safety signals and targeted safety events, frequent pharmacovigilance meetings with the MHRA, monthly pharmacovigilance safety update reports and batch specific surveillance. In addition to these routine pharmacovigilance activities, the following additional risks and safety measures have been proposed: Important identified risks None Important potential risks Vaccine associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use in pregnancy and lactation Vaccine effectiveness There are no important identified risks for BTN162b2. Vaccine associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine associated e nhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) has been included as a potential risk. This is a theoretical risk which is relevant to all COVID -19 vaccines based on VAED having been seen in animal models for vaccines developed for SARS -CoV -1 (a similar but not identi cal virus to SARS - CoV -2, the virus responsible for COVID -19) and also seen in association with use of another respiratory virus vaccine, the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. There is currently no evidence from non -clinical or clinical data of an association of VAED/VAERD with COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 ; this potential risk will be further investigated as part of the pharmacovigilance plan of this vaccine. Use in pregnancy and lactation are included as missing information because this group w as excluded from the clinical trials and further data needs to be collected on the safety and efficacy of this use. Vaccine efficacy for BTN162b2 has been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials. Vaccine effectiveness relates to how well a vaccine works in the \"real world\" setting outside of clinical trials and being used in a wider variety of people. Therefore, long -term real -world data on vaccine effectiveness needs to be collected and this has been included as a missing information topic. The followi ng studies have been proposed to gather more information on these topics: PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 46 Study Country Summary of Objectives Safety concerns addressed Status (Planned, Ongoing) C4591001 A Phase 1/2/3, placebo controlled, randomi sed, observer -blind, dose finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS - COV -2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID -19 in healthy individuals Global The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID -19 mRNA vaccine.

Humoral immunogenicity data from study BNT162 -01 and phase 1/2 of study c4591001 show that elicits robust SARS -CoV -2 neutralisation and S1 -binding antibody responses at 1 month af ter dose 2. The neutralising titres and binding antibody concentrations are higher in younger subjects (18 -55y) compared with the older subjects (56 -85y). Nevertheless, neutralising GMTs for younger and older participants at 1 month after Dose 2 are compar able to the GMTs of a panel of SARS -CoV -2 infection/COVID -19 human convalescent serum. Cell mediated immunity data are available from study BNT162 -01 in a limited number of subjects aged 18 -55 years. Th ese indicate that antigen -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T ce ll responses are induced by the vaccine, with a favourable Th1 profile. Longer -term antibody data at 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of vaccination (including analysis by baseline serostatus); and additional T -cell response data up to 24 months, including in older subjects, immunocompromised adults and HLA typing of the subjects are being collected. This is addressed via the RMP and proposed conditions for the Regulation 174 approval. Clinical Efficacy The results from the phase 2/3 of the pivotal trial support vaccine efficacy in the population most at risk of severe COVID -19 as reflected in the study population which comprises high proportions of subjects who are obese or overweight or have relevant co morbidities. The final efficacy analyses demonstrate a very high level of short -term efficacy. The median duration of follow -up after the second vaccine dose is estimated to be a little shorter than 2 months, which is considered the shortest follow -up per iod required to achieve some confidence that any protection is likely to be more than very short -lived. Indeed, in the Phase 1/2 trials, neutralising antibody levels have been shown to peak 1 -2 weeks after the second dose and, therefore, the VE estimated a t the final analysis after a median follow -up of almost 2 months (95%) is reassuring. However, the current data do not address the following questions. Data on vaccine protection beyond 2 -3 months are currently lacking. These will be generated as the study follow -up is continuing and in effectiveness studies as reflected in the RMP. Data in individuals above 75 years of age are limited (about 1500 in total, half vaccinated). In this subgroup, the VE estimate is 100% with a 95%CI lower bound of - 13%, w hich reflects the current uncertainty around vaccine efficacy in this age group. This information will be generated in effectiveness studies as reflected in the RMP. PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 49 Regarding COVID -19 cases, no viral genomic sequencing data of the isolated strains and no immunogenicity data in these vaccine failures are currently available. This will be addressed at a broader level by the COVID -19 Genomics UK (COG -UK) Consortium and in the follow -up immunogenicity report requested in the RMP. There are no data on concomi tant immunisation, in particular influenza vaccination, or concomitant medications. Flu vaccination was prohibited 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the study vaccination. In the safety database of the first 6610 participants, a small percentage of particip ants in either group (4 -5%) received any concomitant vaccine after Dose 1, and most concomitant vaccines received were influenza vaccines (3 -4%). Analyses of immunogenicity may be available in the future in subgroups defined by concomitant influenza vaccin ation as well as by concomitant immunosuppressive treatment, if any (RMP). There are no data in pregnant women and immunosuppressed patients as these subjects were excluded from the trial. These will be generated in effectiveness studies as reflected in t he RMP. There are currently no data in adolescents (12 to 15 years old) as these have only been recently enrolled. These data will be submitted when available. Clinical Safety Clinical safety data are available from more than 43,000 participants aged over 16 years, of which more than 19,000 have been followed up for at least 2 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 or placebo. The baseline characteristics of the safety population are s ufficiently generalisable to the UK population. Local and systemic reactogenicity data were collected by e -diary for more than 8000 participants. The commonest local reaction was pain, mostly mild or moderate. The median onset of the solicited local reac tions was the day of vaccination until 2 days post -Dose, and the median duration was 1 to 2 days. The commonest systemic events were fatigue, headache, chills and myalgia. Severity was mostly mild or moderate; antipyretic or pain medication was often neede d. Systemic reactions were more frequent and severe in the 16 to 55 years age group. The median onset for most systemic events after either dose of BNT162b2 was 1 to 2 days post -Dose and median duration was one day. At least one adverse event (AE) was rep orted by 27% of participants after BNT162b2 compared to 12% of participants after placebo. AEs were reported more frequently in the younger group (16 to 55 years) than the older group (>55 years), reflecting the reactogenicity profile. Lymphadenopathy, nau sea and malaise were reported more frequently after BNT162b2 than placebo. Assessment of severe, life -threatening or immediate AEs raises no specific concerns. At present, there is no evidence that BNT162b2 is associated with hypersensitivity or anaphylax is, but post -authorisation monitoring for these events will be conducted. No significant concerns are raised on assessment of serious AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation. AEs of special interest (AESIs) have been defined by MHRA for COVID - 19 vaccines. I nterrogation of the AE data did not identify any rare AESIs, or imbalances between treatment groups for incidences of more common AESIs. The data to support safety in pregnancy are insufficient . Therefore, BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy . How ever, u se in women of childbearing potential can be supported provided healthcare professionals are advised to rule out known or suspected PAR COVID -19 mRNA vaccine BNT162 Regulation 174 50 pregnancy prior to vaccination . As a precautionary measure , women of childbearing potential are advised to avoid becoming pregna nt until at least 2 months after vaccin ation . The safety data support use in adults and adolescents aged 16 to 17 years. The safety population included baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive parti cipants defined as having a positive N -binding antibody test result or positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result on the day of Dose 1. There is no indication of a worse safety profile in baseline positive participants. Therefore, BNT162b2 can be used irrespective of COVID -19 history or SARS -CoV -2 serological status. Based on the solicited local and systemic reactogenicity data, and the adverse event data, the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have been included in the Information for Healthcare Professionals and the Information for UK recipients: - Very common ( 10%): injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills, arthralgia pyrexia - Common ( 1% to < 10%): injecti on site swelling, injection site erythema and nausea - Uncommon ( 0.1% to < 1%): malaise and lymphadenopathy The safety population, exposure and length of follow -up are acceptable for authorisation for temporary supply under Regulation 174. Safety data corresponding to longer follow -up will be submitted as laid out in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). Overall conclusion on the clinical aspects The data for BNT162b2 available to date are considered favourable. From a clinical aspect , based on the reviewed information, there is no objection to the temporary supply of BNT162b2 under a Regulation 174 . V USER CONSULTATION Evaluation of the patient information for readability via a user consultation study is currently deferred in the context of emergency supply under a Regulation 174. VI OVERALL CONCLUSION, BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION The quality of the product is acceptable in the context of batch specific release under Regulation 174 . The non -clinical and cl inical data submitted have shown the positive benefit/risk of th is product for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS - CoV -2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older. The use of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should be in accordance with official guidance.

Further data in 12 -15-year olds will be gathered in existing post -authorisation safety and effectiveness studies, and the results of these will be provided to the MHRA for assessment. Reason Extension of indica tion to expand the target population to include adolescents 12 -15 years of age. Supporting evidence Updated information for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and for UK recipients has been provided along with results from the pivotal Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001), which has been amended to enrol adolescents 12 -15 years of age. Evaluation The indication for COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection is active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 virus, in indiv iduals 12 years of age and older. The posology is the same in adolescents and adults. BNT162b2 is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a series of two doses (0.3 mL each) at least 21 days apart. The protocol of the Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001), which provided the basis for the Regulation 174 and Conditional Marketing Authorisation of BNT162b2 vaccine in subjects aged 16 years, was amended in October 2020 to enrol adolescents 12 -15 years of age in a separate age stratum (approximately 2,200 subj ects). These participants were all enrolled in the US and most remain currently blinded. This report describes the immunogenicity results as well as efficacy and safety results with a data cut -off of 13 -03-2021. 1. Clinical Immunogenicity An immunogenicit y objective was added to the study in order to demonstrate non -inferiority (NI) of the immune response to BNT162b2 in a subset of participants 12 -15 years of age compared to a subset of participants 16 -25 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV -2 infection. This NI analysis was performed to provide immunobridging between these younger adolescents and young adults 16 -25 years of age using a validated SARS -CoV -2 neutralisation assay. Methods A random sample of 280 partici pants who received BNT162b2 and 50 participants who received placebo was initially selected for each of the two age groups (660 participants in total) as a subset for immunogenicity assessment. The placebo participants were selected for serology testing to maintain blinding of the laboratory personnel. This sample size was originally estimated to provide a power of 90.4% to declare NI in the specified analysis. Immunogenicity analyses were finally performed on a set of participants who had the required test s completed using the same COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 53 available viral reagent lot for the neutralising assay. A blinded review of the samples tested at that time suggested a sufficient sample size properly balanced across age groups to perform the planned NI analysis. It was estimat ed that if the true geometric mean ratio (GMR) is 0.88, there was approximately 90% power to demonstrate NI and >99% power if the true GMR is 1. This approach was agreed with the US FDA. Endpoints The primary immunogenicity endpoint was the geometric mean titre (GMT) in each age group and the ratio (GMR) of 12 -15 years group to 16 -25 years group at 1 month after Dose 2. Other endpoints were the geometric mean -fold rise (GMFR) and percentage of participants with a 4 - fold rise in neutralising titres (seroresponse) from before vaccination to 1 month after Dose 2 in each age group. Statistical analysis NI was assessed based on the GMR of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titres at 1 month after Dose 2 using a 1.5 -fold margin. The GMR and its 2 -sided 95% c onfidence interval (CI) were derived by calculating differences in means ([12 -15 years of age] - [16-25 years of age]) and CIs on the natural log scale of titres based on Student's t -distribution, then exponentiating the results. NI was declared if the low er bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the GMR was >0.67. A supportive analysis was conducted to assess the seroresponse rate. The difference in percentages (12 -15 years of age - 16-25 years of age) and the associated 2 -sided 95% CI calculated using the Mietti nen and Nurminen method were provided. Results Data set analysed The Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity subset for adolescents 12 -15 years of age included 209 participants in the BNT162b2 arm and 36 participants in the placebo arm, and the subset for young adults 16 -25 years of age included 186 participants in the BNT162b2 arm and 32 participants in the placebo arm. The majority of exclusions were due to participants not having at least one valid and determinate immunogenicity result after Dose 2 and were ge nerally balanced across age and vaccine groups. Demographics In the adolescent immunogenicity BNT162b2 arm, 51% of participants were male, most (88%) were White and the median age was 14 years. About 5% of participants were SARS -CoV -2 positive at baseline. Obese adolescents (based on age - and sex -specific body mass index) made up for 11.5% of this age group. Demographics were generally similar in BNT162b2 and placebo arms, and between adolescents and young adults 16 -25 years of age (Table 1). COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 54 Tabl e 1: Demographics (Immunogenicity Subset) Neutralising antibody results Participants without prior evidence of SARS -COV -2 infection This analysis was conducted in subjects who had no serological or virological evidence (up to 1 month after receipt of the last dose) of past SARS -CoV -2 infection (i.e., N -binding antibody [serum] negative at baseline and SARS -CoV -2 not detected by nucleic acid amplification test [nasal swab] at any visit up to 1 month after Dose 2).

The data establish non - inferiority of neutralising antibody levels in adolescents compared to young adults . In baseline seronegative subjects, a robust neutralising response was shown after the second vaccine dose in both adolescents (GMFR=118) and young adults (GMFR=71), with seroresponse rates of almost 100% in both age groups. The response of adolescents is formally non inferior to that of young adults but, actually, the GMT appears almost twice higher (1.76 -fold) in adolescents compared to young adults. There are very few seropositive subjects at baseline, and as expected, their GMT after vaccination is not ably higher than the GMT in baseline seronegative subjects, almost twice higher in both age groups. Based on these immunogenicity data, similar efficacy is anticipated in adolescents and adults. 2. Clinical efficacy Methods The same selection criteria and vaccine regimen as in adults were applied to the adolescent stratum of the Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001). Outcomes/endpoints The same primary endpoints and COVID -19 case definition as presented for the adult population were used for adolescent s: first primary endpoint: COVID -19 incidence per 1000 person -years of follow -up based on central laboratory or locally confirmed NAAT in participants with no serological or virological evidence (up to 7 days after receipt of the last dose) of past SARS -CoV-2 infection; second primary endpoint: COVID -19 incidence per 1000 person -years of follow -up based on central laboratory or locally confirmed NAAT regardless of past infection. Sample size There was no independent sample size calculation based on demonst ration of efficacy in adolescents. It was anticipated that approximately 2,000 adolescents could be enrolled. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 58 Blinding (masking) Starting 14 December 2020, individuals 16 years of age and older have been progressively unblinded in the study to receive B NT162b2 vaccination when eligible per protocol. However, adolescents 12 -15 years of age remain blinded in this study, as BNT162b2 vaccination eligibility in all regions is currently for 16 years of age and older; a few participants in the 12 -15 years of age group turned 16 years of age after study enrolment and thus became eligible for unblinding to treatment assignment and vaccination. Sponsor and site personnel responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study remain blinded to individual participants' ran domisation for those who have not been unblinded. Statistical methods The point estimate of vaccine efficacy (VE) and associated 2 -sided 95% CI were derived using the Clopper -Pearson method adjusted for surveillance time and provided as descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing was performed. The following populations are used for the presented efficacy analyses: Evaluable efficacy (7 days): All eligible randomised participants who receive all vaccinations as randomised, with Dose 2 received within the predefined window (within 19 - 42 days after Dose 1) and have no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician on or before 7 days after Dose 2. Dose 1 all -available efficacy 1: All randomised participants w ho receive at least 1 vaccination. Results Participant flow Out of the 2,264 adolescents randomised, 4 were not vaccinated. Out of the 2,260 subjects that received Dose 1, 2,241 (> 99%) received Dose 2. The reason for not receiving Dose 2 was an adverse event (AE) in 2 cases of the BNT162b2 arm (see Table 18): pyrexia (related) and anxiety, depression (considered unrelated). The most frequent reason was a COVID -19 positive test, which was reported more frequently in the placebo arm. Overall, a hig h level of compliance was observed in these adolescents up to 1 -month post -Dose 2 visit. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 59 Table 7: Disposition of all randomised subjects through 1 month after Dose 2 Baseline data Since the efficacy population includes nearly t he same number of participants in each arm as in the safety population, the demographics of the efficacy population is essentially the same as in the safety population. It is presented in Table 8 in parallel with the demographics of the young adult (16 -25 years) population. Most adolescent participants are White (86%), with 5% Black and 6% Asian participants. Half are male and 12% are obese. The median age is 14 years. Finally, 4% have positive SARS -CoV -2 baseline status. The demographic characteristics ar e well -balanced across the vaccine and placebo arms. The population of young adults is more racially diverse as they were also enrolled outside the US and the proportion of obese is notably higher (about 20%).

This is a descriptive an alysis and no formal hypothesis tests were performed. Nevertheless, the point estimate for VE is greater than 50% and the 95% CI is entirely above 30%, so the WHO criteria for VE have been satisfied independently for the 12 - 15 years age group (Table 10). Table 9: Follow -up time after Dose 2 (Safety Population) Table 10: First COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose - Evaluable Efficacy Population (7 days) - without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 Second primary efficacy endpoint There were an additional 2 cases in the placebo arm if participants with prior evidence of infection were also considered. The incidence of infection in those with and without prior evidence of infection was similar: 2/122 (1.64%) vs. 16/972 (1.64%), respectively. COVID -19 BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 62 Table 11: First COVID -19 occurrence from 7 days after dose - Evaluable Efficacy Population (7 days) - with or without evidence of infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2 Severe cases No severe COVID -19 cases were reported in adolescents (12 -15 years of age) as of the data cut - off date. Therefore, there is no information to allow independent inferences about VE against severe infection in adolescents to be made. All confirmed cases of COVID -19 after Dose 1 The results demonstrate that, consistent with what was observed in adults, the vaccine provides protection even before the administration of Dose 2. There were no cases reported in the vaccine arm from 11 days after Dose 1 and the lower bound of the 95% CI is above 30% for the period from 11 days after Dose 1 to Dose 2; 11 days was approximately the time point where the cumulative incidence curves for the vaccine and placebo arms began to diverge in the analysis of the adult data. Table 12: First COVID -19 occurrence after Dose 1 - All-Available Efficacy Population COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 63 Conclusions on clinical efficacy In the pivotal Phase 1/2/3 study (C4591001), a cohort of about 2,200 adolescents 12 -15 years of age was randomised to placebo or the same vaccination regimen as adults with a median duration of follow -up superior to 2 months, which is considered acceptable. The data show a high level of vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease (100%; 95%CI [75.3, 100]) after 2 vaccine doses, consistent with immunogenicity results and adult data. F urthermore, this level of efficacy was already observed from 11 days after Dose 1. Overall, the data currently available show a very high level of short -term efficacy in adolescents, supporting an extension of indication to this age group. 3. Clinical s afety Safety results are presented for 2,260 adolescents aged 12 -15 years, of which 1131 received at least one dose of BNT162b2 up to the data cut -off 13 March 2021. In -line with immunogenicity, the main comparison presented is with young adults aged 16 -25 years up to 1 -month post Dose 2 (1097 subjects in the reactogenicity subset, of which 536 received at least 1 dose of BNT162b2). Comparative data beyond 1 month post Dose 2 have not been provided as young adults had a different follow -up time up to the d ata cut -off due to enrolment starting time into the study and due to unblinding of individuals 16 years of age as per the protocol for vaccination under emergency use authorisation. Patient exposure The median duration of follow -up for adolescents was >2 months after Dose 2 (see Table 9). All adolescent subjects were enrolled in US study sites compared with 81% of young adults. Otherwise, with the exception of a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino subjects in the young adult group, the demographics w ere generally well balanced across the two vaccine arms. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 64 Table 13: Demographic characteristics - subjects 12 -15 years and 16 -25 years (Reactogenicity Subset) Reactogenicity All participants aged 12 -15 years and a subset of participants 16 years of age (young adults 16 - 25 years of age) were asked to record local and systemic reactions and antipyretic/pain medication use from Day 1 through Day 7 after each dose. This was done each evening using prompts from an electronic diary (e -diary). Adolescent participants (12 -15 years of age) with e -diary data included N=1131 in the BNT162b2 arm and N=1129 in the placebo arm post Dose 1, and N=1124 in the BNT162b2 arm and N=1117 in the placebo arm post Dose 2. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 65 Young adult participants (16 -25 years of age) in the reactogenicity subset with e -diary data included N=539 in the BNT162b2 arm and N=564 in the placebo arm post Dose 1, and N=526 in the BNT162b2 arm and N=537 in the placebo arm po st Dose 2. Local reactions Local reactogenicity was similar in adolescents aged 12 - 15 years and young adults aged 16 -25 years. In line with local reactogenicity data previously reported in adults, in the BNT162b2 arm, pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction in adolescents and young adults. The frequency was similar after Dose 1 and after Dose 2 in adolescents (86.2% vs 78.9%) and in young adults (83.4% vs 77.5%). After the first and second dose and in both age groups, m ost local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local reactions were reported infrequently and at lower incidence in adolescents (1.5%) compared with young adults (3.4%) across the BNT162b2 and placebo arms after any dose. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported in either age group. Across age groups, median onset for all local reactions after either dose of BNT162b2 was Day 1 to Day 3 (Day 1 was the day of vaccination) and they resolved with a median duration of 1 -3 days. Figure 1: Participants reporting local reactions, by maximum severity, within 7 days after each dose - Reactogenicity Subset: 12 -15 years and 16 -25 years A comparison of the local reactogenicity data in adolescents with data in adult subjects 16 -55 years old was also provided. Generally, the data in these two age groups are similar, with the exception of an increased frequency of moderate pain reported in adolescents. This is in -keeping with the same trend that was seen in the adult population, where it was noted that the frequency COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 66 of moderate pain after any dose was increased for younger participants aged 16 -55 years compared to older participants aged >55 years. Systemic events Systemic reactogenicity was generally similar between adolescents aged 12 -15 years a nd young adults aged 16 -25 years. Systemic events in the adolescent group compared with the young adult group, in decreasing order of frequency by dose (Dose 1 vs Dose 2) in subjects that received BNT162b2, were: fatigue: adolescents (60.1% vs vs 65.6%) headache: adolescents (55.3% 64.5%) vs 60.9%) chills: adolescents (27.6% vs 41.5%) compared vs 40.0%) muscle pain: adolescents (24.1% vs 32.4%) compared young (26.9% vs 40.8%) joint pain: adolescents (9.7% vs 15.8%) (13.2% vs 21.9%) fever: adolescents (10.1% vs 19.6%) adults (7.3% vs 17.2%) vomiting: reported infrequently in both age groups and similar afte r either dose diarrhoea: reported infrequently in both age groups and similar after either dose In line with systemic reactogenicity data previously reported in adults, the frequency and severity of systemic reactions increased with number of doses for mo st events, the most frequent systemic reactions were fatigue and headache, and most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe systemic reactions were reported infrequently and at lower incidence in adolescents (3.5%) compared with young ad ults (6.0%) that received BNT162b2 after any dose. One adolescent in the BNT162b2 arm had Grade 4 pyrexia (40.4 \u00b0C) on Day 2 after Dose 1, with temperature returning to normal within 2 days; it was also reported as an adverse event (AE) leading to withdra wal. Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipyretic/pain medication in subjects that received BNT162b2 was slightly higher in adolescents (37% and 51%) compared with young adults (32% and 46%). Similar to the data previously seen in adults, medicati on use increased in both age groups after Dose 2 compared with after Dose 1. Use of antipyretic/pain medication was less frequent in the placebo arm than in the BNT162b2 arm and was similar after Dose 1 and Dose 2 in the adolescent and young adult placebo arms (ranging from 10% to 12%). Median onset and duration for systemic reactions after either dose of BNT162b2 was similar between the adolescent and young adult groups. Across age groups, median onset for all systemic events after either dose of BNT162b2 was Day 1 to Day 4 (Day 1 was the day of vaccination). Systemic events resolved after each dose with a median duration of 1 day, except fatigue and chills which resolved within a median of 1 -2 days. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 67 Figure 2: Participants reporti ng systemic events, by maximum severity, within 7 days after each dose - Reactogenicity Subset: 12 -15 years and 16 -25 years A comparison of the systemic reactogenicity data in adolescents with data in adult subjects 16 -55 years old was also provided. Overall, the frequency of solicited systemic events and proportion of moderate events was increased in adolescents compared to adults. However, the frequency of severe systemic events was low and similar in the adolescent and 16 -55 years age groups. Duration of symptoms was similar in both age groups. Use of antipyretic/pain medication was higher in the adolescents compared with those aged 16 -55 years, although this difference was mainly after Dose 1 (Dose 1: 37% vs 28%, Dose 2: 51% vs 45%). This is i n keeping with the same trend that was seen in the adult population where it was noted that the frequency and severity of systemic events was increased in subjects aged 16 -55 years compared with those aged > 55 years. Unsolicited adverse events Overview of adverse events The percentage of participants with any unsolicited adverse event up to 1 -month post Dose 2 was similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo arms for both age groups . An overview of AEs for adolescents and young adults reported from Dose 1 to 1 m onth after Dose 2 is provided in Table 14. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 68 Table 14: Number (%) of subjects reporting at least 1 AE from Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 2 - Reactogenicity Subset: 12 -15 years and 16 -25 years Note: Adverse events that occurred on the day of or after subjects were unblinded are excluded from this summary An overview of AEs from Dose 1 to the cut -off date for 2,260 adolescents 12 -15 years of age during the blinded safety follow -up is presented in Table 15. Table 15: Number (%) of subjects reporting at least 1 AE from Dose 1 through cut -off date (13MAR2021): Subjects 12 -15 years Note: Adverse events that occurred on the day of or after subjects were unblinded are excluded from this summary COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 69 Anal ysis of adverse events Adverse events reported in adolescents were generally similar to young adults within the respective BNT162b2 and placebo arms. Most of the AEs after Dose 1 up to 1 month after Dose 2 were reactogenicity events reported as AEs. In ad olescents, AE frequencies in these reactogenicity System Organ Classes (SOCs) were (BNT162b2 vs placebo): general disorders and administration site conditions (1.4% vs 1.0%) musculoskeletal and connective in these reactogenicity SOCs (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: general disorders and vs and connective 1.2%) gastrointestinal disorders (0.9% vs 1.1%) AEs reported in adolescents through the data cut -off date were similar in the BNT162b2 and placebo arms. The most frequently reported AEs in adol escents through the data cut -off date included site pain pyrexia (0.4%), nausea (0.4%), and headache (0.4%). These are all listed adverse drug reactions for BNT162b2. Related adverse events From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, AEs assessed as related by the investigator in adolescents and young adults were similar in the BNT162b2 arm and in the placebo arm (adolescents 2.9% vs 1.9%, young adults 6.2% vs 2.1%). Most related AEs were reactogeni city events and in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 15 adolescents (1.3%) and 19 young adults (3.5%) in the BNT162b2 arm compared with 9 adolescents (0.8%) and 9 young adults (1.6%) in the placebo arm. Related ev ents of lymphadenopathy were reported in 7 adolescents in the BNT162b2 arm and 1 adolescent in the placebo arm, compared with 1 young adult in the BNT162b2 arm and none in the placebo arm. Immediate adverse events Immediate AEs were those collected within 30 minutes hours after administration. No immediate AEs occurred after the 1st dose of BNT162b2 in either age group. Following the 2nd dose, the incidence of immediate AEs was very low in both age groups and comparable with the placebo arms (12 -15 years 0 .2% vs 0.3%, 16 -25 years 0.2% vs 0.4%). No allergic AEs were reported after either dose of BNT162b2 within 30 minutes after vaccination. Severe or life -threatening events From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, severe AEs reported in adolescents and young ad ults were overall low in frequency: 0.6% in the BNT162b2 arm versus 0.2% in the placebo arm among adolescents, and 1.7% in the BNT162b2 arm versus 0.5% in the placebo arm among young adults. Among adolescents, 2 participants (1 each in the BNT162b2 and pl acebo arms) had at least 1 life - threatening (or Grade 4) AE from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2. These included: COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 70 Focal peritonitis and appendicitis reported in 1 adolescent in the placebo arm, both events were reported as serious adverse events (SAEs), res olved, and the participant continued in the study. Pyrexia (40.4 \u00b0C) reported as Grade 4 in 1 adolescent in the BNT162b2 arm, occurred 2 days after Dose 1 with a duration of 3 days (i.e. temperature returned to normal within 2 days), and was considered by the investigator as related to study intervention; the event was reported by the investigator as non -serious, resolved, and the participant withdrew from the study (also recorded in the e -diary as reactogenicity systemic event). Additionally, 2 participan ts in the adolescent age group had life -threatening AEs that occurred after they turned 16 years of age during the study and were unblinded to receive BNT162b2 and were therefore not included in analyses of blinded data: Anaphylactoid reaction reported in 1 participant originally randomised to the placebo arm, 3 days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 with a duration of 1 day, considered by the investigator as related to study intervention; the event was reported as an SAE, resolved, and the partici pant withdrew from the study. Depression reported in 1 participant originally randomised to the placebo arm, 7 days after receiving the first dose of BNT162b2 reported as ongoing at the time of the data cut-off date, considered by the investigator as not related to study intervention; the event was reported as an SAE due to hospitalisation and reported as resolving, and the participant continued in the study. Among young adults, there were no life -threatening AEs reported from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2. Serious adverse events and deaths Deaths No deaths were reported in adolescents aged 12 -15 years of age or young adults aged 16 -25 years up to the data cut -off 13 March 2021. Serious adverse events Up to 1 -month post Dose 2, the incidence of serious AEs in subjects that received BNT162b2 was very low in both age groups (0.4%) and none of the SAEs were considered related to treatment by the investigator. The incidence of SAEs in the 12 -15 years group that received BNT162b2 remained low up to t he data cut -off (0.4%). In subjects that received BNT162b2, the only SAE that occurred in more than one subject was 'Depression', which was reported in 3 subjects in the 12 -15 years group and none in the 16 -25 years group; 2 non -serious events of depress ion occurred in the placebo arm of the 12 -15 years group. All 3 subjects with an SAE of 'Depression' had a significant past medical history that included depression, 2 of the 3 cases resolved after 5 days and none of the cases were considered related to tr eatment. Two adolescents originally randomised to the placebo arm had SAEs that occurred after they turned 16 years of age during the study and were unblinded to receive BNT162b2. These events were also considered as life -threatening and are described abo ve: an anaphylactoid reaction reported in 1 participant and depression reported in 1 participant COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 71 Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis have been observed post -authorisation in subjects aged 16 years and are a recognised risk with BNT162b2. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) AESIs, such as those in the CDC list of AESIs for COVID -19 that include events potentially indicative of severe COVID -19 or autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders, were considered in the review of reported events for the adolescent group in addition to programme defined targeted medical events. The only AESI that was reported in subjects aged 12 -15 years that received BNT162b2 was lymphadenopathy. Anaphylaxis No cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions were r eported during blinded follow -up in the adolescent (12 -15 years of age) or young adult (16 -25 years of age) groups as of 13 March 2021. One young adult participant who was originally randomised to the placebo arm and unblinded to receive BNT162b2 had an an aphylactoid reaction 3 days following their first dose of BNT162b21, with an event duration of 1 day; the event was reported as an SAE, reported as resolved, and the participant withdrew from the study. Lymphadenopathy In the BNT162b2 treated arms, up to 1-month post Dose 2, nine subjects (0.8%) reported 10 events of lymphadenopathy in the 12 -15 years group, of which 7 events in 7 subjects (0.6%) were considered related to treatment. The majority of these events occurred in the arm and neck region, were mild (grade 1), reported within 2 -10 days after vaccination, and half of events resolved within 1 -10 days (4 events were ongoing at the time of the data cut -off date). In young adults (16 - 25 years of age), 1 related event of lymphadenopathy was reported up to the data cut -off date, occurring in the axilla within 1 day of Dose 2 and resolved within 5 days. The frequency of lymphadenopathy events in subjects 12 -15 years is within that expected based on the frequency designation in the product information, and the frequency of related events is similar to that seen in adults 16 -55 years. Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to vaccine and is included in section 4.8 of the information for HCPs with a frequency designation 'Uncommon ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100)'. Appendicitis In adolescents (12 -15 years of age), 2 participants in the placebo arm had events of appendicitis reported as SAEs and considered as not related to study intervention. In young adults (16 -25 years of age), 1 participant in the BNT1 62b2 arm had an event of appendicitis reported as an SAE and considered as not related to study intervention. Bell's Palsy/Facial paralysis/Facial paresis No cases of facial paralysis were reported in adolescents (12 -15 years of age) as of 13 March 2021. Severe Covid -19 illness As of 13 March 2021, no severe COVID -19 cases were reported in adolescents 12 -15 years of age in Study C4591001. 1 This case was not included in the summary safety tables as these only included blinded follow -up data COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 72 Laboratory findings No laboratory data have been provided with this extension of indication. Safety in special populations Pregnancy As of the data cut -off of 13 March 2021, no pregnancies were reported in participants 12 -15 years of age. Four pregnancies were reported in the young adults (16 -25 years of age) that led to discontinuation from the vaccination perio d in Study C4591001, and 1 additional participant in the young adult group withdrew from the study due to a reported AE of exposure during pregnancy; none of these participants has given birth as of the data cut -off date. Safety related to interactions No new data have been provided with this extension of indication. Discontinuation due to adverse events From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, few adolescents and young adults in the BNT162b2 arm (0.2%) and in the placebo arm (0.4%) were withdrawn due to AE s. Of these events, in the adolescent group, 1 participant in the BNT162b2 arm had an AE leading to withdrawal that was considered by the investigator as related to study intervention (pyrexia), and none in the placebo arm. In the young adult group, 1 par ticipant in the BNT162b2 arm a had an AE leading to withdrawal that was considered by the investigator as related to study treatment (severe injection site pain that started 2 days after Dose 1 and resolved after 1 day), and none in the placebo arm. No add itional subjects discontinued due to AEs in the 12 -15 years group up to the data cut -off 13 March 2021. However, one young adult subject who was originally randomised to the placebo arm and unblinded to receive BNT162b2 had an anaphylactoid reaction (see A ESI) and withdrew from the study. Conclusions on clinical safety The safety database comprises of 2,260 adolescents aged 12 -15 years who were randomised 1:1 to placebo or the same vaccination regimen as adults with a median duration of follow -up > 2 month s. This is the same duration of follow -up that was agreed for subjects aged 16 years and over and is considered acceptable, particularly given the significant post -marketing data now available for this vaccine. Reactogenicity in adolescents was mostly mild to moderate, resolved within a few days and was similar to that seen in young adults. When the reactogenicity data in adolescents aged 12 -15 years were compared to those in adults 16 -55 years old, an increased frequency of moderate pain at the injection site was seen, and overall, the frequency of events and proportion of moderate events was increased in adolescents. This is in keeping with the same trend that was seen previously in subjects 16 -55 years compared with those aged > 55 years of age. Section 4.8 of the Information for UK HCPs has been updated to reflect the following wording that is already included in the EU SmPC 'A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.' Unsolicited adverse events were generally similar in adolescents and young adults, with the majority of AEs relating to reactogenicity events. No new adverse drug reactions have been identified. COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 73 Currently available short -term safety data in adolescents aged 12 -15 years reflect a similar safety profile to that in young adults and support an extension of indication to this age group. Provision of 6-month safety follow -up data in subjects 12 -15 years, once available, has been added as a new condition of the Regulation 174 approval. Risk Management Plan The company submitted an updated RMP (version 2.0) with the extension which includes data on use in individuals aged 12 -15 years. No changes to the summary of safety concerns or risk minimisation measures we re required; the safety profile of BNT162b2 in adolescent subjects was similar to that of young adults. The company will gather further data in 12 -15-year olds in existing post -authorisation safety and effectiveness studies, and the results of these will b e provided to the MHRA for assessment. The company has agreed to provide age -stratified analysis on the post -authorisation safety data for 12 -15-year olds in the summary monthly safety reports. 4. Benefit/risk evaluation Benefits Immunogenicity data from adolescent participants show robust neutralising GMTs after vaccination with 2 doses of BNT162b2 at 30 g. This response is evident in the 50% neutralising GMTs of participants with negative baseline SARS -CoV -2 status and is further supported by the boost ing effect observed in the small number of subjects with positive baseline SARS -CoV -2 status. The neutralising GMT in adolescents is formally non -inferior to that in young adults, but in fact largely exceeds that of young adults. Therefore, these data prov ide reassurance that the vaccine provides a robust immune response to SARS -CoV -2 in the adolescent population, at least comparable to the response that has been associated with vaccine efficacy in adults. Descriptive efficacy analyses in adolescents, based on confirmed COVID -19 cases reported from at least 7 days after Dose 2 through the data cut -off date (13 March 2021), show a short -term (at least 2 months) observed VE of 100% (95% CI lower bound 75.3%) in individuals without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection as well as overall in individuals with/without evidence of prior SARS -CoV -2 infection. No severe COVID -19 cases were reported in the adolescents enrolled in the cohort, and therefore, prevention of severe cases cannot be assessed. Taken together, efficacy and immunogenicity data strongly support a positive benefit in adolescents 12 -15 years of age for the same BNT162b2 regimen as in adults. Risks The safety profile of BNT162b2 in adolescent subjects appears similar to that of young adults. Reacto genicity in adolescents was mostly mild to moderate, had an onset date 1 -3 days post vaccination and generally resolved within a few days. Local reactions were predominantly injection site pain and occurred with a similar frequency after Dose 1 and 2. The most frequent systemic reactions were fatigue and headache. For most systemic events, frequency and severity increased with number of doses. Severe local or systemic reactions were reported infrequently. When the reactogenicity profile of adolescents was c ompared with adults aged 16 -55 years, an increased frequency of moderate pain at the injection site was seen, and overall, the frequency of events and proportion of moderate events was increased in adolescents. This is in keeping with the same trend that w as seen previously in subjects 16 -55 years compared with those aged > 55 years of age. The adverse event profile in adolescents mainly reflected reactogenicity events and no new adverse drug reactions have been identified. No deaths were reported and the incidence of serious COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 concentrate for solution for injection PL 53632/0001 74 adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal was very low. The only AESI reported was lymphadenopathy. Whilst the number of events was small, a slight imbalance in serious adverse events of depression was noted in adolesce nts compared to placebo and to young adults. All 3 adolescent subjects that had an SAE of 'depression' and were treated with BNT162b2 had a significant past medical history that included depression. Two of the 3 cases resolved after 5 days and none of the cases were considered related to treatment. Balance of benefits and risks The benefit risk balance of COVID -19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 virus is considered positive in subjects aged 12 -15 years. Conclusion The data provided by the company support the proposed extension of indication. In accordance with legal requirements, the information for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and for UK recipients is available on the MHRA website. Decision: "}
