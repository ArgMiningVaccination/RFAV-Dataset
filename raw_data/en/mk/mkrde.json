Until 1996, all we could do was totry to prevent and treat some of the opportunistic infections. Since then, the advent andlarge-scale distribution of antiretroviral drugs have turned the HIV field upside down, andthe new drugs have brought new questions. At what stage of the infection should we startprescribing antiretroviral therapy? What should we do to ensure that every patient whoneeds treatment can get it, when millions still don't have access? How can we reduce thenumber of new cases? Can the epidemic be controlled in places where the HIV prevalenceis very high? The first text is taken from a book 1on medical innovation in the specific context of humanitarian situations. It looks at the different attitudes adopted by MSF over the yearsin response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, starting in the early1980s and stopping at the end of the first decade of the 2000s, when millions of patientsworldwide began receiving antiretroviral therapy . The second text picks up the thread ofthat story , but this time at the field project level, in the Homa Bay district of Kenya. The last two texts offer an anthropological perspective on two issues discussed among the Homa Bay project teams: how caregiver team analyses connect the local culture to thespread of the epidemic, and the conditions for patient access to HIV diagnosis andtreatment. To this selection we have added a DVD with five films showing the different steps taken to implement preventive and curative treatments in Malawi since the early 2000s. A sixthdocumentary looks at issues of antiretroviral access in low-income countries from apolitical and economic perspective. We hope this cahier adds to the conversation, as we prepare to refocus our strategies for practitioners in the field. The Authors 1. Bradol, Jean-Herv\u00e9 late 1990s the mortality rate for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been brought under control in high-income countries, thanks to the combination ofseveral antiretroviral drugs. Yet there was no plan for administering the treatment in theworld's largest foci of infection. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, the most seriouslyaffected region, was not benefiting from therapeutic advances. Refusing to accept thissituation required innovative efforts on two fronts: medical and political. In 2008, 140,000people, ten thousand of them children, received free generic antiretroviral drugs inprojects supported by MSF . After a limited number of laboratory tests, patients areprescribed fixed-dose combination treatments (in a single tablet) by non-specialist doctorsor nurses. If there are no complications, the prescriptions can sometimes be renewed bypublic health technicians. 2Treatment of opportunistic infections is available wherever possible, and treatment for tuberculosis, the leading cause of death among AIDS patientsin Africa, is integrated with HIV treatment. During the first few years of treatment,survival rates are similar to those obtained in North America and Western Europe. Doesthis qualify as a success? Only a sustained reduction in the number of deaths and thenumber of people carrying the virus in the hardest-hit regions will show the true effect ofthe changes that have occurred in recent years. This article presents the circumstances andreasons which led MSF to treat patients who would not otherwise have access to new andcostly treatments. THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES, AND A CERTAIN INDI FFERENCE According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that infects cells of the human immune system, destroying orPART 1 AIDS: A New Pandemic Leading to New Medical and Political Practices Jean-Herv\u00e9 Bradol and Elisabeth Szumilin 2. As compared with France, fewerthan ninetythousand peoplereceive Seewww.sante-sports.gouv.fr/IMG//pdf/03_Epidemiologie.pdf (in French).8impairing their function. In the early stages of infection, the person has no symptoms. However, as the infection progresses, the immune system becomes weaker, and the personbecomes more susceptible to opportunistic infections. The most advanced stage of HIVinfection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It can take ten to fifteen yearsfor an HIV infected person to develop AIDS. Antiretroviral drugs can slow down theprocess even further. HIV is transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse (anal orvaginal), transfusion of contaminated blood, sharing of contaminated needles, andbetween a mother and her infant during pregnancy , childbirth, and breastfeeding.\" 3 A look at the advance in knowledge on HIV from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s shows that discoveries were made quickly (Grmek, 1990). Clinicians began to suspect theexistence of a new disease in 1981. In 1982, transmission of the disease to hemophiliacsvia blood products that, despite filtering, transmitted the infectious agent suggested a verysmall micro-organism: a virus. In 1983, HIV was classified as a member of the retrovirusfamily because of its mode of replication. It was cloned in 1984, and its genome wasidentified. The identification of HIV antigens led to a blood test that\u2014within certain limitsof sensitivity and specificity\u2014could confirm or rule out the presence of HIV (1985),making it possible to prevent transmission through blood transfusions. The test identifiedthose who carried the virus and those who did not. It then became possible to discernbetter how the virus spread within populations, and to identify the most seriously affectedregions and the highest risk groups and behaviors. This helped define and measure theeffect of the preventive actions that were being introduced in high-income countries in thelate 1980s. Understanding the retroviral mode of replication led to the use of the firstdrug, Zidovudine, whose efficacy is relative and temporary (1987). Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and administration of a treatment against the virus itself becamepossible. Knowing HIV's genetic makeup also led to measurement of the viral load in theblood\u2014a key laboratory indicator for monitoring treatment efficacy . Genetics also enabledidentification of mutant viruses resistant to certain drugs, making it possible to avoidineffective antiretrovirals right from the start of treatment. Understanding the virus'predilection for certain blood cells involved in the immune response resulted in a test thatcould measure HIV's effect on the body's immune defenses, the T4 lymphocyte level (CD4test). At the same time, different strains of the virus (HIV-1, HIV-2, etc.) were identified.Roughly fifteen years separated the first clinical diagnoses (1981) from the prescription ofa treatment transforming an almost-always fatal disease into a chronic one (1996). The 1983 International AIDS Conference in Denver saw the emergence of a political movement for people living with HIV . At the 1989 Montreal Conference, ACT UP and itsCanadian counterpart, AIDS Action Now , manifested their presence as soon as the openingceremony started. They demanded that research focus on patients' needs rather than onpharmaceutical industry interests alone. In 1994 the principle that organizations of people 3. http://www.who.int/ topics/hiv_aids/en/index.html.9living with HIV should have greater participation in the fight against AIDS was adopted by forty-two countries at a summit in Paris. In 2008 the Global Network of People living withHIV (GNP+) included more than a thousand member organizations. They demandparticipation in all institutional processes regarding the fight against AIDS, call foruniversal access to prevention and treatment programs, and emphasize preventiontargeting those who are HIV-positive. They also call for more information on sexual andreproductive health, are opposed to criminalization of virus transmission, and defend therights of people living with HIV . In 1989 MSF-France's Board of Directors approved a proposal to participate in the Montreal AIDS Conference, and MSF-Belgium opened a free, anonymous testing center inBrussels. The MSF delegate to the Montreal Conference declared that it was \"unthinkableto him that M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res should not be involved in the response to AIDS.\" Hesuggested possible approaches involving education, treatment, epidemiological surveys,and palliative care. He reported that treatments were being developed \"based on verycomplex and very expensive combinations\" and, among the avenues of research, he notedthat there were \"openings in Africa on mother-to-child transmission. ... A long debatebegan between those who thought that M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res could and shouldconduct AIDS related activities, and those who thought it was not within theorganization's scope.\" 4The debate was lively and tense. Advocates of engagement emphasized the large number of deaths in certain social categories and certain areas of theworld\u2014Africa in particular. They spoke of possible prevention activities and treatmentapproaches. Those resistant to the proposal stressed that there were no drugs available,and that prevention activities relying primarily on persuading people to change theirsexual behavior had very doubtful outcomes. In their view , MSF\u2014a foreign organizationwith little mastery of the languages needed for disseminating information and a superficialapproach to local culture\u2014was not the institution best-suited to do work that was moresocial than medical. The first report on AIDS, written by Epicentre 5for MSF in 1990, concerned the situation in France: \"MSF is frequently asked to intervene on AIDS inFrance. Yet no one in the organization is particularly responsible or expert in that area,and MSF has no policy on the subject.\" 6The requests were coming from patient organizations, researchers, and practitioners hoping that MSF would support their causewith its resources and reputation. A large diversity of opinions emerged among thegoverning bodies at MSF . Over the 1980s, these bodies had developed into a movement ofdifferent national sections (Belgium, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, Holland, etc.). Therelative political indifference at the office in Paris was met with internal opposition thathad a lot of support from other national sections. In missions outside France, the growing awareness of how health care facilities were responsible for the spread of AIDS led to a series of measures aimed at preventing virus4. Report from the MSF-France Boardof Directorsmeeting, June France,Epicentre, January25, 1990.10transmission during medical procedures. In June 1993 the medical department at the Paris headquarters informed the Board of Directors that screening tests were being set up at siteswhere MSF was directly responsible for transfusions. While members of the Board are notdirectly in charge of sensitive activities (sterilizations, transfusions, injections, surgery ,etc.), this work is nevertheless dependent on them. An unanticipated diagnosis beforetransfusion, coupled with the fear of stigmatization and discrimination and no offer oftreatment, has sometimes meant that testing was delayed. Studies of serological prevalenceamong pregnant women (Uganda and Sudan) sparked a debate on the appropriateness ofinforming a woman that she is HIV-positive during a routine pre-natal consultation.\"What should we do with someone whom we've informed, after our testing, that she isHIV-positive, or with a patient? We risk condemning people to a faster and more painfuldeath, because that knowledge will get them ostracized from their community .\" 7 Antiretroviral drugs made their first appearance in an MSF HIV prevention kit in the mid-1990s, following an accidental occupational exposure to blood. Mutual aid was alsodiscreetly provided to infected colleagues, friends, and lovers. MSF employees withopportunistic infections were given access on an individual basis to treatments that wereunavailable, and often very expensive, in their own countries. Ad hoc networks sprang upto stay with dying friends and loved ones. Refusals to grant visas on the grounds ofseropositivity were circumvented with the organization's complicity . Later, when the firsttriple therapies appeared, they were sent \"under the counter\" to colleagues in countrieswhere they were unavailable. Such actions were limited in number, but they highlightedthe fact that MSF needed to get involved in treating the disease. One of the very first fieldprojects (Surin, Thailand, 1995) that focused on treatment, rather than prevention, wasstarted by an expatriate nurse who had spent several years supporting Thai friends in theterminal stage of the disease. From such individual acts, carried out in the belief thattherapeutic solidarity was morally legitimate, emerged a sense of political affinity amongthose who strongly opposed an institutional position they considered overly timid, andwho were willing to change MSF's policy . Some members of MSF hoped for publicadvocacy and the large-scale use of antiretroviral drugs as a way to reconcile individualexperience and institutional action. The epidemic was particularly severe in places (eastern, southern, and central Africa) where MSF had developed its original, non-AIDS-related hospital activities. The medicalteams were faced with a growing number of cases involving difficult-to-treat opportunisticinfections and management-intensive terminal patients. The teams also had to deal withlocal staff who were not informed of how the virus was transmitted, and who refused tocare for patients for fear of infection. MSF team members mobilized to improve patientwelcome and disseminate basic knowledge on transmission and prevention withinformation and professional training sessions. Practical objectives included welcoming 7. Report from the June 1989 Board ofDirectors meeting,Paris.11patients, treating opportunistic infections, and providing palliative care (pain, wounds, nutritional support, personal hygiene, psychological and social support). Antiretroviraldrugs are therefore essential. Without them, treatment is difficult and ill adapted, andneither reduces the body's viral load nor restores the immune system. This was anargument for their use. Prevention activities in the field increased among specific groups, such as prostitutes and truck drivers in Mwanza, Malawi, despite the reluctance of some, who wanted tofocus mainly on treatment. In late 1995 an editorial on the cover of MSF-France's in-housemagazine Messages asked, \"MSF: a white, heterosexual, HIV-negative organization?\" Itwas a provocative title designed to promote prevention activities and patient support, andfight against stigmatization and discrimination. Such activities were not widely adopted byMSF-France, but began to flourish among other sections. By 1998 MSF was able to claim\"48 field projects in which AIDS is a major component.\" Without an effective treatment,however, the fight against discrimination and in favor of prevention was not enough tomake AIDS a core concern in MSF's policy . DRUG PRESCRIPTION: HESITATIONS AND AUDACITY At the opening ceremony of the 1996 International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, the New York representative for ACT UP raised the issue of access to treatment for the hardesthit populations. \"Yes, the preliminary results from these hugely expensive combinationtreatments look great. But we are a long way from a cure, even for the rich who can affordthe treatments. And we are no closer to a cure for the majority of people living with AIDSon this planet than we were ten years ago. Most peoples living with AIDS can't getaspirins.\" 8 At the 1997 Abidjan Conference, the French president and the minister of health called for \"international therapeutic solidarity .\" In June 1997, with support from a fewmultinational drug companies and the World Bank, the Joint United Nations Programmeon HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, created in 1995) launched the HIV Drug Access Initiative(UNAIDS-DAI). The DAI relied on some of the big pharmaceutical firms agreeing todifferential pricing according to a country's income level, whereas these firms previouslyasked a single price worldwide. In 1998 several countries (Uganda, Senegal, and IvoryCoast) began using triple therapy in their public programs. Its virological efficacy was 8. http://www.actupny . org/Vancouver/sawyerspeech.html.12established in the initial reports. These early experiences using triple therapies in resource-limited countries proved their feasibility and efficacy . Some of the practicalaspects (the lack of generics; prices that were still too high; asking patients to contributeto the cost; the lack of fixed-dose combination of three antiretroviral drugs in a single pill;the significant clinical, laboratory , and psychosocial follow-up needed; etc.) were onlycompatible with cohorts of several hundred patients, however, at a time when tens ofthousands of patients were waiting for the simplest, least expensive treatment. The small number of patients treated by the UNAIDS accelerated-access initiative contrasted with the experience in Brazil, whose national program\u2014using generics and freemedications\u2014rapidly treated nearly 100,000 patients (170,000 in 2008). In 1996 Brazillaunched a public treatment program by presidential decree. Brazilian patent law allowsfor compulsory licensing (without the patent-holder's consent) to produce generic drugs,so while the public pharmaceutical company Pharmanguinhos (Oswaldo CruzFoundation) does not manufacture all antiretrovirals itself, the possibility of doing so\u2014should a private firm's price be considered too high\u2014creates a credible threat ofcompetition that lowers prices. Brazil stands out because it was the first low- or medium-income country to treat large numbers of patients, and remained the only one to do sountil the mid-2000s. MSF reached an agreement with Brazil's public institutions to exportBrazilian antiretrovirals to South Africa. Apart from this agreement, Brazil has neversupported the effort to treat patients in very poor countries by exporting generics, 9though it does assist them in developing their own production. The high cost of the triple therapies used by Brazil (about $3,000 per patient per year) made large-scale initiatives by other countries highly unlikely . In February 2000 theIndian pharmaceutical company Cipla 10announced that it would be marketing a combination treatment, Triomune, for $350 per patient per year. Its components werechosen based on efficacy , the amount of time until certain side effects appeared, and, aboveall, the price of raw materials. 11The aim at the time was to offer it at the lowest possible price: $650 per patient per year, as opposed to several thousand dollars. Cipla grantedMSF an additional $300 discount, which was ultimately extended to all customers. It wasnot in the economic interest of the patent-holders of each individual drug to manufacturea single pill, so producing generics without a patent made it possible to produce the tripletherapy . This was the first time patients throughout the world had access to such a simpletreatment\u2014three antiretroviral drugs in a single tablet, morning and evening. Triomune'slow price and ease of use opened the way for public health programs on a national scale. At the same time, in Africa, private companies from various sectors (mining, energy , beverage, automotive, etc.) began funding access to antiretroviral drugs for theiremployees.

Telephone interview with Dr. Yusuf Hamied,Cipla chairman and CEO, January 23, 2009.13International AIDS Conference in Durban was a high point in improving access to treatment. It was at this venue that Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, and the Bill andMelinda Gates Foundation announced their $100 million donation for a treatmentprogram in Botswana. The hype surrounding these philanthropic actions masked theessential fact that even the least expensive triple therapies, available through UNAIDS,were nevertheless still very costly (between $800 and $1,000). Information obtained fromthe pharmaceutical industry , and confirmed by a WHO expert, prompted MSF to publishthe report HIV/AIDS Medicines Pricing (Perez-Casas, 2000), which showed that it wouldbe possible to reduce the cost to under $200 per patient per year. Procuring the drugs and getting them to the field meant clearing a dual pharmaceutical and legal hurdle (Boulet, 1999). No internationally recognized reference institution couldguarantee the quality of the supply source alternatives to the pharmaceuticalmultinationals. Buyers were unlikely to be reassured by generic triple therapies from India,which were not marketed in either the US or Europe. MSF criticized the WHO for nottaking responsibility; humanitarian pharmacists had to visit and validate manufacturingsites themselves in order to choose suppliers. In 2001 MSF began publishing aninternational guide to purchasing antiretroviral drugs for developing countries (theCampaign for Access to Essential Medicines, MSF , 2008). MSF-Logistique's legal status as apharmaceutical establishment facilitated transit through Europe and redistribution inseveral dozen countries. To manage the risks involved in purchasing, storing, importing,and exporting generic triple therapies, MSF recruited a team of lawyers and pharmacistsspecialized in intellectual property issues, administrative registration, supplier selection,and drug marketing. Just because a treatment is available on the market does not mean that authorities will automatically approve\u2014or medical teams support\u2014its use. Obtaining officialauthorization and convincing medical teams of the benefits means that new products needto be incorporated into a treatment protocol that is realistic both in terms of the patients'circumstances and the caregivers' professional practice. How to simplify withoutsacrificing efficacy? That was the task of the staff at MSF's medical departments, chargedwith providing technical support for field teams, with backup from experts at universitymedical centers. Some of the doctors who undertook this technical adaptation hadcontinued to take short-term assignments in hospitals in Europe, Japan, Australia, orNorth America, and had been prescribing triple therapy for several years. With theirexperiences in resource-limited countries in mind, they were convinced that the protocolscould be simplified without sacrificing the practices essential to therapeutic efficacy . Brazilhad already proven that it was possible to prescribe antiretroviral drugs in middle-incomecountries, and others were following the same path, particularly Thailand. There werestrong reservations, however, about sub-Saharan Africa, which, over the past decades, had14suffered increasing poverty , political instability , and the collapse of public health institutions. There were some parameters the medical team could control, such as prescription quality and drug management, but if patients didn't take medication regularly , failure wasinevitable. From an individual stand point, patients facing imminent death would havemore to gain by trying a treatment that is risky; but a poorly controlled program and badtreatment compliance (creating resistant strains of the virus) would compromise thefuture of treatment for the population as a whole. For this reason, the patient's ability tocome for check-ups (distance, available transportation, and budget) was an essentialcriterion for acceptance into the group receiving triple therapy . A strict treatment protocolmeans more than just coming in for checkups, however. The patient must alsounderstand, or at least accept, the medical reasons underlying the protocol. The MSFmedical team decided to focus on providing information to the patients using specializedmedical counselors, and a member of the patient's social circle was chosen and trained toencourage daily adherence to treatment. Lab testing was also a tricky issue. Existing knowledge suggested starting antiretroviral drugs when the immune response was markedly weakened, but lab tests were not readilyaccessible to MSF teams. Other tests to evaluate the function of potential target organs forside effects were also needed. Monitoring treatment efficacy would have required lab teststo measure viral replication in the body (the number of viruses per unit of blood, or viralload). In a professional setting dominated by the idea of evidence-based medicine whichoften relies on the measurement of biological markers, initiating treatment based on amarked deterioration in immune defenses, ensuring its efficacy , and preventing its toxicitywithout the help of lab tests seemed dangerously experimental. Once the protocols were defined and administrative authorization obtained, there were still several concerns hindering prescription. Would the fact that there were only a smallnumber of treatments available for a large number of patients lead to tensions, violence, orcrime? Should priority be given to people who were needed to treat others (doctors,nurses, etc.), or even to those who performed essential societal functions (political leaders,teachers, etc.)? Decisions to launch field projects were based on several criteria: the localprevalence of AIDS, the attitude of public health officials (whether they were open to theuse of antiretroviral drugs), and MSF's institutional interests. Treatments wereadministered to patients who were already frequenting outpatient clinics and hospitalservices, with priority going to those whose condition was most critical. Medical staffwould be among the first to receive treatment due to their proximity with thoseprescribing it. Tensions did exist, and MSF sometimes hesitated to treat its own staff. Theimpossibility of delegating the treatment of MSF personnel to specialized institutions,15which were largely non-existent, was a convincing argument. Being able to prescribe such complicated-to-manage treatments simultaneously in the dozens of countries where MSFintervened was difficult. Some in MSF's leadership feared that adopting an officialresolution in favor of treating staff when there was no treatment mechanism in place mightexpose the organization to legal action by employees. Finally , in November 2002, the MSFInternational Council decided to guarantee MSF employees access to antiretroviraltreatment. POLITICAL DYNAMICS By the early 1990s infectious diseases had again become a priority in international relations due to their potential economic and security repercussions. The emergence ofnew epidemics (Ebola and AIDS, in particular) and the fear of bioterrorism spurredgovernments to step up their disease related activities. Many institutions (nationalgovernments, international organizations, pharmaceutical firms, national andinternational private organizations, religious institutions, unions, political parties, etc.)were faced with the dilemma of how to respond to the AIDS pandemic. The Internetplayed a key role in relationships that transcended borders, spreading to the mostperipheral players (patients, caregivers, citizens), and reaching the top of public health,economic, and political institutions. Until then, the issues of drug access had beenexamined behind closed doors, and were the exclusive domain of experts, manufacturers,and government representatives. Henceforth, the discussion enjoyed broad mediaexposure. AIDS organizations and medical organizations like MSF took their place at thenegotiating table. The medical and political dynamics challenged interpretation accordingto institutional positions or individual opinions based on their own interests. The strongfeelings around the disease changed the usual dividing lines between individuals andinstitutions. We can define three basic attitudes: realism, universalism, and caution. The realists argued that the conditions necessary for increasing the number of people treated from a few hundred thousand to several million did not exist. Drug availability byitself could not make up for the patients' lack of schooling, the shortage of qualifiedpersonnel and equipment, the meager budgets and inadequate management of health careinstitutions, or the poverty and instability of the hardest-hit countries. Why make a specialeffort for AIDS and not for other diseases that were just as prevalent, even more deadly ,and far easier to treat? MSF , an emergency-oriented organization, would not have the16expertise and constancy that were essential for a lifetime commitment to the patient. There was a serious risk that drugs would be used incorrectly and that mutant,antiretroviral resistant strains of the virus would rapidly emerge. Prescribing beforeconditions were right would compromise the ability to introduce treatment under morefavorable circumstances in the future. Another perverse effect\u2014a drop in prices, and, moreimportantly , a weakening of intellectual property rights\u2014would discourage research anddevelopment funding for new drugs. The prospect of a return on investment would beundermined by black market imports of low-price generics competing with patented drugsin viable markets, and by an erosion of profit margins in emerging markets due to lower,differential pricing based on country income. Charitable donation was proposed as theonly suitable method in the rare situations where conditions were right for using tripletherapy . At the 2000 International AIDS Conference in Durban, Merck announced that itwould supply two antiretroviral drugs free of charge for the national treatment program inBotswana. In that country , where one in four adults (fifteen to fifty years old) carried thevirus, realism, faced with a potential demographic catastrophe, met its limits. Universalists advocated making AIDS treatment accessible to everyone. Public health policies could not be restricted to priority groups dictated by disease statistics. Indeed,societies' reactions to the pandemic, whether rational or not, would be an opportunity forpoorly functioning health care systems to use the fight against AIDS as a starting point forrecovery . Generally speaking, the universalists characterized any objection to making HIVtreatment immediately accessible as an obstacle to be overcome. The MSF representativewho participated in the parallel meetings at the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference inSeattle declared that patients were dying not from AIDS, but from the unavailability ofdrugs due to the patent system. This reasoning, without limiting it to the realm ofintellectual property alone, supposes a change in attitude by governments, thepharmaceutical industry , the medical profession, and patients. Where the universalists saw obstacles to overcome, the cautious needed guarantees before taking action. Precautions had to be taken in order to satisfy not only the moralimperative to treat, but also the need to do no harm, and to avoid squandering availableresources and compromising the future. So prescribing HIV treatment was considered, buton a smaller scale and in countries that already had some means (Brazil and Thailand, forexample) and depending on the environment (patents, the policy of patient contribution,limited human and material resources, etc.). The first use of antiretroviral drugs in Africaon the initiative of UNAIDS, and the first MSF protocols, illustrate this cautious approach. All three attitudes brought morality , medical science, public health, economic rationalism, and political will to bear in their arguments; all three wanted to be universal,realistic, and cautious at the same time. In practice, however, they were mutually17contradictory . Compromise was essential, but finding the perfect balance was impossible. MSF was a good example of this dynamic plurality of opinions that changed as a functionof many variables, some more heavily weighted than others: the emergence of tripletherapy , the will of governments, social and political mobilization, the changingapplication of intellectual property rules, the drop in antiretroviral prices, the availabilityof public funding, the analysis of the early experiences in the field, scientific publications,public controversies, and each institution's own interests. Governments, international organizations, pharmaceutical firms, and local associations were all involved in a national and international political dynamic that exposed theircontradictions, obliged them to explain themselves publicly , and forced them to makedecisions that, until previously , they had considered contrary to their intentions and theirinterests. In May 2000 President Clinton supported the countries of sub-Saharan Africathat wished to produce and import generic drugs (Executive Order 13155). In July 2000 atthe United Nations (UN) Security Council meeting and the Group of Eight (G8) summitin Okinawa, two important commitments were made: \"mobilizing additional resources\"and \"addressing the complex issue of access to medicines in developing countries, andassessing obstacles being faced by developing countries.\" 12The terms \"access\" and \"obstacles\" in the final G8 resolution were borrowed from the vocabulary of non-governmental organizations, including MSF , that were involved in preparing the Okinawasummit. Then UN Security Council Resolution 1308 (2000) stressed that \"the HIV/AIDSpandemic, if unchecked, may pose a risk to stability and security .\" The World Bankdescribed AIDS as a \"development crisis.\" After the failure of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle (1999) there was strong pressure to ensure that the Doha Conference (2001) provide a solution to the crisis. Thequestion of access to drugs seemed to offer the possibility of a positive outcome for at leastone of the issues being negotiated internationally . The monopoly granted to patent holdersfor marketing their drugs was weighing heavily on prices; in the late 1990s, triple therapycost between $10,000 and $15,000 a year. Therefore, what was needed was to makeapplication of the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS, 1994)agreement more flexible, so that the management of patents would not conflict with theproduction and circulation of less expensive generic medications, considered essential topublic health. Brazil, India, and Thailand led a group of about sixty countries in whichAfrica was heavily represented. They worked for access to generics, and were backed byseveral hundred national and international organizations, including Oxfam and MSF . Forsome countries with limited legal and pharmaceutical expertise, the alliance with advocacyorganizations meant the possibility of receiving technical assistance. The organizationslinked their technical assistance with lobbying for their political proposals. Countriesconcerned with defending intellectual property rights (the United States, Japan, and 12. G8 communiqu\u00e9, Okinawa, Japan, July 2000;www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2000okinawa/finalcom.htm.18countries in the European Union, in particular) wavered between strengthening and softening the rules. They feared that by rejecting an agreement authorizing production andcirculation of generic drugs, they would spark reactions jeopardizing the entire newlycreated TRIPS agreement. A few months before the Doha Conference, and in view of thePretoria trial, 13US Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick tried to get the pharmaceutical firms to see reason: \"If they don't get ahead of this issue, the hostility that generates couldput at risk the whole intellectual property rights system\" (Blustein, 2001). Not allmanufacturers were on the defensive, however. Indian companies producing generics werepoised to take over the large market expected to result from the change in WTO policy . AtDoha, the Ministerial Conference affirmed the sovereign right of nations to take measuresto protect public health. Among other things, the Doha Declaration made it possible for acountry to manufacture drugs without the patent holder's consent (compulsory licensing),providing royalties were paid ('t Hoen, 2009). It authorized importation from a countrywhere prices are lower (parallel imports) without the manufacturer's or patent holder'spermission. It was another two years before the issue of parallel imports of generic drugsunder compulsory license was addressed, on August 30, 2003, in Geneva, with theestablishment of fairly restrictive procedures. Despite the limits of the measures adopted,and the pressures exerted to curtail their application, the competition created by thearrival of generics on the market brought a radical drop in prices, which fell 99% between1999 and 2007. The organizations advocating universal access to antiretroviral drugs timidly began prescribing them. By November 2001, 650 patients were receiving antiretroviral drugs inall MSF projects combined. The evolution from prevention to treatment met with so muchinternal resistance that, in November 2002, the MSF International Council adopted aresolution prohibiting AIDS projects that were limited to prevention and did not includethe use of antiretroviral drugs. Due to caution, treatment protocols were so restrictive theydrastically limited the number of patients treated. MSF then relied on the experience ofother prescribers (the Burundian Nationale de Soutien aux S\u00e9ropositifs etSid\u00e9ens, and Paul Farmer's teams in Haiti) to increase rapidly the number of patientstreated. From 2003 to 2004, MSF doubled the number of patients receiving antiretroviraldrugs in its projects, from five thousand to eleven thousand. In June 2001 a special session of the UN General Assembly recommended the creation of an international fund to finance the fight against the AIDS pandemic. The Global Fundto Fight AIDS, T uberculosis and Malaria was created in 2002, awarding its initial fundingto thirty-six countries. That same year, the WHO added antiretroviral drugs to its list ofessential medicines. The \"3 by 5 Initiative\" (three million patients on antiretroviral drugsby 2005), launched in 2003 by the WHO and UNAIDS, was a major step toward providingaccess to AIDS treatment. Though pleased by these developments, MSF voiced some 13. In 1998 a coalition of about fortypharmaceutical firmsfiled suit in SouthAfrica to try toprevent theapplication of aSouth African law ,passed by Parliamentin 1997, allowing the production of generic drugs. The cases wereabandoned in 2001under pressure frompublic opinion.19reservations regarding the absence of what it considered essential recommendations. Many in the organization believed that the use of generic drugs was not being promoted, despitethe fact that generics would allow many more patients to be kept alive for the sameamount of money . Some members also pushed for generics containing several drugs in onetablet, which simplified the treatment regimen for the patient, thus ensuring bettertreatment adherence and efficacy . MSF was also critical of the fact that the \"3 by 5Initiative\" did not advocate either free treatment for patients or the right for nurses toprescribe drugs, when the limited number of practicing doctors made it impossible to treatseveral million patients. In 2003, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) was launched. The plan included the dispensing of antiretroviral drugs, which the US administrationhad, until recently , considered impracticable in Africa. In an article in the Boston Globe onJune 7, 2001, Andrew Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), was quoted as saying that \"many Africans don't know whatWestern time is. You have to take these [AIDS] drugs a certain number of hours each day ,or they don't work. Many people in Africa have never seen a clock or a watch their entirelives.\" Scientific arguments were needed to make the case, so Epicentre created a database(FUCHIA) of all patients treated by MSF for HIV infection. Beside their usefulness inguiding actions, the analyses produced from the database have enabled MSF to publish inscientific journals, thus legitimizing its contribution to the public debate. Theinternational mobilization and the publication of early results on survival rates amongAfrican patients on antiretroviral drugs 14dismissed the Bush administration's initial reluctance (Kasper et al., 2003; Ferradini et al., 2006). At a meeting with MSFrepresentatives, Randall L. Tobias, coordinator for the president's AIDS initiative,maintained that the results obtained by several teams, including MSF's, made inclusion ofantiretroviral funding inevitable in the president's plan. 15 The number of people receiving antiretroviral treatment in low- and middle-income countries increased from three hundred thousand in 2002 to three million in 2007. Yetonly a third of patients needing treatment were receiving it in 2007. That same year, 2.5million people were newly infected, and more than two million died of AIDS. The specificneeds of children\u2014in terms of both prevention and treatment\u2014are still only poorlycovered. The treatment available today is complicated, has severe side effects, and must betaken for life. In addition, the data on the efficacy of national treatment programs isfragmentary . Globally , 18% of treatment sites that provided information have experiencedat least one inventory shortage of antiretroviral drugs (WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF , 2007,p.4). The lab test that helps assess treatment adherence and efficacy is rarely available forindividual monitoring. A few epidemiological surveys make up, in part, for the lack ofinformation on the success rates of treatment programs in precarious settings. 14. The early results were made publicduring an oralpresentation at theInternational AIDSConference inBarcelona (summer2002). withRandall L. Tobias,MSF archives.20Today , due to their toxicity and limited efficacy , the antiretroviral combinations in use in middle- and low-income countries are no longer prescribed in high-income countries.The flexibility in intellectual property rules that made a first-generation treatment possiblein resource-limited countries in no way guarantees that these countries will get new drugs,the need for which is already being felt. Nor is there any guarantee that the fundingavailable for fighting AIDS will continue. Therefore, roughly twenty years after discussionsbegan, voices are once again being raised, both within MSF and elsewhere, urginginnovation rather than resignation.21BIBLIOGRAPHY BLUSTEIN 2001, \"Getting in Front on Trade: New U.S. Representative Adds 'Values' to His Globalization Plan\", The Washington Post, March 13.

Diemen, The Netherlands: AMB.23This document is the result of a visit in July 2010 to the MSF Homa Bay project in Kenya's Nyanza Province and part of a study launched in 2009 on the future of MSF AIDSprojects. The past two years have seen tense debates among the teams regarding futuredirections. Sharp exchanges - and sometimes needless humiliation - have left their markon the people involved, both in Kenya and at Paris headquarters. This atmosphere reflectsthe bitter reality of the discussions on the directions to take and the power issues seen inany institution. The visit was useful, however, thanks to the resolve of all those concernedto prevent a useful debate from turning into a series of squabbles. The visitor was thusable over a period of about ten days to familiarize himself with the principal worksituations and issues faced by the teams. The author has been going to Kenya for sometwenty years, and has been visiting the MSF clinic serving the population of Nairobi'sMathare slum since 1998. The clinic's activities now centre on HIV , tuberculosis, andwomen victims of sexual violence. The focus of attention on this visit was the Homa Bayproject, which covers two districts (Homa Bay and Ndhiwa) in Nyanza Province. As theproject grows and evolves, the question of HIV treatment coverage for all those who aremedically eligible is posed. The internal discussions on the future of HIV projects were woven together from a number of topics, which can be grouped into three sections: the setting (local, national,and transnational) in which MSF works, the role it would like to play in the fight againstHIV , and how it manages its AIDS projects. Once back in Paris, the challenge was not totackle all the issues, but rather to examine certain important points that keep coming upin discussions, while trying to find openings where the assumptions and formulation ofquestions in the debate wouldn't lead to the same impasses. A field project is a set of activities aimed at meeting objectives in a given place or institution (for example, an administrative department, a town, a camp, ahospital or any other medical or social institution). PART 2 AIDS: from initiating treatment to fostering patient loyalty Jean-Herv\u00e9 Bradol Paris, f\u00e9vrier 201024Each field project is run by a national or international team under the authority of a field coordinator. At the national level, projects are overseen by a capitalteam, led by the Head of Mission. For each member of the field team there is adouble chain of command, political: (Field Coordinator, Head of Mission, DeskProgramme Manager, Operations Director, Executive Director, President, andBoard of Directors) and professional: (for example, Doctor, Field MedicalCoordinator, Capital Medical Coordinator, Desk Medical Advisor, and MedicalDirector). The desk is a subdivision of the Operations Department under the authority ofthe Operations Director. It is responsible for steering the projects, choosingamong the different possible activities, and monitoring them from headquarters.It is led by a Programme Manager and consists of several representatives fromthe professions needed for operations (medical technology , human resources,administration, and logistics). See the sheet on the Kenya project, 2010, in theappendices. THE LOCAL, NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL CONTEXT THE PANDEMIC, AS SEEN FROM KENYAThe 2007 national survey already showed an average prevalence of just over 7% for Kenya's adult population (ages 15 to 64). However, HIV prevalence was 15% in NyanzaProvince, yet less than 1% in the North Eastern Province. In one province AIDS is a healthcatastrophe, in the other just another disease. In some places, the epidemic has neverassumed tragic proportions. In Kenya, as in other countries, the situation is still disastrousfor large segments of the adult population living in high prevalence zones and for groupsof individuals whose practices not only put them at greater risk of infection, but makethem less likely to receive care, due to the disapproval they elicit (men who have sex withother men, prostitutes, drug users, etc.). But the discrepancy between available resourcesand the large number of cases as well as the stigmatization of certain lifestyles are not theonly reasons why some people are excluded from treatment. Patients with severe forms ofthe disease and children - whose needs differ from those of the majority of patients, whoare adults - are penalized by care poorly-adapted to more complex and expensiveprotocols. 25The term \"pandemic\" - an epidemic progressing within a very wide geographic area, over several continents - is more a social and political necessity for mobilizing epidemicresponse than it is a solid epidemiological concept. Should we measure it by theproportion of the world population that is infected? The resulting morbidity andmortality? In 2009, when asked to give a precise definition of the term \"pandemic\" duringthe debate over public expenditures for H1N1 flu outbreaks, medical experts - the WHOleading the way - were hard-pressed to come up with an answer. The way that politiciansand activists use the word \"pandemic\" suggests there's a single reality encompassing all thevarious epidemics; that there's an invisible thread connecting San Francisco's backroomregulars with the patrons of Kinshasa's brothels. Politically , the feeling of a shared fate withrespect to the disease has unquestionably paved the way for international solidarity . It hashelped provide wider access to a treatment that was at first available only to a privilegedfew - patients in wealthy countries. But for all that, being infected by the same virusdoesn't create a common interest, or indeed a common destiny , between suchgeographically and socially disparate people. Even within the same country , theepidemiological profile and daily lives of IV drug users set them apart from the rest of theirHIV-positive fellow citizens. THE PACE OF KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND MUTATIONS IN FUNDING One argument used to convince donors to continue their efforts is that, despite the emergency situation, the response is slow and inadequate. The fact that the available drugsand protocols cannot stop the spread of the disease or treat all of the patients contributesto the feeling that research is not progressing. In reality , there has been rapid progress inknowledge and know-how since the defining of the new syndrome in 1981. The diseasewas quickly understood to be caused by a virus (1982) belonging to the family ofretroviruses (1983). The virus was cloned, and its genome decoded in 1984. Soon the firstlaboratory test for confirming diagnosis became available (1985), and the first drug,zidovudine (AZT), was proven effective (1987). A treatment capable of extending life byseveral years (HAART) was identified in 1996. In roughly ten years (2001-2010), fivemillion people were treated with antiretroviral drugs, despite the fact that the vast majorityof them lived in low- or middle-income countries. The past three decades have seen the burgeoning of prevention and treatment initiatives on a scale and pace unheard of in the history of public health. So should weassume that biomedicine is now so expert and so powerful that we can expect equallyprofound and rapid advances in coming decades? The fact that MSF programmes wereusing HAART barely five years after it was proven effective is remarkable. It usually takeslonger; humanitarian doctors often have to wait twenty years or more before being able touse a new treatment. While major strides have been made, we still don't have a vaccine toprevent infection, or a drug capable of completely eliminating the virus from the body .16. Bernard Rivers, Aidspan, Problems with Kenya's GlobalFund Grants. This paper was presentedat CountryCoordinatingMechanism meeting,Naivasha, Feb. 19-21, 2009, pp. 1-2.And while prevention and treatment tools reduce the number of new cases and slow the progress of the infection, they are still ill-suited to living conditions and care-providerpractices in the hardest-hit countries. In Kenya, the simple fact that 270,000 patients havebeen put on antiretrovirals in just a few years illustrates the pace and scope of the changes- especially since management of chronic diseases was until then a relatively small part ofKenya's public healthcare sector. In July 2010, results from Kenya's latest national HIV prevalence survey were just beginning to circulate. The United Nations held Kenya up as an example, because the HIVprevalence in young adults aged 15 to 24 had declined between 2007 and 2010, meetingthe goals set by the donor States. The UN's announcement of these encouraging resultsimplied that Kenya was at the cutting edge of the fight against the pandemic. In aninternational context where the will of donors is flagging, clearly it was useful to show -using the example that a part of Kenya's youth were adhering to preventive measures -that the worldwide campaign against HIV could indeed claim some victories. Repeated requests made by the Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines to the teams in Kenya for an example of how reduced funding impacts patients in the field arefurther evidence that global strategy affects local reality . Actually , Kenya has not yet lackedfunds - in fact, it is having trouble using the money that's available and justifying the useof certain sums already spent. \"Kenya's three Round 2 grants have reached the end of their5-year terms, with a total of 47% ($67 m.) of the agreed Phase 1+2 funding un-disbursedand no longer available....Audits at the end of 2004, 18 months into the Round 2 grants,showed that 99% of the $7 million disbursed by then was unaccounted for. In August2008, the Global Fund still listed those audit queries as being unanswered.\" 16Kenya is neither ahead nor behind in the battle against the pandemic, but simply in a place of itsown, which cannot be reduced to a single point on a numeric scale of quantitativeindicators for monitoring the global HIV strategy . When pressed, the Kenya teamsmanaged to make their point of view known to Access Campaign headquarters, andreleased a public statement limited to the country but in relation to the facts. At the sametime, MSF communications departments everywhere else rallied to condemn the donorstates' lack of mobilisation at the XVIII International AIDS Conference, organized by theInternational AIDS Society , in Vienna in July 2010. How were public health institutions,only recently described as extremely inadequate, supposed to absorb all that moneywithout a hitch and transform it into quality care? The non-use of some of the international funds allocated to fighting HIV in Kenya was a reminder of a reality that didn't tally with MSF advocacy , and thus had to be avoided ingeneral discourse aimed at describing the weaknesses in the global pandemic response.First, information slanted in this way is objectionable, because it reduces a complex 2627problem to the single issue of whether foreign institutions in the country in question have \"the political will to fund the fight against HIV .\" While the reductive nature of the messagehas been brought up, it is still considered useful to the cause. Repeated often enough,these buzz words take on the appearance of truth - based upon which decisions are madeand errors committed. Practitioners, however, know that healthcare is not made by moneyalone, and that new scientific knowledge and intense social and political mobilisation arecritical to progress in public health. UNDERSTANDING, AND BEING UNDERSTOOD BY PATIENTS An anthropological study 17was conducted from April to June 2010 to try to explain why some patients were receiving treatment too late, when their immune systems werealready badly compromised (CD4 count below 100/mm3, WHO Clinical Stages 3 and 4). The study also had several other aims: to explain how the \"Luo community\" viewed the HIV epidemic, to determine the epidemic's sociocultural impact, and to assess theelements of Luo culture that might favour HIV transmission. The study's sponsors, MSFoperations managers at all levels (headquarters, capital of the country , and Homa Bayproject), wanted to learn about patient perceptions and motivations in order to influenceattitude and behaviour changes. In order to explore the reasons why patients wait \"too long\" to come in, we need to define the \"right time\" to start HAART. According to promoters of HIV treatment, 18ideally , all adults would be screened voluntarily once a year. If positive, the hope is that thepatient would heed the instructions for preventing transmission of the disease to others,encourage those close to him to be tested, and start antiretroviral therapy \"at the righttime,\" that is, before his immune defences collapse. There are several problems with thisideal. The \"right time\" invoked by care providers has changed constantly over the past few years. When we began prescribing HAART in 2001, treatment was rare and reserved forthose who would now be considered \"too late.\" The situation for some of the people whoare now coming in \"at the right time\" is changing, since the CD4 threshold below whichHAART must be prescribed has just been raised. Basically , patients are now being asked tocome in sooner. While they are coming in \"at the right time\" now , they will soon beconsidered \"late.\" The \"right time\" depends on both the state of medical knowledge andthe ability of the healthcare services to provide treatment, and both of these are inconstant flux. As a result, the criteria for starting HAART has changed frequently overtime; from the initial period when drugs were scarce and the most serious cases givenpriority , to the current period of greater availability , where care providers want to startHAART earlier. Aside from its negative connotations, the definition of \"patients who come17. Vanja Kovacic, Access for more - Overcomebarriers access toHIV/AIDS care inHoma Bay district,Kenya. Phase 1 , June 2010, Homa Bay A qualitativesurvey wasconducted is not sufficiently stable to prevent confusion. In 2010, French health officials estimated that a third of HIV patients came in \"too late.\" Even with its considerableresources, one of the world's best healthcare systems cannot produce patients disciplinedenough to come in exactly on time. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2010, 1956% of treatments in Homa Bay were started at \"the right time,\" that is, on patients who were atWHO Clinical Stages 1 and 2. Clinical staging of new HIV patients Stage 4 33 6 Total510 100 We should note - by way of reference regarding the limits of qualitative studies - the conclusions of a study 20conducted in France investigating the reasons for participation and non-participation in cancer screening: \"[translation] There are a number of types ofjustification and explanation that shed light on the choice to have, or not have, screeningtests: the person's relationship to health and their body , their opinion regarding theprinciple of prevention, the fact of having been affected by cancer, their trust in theirdoctor, the fear of knowing, the fact of having receiving an \"invitation letter\" from theanti-cancer organisation, etc. But the way in which individuals relate or positionthemselves with regard to these explanatory factors is always singular. And it is always thisspecific relationship that explains why individuals act or not, take up the preventionsystem, or not.\" It would be more appropriate for us to ask ourselves about the problems arising from the patient/care-provider relationship, without prejudging about who is early and who islate. To describe patient attitudes regarding available care, we can use an economic andsociological classification scheme 21from a study on the non-use of social assistance by eligible individuals. This classification distinguishes three typical situations: individualswho are not aware that assistance exists or that they are eligible for it (not aware);individuals who are aware of the assistance but choose not to ask for it (not requested),and individuals who have requested the service, but haven't received it (not received). Anexamination of the data from the anthropological study in Homa Bay suggests that thereasons for non-use of HIV care often fall into the \"not received\" category .

This doesn't mean that \"not requested\" had no part in the non-use of care. But the fact is that allpatients tried to consult. Neither of the two healthcare sectors - biomedical or non-biomedical - offered patients appropriate diagnosis and treatment in a reasonable amountof time, despite the prevalence of the disease and the severity of their condition. Lookingat the care trajectory of the fifty or so patients studied, only half of the patients werediagnosed by their fourth visit, in a region where 20% of adults are infected. Just over onein ten patients had to make seven attempts before being diagnosed and started ontreatment. The anthropological study also looked at the relationship between Luo culture and HIV transmission. The Head of Mission practicing there between 2003 and 2007 had alreadybroached the issue in her report: \"Luos, an exception among Kenyan tribes, don'tcircumcise, they are also polygamous (60% of families in Rusinga highland in 2001).These two HIV transmission factors combine with others such as the consequences of theongoing women inheritance culture, a culture of early sexual relationships before marriage(traditionally tolerated in elopement and a behaviour currently accepted by the majority ofLuo men) in addition to prostitution caused by modern life and poverty (young widowsrefusing to be inherited or unmarried young women seeking a livelihood). Prostitution isespecially common along the lakeshore where young fishermen benefit from a regularincome. These factors have made the local Luo society highly vulnerable to sexuallytransmissible diseases. This accumulation of risk factors explains why HIV prevalence isup to 40% among adults in some areas of Nyanza.\" Tribal membership and identity continue to have considerable importance in the social and political life of contemporary Kenya. Until the most recent elections, many Luo didn'trecognise themselves in the country's government. Homa Bay is a majority Luo region,where HIV prevalence is three times the national average. In this context, the naturaltendency of those fighting HIV is to claim a link between the severity of infection in thisregion and what they consider the relevant sexual practices in Luo culture. T wo of thesepractices, one of them levirate marriage (where a man must marry his brother's widow),are mentioned by AIDS actors as favouring transmission of the virus. Both are connectedwith resumption of sexual relations by a widow , or her remarriage. While there may be aparticular link between Luo culture and virus transmission, simply blaming certain aspectsof the tradition governing sexual activities in widowhood is not a convincing argument.Culturalism is not the only explanation of why Luo culture is being blamed. There is alsoa widespread belief within AIDS organizations that gender inequality contributes to virustransmission. Epidemiological data on HIV prevalence by gender in Kenya confirms theview that women are at a disadvantage in negotiating sex and its attendant particulars(e.g., condom use). But there is nothing to indicate that if widows resumed sexual activity30outside the rules of Luo culture they would be less likely to transmit the virus. The HIV epidemic can sometimes seem like a boon to those who would like to change tribaltraditions and gender relations. Indeed, it's hard for activists to resist the temptation tojustify a \"modernizing\" or feminist position by claiming that it's better for health. Freed from the assumptions about patient \"lateness\" and the harmful health effects of Luo culture and gender relations, MSF's anthropological efforts could examine the patient-care provider relationship in greater depth by drawing on the already-plentiful literatureand data from Homa Bay . The goal is to identify the parameters that determine the successof lifelong treatment of a disease that is fatal if treatment is interrupted or ineffective. Notethat the literature review should not be limited to the AIDS literature, but should alsocover medical specialties in which monitoring chronic patients is part of everydaypractice. Patients' experiences with the disease and its treatment are changing. In the late 1990s, patients starting HAART experienced long periods of painful and disabling symptoms.They were aware of being close to death, and had often accompanied a loved one duringthe terminal phase of the illness. In the initial phase of treatment, patients experiencedrelief from their symptoms and a return to normality . Now , in Kenya as elsewhere, thanks to medical progress, the majority of patients are offered HAART based on lab tests, at a point when they have only minor clinical signs ofthe disease, or none at all. Increasingly , patients are being asked to follow a treatmentprotocol not to reduce pain and restore their independence, but to satisfy the abstractnotion that if they do not correct an abnormal lab result, they risk suffering from theeffects of a disease - AIDS - at some time in the future and which might kill them a fewyears down the road. Moreover, the first patients received innovative, specialized care by care-provider teams inspired by a pioneering spirit conducive to an empathetic approach to the patient. Patienteducation was afforded considerable importance in those pilot programmes, combining awarm welcome, medical information, and enjoinders to follow treatment protocolscarefully . This patient education explains, in large part, why care-provider teams in Africaachieved compliance and survival results on a par with those in more privilegedenvironments (North America and western Europe, for example) with many moreresources. Indeed, HAART's success is not simply that of a drug cocktail, but also of amedical practice that takes the time to explain the treatment process to the patient,encourages him to ask questions, and verifies, through this exchange, that the patient andsomeone close to him have truly grasped the concepts essential to the success of thetreatment protocol.31Extending treatment meant involving personnel from health ministries with fewer resources than the organizations that had launched the first pilot projects. Patienteducation has been one of the first victims of this personnel shortage, even though, due tothe changing patient profile, it is now more essential to success than ever. We should notethat in Kenya, the word used in both society and healthcare institutions to designatepatients is \"clients.\" During a visit to a clinic taking part in the decentralization oftreatment from the district hospital to peripheral health centres, a remark by the foreignvisitor to a Kenyan colleague - \"Here, this is not HIV friendly\" - prompted an unequivocalresponse: \"Kenya is not client friendly .\" Yet one of the main issues in chronic diseasemanagement is avoiding disruptions in the continuity of care. Why would a patient remain loyal to a practitioner who bullies him? Observing consultations outside the district hospital's Clinic B, in peripheral care centres (e.g.,Marindi, Ndhiwa and Rangwe) helps to see what discourage patients. Waiting times arelong. Forget confidentiality - there is no guarantee of even minimal discretion, and patientfiles are easily accessible. The visit is basically just a set of administrative acts, duringwhich other members of staff frequently open the door to the examination room for onereason or another. Patients rarely receive a physical exam, and there is as little time fordiscussion as there is staff training to provide pertinent information. Patient interviewsconducted at the MSF-run clinic (the district hospital's Clinic B), on the other hand,emphasized the importance of courtesy , discretion and patient education. The anthropological study showed that patients did not receive care when they requested it. It also showed that the reasons for not requesting care, aside from the fear ofdeath, were the fear of loss of reputation and of treatment side effects. How , then, will theeven worse consultation conditions in a decentralized system help reassure patients? MSF ,upon whom this point has not been lost, is trying to support peripheral health centreteams, using a mobile team (clinician, nurse and counsellor) to improve patient care.While this support is useful, its impact is limited by existing constraints - in particular,the instability of MoH staff and the lack of suitable facilities. The lack of dedicated space shows the extent to which chronic disease management has never been an important objective in the countries where MSF works. A goodillustration of the relationship between treatment objective and architecture is Malawi'sChiradzulu district hospital. The layout of the new European Union-funded districthospital, opened in 2005, makes no provision for HIV/AIDS activities, despite the fact thatnearly one in five adults in the district are HIV-positive, and 30,000 HIV patients are nowbeing treated there. Some of the HIV activities in the Chiradzulu hospital are conducted inrooms intended for trauma care. The Homa Bay district hospital needed new buildings tobe able to provide HIV and TB care. 32Many of the patients are poor farmers whose financial problems are exacerbated by their illness, as their income and borrowing ability decline and expenses rise. Patients arenot asked to help pay for antiretroviral drugs, consultations, or some lab tests. But thatdoesn't mean they don't have to pay anything - there are still transportation costs and billsfor lab tests and medications not included in the \"free\" care. There is yet another complicating factor. While it is true that a large percentage of patients are now started on treatment before their immune systems become too damaged,this doesn't mean there are no more complicated cases requiring specialized medical care.If clinicians fail to respond to requests for medical help when the disease worsens becauseof the complexity and cost of care, this can't help but impact treatment adherence andpatient loyalty . Why trust practitioners who abandon \"clients\" just when their conditionhas deteriorated to the point where care is critical to their short-term survival?Abandoning terminal patients to deprivation (food, hygiene and treatment), pain, andisolation after their years of loyalty to the care system can only make those who followeven more reluctant to follow medical recommendations. Another constraint for careservices is to be able to contact patients at home when they stop coming in forappointments. The need to extend care beyond the walls of healthcare facilities is also anissue in the management of terminal patients who are no longer mobile. Extending thecare delivery network beyond the institution is essential to finding patients who havestopped coming in. Already , monitoring of patients over several years shows a disquietingpercentage \"lost to follow-up\". Of the 510 new patients at the district hospital in the firstquarter of 2010, 494 were lost to follow-up. New patients and outcomes during the first quarter 2010 - Homa Bay programme N New patients total 510 New starting HAART 346 Deaths 14 Lost to follow-up 494 Transfer out 13933These data are consistent with data collected in other settings:22 \"[translation] Recent epidemiological studies describe the default, treatment failure, and viral resistance rates faced by treatment programmes in Africa: \u0081 In many countries, a high percentage of patients stop their ART early (25%of patients stopped after 12 months, and 33% stopped after 24 months) (1).\u0081 These interruptions are due, in part, to early patient death - deaths relatedto delayed diagnosis of HIV infection - but also, in almost half of cases, to thepatient discontinuing all medical follow-up.\u0081 A study of five African countries (Botswana, Malawi, Uganda, South Africaand Cameroon) found that 15 to 25% of patients were in virological failureafter 12 months or more of treatment (2).\u0081 A study conducted in Cameroon reported that 16.9% of patients showedviral resistance after 2 years of treatment (3); a broader study showed thatnearly 90% of patients in virological failure were carrying viruses resistant toat least one of the three classes of antiretroviral drugs (4).These high early default, therapeutic failure and viral resistance rates reflectthe current shortcomings and limits of care and treatment mechanisms.Treatment defaults are extremely damaging to both the individual (increasedmorbidity , early death) and the community (in particular, by favouring theemergence and spread of viral resistance). They increase costs - the moneyspent actively searching for these patients, and then for their subsequentmedical care - especially since the second-line treatments needed for patientswith resistant viruses currently cost $1,200 per person per year (eighteentimes more than the initial treatment).

Even leaving aside issues related to drug efficacy and side effects, a quick glance at the conditions that help to establish the relationship needed for successful treatment indicatesthat such conditions are far from the reality at public institutions. Kenya has started270,000 people on treatment in just the past few years, and there are hundreds of22. T raitement (3),pp. 89-91; 375177.34thousands more waiting. It is plain that public healthcare services are being given a task that they cannot accomplish in high-prevalence regions. This means that other care-delivery models are needed. This tension between the lack of available care and thenumber of people waiting for treatment has existed since 1996 and the response hasprimarily been a combined approach that is both economic (lowering prices andincreasing public funding) and medical (offering empathy and medical advice, simplifyingthe treatment protocols, and applying the subsidiarity principle 23when choosing personnel). There is still room for further reducing the patient's share of the costs. Avenuesfor improving treatment efficacy , reducing side effects, and simplifying storage and dosingare being explored. HIV and immune status (CD4 count) can already be assessed by rapidtests; the same will soon be true for viral load. To sum up, the limits to expanding andadjusting available care are related primarily to the state of public healthcare facilities. MSF'S ROLE DISCOUNTING MSF'S HISTORY AND THE ILLUSION OF POWERThe draft report from the July 2010 mise \u00e0 plat (MAP) 24on the Kenya projects (see Appendices), written in telegraphic style to allow rapid distribution to the field, summedup a decade-long policy: \"Late 90's - refusal to get involved and nothing to offer. Early2000s -involvement and significant early successes (treatment and advocacy)\". It is a common misconception that the Association's involvement in HIV began with HAART's arrival in the field in the early 2000s. In the minds of many colleagues, the threedecades of rapid progress described earlier are reduced to only one - the last. In reality , thenumber of HIV projects prior to the 1997 arrival of HAART was already on the same orderof magnitude as today . MSF teams were actively working in the main epidemic foci inAfrica (western, eastern and central) and Asia, seeing patients, distributing informationabout the disease and how it is spread, preventing transmission during medical andnursing procedures, fighting for access to care, and treating opportunistic infections.Before the late 90s, the possibility of stopping the virus from multiplying in the body wasvirtually nonexistent, and the immune system's decline irreversible. Hope at that timerested on prevention campaigns, which to many meant encouraging people to change theirsexual behaviour. Those who had doubts about widespread change in sexual behaviour orwhether it was appropriate for MSF - a foreign humanitarian organization - to participatein such campaigns were seen by their detractors as refusing to get involved in the fight 23. According to the subsidiarityprinciple, people at a higher levelshould refrain from doing whatsomeone at a lowerlevel can do. 24. The MAP is a meeting held twicea years, at whichthe managers froma given the resultsand theobjectives for fieldprogrammes.35against AIDS. These controversies and the Association's limited participation in the public debate over how to fight HIV is remembered in the collective conscience of its members asan absence, or even a refusal to mobilize. In contrast, the early 2000s is seen as a period ofheroic engagement with a series of rapid changes leading to the use of HAART in MSF-supported projects. At meetings in Kenya with representatives from other institutions, MSF is given little credit for having been among the first to use and demonstrate the effectiveness of aprotocol that now allows millions of patients to be treated. The initiative of which MSF ismost proud - having been the first to prescribe antiretrovirals, at no cost to patients, in apublic hospital in Kenya - has been forgotten. On the other hand, our Association isadmired - even feared - for the weight its words carry in the public debate. While MSF'smobilization against HIV is often described as belated, the impact of its advocacycampaigns on decisions by multinational pharmaceutical firms, the World HealthOrganisation (WHO), and donor countries is overestimated. Governments have beencommitted to fighting infectious diseases for as long as there have been state institutions,because epidemics threaten their ability to ensure public safety , and have significanteconomic consequences. The primary goal of governments, however, is not to provide careto individuals, but to ensure public safety and avoid economic losses and politicalinstability . In modern times, the exemplary model for fighting infectious diseases is the campaign to eradicate smallpox: an initial investment (the vaccination campaign) and a decisiveresult (eradication of the disease). The strategy is to eliminate the cause (the disease), notmanage its consequences (the patients). How , then, to explain that, in the case of AIDS,donor states have agreed to spend several billion euros a year on treating patients with noprospects for eradicating the disease? The threat to public safety and the ubiquity of HIV , anextraordinary level of social mobilization, the potential major economic repercussions,rapid scientific progress and countless other factors have helped make AIDS - and theresponses to it - unique. But to understand why donor states have found it in their interestto depart from their usual position and get involved in treating millions of patients withoutany prospect for ending the disease, we have to look at the impact that the public debate onpharmaceutical intellectual property issues has had on political decision-making. In the late 1990s, when extending the use of antiretrovirals beyond high-income countries became an issue, one of the main themes of World Trade Organization (WTO)efforts was the globalization of intellectual property rules applying to trade. The high priceof certain drugs - like antiretrovirals in the late 1990s - can be explained, in large part, bythe trade monopoly conferred on pharmaceutical firms by patents. The combination of apublic health disaster and prohibitive drug prices disproportionate to the costs of36production raises the question of whether intellectual property rules are compatible with public safety - in this case public health. This was a major challenge. In today's world,wealth and power are less often derived from ownership of physical objects, andincreasingly based on intangible ownership of the knowledge (legally formalized bypatents) that allows the production of objects and services. Reducing the economicadvantages conferred by patents means reducing the value of that portion of capitalrepresented by intangible objects. The too high price of AIDS drugs in the late 1990s - several thousand dollars per patient per year - created friction between two political objectives: private ownership andpublic safety . The moral dimension of the conflict added a dramatic effect, enhancing itspublic visibility . The tension between the two imperatives - private ownership and publicsafety - exposed the fragility of an economic system that relies, in large part, on the beliefthat ownership of knowledge essential to public health can remain in the hands of a smallnumber of individuals and institutions for long periods without any significant conflict.The major economic powers urgently needed to offer a series of concessions on access todrugs, before the \"our lives versus your profits\" debate compromised their ability toextend intellectual property rules to all global trade - especially since, at the time this washappening, in 2001, negotiations on other WTO issues were deadlocked and theinstitution was weakened. In that particular context, the major economic powers, led bythe United States, supported a softening of the intellectual property rules - for thepharmaceutical market only - vis-\u00e0-vis public health institutions. Basically , the fight against AIDS benefitted from an extraordinary combination of economic and political circumstances. Circumstances so conducive to rapid change inpublic health policy cannot last forever, nor be reproduced at will through advocacy . Whenthey do occur, however, they create political openings and offer those capable of seizing itan opportunity to change long-established power relationships. MSF AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES After the crisis caused by the lack of antiretrovirals in the countries hardest hit by HIV was resolved, the question of how and for how long MSF should be involved in the fightagainst HIV became the focus of internal debate once again. Questions about involvementin so-called \"development\" activities have been debated since the Association's very firstGeneral Assembly , in 1972: \"[translation] There are two opposing lines of thought: thefirst calls for volunteer medical aid that can be mobilized rapidly for short missions [...].The second, supported by volunteers returning from Bangladesh and Upper Volta, arguesfor the other urgency - the chronic lack of medical care in the Third World\". 25Nearly forty years later, the debate continues in the report from the June 2010 Kenya MAP , which refersto health development-type to question the pertinence of projects shared by field and headquarters, the latter also being concerned with the cost of the projects and the fact thatthey might not be consistent with MSF's role.\" Similarly , in late 2008, the OperationsDepartment 26in Paris considered transferring a large portion of HIV activities, in Kenya and elsewhere, to other organizations: \"[translation] This effort should start with anexamination of our international, national and local work environments, to identifypossibilities for transferring the responsibility for care and supplying drugs to someportion of the 'stable' patients that we are now treating directly to other actors (NGOs,Ministries of Health, peer groups, etc.).\" To better understand the changing opinions on \"development\" policies within MSF , we need to recall the state of international relations at the end of WWII. The Cold War hadbeen intensifying since the late 1940s, and the so-called \"underdeveloped\" countries werethe focus of a struggle for influence between the two sides. Contributing to thedevelopment of poor countries was one of the four points of President Harry S. Truman's1949 inaugural address: 27\"We must embark on a bold new programme for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvementand growth of underdeveloped areas. More than half the people of the world are living inconditions approaching misery . Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease.Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threatboth to them and to more prosperous areas.\" In the early 1950s, French demographerAlfred Sauvy coined the expression \"Third World\" in reference to the Third Estate - underthe French Ancien R\u00e9gime , the voters (and their representatives) who did not belong to either the nobility or the clergy . In reality , the goal of developing the third part of theworld - the one outside of NATO and the Warsaw Pact - transcended many politicaldivisions, as did, in other times, Christianisation or the concept of the civilizing mission ofcolonization. 28The dominant ideology of the time held that science, industrialization and economic growth would soon allow \"backward\" nations to close the gap, provided the\"advanced\" nations supported the project by allocating funds, adopting new trade rules,sharing scientific knowledge, and transferring technology . It was in this context that a group of Third World nations launched the Non-Aligned Movement, introduced at the Bandung Conference (1955) and the Belgrade Conference(1961) as an alternative to the declining colonial powers and U.S. and Soviet hegemony .The membership of Cuba, North Vietnam, Yugoslavia and the Republic of China, however,was an indication that the Non-Aligned Movement would be unable to completely escapeconfrontations between the two opposing economic and political systems. Traces of these typical Cold War confrontations can be found in internal discussions and MSF publications on the direction of international development aid. Third-worldism,26. argument.38development, poor nations' debt, famines, and international health issues are at the heart of a colloquium conducted by the Libert\u00e9 Sans Fronti\u00e8res foundation, an MSF satellite from 1982 to 1989. In 1986, as part of that discussion, MSF President Rony Brauman wrote:\"[translation] The main demands of the \"new order\" 29desired by the entire third-worldist movement have this in common: they pursue perfectly laudable goals using methods thatwill inevitably destroy them.\" 30Brauman specified two important points. First, the critique \"came from within the third-worldist movement itself.\" Second, it was aimedprimarily at a \"leftist\" idea of development that he considered dominant in France, while\"the right\" was nowhere to be seen. In LSF's view , third-worldism - the love child of\"Leninism and Christian socialism\" - represented \"a kind of extension of traditional socialmorality on an international scale.\" By the late 1980s, development had become aninalienable human right, thus taking on an aura of complete unreality: \"The right todevelopment is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human being and allpeoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, culturaland political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can befully realized.\" 31 LSF's public positions were defined in opposition to third-worldism's then-considerable influence in the health domain. The International Conference on Primary Healthcare washeld in the USSR, in the town of Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan in 1978. Its final declarationaccorded an important role to community health workers, modelled on Maoist China's\"barefoot doctors.\" LSF's hostility to communist-influenced health policies wasn't based solely on a rejection of the deadly , freedom-killing attempts at social and public health engineering,which it saw as the death throes of a totalitarian thought process whose sentimentalistthird-worldist tone failed to mask its dangers. The rejection of totalitarianism was, in fact,reinforced by experience in the field. It was operations to assist Third World refugeesduring MSF's first twenty years that had the greatest impact on the Association's politicaland technical choices. These refugees were Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Afghan, andEthiopian, proving, \"by their very existence, the failure of communism\". Third World\"popular democracies\" were producing nearly 90% of the world's refugees. 32In the 1980s, however, while MSF was formulating its criticisms of state authoritarianism, theneoliberalism of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher was winning to such an extent thatit became a threat to public health in poor countries, and to all socially progressive publicpolicy . The structural adjustment policy imposed by the international financial institutionswas leading to significant budget cuts in \"developing\" countries, while the Cold War wason the wane. In reality , LSF did not take into account this shift in international powerrelations when it opposed third-worldism. 29. In 1974, the UN General Assemblyadopted theDeclaration on theEstablishment of aNew InternationalEconomic Order(NIEO) ; one its objectives was torespond todevelopment issuesrelated to the priceof raw en question. Rony Brauman (ed.),Paris, OlivierOrban, 1986. 31. United Nations General 4, 1986. 32. Populations \u00edn danger , Fran\u00e7ois Jean (ed.), London,John Libbey & Co.,1992.39The fact remains, however, that at the same time it was positioning itself in opposition to third-worldism, MSF was participating in long-term third-worldist-inspired publichealth development activities within broad coalitions of actors (states, internationalorganizations, and NGOs). While this was true of the French section, the first in the SansFronti\u00e8res movement, it is even more obvious in the history of the Belgian, Swiss, Dutchand Spanish sections, which until the early 1990s were involved primarily in public healthdevelopment projects. 33This is evidenced by the fact that both in practice, through its field interventions, and by its public positions, MSF has supported every new , majorinternational health initiative: the Expanded Programme on Immunization (1974); thepromotion of primary healthcare following the Alma-Ata (1978) and Bamako (1987)conferences; the health-related Millennium Development Goals (2000), and the goals ofthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, T uberculosis and Malaria (2002). From the earliest editions of MSF's Clinical Guidelines, 34the introduction places the Association's medical action squarely in line with the movement for universal primaryhealthcare launched at Alma-Ata. \"[translation] Curative care is only one component ofthe healthcare programmes adapted to the needs of developing countries. It is importantto remember that other priority programmes also need to be developed. These are thefoundation of all action aimed at improving the health status of a community . These highpriority programmes focus on nutrition, water, hygiene, sanitation, the expandedprogramme on immunization and mother-child health.\" Admittedly , MSF did criticise thefinal Alma-Ata Declaration to some extent. The first had to do with the definition of\"Health for all by the year 2000,\" which seemed completely unrealistic: \"The Conferencestrongly reaffirms that health, which is a state of complete physical, mental and socialwellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity , is a fundamental humanright and that the attainment of the highest possible level of health is a most importantworldwide social goal whose realization requires the action of many other social andeconomic sectors in addition to the health sector.\" The second criticism was aimed at therole to be played by community health workers in promoting primary healthcare. Themagnitude of the responsibilities entrusted to a category of personnel with no medical orallied healthcare skills did not bode well for success, especially since the training,supervision and material resources to support their activities were lacking. That didn't,however, stop the Association from distributing David Werner's handbook, Where There is No Doctor - the veritable medical bible for community health workers - to every MSF field project library , where it remained until the mid-1990s. In 1992, the Association's internal debate over participation in development policies went to a new level. In 1985, the opinion of LSF members was expressed in the conclusionof the Third-worldism in question colloquium : \"[translation] Third-worldism is an obstacle to development.\" By the early 1990s, the problem was no longer third-worldism, but 33. Paris, 1988.40development itself. In the foreword to the collection35written since the suspension of Rony Brauman, then proposed a new definition of humanitarian action: \"First, let us hazard aminimum definition. Humanitarian action aims to preserve life and human dignity and torestore people's ability to choose. To accept such a definition is to say that, in contrast toother areas of international solidarity , humanitarian aid does not aim to transform societybut to help its members get through a crisis period, in other words when there has been abreak with a previous balance.\" What this new definition did was free humanitarian actionfrom the obligation to participate in a global enterprise to transform the world, where thecombined benefits of science and economic growth would ensure that \"underdeveloped\"countries could catch up, provided they followed the recommendations of \"more advanced\"countries. For humanitarian medicine - whose origins are, in part, linked to historicexperiments (colonial military medicine, missionary and social reform medicine) in themarch toward a new world - the impact of this break was considerable. It could nowdistance itself from a humanitarian action that might contribute to universalizing thecivilization process begun in Europe and gradually spread to the rest of the world. The influence on MSF members of this updated definition of humanitarian action by Rony Brauman in 1992 explains why the wording to the effect that the Association intendsto respond to crises, on an emergency basis if possible, crops up again and again in theinternal debate. \"At the end of the 1990s, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) got involved inHIV/AIDS because we viewed it as an emergency: today , MSF still believes this is a crisisrequiring an exceptional response.\" 36Similarly , the June 2010 Kenya MAP report says, \"2009, recommitment to MSF's role in the fight against HIV , which is again seen as anemergency....\" But what should be our attitude in response to crises whose resolutioninvolves long-term participation in a process of social transformation, like setting up betterinfectious disease monitoring, for example? AIDS projects and Access Campaign advocacyare examples of where we go beyond Rony Brauman's 1992 definition. AIDS is a crisis thathas already lasted several decades, and the introduction of HAART in poor countries is anobvious social transformation. While Brauman's definition might free humanitarian actionfrom the constraints of belief in the ineluctable march of progress guided by law and drivenby the combined effects of science and economics, it can also preclude potentialengagements by explaining that humanitarian aid \"does not aim to transform society but tohelp its members get through a crisis period, in other words when there has been a breakwith a previous balance.\" But is it possible to help a population get through a crisis whilechoosing not to participate in transforming the society in which the crisis occurs? In MSF's internal debates, the position that claims to give priority to the incontestable \"save lives here and now\" is offering an argumentum ad verecundiam . It expresses fidelity to the supposed origins of the Association, though in fact there is no evidence that there was 35. Populations \u00edn danger , Fran\u00e7ois Jean (ed.), London,John Libbey & clear-cut decision, but on the contrary , evidence of a contradictory discussion that began at the first MSF General Assembly , and continues to this day . Emergency response isoften held up - wrongly , as history proves - as the activity to which we must alwaysremain loyal. The contradiction between the claim that MSF did not originally participatein development activities and the facts is partially hidden from the collective imagination,thanks to the organization's promotional communications, which tend to emphasize theimage of a humanitarian medical organization heroically responding to emergencies, abovethe political fray . The debate is reduced to an ontological argument, thus avoiding thepolitical dilemmas. The hardening of identity in the arguments of those who are nowagainst involvement in so-called health development activities is no minor detail to theiropponents, who appear to disagree with them to the point of no longer being consideredto possess the \"MSF identity .\" They aren't just dissidents - they're outsiders to theassociation they joined. A Kenya team leader who came out in favour of joint healthdevelopment projects with public institutions thought she heard a representative fromheadquarters reply that she \"had the wrong organization.\" Yet the discussion on the limits of MSF's role shouldn't end in a decisive victory by one side or another. MSF isn't a Red Cross satellite or a UN agency , and it certainly isn't theappointed operator of some former colonial power's international cooperation department.The association defines for itself the scope of its mandate, offering its members thefreedom to explore limits while giving meaning to their volunteer service, transforming itinto something more than just a form of daily self-sacrifice. The authors of the MSFCharter used the expression \"populations in distress\"; twenty years on, Rony Braumanspoke of \"populations in crisis.\" These expressions can be thought of as malleable, or ableto convey multiple meanings. They are inclusive - sometimes too inclusive - and ongoingcritical reflection becomes essential. In this sense, the definition adopted in 1992 was asalutary attempt to narrow the range of possible meanings. But MSF's history (its reliefoperations, its position among aid organizations, and its institutional growth) alsodemonstrates how having a flexible definition of its role has been extremely productive.The goal is not to settle the debate, but rather to keep it alive, so we can take advantage ofthe flexibility of the expressions \"populations in distress\" and \"populations in crisis.\"Internally , hardened identity references can only stifle critical debate. Definitively endingthe debate over how to define the scope and methods of humanitarian action wouldnarrow a priori the field of intervention. MSF would thus be depriving itself of the freedom to respond, other than with dogmatic pronouncements, to new and constructive questionsby the teams at work in unique and changing fields of action. BENEVOLENT AND SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS? The internal debate is not simply a discussion on the validity of MSF's participation in transnational public health initiatives. It is obvious to those who support this approach42that action necessarily involves the Association's participation in building public healthcare institutions. \"As seen above, the need for integration of activities with the MoHto scale up treatment and progressively envisage coverage of ART needs has been clearlystated.\" This assertion is taken from the report written by the Head of Mission for Kenyafrom 2003 to 2007. Yet the idea that public healthcare institutions offer the most solidguarantee for sustainable public health action is debatable - not just politically , but alsobased on MSF's practical experience. Regarding AIDS, these same public institutionshelped spread the virus (via injections, transfusions, etc.). Then they increasingly refusedcare as the disease became an everyday part of their clinical activities. And then, when aneffective treatment (HAART) became available, the health ministries had enormousdifficulty setting up administrative procedures for procuring it, although they could haveobtained the drugs from the Global Fund without having to pay for them. Ten years on,few of these countries have made any financial effort to support HIV activities - and let'snot even go into the misappropriation of international funds. The ambivalent (to say theleast) view of the public health employees' integrity is illustrated by the pharmacybuilding constructed by MSF's Homa Bay team. The MSF AIDS project pharmacy was builton the Association's privately owned site, not in the compound of the district hospitalwhere the project's medications are prescribed. Yet the building was constructed with aview to the long term, as its thermal insulation shows. The insulation was designed so thatelectric air conditioners would not be required to protect the drugs from hightemperatures. The public sector is entrusted with the responsibility of covering the healthneeds of the population, but not to the extent of entrusting its employees with the keys tothe pharmacy . Whether to work in the public or private sector is a tactical choice, since neither offers a decisive advantage by its nature and in all situations. In Africa for example, church-affiliated healthcare centres often offer better quality , more reliable care than their publicsector counterparts. In the Homa Bay district, a visit to the Catholic Asumbi Health Centre(35 inpatient beds, with ART and TB drug dispensing in addition to its standardpreventive and curative activities) offered a good example of reliable, high quality care. Incontrast, the history of public health institutions since the end of WWII in the countrieswhere we work shows anything but stability . The history in African countries is a tellingexample: colonial medicine followed by independence and international cooperation(often with the former colonizer); collapse of public services in the 1980s, exacerbated bythe structural adjustment policies of the international financial institutions; and thentimid resumption in the late 1990s. This picture hardly suggests a clear relationshipbetween the public nature of the healthcare institutions and the sustainability of steadilyprogressing healthcare activity . 43PROJECT MANAGEMENT During the visit, activities at Homa Bay were entering a new phase in their development: an increase and reinforcement of HAART dispensing sites outside thedistrict hospital, in peripheral healthcare centres. This was the resumption of an effort todecentralize ARV dispensing initiated in 2003 in Ndhiwa. Paris headquarters, the capitalteam in Nairobi, and the field team all agreed on the direction to take. The latter was laidout, in broad strokes, taking both MSF objectives and local circumstances intoconsideration. The goal in Homa Bay - a high-prevalence area where available resourcesare insufficient - is to start treating as many patients and as early as possible. To achievethis, the plan is to increase the number of ARV dispensing sites in the Homa Bay andNdhiwa districts, while ensuring that a large percentage of the patients being treatedmaintain the lowest possible viral load over time. Despite the consensus on the objective, there was still some discomfort over how to concretely manage such an undertaking. The field team felt they were being asked for toodetailed an action plan - the exact number of new dispensing sites in a given time periodfor a specific, detailed budget. The team pointed out that it could not provide that kind ofplanning data, because too little was known about the factors that would determineactivities to construct a reliable timetable. To them, how to manage this new directionproposed by headquarters was just the first in a long list of hurdles to be overcome. Doingthe project itself would be something of an adventure, since no one had ever done such athing under social and epidemiological circumstances like those in Homa Bay . Moreover, itwould mean maintaining high quality care for many years. The method usually used formonitoring projects seemed ill-suited to a totally new experience; due to their inherentrisks, innovative enterprises require a special type of management. For example (andperhaps forcing the point slightly), it could be said that HIV care in district hospitals hasbecome so familiar that this kind of project can be managed using a precise, pre-established plan. But overall, it's better to assume that each field project has social,cultural, economic and political circumstances unique enough to create uncertainty tojustify a management that measures the work accomplished other than by merely lookingat progress along a series of pre-defined steps. MANAGING UNCERTAINTY Basic research institutions and industry draw up management models appropriate to innovative projects, i.e., those with a high degree of uncertainty . By way of example, BrunoLatour's paper \" L 'impossible m\u00e9tier de l'innovation techniqu e [The impossible job of technological innovation] 37provides a framework for monitoring these kinds author as ever more costly experiments conducted by uncertain researchers and decision-makers who explore various degrees of uncertainty while capitalizinginformation, in the hopes of generating support for the proposed object among potentialconsumers and citizens. How , according to him, is such an undertaking managed? \"[translation] Calculations cannot be used to assess the chances of an even slightly radical innovation, because the world in which it will be introducedisn't stable enough to get reliable numbers; yet it would be futile to trustnatural selection, since evolution isn't guided by any sense of efficiency . So dowe just give up, extol the perils and greatness of research \"that no one knowshow to manage,\" and support random projects while hoping for the best?This approach - while it might be gratifying to researchers - usually ends upbeing a colossal waste. The issue is to know whether we can evaluate withoutcalculations. Things that can't be calculated can still be described. But howdo we give a good description of an innovation that doesn't yet exist? Theway research projects are usually introduced makes evaluation nearlyimpossible. The researcher always tends to present his discovery as the eighthwonder of the world. Without flaws, opposition or competition, it shines -according to him - with the combined light of scientific truth, technicalefficiency , economic profitability , and perhaps even social justice - not tomention the inevitable progress. To hear him, shareholders, venturecapitalists, colleagues and consumers need only pull out their chequebooks.This is only human...but it isn't assessable.Now let's suppose that someone asks the innovator to describe his project notas an absolute necessity , but as a perilous adventure that might well fail. Weask him to name the competitors whose products currently occupy the nichehe wants to fill; we ask him to spell out the alternatives his project will haveto settle for if it fails to convince; we want to know how it can be modified toincorporate opponents' objections, and so on. Instead of making hispresentation watertight, we ask him to describe the risks. Why , you mightask, would that kind of description allow a better assessment than theimpossible calculation? If we can't, in all fairness, ask the promoter of aradical innovation to calculate his project's chances, we certainly can't askhim to know the answers to all of these questions about the ecology of aninnovation yet to come.Nor does the evaluator's judgment apply to in-depth knowledge; to a nascentinnovation we can only expect a nascent response. The evaluation is basednot on a thorough knowledge of the project's environment, but only on the45increasing richness of the innovator's description. The inventor can't know the future; he might fail; he might be wrong; he is feeling his way in the dark;we can't rely on any expert to judge him; we can't trust unfair naturalselection. While all of this is true, there is only one thing doesn't lie -Ariadne's thread remains solidly in our grasp - is the description of theproject's future world richer and more detailed now , after the project has gonethrough testing, than when the innovator and evaluator last met? What theevaluator can measure with some small degree of certainty is the \"learningdelta\", which makes it possible, between two tests or two meetings, toimprove the description of the project, making it both more easily articulatedand more negotiable. \"Negotiable? Take it or leave it!\" cries the indignantinnovator. If that's the case, don't give him a penny - let the project languishon the shelf with all the other brilliant but unworkable inventions. Whatyou're looking at is not the next great thing, but a white elephant, alabyrinthine contraption. In order to exist in ten or twenty years, the projecthas to be able to fit into an ecology as fragile as an Amazonian jungle; eitherthe innovator tries to understand the environment with you, and you have tosupport him through his testing, or he's only interested in his project and notits ecology , and his project has no chance whatsoever of becoming reality .Demanding the description, you'll get savings the calculation wouldn't getyou - and that beats counting on Darwin.\" Along with the advice above - written for an audience from the world of industry - are sixteen indicators, divided into four categories. Each is aimed at preventing what theauthor calls \"innovation pathologies\": \u0081 the belief that an innovative project can be ballistic, in the sense that its initially defined trajectory will not change; \u0081 paranoia that manifests itself as hostility and contempt for any approach critical of the project; \u0081 manipulation so that the project is judged by unrepresentative experts and by non- relevant testing; \u0081 the lack of a plan, as signalled by the absence of any foreseeable object likely to reconcile the different environments and contradictory interests revealed by the earlyphases of the project. Latour's indicators are presented briefly to underline the fact that there are specific methods for managing projects characterized by uncertainty in other professionalenvironments - for example, basic research and industry . The stakes are not small, since -as the author points out - laxity has its price: \"[translation] As one often hears at business46dinners, research and innovation are the surest (but definitely one of the most pleasant) ways to go broke.\" Given the risks inherent in innovation, the proposed managementmethod consists of evaluating the \"learning delta\" measured from one step to the next asthe project goes along. As each step is evaluated, resources are allocated to the projectaccording to the knowledge and know-how acquired in the preceding steps. This way ,allocated resources are transformed into new information about the different states of theworld in which the innovation is deployed, and about the contours of the innovation-in-the-making that will have to find a place in it. ADVOCATING BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: AN ADJUSTMENT VARIABLE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY? The process of innovation in public health can be represented schematically using three variables: \u0081 the state of science and technology;\u0081 the political will;\u0081 the required behavioural changes. When scientific and technical knowledge exists but is inadequate (e.g., AIDS after HIV testing came on the market but before the discovery of the effectiveness of HAART), andpolitical will emerges out of fear of widespread epidemics among heterosexuals(governments begin to view HIV as a threat to their security , economy , and politicalstability), then the demand for behavioural change is at its highest. Everyone on the planetis asked to restrict the number of their sexual partners and use a condom every time theyhave sex. When the scientific and technical capital (e.g. development of HAART) and political will (resolutions by the G8 in 2000, and by the WTO and UN General Assembly in 2001)increase, the behavioural changes demanded are more moderate. HAART is introduced inthe form of a twice-a-day tablet in poor and middle-income countries. The patient is notasked to help pay for the medication and is given information about the disease and histreatment. He then becomes subject to the constraints of managing a chronic disease, i.e.,regular attendance at consultations and treatment adherence. This suggests that the demands for behaviour modification required by the implementation of a public health policy increase in proportion to the need to compensatefor inadequate scientific knowledge or lack of political will. This can be helpful whenassessing the early potential of a public health proposal. 47How would we describe the current situation? Science is marking time. The prospect of a vaccine is becoming more remote, and the other preventive measures are unable toprevent the roughly two-and-a-half million new cases every year. No new antiretroviraldrugs have come along to radically simplify treatment. The lab tests needed to followpatients are becoming more accessible, thanks to techniques that can be used in theresource-poor settings of our medical practice. A set of prevention measures and thewidespread and ever-earlier use of antiretrovirals offer a glimmer of hope that HIVincidence, mortality rates, and ultimately , perhaps, prevalence, will decline. Donor states'political will is also marking time, as evidenced by the slower growth in HIV funding andassertion of other priorities, such as maternal and child health. Earlier we saw whytreating patients without seeing their numbers decline was not part of the strategiesdeemed as pertinent by donor states. Yet the current officially-stated goal of governmentsand HIV coalitions is an ambitious one (universal access to treatment 38), which would mean treating more patients. In 2010, the desire for universal access to HIV treatment in spite of gaps in the science and the diminishing political will is creating a situation much like the one in 1985-1996.Back then, knowledge had advanced rapidly to the point where an HIV test and mono-and bitherapies were available, and the political will among donor states to respond to theepidemic was on the rise. Those who had relatively ineffective tools but who neverthelesshoped to stop the spread of HIV asked for maximal behaviour change - fewer sexual1985-1996 : Use prevention to limit the spread of epidemics to broad populations2000 : Treat patients with antiretrovirals in all countries2010 : Reduce disease transmission through use of antiretrovirals and other methods Science and technology+ +++ + Political will ++ +++ ++ Behavioural change +++ + +++ 38. Universal access to treatment isunderstood tomean coverage of at least 80% of HIV-positivepatients withalready damagedimmune systems.48relations and partners, and systematic condom use. Today , scientific progress is slowing and the political will is weakening, as witnessed by the slower growth of available funds.The extremely ambitious goal of universal treatment means once again believing in thepossibility of rapid, profound changes in the behaviour of patients, care providers, andhealthcare institutions. RADICALIZING THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV? No treatment can completely eliminate the HIV virus in people who are already infected; thus, while success in providing universal access to treatment would lower mortality ,transmission would still not be slowed enough to prevent a continuous increase in thenumber of carriers. This would mean having to solicit donors for more every year, with noprospect of putting an end to either the disease or the increase in costs. We showed abovethat the donors' commitment to treating millions of patients despite the lack of anyprospect of eradicating the disease or reducing expenses was the result of a specific set ofcircumstances in the late 1990s. Today , the vast coalition of actors involved in social andpolitical mobilization is expressing its concern about the weakening of government will. In response, the \"test and treat\" strategy that promises to reduce transmission and costs in just a few years is gaining popularity . At the start of the Kenya visit, on arriving inNairobi in July 2010, the goal of the first meeting was to decide whether MSF should signan appeal by a coalition of Kenyan organizations entitled \"HIV: eradication is withinreach.\" The text called for a financial effort by foreign donors and the government in orderto make Kenya an \"HIV transmission-free zone.\" It also made reference to the position ofauthors from the two departments responsible for AIDS and tuberculosis at the WHO infavour of a test and treat-type strategy whose expected result would be the elimination ofHIV epidemics. Some WHO experts expressed this position as individuals in an article inthe Lancet . 39In practical terms, they proposed testing everyone over the age of 15 every year, and starting everyone who tests positive on HAART, whether they have clinical signsof the disease or not. According to a case study by the authors - a mathematical model ofa simplified South African situation (heterosexual transmission only) - there is reason tohope that the HIV prevalence could drop from 10% to 1% in this virtual South Africa injust a few years. What this article offers is a mathematical model that satisfies donor demands to use the funds in a way that reduces the number of patients, and thus costs. Every individualwould be expected to volunteer for a screening test at least once a year, and would agree totake medication every day for the rest of his life - not to take care of himself, but tocontribute to the collective good by reducing the spread of the disease. Is this realistic?Data from the anthropological study 40confirms that the discipline required of patients by public health policies runs up against the complexity of their lives.39. R. M. Granich, C. F . Gilks, in this work, Vanya Kovacic,Social Navigation.49What is most surprising about the \"test and treat\" proposal is the wide and rapid following it has attracted barely a year after its publication, despite the ethical dilemmasand considerable practical obstacles. What will happen to each patient's right to accept orrefuse prevention? How can a proposal that at least doubles the number of people on ARTbecome a reality within fragile public health systems where staff is in short supply , and thedrugs have limited effectiveness and significant side effects? In reality , this proposal - moreeconomic and political than medical - fits the situation that developed following the WTODoha Agreement (2001) and the creation of the Global Fund (2002) perfectly . In thosevery specific circumstances, the States agreed to invest in treating patients despite the lackof prospects for eliminating the disease. Once that extraordinary and advantageous set ofcircumstances ceased to exist, talk of eradicating the disease started up again among HIVresearchers and activists. What does it matter if there has been little progress in developingprevention tools, especially a vaccine; maintaining contact with donors means having tofind a way to prevent them from losing impetus for economic reasons. Indeed, the slowergrowth of HIV funding is beginning to be felt. When asked about \"test and treat,\" a high-level official 41in Kenya's Ministry of Health confirmed his interest. In his view , it's simply a matter of financial resources. Ideally , This Mwalimu42supporter would prefer that his country provide the funding itself, because to him that seems the best guarantee ofsustainable development. But in the absence of a national solution, he wants to see donorsincrease their funding sufficiently to cover treatment for everyone who is HIV positive. YetKenya is one of the countries where in previous years healthcare institutions weren't evenable to put all of the international funding to good use. The interview with this high-levelMoH official gave the impression - often experienced in other contexts - of an attitudethat transnational funding of a public health initiative is equivalent to guaranteed incomefor administration officials. This feeling was to be confirmed by an interview with anofficer from the National AIDS Control Council (NACC), then in full fundraising mode,and by the outside but involved view of an American Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) officer stationed in Kenya. Testing an entire population every year and treating all positives with antiretrovirals - whether they need treatment or not - in order to stop transmission might be anappropriate approach in certain extraordinary situations. It is an experiment worth tryingin high-prevalence areas where the epidemic cannot be controlled using other strategiesand its impact is devastating. But as a list of the prerequisites (high prevalence,acceptability , and feasibility) makes clear, only rarely are all of these met. The Homa Bayregion has twice the HIV prevalence of South Africa, the example for the \"test and treat\"model. Developing a similar strategy in this region would require mobilization andcompletely new forms of social organization; so little evidence of these is seen in MSF'sday-to-day work that the goal of eradicating the epidemic in a few years seems highlyunlikely . Given where HIV-fighting tools are today , reducing the disease's pressure on 41. The names of those interviewed willnot be cited in thistext. They wereencouraged to beforthright in (the teacher), a fiercesupporter ofindependentdevelopmentpolicies vis-\u00e0-visthe former colonialpowers.50society depends more on the ability of political and social actors to come up with entirely new forms of medical and social mobilization than on medical technology itself. THE RETURN OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER - FOOT SOLDIER AND SPECTRE OF PUBLIC HEALTH The universal access to care and \"test and treat\" proposals agree on one point: that the resources needed to achieve the objective are to be found in community mobilization (aset of new behaviours by patients and those close to them who are not members of themedical or allied health professions). And so re-emerge the community health worker andcommunity mobilization at the heart of the push for universal primary care in 2000 - apush that began at the 1978 Alma-Ata Conference. More than thirty years on, thesupposed virtues of these community health workers are still at the heart of transnationalpublic health discussions, as illustrated by an excerpt from an Institute for DevelopmentStudies 43document: \"Human resources are at the very heart of a health system. Health systems cannot function effectively without sufficient numbers of skilled, motivated andsupported health workers; yet estimates suggest that there is a shortage of 4.2 millionhealth workers worldwide. The shortage is most severe in sub-Saharan Africa. In countrieswhere formal health workers are too few , Community Health Workers (CHWs), local levelvolunteers, have an important role to play in providing services to the poorest and mostvulnerable communities. As CHWs are members of the communities where they work,they know and understand the health needs of those around them. Moreover, they can betrained and deployed quickly , and are unlikely to emigrate.\" But meta-analyses of existing data - in particular data from randomized controlled trials, or RCTs - offer some nuance useful for understanding the impact to be expectedfrom mobilizing the now re-named Lay Health Workers (LHWs). One of the largestliterature reviews available 44sums up the current state of knowledge: \"Conclusions. The use of LHWs in health programmes shows promising benefits, compared to usual care, inpromoting immunization and breastfeeding uptake; in reducing mortality and morbidityfrom common childhood illnesses; and in improving TB treatment outcomes. Littleevidence is available regarding the effectiveness of substituting LHWs for healthprofessionals or the effectiveness of alternative training strategies for LHWs.\" The currentstate of knowledge is itself a subject that warrants some clarification. Many studiesfocused on high-income environments; randomized trials on Lay Health Workers arepoorly referenced in the scientific databases; not all of the studies in the literature reviewinclude a comparison between professionals and LHWs providing the same services; thestudies comparing medical and allied health professionals to LHWs do not allow to draw aconclusion as to which category is better; the periods under review are too brief to give anidea of the effects of LHW activities beyond the short term; the differences in the amountof staff supervision between the studies and routine care needs to be accounted for in43. Institute for DevelopmentStudies (IDS). \"TheUK AchieveHealth Goals inDevelopingCountries(IDEAHealth).[http://www.who.int/rpc/meetings/LHW_review.pdf].51order to assess the reproducibility of the effects noted; and overall, the available data do not distinguish well between failures due to poor implementation of the activities andthose due to the chosen activities' lack of effectiveness. In the case of Homa Bay , Kenya, several NGOs were given responsibility and funding by the government and international donor institutions to act at the community level.According to Kenya's strategic plan for HIV/AIDS, an estimated 60% of services at the locallevel must be provided by community service organisations (CSOs), members of theKenya AIDS NGOs Consortium (KANCO). Created in 1990 by seven organizations, theconsortium now has more than a thousand member organizations. Women Fighting AIDSin Kenya, or WOFAK, created in 1994, is one example of an organization working in avariety of areas: prevention and education for the most at-risk groups, advice for peoplewith HIV , medical care, and advice on following the treatment. WOFAK runs ten centres,three of them in Nairobi, and estimates that it serves 6,000 women and 2,000 children.WOFAK representatives travel to sites and organize meetings with HIV-infected people inthe villages. When questioned, heads of WOFAK in the Homa Bay district made no secretof the lack of resources and organization for doing their work. Thus, while organizationsof this kind intend to act through people living with HIV or their close friends and family ,the reality is that they do not have the material means to maintain a regular relationshipwith the people charged with conducting public health activities outside health centresand hospitals. What kept coming up, not just in the interview with WOFAK but also withrepresentatives of other NGOs (the African Medical and Research Foundation, forexample), was MSF's reluctance to pay for the contacts (transportation and food) betweenthese organizations' representatives and those of the \"communities\" targeted by theiraction. In fact, in order to decentralize care from the district hospital to peripheral healthcentres, MSF was counting on the help of these very organizations who in turn asked MSFfor help to be able to carry out their work. The above give reason to doubt the results of a national and global strategy - universal access to treatment - that expects to achieve a highly ambitious goal using communitymobilization as a cure-all to remedy the lack of appropriate technology and policies. Thatdoubt is reinforced by the memory of similar situations with regard to health policy ingeneral (e.g. the attempt to achieve universal access to primary healthcare), and to HIV inparticular (early hopes of eradicating the spread of the epidemic through rapid,widespread adoption of new sexual behaviours). 52SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? CAST ASIDE OUR ILLUSIONS AND KNOW OUR WEAKNESSES There is nothing in MSF documentation or history to indicate that long-term public health responsibilities should be ruled out, a priori , because they are incompatible with the \"MSF identity .\" We should, however, learn from past experience. The first lesson isthat we should distance ourselves from fantasies such as universal access to treatment and\"test and treat.\" Why talk about distance, and not about refusal? First, because these grandschemes for the future convey new health norms that legitimize resistance to unacceptableaspects of the present reality . These major transnational mobilization efforts deserve creditfor putting issues, about which they were until only recently hopelessly apathetic, on theagenda of the world's most powerful. The new political dynamics offer us the option ofjoining a collective mobilization while maintaining a critical approach. But criticalengagement is only advantageous if we can maintain real distance from the illusion at thecore of the proposed policy . For example, believing it is possible to eradicate HIV with thetools now available implies that, while we might need to replace them, it is not essential.But in a context of chronically scarce public health resources, that which is needed but notessential quickly becomes superfluous. Thus, small advances as crucial as new diagnostictests and drugs become less likely . The second major lesson our experience should teach us has to do with our own limits. We do not have all the qualities required by certain aspects of health policy . In manyAfrican and Asian countries, in particular, pursuing \"healthcare for all by the year 2000,\"or hoping to restore access to care after war, we have tried to improve the management ofsome public healthcare institutions by convincing the Ministries of Health to delegate tous the administration of some of them. To put it bluntly , while interventions of this typeconducted from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s were educational, they were alsoresounding failures. Either the institutions were not at a stage where our objectives wererealistic (free clinics following the Bamako Initiative, in an environment of structuraladjustment), or MSF expertise and staff were a poor fit for their institution-building needs(the Expanded Programmes for Immunization). In addition to the unfavourable financialcontext of reduced public spending in the countries in question, we need to beclearheaded enough to see our own weaknesses: a private organization trying toconsolidate public institutions, being foreign and the constant turnover in expatriate staff,many of whom didn't have the necessary qualifications for the task.53DESCRIBE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS WE'RE FIGHTING First and foremost, the epidemic itself needs to be described at the level on which we intend to fight it - in this case, in the Homa Bay and Ndhiwa districts. The internalliterature is full of provincial, national, and global information. We have relatively detailedinformation on the patient cohorts being treated. But one level is missing - the collectivereality in which we practice. Here, this means the reality of the people in two ruraldistricts in Kenya. Medical teams should be paying attention to patients who are lost to follow-up - and more generally , to the people who aren't using medical services for which they are eligible.We should be adapting our services to the patients' culture and living conditions - not thereverse. Sociology and medical anthropology should be given greater autonomy informulating the questions to be studied. While these questions are supplied exclusively byoperations managers as terms of reference reflecting their own concerns and prejudices,social science studies are very likely to reinforce the opinions already widespread withinthe organisation, rather than shed new light on the problems encountered. Our currentprevention and treatment methods are still very restrictive. To what extent, and in whatproportions, can they be carried out? Only a combination of medical and sociologicalobservation can answer this question. INVENTORY AVAILABLE STRENGTHS AND KNOWLEDGE The recent hire of a Kenyan manager in charge of partnerships with the other HIV actors in Homa Bay should enable us to get an overall view of the resources available inthe two districts. Perhaps MSF should take the initiative by proposing a general meeting ofeveryone working on HIV in Homa Bay . In addition to the available resources, this wouldallow us to inventory the convergences and divergences between actors, and probably gaina better understanding of the patient associations' point of view. In any case, once we have listed the resources and possible synergies, there will still be a large discrepancy between HIV prevalence and the means for combating it. MSF has theresources, particularly financial, which would allow us to recruit the personnel that arelacking. Similarly , we would be capable of covering the geographic area with communityhealth workers deployed outside healthcare institutions. In the specific area of AIDS, paststudies 45have shown that such personnel can play an important role in patient follow-up. But the current literature on Lay Health Workers is quite clear about a potential systemiceffect. There are no examples suggesting that the use of LHWs constitutes a decisiveadvantage in developing a sustainable healthcare system. Fundamentally , doesn't an approach where tasks are allowed to slide down the chain of command (from specialist to generalist, from doctor to medical assistant or nurse, from45. Jaffar S, Amuron B, Foster S, 2080-9.54nurse to lay health worker) ultimately delegate much of the responsibility for treatment to the patient and the people around him (family , friends, patient associations)? In a number ofcountries - Burundi, for example - the large percentage of patients being treated in non-profit networks confirms this. The reasons for starting ART as early as possible are becomingclear. It's not only about the need for good individual care, but also the need to prevent aninfected patient from transmitting the virus to too many other people. As a result, thenumber of individuals theoretically eligible for ART is growing, and is becoming increasinglydifficult for the healthcare facilities to handle. More and more patients who are recruited orcome in on their own will have an abnormal lab result, a detectable viral load, and no majorclinical manifestations. Delegating a significant part of treatment responsibility to them, withsupport from the people around them, is probably the best compromise for ramping up theHIV response in places where the epidemic is most deadly , without excessive expansion ofthe public healthcare facilities to treat just one single disease. The tools needed to implement this plan - even if only the antiretrovirals and lab tests - are not currently available. The need for a new fixed-dose antiretroviral combination - ata price where over ten million treatments a year worldwide would be feasible - isbecoming clearer every day . It will have to be more robust against resistance, tolerant ofirregular dosing, relatively insensitive to weight variations, and have less severe sideeffects. The number of lab tests that can be done rapidly in resource-poor settings isgrowing quickly . The HIV antibody test and CD4 count are already available in this form,and the viral load soon will be. Imagine patients going to a walk-in counter near theirhome or work to be screened, starting treatment based on lab criteria before their immunesystems are too damaged, being monitored for treatment efficacy using simplified lab tests(rapid CD4 count and viral load) and, if there are no major abnormalities, getting theirART prescriptions renewed without seeing a doctor or nurse. The only piece missing fromthis primarily laboratory-based system for monitoring HIV-infected people before theyshow clinical signs of the disease is a lab test able to tell whether the patient is followingthe treatment. This is one specification that could be included when developing a newfixed-dose combination to take over from the current first-line treatment. Wouldn't it bepossible for the new FDC to include a marker that would indicate, via a simple lab test,good treatment compliance? But laboratory tools will only be useful if they are in linewith, as much as possible, patients' wishes. No matter how sophisticated the availabletools, care-provider teams and patients will have to decide together on a treatmentprotocol. A change in the first-line treatment - which will be unavoidable due to treatmentfailures and side effects - offers an opportunity to examine what patients, and theclinicians who follow them, want from the new treatment. Testing new approaches requires an appropriate working environment, which a partnership with KEMRI 46- the national medical research institute - could provide. The46. \"The Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute that KEMRI and MSF are both founding members of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative bolsters the idea of a partnership with enough autonomy to develop alternativeapproaches outside, or on the fringes of, the public system's treatment protocols. The hopeis that, having been studied by the national medical research institute, these alternativescan some day be adopted by MoH healthcare centres. Obtaining better tools (drugs and lab tests) is part of the transnational dimension of the fight against HIV . The specific needs of medical research for patients treated inresource-poor settings, the ins and outs of medical product marketing, and public healthfinancing remain central issues. Ten years ago, thanks to the legitimacy it gained with itsearly treatment successes in places where they had been thought impossible, MSF helpedadvance these issues. It enabled the Association to state the problem it was facing insimple terms: \"Our patients aren't dying due to the virulence of infectious agents, butbecause of the unjustifiably high prices of the drugs that could save them.\" It's easy tounderstand the power of this public statement, and its devastating effect on the positionsof the interest groups involved - for example, the Big Pharma and the donor states. Thecontemporary equivalent of this powerful lever would be a demonstration that theepidemic can be controlled at the local level. Then, drawing on this new expertise, MSFwould again be justified in demanding publicly the resources needed to control HIV in theplaces where it is taking the greatest toll. 56HOMA BAY PROJECT TIMELINE 1996 MSF responds to clashes between two clans in North West Migori with mobile clinic for afew months.MSF upgrades Got Kojowi Health Centre as a referral centre for a Home Based CareProgramme in Nyarongi Division to address the HIV/AIDS situation.Introduction of HIV testing. 1997 The Home Based Care project is discontinued due to increased activities at Homa BayDistrict Hospital and poor uptake of services.Activities focused around TB care are rolled out. 1998 A blood safety programme begins at Homa Bay District Hospital and is continued until2004 when the Kisumu Regional Blood Bank becomes operational. 1999 An outpatient HIV clinic opens in 3 rooms of the hospital to treat sexually-transmittedinfections and provide prophylaxis.The Inpatient Pharmacy Programme (IPP), a revolving fund pharmacy , begins in 1999 toaddress the shortage of drugs in the medical wards.

Duration of the project: Home based care started in 96/97, TB care in 97, blood safety in 98 and HIV prevention services and STI management started in 1999 in HBDH, since 2001MSF is providing Homa Bay district (including Ndihwa district) has a population of around 350,000. Aconservative estimate of HIV prevalence is about 16% among people aged 15 to 49. Otherestimates of prevalence reach 30%. MSFF started HIV/Aids activities in 2000 andintroduced free ARVs in the Homa Bay District Hospital in 2001. In 2004, the Ministry ofHealth (MoH) started its own HIV/Aids activities in the hospital. Integration of the twoprogrammes started in 2006 and was completed in October 2009. Activities concentrateon outpatient care with only very limited involvement in the hospital wards.Decentralisation activities until last year were focused on three clinics on a relatively smallscale. Though it started HIV/Aids care in the district, MSFF is now surrounded by differentactors badly coordinated by the MoH with Pepfar (The U.S. President's Emergency Plan forAIDS Relief) sponsored Aphia II (AIDS, Population and Health Integrated Assistance)being the actor with major influence in the district, despite being barely active in thedistrict hospital. MSF also provides TB and Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) TB care incooperation with the national programme and runs a culture laboratory in Homa Baydistrict hospital. Review of 2009 MSF continued its work in the Homa Bay District Hospital (HBDH) HIV clinic, the 2hospital medical wards, the tuberculosis ward, the chest clinic, and 3 peripheral healthcentres (Ndihwa, Rangwe and Magina). Additionally , another 5 MoH health centres in thedistrict were approached and assessed to start decentralisation activities towards the end ofthe year. The decentralisation strategy was re-modelled from a substitution to aAppendix II60consulting/technical support approach. T wo of the former three health centres are now running independent activities with very limited involvement from the MSF team. Majorobstacles to a more swift extension of activities were Aphia II's reservations and the MoH'slack of coordination in the district. As of January 2009, the MoH (Pepfar) mainly suppliedARVs, with several stock outs due to a lack of clear cohort data, order discipline and stockmanagement by the MoH and KEMSA (Kenya Medical Supplies Agency). The two cohorts were finally fully merged in the extended Clinic B facility , which wascompleted in 2009. The MDR \"Ward 6\" was completed and officially inaugurated inAugust. Efforts were made to improve defaulter tracing, with MSF leading the set-up of acoordinated tracing through CBOs (Community Based Organisations) and NGOs in thedistrict. The recruitment of a department supervisor and the involvement of an outsidecounselling advisor were intended to improve the counselling department's performance.

The desk believes that we have to set a long-term goalfor each project that will drive us towards something more than incremental achievementin order to break from the cycle of dissatisfaction with the current programmes.Appendix III63Mathare ...Homa Bay Strategy - Access for More. The target for the programme is coverage. For the next MAP , the team is expected to provide:Estimates of current coverage (either from a study or compilation of existing data) (July)Re-write the future orientation of the programme slide 35 based on the Access objective(August).A coverage goal - specific percentage/patient numbers (Sept).Plan for re-orientation of activities to meet coverage objective in the coming 24 months.Defend strategy for access versus incidence reduction. Why not go further and try toreduce transmission via access and treatment? Protocol: Goal is to begin shift of patients to 350 and Tenofovir immediately . Team needs to reflect and devise proposal for transitioning patients to ensure that, by the end of theyear, 350 is the threshold in all the programmes that MSF supports and all new patientsare put on AZT or TdF . An initial discussion must take place very quickly to figure out theshort-term budget impact as we assume that MSF will need to pay for the bulk of thesenew treatment costs. Dispensaries: MSF will handle drug delivery at the dispensary level (23 dispensaries). The goal is to ensure that diagnosis, counselling, and treatment for HIV/TB is available. Giventhe current period of transition between Aphia 2 and Aphia +, we feel that it is importantto get an agreement with the MOH for this activity and then communicate broadly toAphia and USAID that MSF is moving into this space. Timing - the goal is an agreementwith the MOH by August 15th and implementation in at least 10 health centres by thenext MAP . The approach to this can be sensitive to the relationships and partners in thearea as long as it meets the time objectives. Laboratory: We continue to debate MSF's role in adding resources to the HIV side of the lab. We need a definite plan to have adequate access to CD4 services for HB (includingdispensary scale-up and 350 threshold) plus all necessary tests to support TdF protocol.Note that the CD4 plan should consider the use of point of care in the future. Electricitymust be solved; if it is not solved by the next MAP , Fred is buying us all dinner! DR TB: Ok to support acceleration of DR TB care in surrounding health districts with technical support (should we try to negotiate MSF protocol in exchange?) Training: Agree that training is an essential element in quality as well as staff motivation.64Ok to invest in training resources but not clear that a 'training centre' is the right approach to start off with. First need to define a post for training advisor (expat or national) whowill help develop curriculum, organize training, but not necessarily lead training. Education-Communication: Agree that more public messaging on HIV is necessary . Agree to pursue suggestion to communicate via the local Luo radio station. An HIVeducation/prevention message needs to be developed and tested in the community beforeany radio campaign; could be a good place to link up with other organizations. Anthropologist: Very interested in the concepts arising from the interviews of patients coming in late.Need to finalize orientation of remaining time in the programme. I propose understandingwhy patients come in early (essentially the same research on health seeking behaviour forpatients who come in when they are healthy). Although potentially fraught with problems,it would be interesting to actually interview health workers on their barriers to providingtreatment (health providing behaviours?). Coordination Expat duration: 9 months with case-by-case evaluation of extensions; they will not becategorically refused but the desk remains committed to supporting the rotation of expats.HQ agreement: need to closely monitor implementation.CQ: OCBA is sending a security advisor; team will review recommendations and makeproposition if changes are necessary .Night driver: would like plan for hiring a night driver and elimination of expat driving.This will also help with the transit problem where you could give the per diem andsecurity rules to the driver who goes to the airport.Academic MedCo: not approved based on the priority to establish the strategic direction ofthe programmes and the fact that the current Asst MedCo is apparently not ready toassume these responsibilities. Coordo can assess needs for a Deputy MedCo. 67I. INTRODUCTION 1.1. \"AFRICAN SEXUALITY\" AND THE SPREAD OF HIV Homa Bay is located in the western part of Kenya, one of the areas in the country most severely affected by HIV . The estimated prevalence is 14% higher than the nationalprevalence (Chiao et al., 2009; MSF France, 2009; National AIDS Control Council, Kenya,2005), which inevitably leads us to the question: Why this is this the case in Homa Bayand not in other parts of Kenya? The reasons for this disproportionate distribution of HIV are frequently attributed to the cultural practices and traditions of the Luos, an ethnic group predominant in westernKenya. Luo culture, with polygamy , sexual cleansing rituals, and wife inheritance, 47has created a fertile ground for culturalistic48discourses on the spread of HIV in Kenya among scientists, medical specialists and the Luos themselves. Dating back to colonial times, these are certainly not new. Literature from the period abounds with explanations on the spread of specific diseases, particularly sexually-transmitted ones, and how this relates to the culture and behaviours of local Africanpeoples. In the 19th century , for instance, there was a simultaneous outbreak in Uganda ofnon-sexually transmitted treponema pallidum pertenue (yaws) and sexually transmittedtreponema pallidum (syphilis). Both were attributed in the medical texts to the\"immoral behaviour\" of Africans (Vaughan, 1991). Africans were not only seen as lookingdifferent and being susceptible to disease, but also as having different sexual inclinationsand behaviours, which went on to become defined as \"African sexuality\" (Caldwell et al.,1989). PART 3 Cultural stereotypes and the health seeking behaviour of HIV/AIDS patients in Homa Bay, Kenya Vanja Kova i * and Joan Amondi** * Medical Anthropologist, MSF France, Homa Bay, Mission Kenya ** Interpreter, MSF France, Homa Bay, Mission Kenya 47. Sexual cleansing rituals, regulatedby strict shouldbelong thefamily of thedeceased. 48. We use the term \"culturalistic \" to refer to the broaddefinition of\"culture\" as a set of shared attitudes,goals, beliefs,behaviours,practices, etc.68\"African sexuality\" was divided into two categories: male and female sexuality , and female sexuality , with the latter becoming the focus of some considerable colonialattention. The black African woman was described as degenerate, primitive, andpassionate and was used as a synonym for the prostitute and the female animal. She wasdescribed as \"doubly dangerous, being both African and wild, and female and wild\",(139:1999). She was an icon of sexually- transmitted disease, in contrast with the womenof 19th century Britain who were seen as \"reproducers of race\" and whose female sexualitywas \"successfully tamed\" (Vaughan, 1991). During the initial stages of the HIV epidemic, such racial stereotypes were used to determine attitudes towards the spread of the disease. But as \"race\" went on to become amore sensitive issue in the scientific arena, arguments on specific cultural traits fuellingepidemics became a convenient substitute. 1.2. LUO CULTURE AND THE SPREAD OF HIV In the case of the Luo ethnic group, the notion of a culturally-driven spread of HIV is deeply rooted and, surprisingly , even now has not moved on from the colonial perception.Culturalistic approaches appear not only in peer reviewed scientific papers (see for example Ayikukwei et al., 2008; Ogoye-Ndegwa, 2005), but they are also common amonghealthcare providers, including MSF (see End of Mission, Kenya (2003-2007) internalreport). There is doubtless an intuitive reasoning behind culturalistic arguments. Sexual cleansing rituals, wife inheritance, and polygamy are slowly dying out, but they still playan important role in everyday life in the rural areas of Luoland. However, who is bestplaced to talk about their culture? Here is what the Luo elders have to say about thespread of HIV: \"In the old days, younger people respected older people, but not anymore. And people never used to die like they die today. Men in the old days, they were between 23 and 25 (years oldwhen they got married), but now even 15-year olds get married. Women used to get married atthe age of 19 or 20. In the old days, younger women respected their parents, they waited(sexual activity) until the right time! They waited until they got married. And parents neededto approve the marriage. In fact, in the old days, girls got married as virgins, but not anymore.The girls, once they got married, they would stay there (at home), even if they were young.People would not go anywhere else (to have extramarital affairs), it was not the custom at all!But now it doesn't happen that way. Right now , girls go out to look for money from the men.They engage in sex for the sake of money, to help their parents. And in the old days there wasno disease (AIDS). But there is a disease now and it is killing people, so people depend on otherpeople to look after them... So people engage in sex for the sake of money. There are a lot of69nightclubs, discos. And there are young men and they marry young girls without their parents' consent. These younger men work as casual labourers. So they keep the money and at nightthey go to discos and they get diseases there. And again, when they go home it is theresponsibility of the older people to look after them when they fall ill. So it is a problem... Wife inheritance in the old days, it was done for the sake of the children. Then women could notlook after their children alone. Food, clothing, basically the man took care of them. Butnowadays, even older women remarry younger men, which is disrespectful. In the old days,there was wife inheritance but (it was regulated), it had to be a brother-in-law , whosebackground was known about by the lady (widow). And the older people needed to sit down todiscuss and they had to approve, before the inheritance took place. But nowadays, in moderntimes, it is not like this anymore... People go and marry just anyone. And it is even worse,because of this disease, this deadly disease (AIDS). Now people just marry at random\" (Elder, Homa Bay , 19/4/2010). The elders, who have witnessed their community struggle with HIV for decades, are stating very clearly that it is not ancient Luo culture, but a change in this culture - a shiftin the way it is practiced or the practice of this culture with very different rationales - thatis the reason for disease, death and an aggravation of health and social issues. Animportant point they make is that the culture, wife inheritance, for example, was regulatedand governed by certain rules and that the elders were responsible for ensuring that thecodes of conduct were heeded in accordance with the rationales on which they werebased. The advent of a more western lifestyle with its discos and so on, a loss of respect forerstwhile social rules regarding marriage, the access to cash-paid labour and the HIVepidemic itself, exerted new existential pressures on the community and contributed tothe spread of disease far more than the \"old\" Luo culture. According to the elders, had this\"old\" Luo culture remained untouched, it would have, on the contrary , fought to preventHIV infection. Furthermore, so far, no sound epidemiological evidence has been offered tosupport the culturalistic approach on the spread of HIV or weigh it against other debates centred on economics or physiology . 1.3. WHO IS GUILTY AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? It does not matter which - racial stereotypes, such as \"African sexuality\" or the cultural uniqueness of the Luos - both have been successfully used from the outset of HIV controlin simplifying discourses on the spread of HIV until now. While it is taken for granted thatpolygamy and prostitution are responsible for the spread of HIV in Africa, nothing much issaid about HIV infection caused by medical intervention. However, when Gisselquist et al.(2003) examined crude risk measures for HIV infection in Africa through to 1988, theyprovided evidence that exposure to healthcare caused more HIV than sexual transmission,promoted as the main means of transmitting the disease. Furthermore, the authors arguethat this evidence was deliberately ignored in order to maintain public confidence in the70healthcare sector. Thus, as often happens, culturalistic approaches are automatically defined to represent the culture of patients or communities but ignore the powerful,possibly even more dominant culture perpetuated by healthcare systems and their medicalinterventions. In fact, the latter are rarely called into question. Thus, the will to maintain public confidence in healthcare often results in biased views. The example of health seeking behaviour we present in this paper discloses details of onesuch bias and further suggests that blaming the patient is commonly used to divertresponsibility from healthcare providers who contribute substantially to the problem. It isimportant to keep this in mind, since attitudes to HIV epidemics have always beeninseparable from individual, cultural, national, and international blame. Much caution isnecessary because a culturalistic approach may be used not only to over-simplify the complexity of an issue, but also as a reason to justify inequitable distribution of healthcarein the future. Unfortunately , in times when sustainable ART funding is uncertain, this isnot mere conjecture. II. WHY DO PATIENTS DELAY IN ATTENDING FORMAL HEAL THCARE FACILITIES? One issue stemming from the culturalistic approach became apparent to us during our research on health seeking behaviour49among Luo patients. The question was: why do some patients take so long to access HIV-related treatment? The question originated fromthe observation of numerous patients in Homa Bay hospital wards who are bedridden andsuffering from severe forms of opportunistic infections. During discussions with healthworkers we realized that the common assumption is that these patients prefer traditionaltreatment to formal western treatment since it is an intrinsic part of their culture. Theother assumption was that they wait to be very ill before going to a formal medicalinstitution. Hence, these common assumptions are based on the patients' culturalisticbeliefs and clearly imply that the solution lies in exploring and changing their attitude. As will become apparent, the results of this research showed that culture did not play a major role in keeping patients away from medical facilities, or at least not the culturepractised by the communities in question. But, the medical institutions and the culturethey perpetuated did contribute to creating barriers to early treatment. This of courseopens a fraction of the blame mentioned above and provides the opportunity to initiate adiscussion on the sharing of responsibility between patient and healthcare provider. 49. Health seeking behaviour refers todifferent treatmentoptions used bypatients, thefactors thatcontribute toassociateddecisions.71Health seeking behaviour is often examined, as was our research, to steer patient behaviours towards institutionally desired actions. Healthcare providers promote HIVtesting and early treatment of HIV-positive individuals because these have manyadvantages: easier administration of treatment, less side effects, and better prospects ofrecovery before the onset of medically-challenging opportunistic infections such as TB,meningitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, etc. (Harries et al., 2004). In addition to the physicalbenefits, patients also profit from early treatment in social terms since the symptoms of theinitial stages of the disease, such as skin disease and severe weight loss, show little or notat all which prevents them from being stigmatised. Moreover, they remain fit and are ableto work and support their families. So, the benefits of early treatment are not under debatehere, but rather the means to achieve them. It is manifest from the medical records that a high proportion of patients are extremely slow in going to MSF France-run Clinic B. The interviewed patients, for instance, receivedHIV-related treatment a year and a half later on average, when there was already a strongsuspicion of HIV . This suspicion stemmed either from their partner's disclosure of theirHIV-positive status or from their own persistent symptoms of opportunistic infections.Here is a review of what happens during the lengthy period before patients take up thetreatment programme. 2.1. WHERE DO PATIENTS GO FOR HELP? The diagram below is based on the analysis of interviews with 50 patients (25 male and 25 female); for more details on methodology , refer to Kovacic V . (2010), OperationalReport I. Each patient's account was plotted as a set of pathways, joined in Diagram 1. Analysis of the health seeking pathways (the steps that patients took and the treatment options they used prior to receiving HIV/AIDS treatment) gives cause for alarm. More thanhalf of the patients (62%) began in the formal healthcare sector such as dispensaries,private clinics, district hospitals, etc. where they could be tested for HIV . Failure todiagnose patients with HIV during the first four visits to a healthcare facility was onaverage 74% (1st half (57%) of the patientshad to take at least 4 different steps before receiving satisfactory treatment. The maximumnumber of steps reported before receiving appropriate treatment was no less than eight. This leads us to conclude that, despite HIV/AIDS being a major public health issue in the area and that patients regularly access formal healthcare facilities, the ability todiagnose an individual with HIV in these facilities is extremely poor. Hence, the poor rateof suspicion (a clinician's ability to suspect HIV infection) and diagnosis (lack of technicalcapacity) were major reasons for delays in treatment.72In spite of this, in comparison to traditional treatment, the formal healthcare sector leads the way in the health seeking process; patients' flow is considerably higher (onaverage 19 patients per step) compared to the traditional sector (on average 7 patients perstep). More than one third of patients (34%) turned to traditional health systems as asecond option after becoming disillusioned with the ineffective treatment provided atformal healthcare facilities. But, out of the 19 patients who began with the traditionalhealthcare sector, 68% turned to the formal healthcare sector as their next treatmentoption. In short, the formal healthcare sector is the leading treatment option chosen by patients when confronted with HIV-related symptoms. Poor diagnosis results in treatmentthat does not relieve symptoms. This leads to substantial intervals before the next visit to aformal healthcare facility and impacts on opting for traditional treatment as an alternative.73Diagram 1: Patients' pathways (based on 50 patient accounts) NUMBER OF TREATMENT OPTIONS PATIENTS USEDDispensary Health centre Private clinic Private hospital VCT healers Lego Maria spiritual healers Traditional midwives Self-treatment with herbs 1st TREATMENT OPTION out of 50 patients, 0 receive treatment 2nd TREATMENT OPTION out of 50 patients, 12 receive treatment 3rd TREATMENT OPTION out of 38 patients, 11 receive treatment(2 continue with trad. treatmentafter testing HIV+) 4th TREATMENT OPTION out of 27 patients, 7 receive treatment 5th TREATMENT OPTION out of 20 patients, 12 receive treatment(1 continues with trad. treatmentafter testing HIV+) 6th TREATMENT OPTION out of 8 patients, 2 receive treatment 7th TREATMENT OPTION out of 6 patients, 5 receive treatment 8th TREATMENT OPTION 1 patient receives treatmentFORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTORTRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR TRADITIONAL SECTOR FORMAL HEALTH SECTOR50 19 631 6 2 1 1 1247 13 7 9 4 2 15 2 3 1220 14 13 6 5 1 Number of patients who have chosen this treatment option Path away from formal healthcare sectorPath away from traditional healthcare sector Move to traditional treatment, regardless of HIV test/treatmentN\u00b0742.2. INSTITUTIONAL DENIAL When the patients who used formal health facilities as the first option were successfully diagnosed, this was the end of their long health seeking behaviour. In relationto this, we use the term \"institutional denial\" to refer to institutional neglect andresistance (whatever the reason) to diagnose patients with HIV , even when the symptomsclearly indicate the likelihood of HIV infection. Let's look at the example of the patient who went to Ndhiwa district hospital 50with persistent diarrhoea. Despite being an obvious symptom of HIV infection, she was treatedfor typhoid for two years and was never offered an HIV test during her visits to the formalhealthcare facility . Another example is a patient who, during a couple of repeat visits to theMoH division of Homa Bay district hospital (an extension of the MSF HIV/AIDS care unit)was treated for \"serious malaria\". After a lengthy and frustrating period with noimprovement in his symptoms, he was at last offered an HIV test. The conditions most commonly treated early on in health seeking behaviour were malaria and typhoid. Not surprisingly , patients who were disillusioned with ineffectivetreatment turned to traditional methods as an alternative and it took them a long time todecide to return to the formal facility . This decision was also fuelled by a traditionalexplanation of diseases in the event of diagnostic failure in healthcare facilities: \" If someone suffers from Luo diseases, tests in the hospital do not show anything in the blood \". Hence, in contrast with reasoning delays in treatment with patients' lack of urgency (ability to seek healthcare), improved HIV-infection testing capacity , insufficient in theformal healthcare facilities, is required in order to detect more HIV infections in the earlystages of the disease. 2.3. TRADITIONAL TREATMENT Despite the predominance of the formal healthcare sector, traditional treatment was frequently used by the interviewed patients (a total of 72%), and remains an importanttreatment option in health seeking behaviour. The following description provides someinsight into the practices used and evaluates the conceptual interaction betweentraditional healers and the formal healthcare sector. Traditional treatment is provided by traditional healers (\"witch doctors\", herbalists, traditional midwives 51) and religious healers, mostly from independent churches Roho and Legio Maria. Traditional treatment involves drinking herbal infusions, licking dried herbs,using herbs for bathing, and superficial cutting of the skin and application of herbs.Spiritual healing includes praying, sprinkling blessed water over the patient, and drinkingblessed water. 50. District hospitals are at the top of of ailments,for example75This type of treatment is associated with the diagnosis of two different traditional diseases, chira and witchcraft52(more details on traditional treatment in Operational Report I). In support of the criticism of the culturalistic approach, none of the interviewed healers claimed to be able to treat or cure HIV/AIDS. On the contrary , they were very clear thatthis is the domain of the formal healthcare sector (\" hospital disease \", as they call it). Some of them, when they saw their clients' symptoms, even said they suggested to them thepossibility of HIV and referred them to the nearest healthcare facility . Therefore, in somecircumstances, the local culture works in collaboration with, rather than against, theformal medical institutions. III. CONCLUSIONS Racial and cultural stereotypes have been used from the early stages of HIV/AIDS control to explain the specifics of HIV distribution in Africa. Unfortunately , the sameprinciples are applied when healthcare providers struggle to explain poor access tomedical facilities providing HIV-related care. Through the example of the health seekingbehaviour of HIV patients who delay accessing HIV-related care, we see that culture,namely the traditional interpretation of symptoms and traditional treatment, is only a verysmall part of the problem in Homa Bay . In contradiction with common assumptionsregarding patient and community culture determining care-seeking and delayed treatment,long delays in accessing treatment were mostly due to the failure of the formal healthcaresector to diagnose these patients with HIV when they accessed health facilities earlier inhealth seeking behaviour. This example demonstrates the need to conduct a criticalevaluation of the provision of quality care in MSF's operational area. It also opens updebates on the pertinence of our perceptions of programme beneficiaries and ourassumptions regarding the cultural determinants of health seeking behaviours. A criticalapproach, based on evidence from the communities/beneficiaries but examined andanalysed impartially without cultural stereotyping, would enable the development ofeffective HIV/AIDS programmes. 52.

INTRODUCTION This paper is based on experience gained while conducting an anthropological study for M\u00e9decins Sans Bay . The HomaBay area, extending along Lake Victoria, has one of the highest prevalence rates ofHIV/AIDS in the country . Active in the area since 1996, MSF initiated a programme in2001 to deliver free Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) in a public health facility . Since then,MSF and the Ministry of Health (MoH) have enrolled more than 17,000 patients in theHIV/AIDS control programme organised at the district hospital and other decentralisedsites. Observing the barriers that local communities face in accessing care, the authors were entrusted with the task of exploring these issues and developing strategicrecommendations for future projects. Our distinctive position as researchers and outsidersbrought us close to the communities and their personal stories of living with HIV/AIDS.The objective of this paper is notto write about the daily struggles of patients, norto reflect on the insufficiency or unavailability of quality care but rather to reflect upon themicrocosms within the macrocosms, on agency and tactics that help people to cope notonly with the disease, but also with their dependence on medical institutions. PART 4 \"Social Navigation\" and HIV/AIDS Vanja Kova i * and Joan Amondi** * Medical Anthropologist, MSF France, Homa Bay, Mission Kenya ** Interpreter, MSF France, Homa Bay, Mission Kenya 792. A FINE BALANCE? Visiting patients in their homes allowed us to hear many different stories. A common and surprising trend we saw was that, while patients feel assisted by healthcare providersin terms of access to treatment, they also feel limited when it comes to making decisionsabout their own lives. This was to some extent corroborated by health workers who, whenI talked with them, said that HIV-positive patients are perceived as passive recipients of theprogramme who should question neither the benefits of treatment nor the medicalrecommendations. For the patients, however, treatments and their accompanying sideeffects and rigid medical recommendations often clash with the social reality of theireveryday lives and pose some of the most severe challenges. It is important to remember that as soon as people learn that they are HIV positive, not only do they embark on a life-long dependency on health facilities, but they are alsosubjected to an invasion of privacy that, to the best of our knowledge, does not occur tosuch an extent in the treatment of any other disease. Let us review the phrases usedregularly in therapeutic education sessions: \"prompt \"practicing safe sex\". What then is left to patients to makedecisions about? Their compliance with these recommendations is monitored constantlyand if they fail to do so, they are pressed into additional therapeutic education sessions to\"change their behaviour\" and act in accordance with the expectations of the healthfacilities. So, ultimately it is up to the healthcare providers to judge what is good and whatis bad, who will live and who will not - a chilling reality often present in the minds ofpatients. The efforts of the public health services to check the spread of HIV , especially in already ravaged communities such as Homa Bay , are indisputable. And it is alsoindisputable that the main focus of the healthcare providers is to improve and maintainthe physical health of their patients. However, other aspects of healthcare are not takeninto account in this approach, such as patients' emotional and social well-being. HIV-positive individuals now have long-term aspirations and these involve other people.Therefore, understanding and working with their social networks is crucial as this is oneof the main coping strategies for people living with HIV/AIDS. Striking a balance betweenthe demands of care workers and the expectations and personal and social space ofpatients is the subject of ongoing negotiation. 8081SOCIAL NAVIGATION Such negotiations have led patients to develop numerous innovative strategies we call \"social navigation\". We use this term to refer to the tactics that patients have developed tonavigate between adhering to medical recommendations, with as little risk as possible totheir lives and related responsibilities (preserving respect and social status, providingfinancial support to their families, safeguarding their marital relationships from conflict, etc). My research focused primarily on health seeking behaviours. Therefore, mention of issues of social navigation in interviews was muted. The quotes I present in this paperoften provide an indirect insight into the context, and therefore should be read with anopen mind. Yet, the examples below demonstrate the need for a broader approach in theway we envisage HIV/AIDS programmes. Needless to say , there is immense potential forfurther exploration of this topic and the results of such an exploration would provide uswith a greater understanding of the realities of people's lives. ADHERENCE Taking a drug everyday , twice a day , at exactly the same time, without fail, for the rest of your life; no need to be an expert in behavioural sciences to understand that this is anunrealistic expectation. Adherence to prescriptions was an issue that came up during myinterviews, most often in a hesitant, painful tone. Most of the people I interviewed wereterrified of being labelled \"defaulters\" (people who refuse to take drugs either partially orcompletely). Their observations that \"defaulters\" ended up dying \"before their time\" wereembedded to such an extent that they were reluctant to even start treatment. Notsurprisingly , this fear was also associated with the notion that the health facilities mightrefuse to provide ARVs to \"defaulters\". As per medical protocol, as soon as an individual is diagnosed as HIV-positive, prophylactic treatment should be started. However, many of my interviewees\"administered\" to themselves for some time before they felt ready to start treatment. Thisdecision, taken in order to avoid becoming \"defaulters\", gave them the time and the spaceto accept the overwhelming news of the test result, which led them to re-think theiroptions in life. During this period of \"acceptance\", they often return to the health facilityand get re-tested, making out it was their first test. This is triggered by a worsening oftheir symptoms or simply because they wish to get confirmation of their HIV-positivestatus as they are still dealing with intense feelings of denial. The period between the firsttest and starting treatment sometimes takes years, as demonstrated by the example of ayoung lady I talked to, who had waited five years. She described her experience: I have been tested three times (...). I had three (registration) cards, but I used to throw them away. (...). And earlier when I went for the test, I didn't start treatment right away (...).82Because I know somebody should not default. I saw somebody the other side (of the river). She was admitted and than she was given drugs, but she hid them. She didn't take the drugs; andthat lady has been already buried, she is already dead. And the second case of somebodydefaulting (I know), he was almost dying; but they have started giving him drugs again (...). Atfirst (testing) I was given the yellow card; I remember I was told by the counsellor , not to beworried or stressed even if I was found with it (HIV). And I was asked what will I do (ifpositive), and I was told (by the counsellor) whatever the results, she would like me to like mywork and not to be stressed. And to eat well. So what I did was buy juice, the commercial one.And all the time there was fruit in the house and I would eat (it). But all this time, (I took) notreatment, no drugs. Than I threw the yellow card away. The second time it was also like that...I threw it in the river . And than I decided... I was getting sick, but I would just buy some drugsat the junction here, or somebody would send me some drugs, like malaria, which would be like170 (shillings)... And than I got sick again... I had joint pains, and I used two blankets tocover myself and it went on just like that. Until the last one (time when sick) when a friendcame (to visit) and told me- now you need to go (to get treatment) (HIV-positive woman, Homa Bay , 9/8/2010). AFFORDABILITY Eating a \"balanced diet\" and \"working moderately\" also cause much pessimism and pondering within the community . The notion of \"balanced diet\", evoking perhaps the timewhen this was almost the only area patients could influence to try to prolong their lives,was interpreted as eating expensive food such as meat and fruit unavailable locally .Increased spending on food along with \"moderate working\" in the context of the fight forsurvival, were described as a threat to the existence of the community and were openlyopposed: Where we normally go for medication they tell us that we need to eat a balanced diet, we need to work in a temperate manner , not over-stretch; when we get such (information) somepeople get frustrated: how shall I survive? Now this may make us feel that in few years (from)now our community may be swept (away) (HIV-positive man, Homa Bay , 12/8/2010). SEX AND PARTNER INTIMACY Presuming there is no need for discretion in discussing intimate issues, the patient's sex life is talked about openly during therapeutic education sessions: with whom, how andhow often (the latter regulated by the number of condoms received during the previousvisit). The interviewees often stated that they would take condoms from health workers toavoid further discussion and claim they used them just to ensure the \"right\" box on theform was ticked. However, they would never consider actually using them. In the HomaBay community , condoms are closely associated with HIV infection. So practicing \"safesex\" is inseparable from unwanted disclosure. Lubricant is also believed to cause infertility83and pain in the lower abdomen. And sometimes using condoms is quite simply not an option, because the patient has decided to have children. DISCLOSURE The biggest problem by far is the assumption that HIV-positive individuals are willing and or able to disclose their HIV-positive status to their partners. The risks associated withdisclosure are considerable and often unpredictable and can lead to verbal and physicalabuse, neglect, withdrawal of financial support, and desertion. One of the intervieweesreflected on the complicated nature of talking to his partner: \"Maybe you are not with your wife (but with somebody else). She doesn't know where you are going, where are you walking... You don't discuss... It is difficult to come to her andexplain! How do you start? Maybe you were walking badly (misbehaving)... How do you start?(HIV-positive man, Homa Bay , 21/7/2010). Many of the interviewees did not disclose their HIV positive-status to anyone, including their partners or spouses. Those who did disclose often used a variety ofcommunication strategies that helped them reduce the aforementioned risks. Maleinterviewees in particular reported that they did not leave any room for discussion withtheir wives, but used more indirect strategies. They often left their health facilityregistration card (with the HIV-positive option ticked) in the house or in their clothes onpurpose so that their wives would find it when going about household chores like cleaningand washing. Interviewees from polygamous marriages have more options for social navigation since they can choose to disclose their positive status to just one wife. This removes the pressurefrom the healthcare providers: (\"Yes, I told my partner\") and gives them room tomanoeuvre regarding their marital affairs. This is the testimony of one of the intervieweeswho was open with his elder wife about his extramarital partners and HIV infection, butnot with the younger one: \"I told the elder wife (about my status), because I had told her earlier \"you know that I may bring you this disease (HIV)\"! And she is here (in the house) for so long, she cannot run awayfrom home. But if I tell the younger one there is a possibility that she will go away\" (HIV positive man, 16/7/2010; Homa Bay). The same person also suggested a solution to the care workers to enable them to provide the appropriate conditions that would facilitate compliance with the medicalrecommendations, i.e. full disclosure and use of condoms:84\"I have been waiting for these people from the mobile VCT to come, and they ought to come. If they come I will say to my (younger) wife - there is a mobile VCT , go and get tested! So thatis what I am voting for... The best way that people could be helped is if you could organize amobile VCT in a church or a school. You see, the elder wife knows, but the younger one doesn'tknow about my status. So with the mobile VCT she would know! I cannot break the news to herbecause she would suspect (that) I am the one who infected her . So then my wife would knowher status, I would say - let's now just start treatment and use preventive methods; let's justprotect all three of us. And then I could use the condom the way I was taught\". (HIV-positive man, Homa Bay , 16/7/2010). DISTORTING TRANSMISSION KNOWLEDGE After years of providing information to patients about HIV/AIDS, it is generally believed that the community uses medically-correct terms when discussing related issues.Despite sound knowledge regarding disease transmission, members of the communitysometimes choose to attribute their illness to other infectious agents, a decision that helpsthem avoid conflict within their family . One of my interviewees, a young girl married to amuch older man, was quite open about her extramarital partner. She assumed that he wasthe source of her HIV infection, but was reluctant to discuss it with her husband. Whenshe saw that her husband was falling ill, she chose the following strategy to encourage himto get tested: \"The period when I kept quiet (did not disclose) was maybe five years. When I was tested I didn't tell my husband directly. And when I came (home) with the Plumpy'nut my husbandasked (me)- what are those things? And I said - you see, when I went to the supermarket I wasgetting all these things... And I took these snacks. And even my husband ate it (Plumpy'nut)with me, because I couldn't say it was a medicine. I lied like that... The second time, I was sickagain. And I lied that I had a growth in my stomach and that I needed an operation. The thirdtime, I saw that the husband was also getting sick. Than I decided - now it is the time to reveal(the truth). First I told my husband - now , you need to go for a test, an HIV test. And myhusband said, \"No, I cannot go for an HIV test. You see, I am old... There is no way I wouldget it (HIV)!\" But the husband was getting sick, and I was getting stronger . So I was thinking -I cannot lie to my husband! I need to find a way to tell him (about my status) and ask him to gofor the test. So I told him these days, you see, these things (HIV) are not only transmittedthrough sex... Now you are saying, you are old... It is also transmitted through mosquitoes. Doyou remember your son (co-wife's son) was sick? So, the mosquitoes could have sucked hisblood and than sucked your blood. Now , this is a major disease. Even mosquitoes have it! So thehusband agreed to go for the test (HIV-positive woman, Homa Bay , 9/8/2010).853. CLOSING REMARKS These examples are by no means unusual. The patients' experiences illustrate that social navigation is an extremely powerful tool. It is obvious that patients do not onlyquestion the advice given to them at health facilities but, regardless of being labelled asuncooperative, they also choose for themselves what they want to put into practice (whatis \"good\" for them). This can be interpreted as undermining the supreme authority ofWestern medicine, or, serve as a reminder that sometimes it is difficult to decide what isthe best solution for an individual, despite the scientific and medical evidence. It is abundantly clear that the further away medical recommendations are from what is feasible for patients, the greater the non-compliance. In other words, what is the point ofhaving stringent recommendations that nobody adheres to? There is most definitely aneed to develop patient-centred care, a holistic approach that considers a patient not onlyas a person but also as a social being. However, it will be hard to develop care driven bypatient needs if the patients themselves are absent from the negotiating table. But that isanother question "}
