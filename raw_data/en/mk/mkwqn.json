Below you'll find my top tips for staying healthy and powering your innate immunity! All of the products below can be found on the [Balanced Natural Health Wellevate](https://wellevate.me/breanna-guan) and [Fullscript](https://us.fullscript.com/welcome/drbreannaguan). These are my recommendations please speak with your provider before starting any new supplements. If you want a personalized plan please contact Balanced Natural Health to set up a virtual appointment info@drbreannaguan.com My Top Recommendations for Immune Support 1. Vitamin C (I recommend liposomal vitamin C as its better absorbed and much more potent. I've stocked up on a liquid product so I can share it with the kids too). I'm using Quicksilver's Liposomal C. 2. Zinc, vitamin D and vitamin A These are my go-to viral support vitamins. I recommend having them regularly via your food. I increase the dose at the first signs of illness. If you want to set up an appointment to develop a personalized immune protocol [send an email to info@drbreannaguan.com for scheduling.](https://drbreannaguan.wpengine.com/contact/) 3. Astragulus I've added this to my soups because it is not only immune boosting also great for my more allergic child. You can buy this product as a tincture, capsule or root slices and use regularly to boost immunity! 4. Exercise! Great time to get started with the warmer weather (go easy if you're just getting started). Better circulation, inflammation levels, and mood all boost immunity, yea! Get stronger to keep your immunity stronger! 5. Vital Immune Biotics Probiotics especially aimed at supporting immunity. You can find this one on wellevate and fullscript. Made by Klaire Labs. I recommend taking it in the morning before food with water. 6. What do you use for cough syrup? I use English Ivy Syrup by Genestra a clean and healthy product, mild but great for children. Soothing to the throat and lungs for that cough that keeps you up at night. 7. Garlic, ginger, onions and orange veggies for immunity. Add mushrooms to give an extra boost as they increase your IgA- the first line of defense. Food is powerful medicine! 8. Commit to sleep Not only does it make your thoughts sharp and your eyes and skin aglow but it also reduces feelings of stress, Ahwwww! Sleep your way to wellness. How many hours will you give your precious body? More is better ; ) 9. Love Focus on that which you love. What you are enjoying and be in the moment. Get away from hysteria and drama and keep yourself nurtured with loving thoughts, actions and surround yourself with people you love. 10. Curcumin/Resveratrol You know I love curcumin but this product just raised the bar. Resveratrol and curcumin together to fight inflammation. Love this! Empirical Labs, Liposomal Curcumin and Resveratrol. 11. A final thought, avoid the sugar! Studies have shown that after ingestion of sugar immune response declines for about an hour's time!
