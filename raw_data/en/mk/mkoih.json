In fact, new age wellness has been gaining momentum in Western cultures since the 1970s. However, new age wellness travel is a much more recent trend. What is New Age Wellness Travel? New age wellness travel originates from both experiential and adventure travel. It embraces many longstanding holistic concepts. Excursions on new age wellness retreats include a variety of alternative wellness practices. These alternative wellness practices are designed to transform the individual. Often referred to as [transformative travel](https://www.transformational.travel/), new age wellness travel is catching wellness tourism by storm. New Age Wellness Philosophy New age wellness embraces holistic health concepts and alternative medicinal practices. It's \"a movement characterized by alternative approaches to medicine, spirituality, environmentalism and more.\" Believers support the notion that nature, humanity and all energies are unified in their existence. The new age wellness philosophy takes [ecofeminism](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/intersectional-environmentalist-ecofeminism) and [holistic medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-holistic-medicine#:~:text=Holistic%20medicine%20is%20a%20form,for%20optimal%20health%20and%20wellness.) to bring forth a well-rounded approach to self-care. This view of well-being sees both science and spirituality. New age wellness combines both studies to promote optimal health. Concepts in New Age Wellness At the same time, new age wellness concepts embrace alternative practices. These practices involve yoga, massage, crystal therapies and many others. The goal is to view health as being our normal and natural state. Moreover, our normal and natural state is reflective of proper balance. It is only when this balance is upset that illness appears. New age wellness and alternative practices seek to maintain and/or restore this balance. Alternative Wellness Practices at New Age Wellness Retreats Are you seeking transformative travel? Lucky for you, a number of alternative wellness practices are available today. Alternative practices at a new age wellness retreat may include chiropractic care, biofeedback and herbal medicines. That's not to say that new age wellness travel doesn't include additional activities. For example, [meditation retreats](https://vacayou.com/experiences/wellness/meditation-breaks) and [yoga escapes](https://vacayou.com/experiences/wellness/yoga-retreats) are commonly pursued by those seeking alternative wellness practices. Healing crystals and various types of massage therapies are included in many new-age spas. Guests at new age spas explore the healing powers of water, mineral baths and sensual aromatics.

Planning For a New Age Wellness Retreat When planning a travel excursion to a new age wellness retreat, you may want to consider more than just location and specific therapies. The alternative wellness practices previously mentioned highlight a destination's commitment to the new-age healing approach. This is good. In addition to the destination's wellness services, it is equally important to research the location. The Importance of Location Location, location, location and its surroundings are very important. Why? Geographical location and weather tend to affect a person's wellness. Take Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), for instance. A person with SAD probably will not benefit from a wellness retreat where the clouds are overcast and the windchill is -18 degrees Fahrenheit. To wrap it up, new age wellness acknowledges both unity and balance in everything. This is why natural surroundings can play a significant role in holistic health pursuits. Both unity and balance will offer opportunities for powerful transformations. But that is not to say that each may be quite different in nature.

While wellness travel has boomed during this time, an attraction to alternative wellness practices has as well.
