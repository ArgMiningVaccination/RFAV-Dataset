Clinical trials are key steps in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process. Participants can access cutting-edge therapies while playing a vital role in helping researchers develop new treatments. Use the FARE Clinical Trial Finder to simplify your search for research studies that fit your needs: - Fill out the filter menu below. Use keywords for a narrow search, or leave keywords blank for a broader search. - Click the Search Trials button. Matching trial summaries will appear at right. Select LEARN MORE to view details. - For more information, email or phone the site coordinator at the trial site nearest to you. - We strongly recommend that you consult with your healthcare provider about any trials that interest you and refer to our terms of service below. FARE Clinical Trial Finder searches studies listed on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health that provides information on publicly and privately supported human clinical studies in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., and in more than 190 countries and U.S. territories. For Patients All food allergy patients who can give informed consent themselves, or through a legal representative, are eligible to join the [FARE Patient Registry](https://www.foodallergypatientregistry.org). This U.S. focused research study invites patients to complete a series of surveys, sharing their de-identified (anonymous) food allergy experiences with the research community, helping to advance understanding of the disease. All data is stored and maintained in a secure, password-protected database, assuring the privacy, security and confidentiality of all personal information. Learn more and [register today](https://www.foodallergypatientregistry.org/component/comprofiler/registers.html) to help drive research forward. For Researchers Do you need volunteers or data for your clinical trial? Let the [FARE Patient Registry](https://www.foodallergypatientregistry.org) help you.

This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of APT-1011 3 mg administered HS (hora somni, at bedtime) for the induction of response to treatment (symptomatic and histologic) over 24 weeks. The open-label extension will continue to evaluate long-term safety in subjects who consent to continue on open-label treatment with APT-1011. - Accidental Reactions in Peanut/Tree Nut Allergic Children Food allergy is an immune reaction, triggered by food protein allergens, of varying severity, from mild local reaction to life threatening anaphylaxis and fatalities. Peanut is a plant from the botanical family of the Fabaceae, more commonly known as legumes. The prevalence of peanut and tree nut allergy is increasing. In France (ELFE cohort), it is estimated to 0.93%. The tree nuts include mainly almond, hazelnut, pistachio, cashew nut, walnut, pecan nut and Brazil nut. Allergy's prevalence is estimated to 0.54% in children up to 5.5 years. Peanut allergy is a main cause of anaphylaxis and deaths due to food allergy. Recurrence... - Acquisition and Long-term Observation of Patients With Severe Allergic Reactions The Anaphylaxis Registry aims to assess data in a standardized form about symptoms, triggers, cofactors and therapy management from patients who experienced an anaphylactic reaction. This should improve diagnosis and long-term management of these life-threatening allergic reactions. - Acutelines: a Large Data-/Biobank of Acute and Emergency Medicine Research in acute care faces many challenges, including enrollment challenges, legal limitations in data sharing, limited funding, and lack of singular ownership of the domain of acute care. To overcome some of these challenges, the Center of Acute Care of the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands, has established a de novo data-, image- and biobank named \"Acutelines\". Acutelines is initiated to improve recognition and treatment of acute diseases and obtain insight in the consequences of acute diseases, including factors predicting its outcome. Thereby, Acutelines contributes to development of personalized treatment... - Adjuvant Treatment With Abatacept to Promote Remission During Peanut Oral Immunotherapy This is a phase 2a, multi-center, randomized and double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing 24 weeks of abatacept versus placebo used as adjuvant to oral immunotherapy to induce remission in adolescents and adults with persistent severe peanut allergy. This is a proof-of-concept trial in which the primary outcome will be the suppression of the initial peanut specific IgE surge during OIT, which is used as a proxy outcome of peanut allergy remission. Adolescents and adults with persistent severe peanut allergy (n=14) will be randomized to either abatacept or placebo at a ratio 1:1 for a total period of 24 weeks. Peanut oral ... - A Hypoallergenicity Study on a New Rice-Based Hydrolysate Formula Cow's Milk Allergy (CMA) affects between 2-3% of young children but its severity varies between regions/countries. While the long-term prognosis for CMA is good, with the majority (80-90%) of children outgrowing their allergy by around 3-5 years. Breast feeding is the most optimal form of feeding for all infants, regardless of their condition, and in those with CMA maternal dairy exclusion is recommended as first line treatment. In non-breast fed or mixed feeding, a hypoallergenic milk substitute is recommended for young infants. The AAP and other societies such as EAACI and ESPGHAN considers a formula to be 'hypoallergenic' if at least ... - Allergy and COVID-19 Vaccines Prospective monocentric study designed firstly to estimate the proportion of patients who tolerated the continuation of the COVID-19 2nd injection (absence of anaphylactic manifestations). secondly, to know the proportion of definite anaphylactic reactions in cases of suspected anaphylaxis after the first administration of a COVID-19 vaccine the very complete allergological explorations with both the clinical side, skin tests and biological tests will allow us to highlight the responsibility or not of the components of the vaccine,in particular of the excipients (PEG2000, PS80 and tromethamine) in anaphylactic reactions to ... - Allergy and Immunology Natural History Study This protocol is a natural history study designed to evaluate subjects (and some family members) with suspected or identified genetic diseases of allergic inflammation or Immune Dysregulation. Patients determined by clinical history and outside evaluations to be of interest will be consented and enrolled into this study. Blood specimens, stored blood products and derivatives, saliva, hair, fingernail clippings, cord blood, umbilical cord, bone marrow, tissue biopsies and/or buccal swabs from such patients and/or their family members will be obtained for research studies related to understanding genetic and immunopathogenic bases of... - An Intervention Study to Improve Therapeutic Compliance in Adult Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis. In many chronic conditions adherence to long-term treatment is a challenge, also for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. Interventions, such as behavioral, educational and reminder interventions might improve treatment adherence. With this trial the investigators want to assess the effects of additional education in combination with more frequent follow up and patient reminders on adherence to treatment in adult patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. - A Registry for the Food Allergy Community The FARE Patient Registry will serve as a prospective, observational food allergy reporting system that stores detailed health and other basic information about patients' real-world experiences with food allergies, to encourage open sharing of de-identified data and participation in clinical trials. The FARE Patient Registry intends to make and support scientific discoveries by enabling the food allergy community to participate directly in research. "}
