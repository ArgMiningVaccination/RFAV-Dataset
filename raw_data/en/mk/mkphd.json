provides you with essential information about the courses offered at University College Maastri cht during the 201 7-2018 Academic Year. Courses are listed with a course title and a course code. The course code refers to the part of the College program me to which a course belongs and to the level of the course. Every course counts for 5 ECTS (Europea n Credit Transfer System), except Skills, that are 2.5 ECTS each and the UCM Capstone which represents 10 ECTS. A full study load consists of 30 ECTS per semester and 60 ECTS per academic year. Course code abbreviations The course code consists of three letters and a four digit number. These are the three letter abbreviations: COR Academic Core HUM Humanities SCI Sciences SSC Social Sciences SKI Skills PRO Project CAP Capstone UGR UCM Undergraduate Research The first digits of the four digit number in the course code indicate the level of a course: 1 = 100 0-level introductory courses (open to all students) 2 = 200 0-level intermediate courses (may have prerequisites) 3 = 300 0-level advanced courses (do have prerequisites) The four digit number of th e course code refers to the course number. UCM Undergraduate Research / MaRBle (UGR) , UCM Undergraduate Research / The Documentary and Applied Research & Internship Project Please note that UGR2001/3001 UCM Under graduate Research / MaRBle , UGR3002 UCM Und ergraduate Research / The Documentary and UGR3003 Applied Research & Internship Project are only open to students that have been accepted in to these courses . Prerequisites and recommendations A number of course descriptions include prerequisites or recom mendations.

Recommended It is strongly recommended not to take this course in your first or second semester. Objective To familiarize students with the philosophical foundations of the scientific method . Description of the course Starting from classical positions on the objectivity and methodology of science, such as those of logical empiricism and critical rationalism, the so -called historical and sociological turn in the theory of science, will be analyzed. Students will learn about the work of Kuhn, whose paradigm theory of science revolutionized thinking about scientific knowledge. Typical issues in this course are: what is the role of observation in science? What is a scientific explanation? What roles do theories and experiments play in science? What is the nature of scientific progress? Can we rationally decide between scientific viewpoints? Literature Chalmers, D. (1999). What is This Thing Called Science? E-reader .

Objectives To provide students with an understanding of the main trends in politics, demography, society and culture over the last 70 years and to put these trends in a global context. To develop a critical attitude towards the use of historical theory, and the interpretation of historical data and processes. Description of the course The course intends to trace back current situations to their historical backgrounds. T he first three tasks, under the caption \"Toolkit\", will therefore consist of a brief exploration of the philosophy of history and some issues regarding historical perspective, a discussion of the concepts of \"state\" versus 'nation' (in anticipation of issu es regarding decolonization, specific regional conflicts, and possible sources of conflict in general that will be discussed in later tasks) , and a discussion of the Cold War as an influential factor in recent history. Each of the following tasks, under t he captions of \"Area surveys\" and \"Assessment of the current global situation\" respectively, will be built around a case that represents the underlying problem, and both combined will lead students to specific source material. Examples of such cases are de colonization, the economic development of Asia, conflict in Africa, and the implications of the current position of the USA as \"solitary superpower\".

Hoye , Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Philosophy, m.hoye @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Core Fall/Spring 2 / 5 5 Prerequisite None. Objectives The course will provide an introduction to western political philosophy. Students will learn to analyse, discuss, and apply basic concepts in contemporary political philosophy such as justice, equality, liberty and community. Students will apply these core concepts to various local, national, and global political issues such as migration and global justice. Students will be trained in normative political argumentation. They will exercise their ability to debate contentious ethical issues of public life. Description of the course Politics is a complex and puzzling subject. If only taken at the ir word, It is difficult to understand why people act the way they do and believe the things they purport to believe in. As political philosophers we try to understand underlying conceptions and values that shape politics and which are used to justify conc rete policies. We are not concerned with what people claim to believe. Instead, we are concerned with how the language and concepts that people use comes to define who they are. In other words, we don't have ideas, ideas have us. Our task in this course is to understand those ideas. This course will provide an introduction to contemporary philosophical debates about core political concepts such as justice, liberty, equality, community, and democracy in modern liberal - democratic societies. Students will beco me familiar with the thought of some of the leading modern political philosophers, like John Rawls, Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, Philip Pettit, and Martha Nussbaum. Since conceptual analysis is the core business of philosophy, students will learn to analy se concepts, to clarify fuzzy moral ideas, and to make explicit the tensions and contradictions inherent to our political lives. Students will learn how to apply these concepts to current political debate and practice.

Prerequisite None. Recommended This course provides an introduction to theorizing and modeling. It is relevant for a wide range of other courses that are offered at UCM, but it does require some experience in academia. Therefore it is recommended that students take the course in their second, third, or fourth semester. Objectives To offer a broad overview of scientific models and modelling techniques in different disciplines. To teach students how to work with models in different academic fields. To teach students how to model a specific phenomenon by using general models and modelling techn iques. Description of the course The aim of the course is to familiarize students with model systems within the different disciplines of Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities. Models allow us to approach complex questions in systematic ways, for instanc e, by predicting weather conditions, the patterns of bird flight formations or the results of presidential elections. Such questions are present everywhere and it is through modelling that we can try to find some answers. Modelling helps us to break down w hat we are studying into variables, understand relations or correlations between them and even predict the future. The course starts with a short introduction to models, followed by several case studies that illustrate their usefulness in various contexts. Exposing students to models used both in academia and every -day thinking, the course fosters a thorough understanding of natural and social phenomena. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to link models to specific situations and examples from t heir daily -life. The final report allows students to use the knowledge gained in the course to analyse a phenomenon/situation of their own interest. This can be done either by conducting thought experiments, applying and redefining existing models or desig ning one's own model. The interactive lectures help students to gain a broad understanding of different kinds of modelling techniques. A special workshop is offered in order to trigger interests, thoughts and ideas and find ways of translating them into an individual and structured academic report .

Examination Assessment will be based on a mid -term exam, an exam in the final week, and a written assignment, consisting of a report, two peer reviews. Both exams consist of open questions. 10 11 Humanities (HUM) 12 HUM1003 Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies Course coordinator Dr. L. van den Hengel, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Centre for Gender and Diversity, l.vandenhengel@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concent ration Spring 4 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Objectives To introduce students to the foundational texts and formative debates that have shaped Cultural Studies as an academic field of inquiry. To familiarize students with key concepts, themes, and to pical debates within contemporary Cultural Studies. To introduce students to some of the central theoretical approaches within Cultural Studies, including critical theory, semiotics, material culture studies, gender theory, and critical posthumanism. To pr ovide students with the analytical skills to develop their own examination of cultural objects and processes. Description of the course Cultural Studies is a wide -ranging interdisciplinary inquiry into the ways in which contemporary culture, especially po pular culture, operates and functions. It explores how cultural processes and artefacts are produced, distributed, and consumed, and traces the diverse ways in which people shape and transform culture particularly in relation to issues of identity, differe nce, and power. In contrast to more traditional approaches to culture, Cultural Studies focuses not merely on 'elevated' cultural objects such as 'great' works of art and literature, but also - and primarily - deals with more mundane cultural phenomena. Ad dressing topics that range from fashion advertisements to Facebook, and from the iPhone to Lady Gaga, Cultural Studies zooms in on seemingly familiar, yet highly complex, practices of everyday life. This course introduces you to the key thinkers, topics, and critical frameworks in Cultural Studies. It starts with some of the foundational texts and formative debates within the field, most notably the work of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, and Stuart Hall, associated with the Frankfurt S chool and Birmingham School respectively. Subsequently, we will take a closer look at several topical debates and conceptual approaches within contemporary Cultural Studies. We will address themes such as consumer culture, advertising, and social networks; the power and politics of representation; material culture and identity; cultural performances of gender; and the transnational cultural flows of globalization. By reading the work of major theorists such as Zygmunt Bauman, Henry Giroux, and Joanna Zylins ka, you will familiarize yourself with a variety of critical approaches to cultural theory. Lastly, by looking at the interrelated topics of posthumanism, art, and technoscience, the final tasks of the course will explore some of the most stirring debates within Cultural Studies today, setting out new directions for the future development of the field.

Objective To teach students how to \"think philosophically\". Description of the course One of the greatest and most influential Ancient philosophers, Aristotle of Stageira (384 -322 BC) once remar ked, \"Wonder is the beginning of philosophy\". What he was referring to is our habit of asking fundamental questions about our every -day life, such as, \"Suppose I am certain that I am right about something, what is that certainty based upon?\"; \"Suppose I am engaged in a discussion with someone (for example about some controversial matter), what can objectively guarantee the stringency of my argument?\" Thinking about and discussing such questions will force us to reconsider the things we have always taken f or granted. And ultimately they will lead us to more fundamental questions about the proper nature of Truth and Knowledge as such. Assignments during the course include the following: the nature of philosophical enquiry, problems of knowledge and truth ( including the understanding and evaluation of arguments), ethics.

C.H. van Rhee, Faculty of Law, Foundations and Methods of Law remco.vanrhee@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Objectives To provide students with a better notion of law as a ha rmonising phenomenon in European culture. To provide students with a basic notion of similarities and differences in the approach to law in the vario us member states of the European Union (and the USA). To give students a better understanding of basic lega l notions such as property, contract and delict. To provide students with a greater ability to evaluate the significance of the transfer of law making powers from the national to the European institutions. Description of the course What do Europeans have i n common? Part of the answer to this question is: their law. Currently, approximately 50% of all new legislation in the member states of the European Union has a non -national, European origin. This international outlook of law in Europe is not a new phenom enon. Even when concentrating on the so -called 'national laws' of the various European nations, it must be admitted that these laws find a strong foundation in a non-national, truly European tradition. Th is tradition dates back to the Middle A ges. Since it is the conviction of the course coordinator that a true understanding of the growing importance of the European institutions and policies can only be achieved by understanding the common legal history of Europe, the present course concentrates on this sh ared (legal) past. In doing so, it takes as its focal point the ius commune , i.e. the common, scholarly European approach to the law that originated in the Middle A ges and that was strongly based on Roman Law. This medieval tradition forms the common groun d on which the present national legal systems in Europe have developed. It has strongly contributed to the creation of the idea of a common European culture. In a manner that is highly relevant for an audience of non -lawyers and lawyers alike, the course s tarts with discussing Roman Law. The so -called Corpus Iuris Civilis will be used as the point of departure since most of what we know about Roman Law derives from this compilation of legal materials that was made in the 6th century AD on the orders of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. The texts that this emperor included in his collection were the product of a thousand years of unbroken legal development. During this millennium, roughly from 500 BC to 550 AD, Rome expanded from a small city -state to a world empire. While Roman law was adapted to cope with the changing society, the idea was maintained that it was essentially the same law that had been part of the early Roman way of life. The course will also concentrate on the different approach to the law tha t existed and still exists in Anglo -American jurisdictions. It will try to explain the legal differences today between continental Europe and the British Isles. Additionally, some elements of American legal history will be studied. In doing so, the many similarities that lie beneath the seemingly radically different outward appearance of law in Anglo -American jurisdictions will come to light. This exercise will demonstrate that Anglo -American law is not so different from continental European law as some wri ters would like us to believe. The course will conclude with a study of a selection of similarities and differences that exist in today's European legal landscape. Literature O.F. Robinson, T.D. Fergus, W.M.

Rausch , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, christoph.rausch@ maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Objectives To provide students with an advanced introduction to the visual and performing arts. To broaden the students' theoretical understanding of art. Description of the course The traditional term for the many ways in which artworks represent reality is mimesis. The mimetic talent for imi tation and representation has been the subject of admiration, study and debate throughout the history of Western art. The notion of mimesis is employed to describe painting, literature, music, theater, dance, and more; it is still used to characterize the domain of the arts in general. In engaging with the concept of mimesis, this course focuses on three central themes and approaches. The first part of the course is concerned with representations of reality in nineteenth and early twentieth century literatu re, painting, and music. The second part deals with modern and contemporary performance art. The academic field of Performance Studies is introduced in an attempt at dealing with the blurring of genres, cultures and conventions that are typical for contemp orary art shaped by mass media and processes of globalization. The third and last part of the course discusses sociological perspectives on art as a social practice and a collective activity. This course, through its emphasis on representations, performanc es and interactions, constitutes a basis for courses on the arts in all their diversity, as well as courses on culture in general. The course includes a practical exercise in stylistic representation at the Charles Nypels lab, the print workshop of the Jan van Eyck Academy ( http://www.janvaneyck.nl/en/labs/charles -nypels -lab).

Weusten , Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Centre for Gender and Diversity, josje.wesuten @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Objectives To analyze pop songs and poems in depth. To explore the theory of the lyric. To integrate gender and diversity into the study of the lyric. To become familiar with a number of classic Anglo -American poems and influential pop songs. Description of the course This course i s based on the following textbook: Helen Vendler. Poems, Poets, Poetry: An Introduction and Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2009 (ISBN three respects we shall amplify Vendler's book: First, by reading some of the theory on the lyric by literary theorists and pop music theorists. As an academic, you must learn to read theory from firsthand sources. Second, by applying all of the chapters of Vendler's book to modern songs. Songs are also poems, although they are nev er considered in the conventional histories of poetry and in lyric theory. This is a strange omission, for not only do the \"lyrics\" of songs show all properties of poetry, the music of the song can also be seen as an exteriorization or enhancement of the m usical element of language, emphasized in \"regular\" poetry through the use of rhyme, rhythm, structure, and images. The lack of attention to the pop song in books on poetry makes these books a bit outdated. Aim of this course is to give the theory of poetr y a new life, by reconnecting it with the song. Finally we will amplify Vendler's book by focusing on gender, ethnicity and sexuality as relevant categories of analysis in the study of poetry and song. There are significant differences in the ways in which male and female poets and singers express themselves: differences in themes, in the intertextual universes poets/singers choose to position themselves, in the use of genre, in forms of addressing the reader. We will address the question how gender, ethnic ity and sexuality could be integrated into the theory of the lyric. Literature Primary sources (poems and songs) Vendler, H. ( 2009 ).

Stout , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , mark.stout@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Objectives To provide students with an overview of the conc ept of Europe and the development of European identity. To highlight the specific characteristics of European political/social/cultural history, notably in comparison with that of other (non -European) societies, that contributed to a sense of European comm unity and the European identity. To demonstate how a sense of community could evolve from the many shared historical cultural factors. To provide students with an introduction to a range of theories which are fundamental to a range of courses at UCM. Desc ription of the course This course deals with some of the most fundamental questions concerning the development of the European Identity. What have been the decisive common experiences that have fostered a sense of European community and identity, and how h ave they evolved over time? Tracing those events and experiences in the past that have helped to shape some sense of European community and identity means establishing the factors that have contributed to the difference between Europe and the non - European world. The concept of identity logically consists of two components: the notion of historical continuity and a marked sense of difference between the \"in -group\" and one or more significant others. If we accept that there is some sort of European identity, albeit complex and multifaceted, we should ask which factors have generated it. To put it more specifically: Which factors contributed to Europe's Sonderweg in world history? Or, to use the words of one author, the historian E.L. Jones: how did \"the Europe an miracle\" come about? From the angle of world history, the European experience constitutes a major deviation from an almost universal pattern of social and political organization. Europe is the first region in the world that has changed into a large -scale industrial and urban society. This so called process of modernization has turned European civilization into something of a historical anomaly - the kind of anomaly, however, that forced itself on other continents, thus becoming a new kind of standard in the end after all. To ask for the factors that have contributed to the modern sense of European community and identity is, at least for a large part, to ask for the factors that have produced this phenomenon of modernization, including the blatant economi c disparities between European civilization (including North -America) and the rest of the world.

To acquaint students with a basic understanding of periodization in literary history. To acquaint students with basic concepts in literary theory. To enable students to apply theoretical concepts to their readings of novels. Description of the course For centuries, the body of work r eferred to as 'literature' would first of all entail drama and poetry. But in the course of the nineteenth century, the novel took flight. As its name testifies, the novel was a new genre. But what exactly is a novel - Virginia Woolf described it as 'the m ost pliable of forms'? Why did it become such a dominant genre? Some have argued that the novel was so successful because it became the medium of the middle class, and the vehicle of its emancipation. To be sure, the novel helped shaping ideas about modern society, about what an individual is or can be, about self and other, about love, sex, marriage and property. But even if all those functions can be attributed to the 19th century novel, can the same be said about the 20th century novel? How did the novel as a genre change over time? This course will address these and other questions, first and foremost by reading primary texts - key novels from the Western tradition - from 1850 onwards. You will read novels by, for instance, British, Dutch, Belgian, Fren ch, German and American authors. The reading and discussion of the primary works is the main objective for this course. Besides that, the course will introduce you into the scholarly analysis of literary works. It will acquaint you with major developments in the history of Western literature since 1850, and provide you with a vocabulary/toolkit to discuss and analyse novels. You will gain experience in reading, analyzing and writing about literature. Literature 6 novels: Gustave Flaubert - Madame Bovary (1 857) (French). Franz Kafka - The Metamorphosis (1915) (German).

Brunotte, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Centre for Gender and Diversity, u.brunotte@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities Prerequisite Interest in historical research and critical theoretical reflection . Objectives To acquaint students with a critical perspective on modern, mostly European history and the 'dialectic of Enlightenment', that means to show how the achievements of Enlightened ideals etc. were intertwined with colonialism, the 'Jewish question', gender and class ineq ualities... To acquaint students with cultural construction and historical configurations of 'race', class, gender and sexuality from the Enlightenment until the Shoa/Holocaust. To acquaint students with the way these categories of difference were conceptu alized and interconnected, and how they were sometimes newly invented in science, philosophy and social theory. To acquaint students with the way in which these configurations like gender, race and religion have structured cultural scripts and practices, s tereotypes, individual identities, and European and North American developments, like slavery. To acquaint students with the way in which such intersecting categories of difference have constituted (and still constitute) inequalities and differences of pow er, resulting in invisibility, restricted access to sources etc . Description of the course Starting from recent debates and problems like new nationalism, misogyny, political homophobia, Islamophobia and Xenophobia... this course offers a historical inquiry into the construction and development of cultural 'differences' marked through categories like gender, sexuality, class, 'race', and religion from the eighteenth century until the Holocaust. Through historical case studies, philosophy and literature it loo ks at the way in which Western identity -discourses and its colonial subcode have formed dichotomies like self and other, black and white, the Orient and the West, male and female, worker and bourgeois, hetero - and homosexual, and how these differences beca me social inequalities. From a critical theoretical perspective it will reconstruct the paradoxes of a 'dialectic of Enlightenment', that means the dark side behind its claim for reason, equality, brotherhood and freedom. It aims, firstly, to trace and ill ustrate the ways in which the Enlightenment has provided a rationale to mark gendered, classed and racialized boundaries in science which, more often than not, resulted in inequalities. These inequalities became embedded in European society in such a way t hat the active, dominant subject came to be seen as 'white, male, and middle class.' Moreover, this dominance grew beyond 'Europe' and helped to carry out the imperial project. The centrality of empire discursively and materially forged a 'European -ness' t hat was distinctively gendered, classed and racialized. With the help of a literary analysis (Joseph Conrad \"Heart of Darkness\"), the course demonstrates how classical European nationalism and colonialsm (slavery) were gendered and racialized. Secondly, t he course will introduce into critical theories, like discourse analysis and the history of knowledge (Michel Foucault), postcolonial and gender/sexualitiy studies and studies on Orientalism (Scott, Said). Thus, it will examine the dynamic processes of the \"history of sexualities\", their formation and contradictions, which emerged out of these processes. We will heed our attention to some of the salient ways in which women and men of the different classes and 'races' became embedded in social relationships, thereby often transgressing taken -for-granted lines of differences. Last but not least, we will ask how colonial and anti -Semitic discourse, stereotypes of the 'external Other' and stereotypes of an 'internal European Other' (the Jews etc.) were intertwin ed and how we can better understand the Holocaust from a historical perspective.

Doorman, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Ph ilosophy, doorman@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities Prerequisite None, however, this course is not suitable for students in their 1st year. Objectives To provide students with a historical and philosophical introduction to Enlightenment and Romanticism. To understand these periods as opposed worldviews in social, philosophical, scientific and political perspective. To understand how much our life and culture is structured by enlightened and romantic views. Description of the course The debate between Enlightenment and Romanticism has an enduring impact on discussions of today in art, politics, science, human identity and social values. This course is a systematical introduction to these two, formative, opposed intellectual traditions. First, a historical context will be presented to the political and ideological ambitions of the Enlightenment (enlightened despotism, the court of Frederick the Great, the diffusion of the Enlightenment). Secondly the opposed appr oach to 'Nature' will be introduced; the influence of Newton, the rise of modern science, the Encyclop\u00e9die vs. Romantic science (e.g. Goethe's criticism on Newton's Theory of Colour) and the role of the arts in the new approach to Nature. Then, the changes in the visual arts will be treated, illustrating continuity and discontinuity in cultural history (Romanticism and Neo -Classicism).

Recommended HUM1007 Introduction to Philoso phy. Objectives To provide students with a basic introduction to ancient Greek philosophy; To teach students how to explore the meaning of philosophical texts by situating them in their historical contexts; To explore how our culture, and we as part of it, has been shaped by these ancient thinkers. Description of the course Why would anyone choose to study philosophers who lived and wrote (more than) two millennia ago? One obvious answer is: to learn about one's roots; to better understand Western culture a nd heritage. Up to this day, the ancient Greeks and Romans constitute a major influence on our ideas about critical thinking, about the fundamental character of Reality, about Science, Ethics, and Art, and last not least: about what it is to be human and a bout what it means for humans to flourish, to live truly good lives. Ancient philosophy provides an inexhaustible source of inspiration for contemporary philosophy. \"The European philosophical tradition\", the philosopher Whitehead once remarked, \"consists in a series of footnotes to Plato\". Slightly overstated, but not untrue. In this course we will return to the sources and study the texts that helped us become who we are today. We will study a range of canonical philosophical texts from Antiquity, rangin g from the Ionian Philosophers of Nature to Aristotle. Although we will attempt to position these treatises in their historical and geographic contexts, our main concern will be: what have these ancient thinkers still to say to us today? One warning: even if you have some prior knowledge of ancient Greek philosophy, that doesn't make this an easy course. Only choose this course if you are genuinely interested in reading ancient philosophical texts that do not always yield their secrets easily. Literature Required Copleston, F.C. (1993 [1962]).

Recommended HUM1011 Introduction to Art; Representations, Performances and Interactions. Objectives To study historical and theoretical approaches to modern and contemporary art. To enable critical reflection an d debate on the meaning and relevance of artistic practices. To learn how to write an art review. Description of the course Since the late 19th century and certainly up until the mid -20th century artists have issued avant -garde manifestoes of change, claim ing their art to be ahead of the times. Critical of conventions and traditions, they regarded art as a revolutionary means to social, political, cultural, and intellectual emancipation and progress. Through what has been called the \"shock of the new,\" by m aking tabula rasa with the existing, art was to create a better world. Were it not for the fact that art effectively served the ideologies of both the socialist and fascist totalitarianisms of the last century, such radical ambitions might even sound a bit na\u00efve, nowadays. Indeed, as yesterday's future has become today's past, the utopias of a bygone era seem to have been disappointed, at last - or have they not? Do we need to rescue avant -garde virtues and ideals for the sake of the relevance of contempora ry art? What precisely is the legacy of the modern avant -garde besides its success on the global art market? In the early 21st century and under the spell of a \"new spirit of capitalism\", is there any hope left for effective artistic critique? Or does the current \"economy of enrichment\" simply reduce the value of art to a financial speculation tool? This course considers histories and theories of modern and contemporary art. It provides an overview of the heterogeneous and experimental development of modern and contemporary art. Artistic responses to society, politics, science, and technology are discussed. A further emphasis is on the practices governing institutions of the contemporary art world, such as art markets and museums. The course features a visit to the Bonnefanten museum in Maastricht, as well as a studio visit and debate with an artist in residence at the Jan van Eyck Academy in Maastricht.

Description of the course The course reconstructs the main ideas of some of the most influential philosophers of the 2 0th century: Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 -1951), Martin Heidegger (1889 -1976), Hannah (1906 - 1975), Michel Foucault (1926 -1984), Jacques Derrida (1930 -2004) and J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1929). Their ideas are partially the result of the practical turn within p hilosophy initiated in the 19th century by Karl Marx (1818 -1883), S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813 -1855), Sanders Pierce (1839 -1914). So, elaborating on their work during the past century many philosophers took practical issues as the starting point of their philosophy. This course tries to figure out what these practical issues are and how they are related to their theoretical ideas. Moreover, the course addresses the link between the work of these philosophers and the so cietal context and discusses its heuristic value. Literature E-reader .

This course focuses on cultural difference and identity in an era in which the nation see ms to lose its unifying significance in matters of personal identity and group identity formation. It seeks to analyze how globalization influences identity and culture and the ways in which these interact with social differences such as gender, ethnicity, religion and nationality. Its orientation is both practical and theoretical. Students will become acquainted with different theories of globalization and culture such as Hybridization (Nederveen Pieterse), McDonaldization (Ritzer), and the Clash as Orientalism (Said), Occidentalism (Margalit and Buruma), and Multiculturalism.

The focus will be on the Latin West. The course aims to provide a critical approach to a selection of medieval topics , including The development of education in the Middle Ages. The position and influence of Christianity in the Middle Ages. Philosophy in the Middle Ages. Literary works of the Middle Ages. Science in the Middle Ages. Magic and witchcraft in the Middle Age s. Description of the course For many of us, even medievalists, the Middle Ages are still somewhat of a mystery. On the one hand we tend to identify the Middle Ages with a dark period in history, which does not have a lot to offer us culturally or intellec tually. Yet we are also fascinated by this period, and quite enjoy many of the artefacts that have been handed down to us. In this course we will try to unravel some of the mysteries of the Middle Ages. We will try to understand how and why this period has become such a source of bewilderment: we shall pay attention to 'typically medieval' phenomena, but also look at the reception of the Middle Ages in retrospect. We will critically evaluate the presuppositions about the Middle Ages and show the continuity of intellectual developments in Antiquity, the Middle Ages and the present . Literature Martha L.

Objective The aims of this course are t o familiarize students with topics relevant for digital culture and society such as: Different uses of digital media in the fields of netactivism, gaming, digital literature and digital art. The relation between technological development and user practices as e.g. hacking, sharing practices, quantified self. Introduction to information politics. Description of the course Students in this course will be introduced into the broad field of digital media and discuss in detail computer based practices (both from literature from the humanities and qualitative social sciences). The topics discussed range from transformations in our digital cultures based on technological developments to artistic practices in digital literature and art. While popular debates usually focus on general discussions on the impact of digital media, this course will deal with the complexity, history and diversity of our contemporary culture. Over the course of the past decades digital devices have become omnipresent in Western society. Ever y day we type on computers, make calls with our mobile phones, log in to numerous websites and social networks. Perhaps more importantly, we are able to keep extensive, precise records of our everyday lives. From internet cookies to video camera surveillan ce feeds, along with the information users, companies and governments store in clouds, more and more data is generated and archived. In the digital age, information circulates faster and faster, sometimes without the knowledge of the parties from which the data originate. The consequences have been differently valuated. The optimistic account stresses the new media's inherent possibilities for active cultural and social participation beyond the reach of existing political or commercial institutions. Liberat ion is a term discussed when we follow discussions about the use of social media to support processes of democratisation. When we investigate the use and abuse of user data and surveillance strategies both from governments and marketing institutions explo itation of users is central in the debate. We willingly help to spread information on social media, often without an awareness of the information politics involved. T he cultural transformations of and through new media technologies, the impact they have on their users and the politics of information that form the basis of both exploitation and liberation will be investigated in this course . The course will be structured as follows: 1. Transformations: new vs. old media, users and non -users. 2. Networking: sharing practices, privacy and surveillance, activism, hacking. 3.

Objective s To introduce students to a number of central themes in the philosophy of med ia and technology. To investigate what is at stake in different philosophical methodologies and approaches to media and technology Description of the course Discussions about the changes media and technology bring to culture, and whether these are to be judged good or bad, are as old as philosophy itself. Media and technology have always had their 'apocalyptic', critics and their 'utopian'apologists. Examining the ideas of Plato, Kierkegaard, and Marx we will see how these debates have evolved over the cent uries. With the rapid development and spread of media and technology in the 20th and 21st century, the debate between these two parties has intensified. Yet we are now beginning to realize that these overarching approaches have limited value when it comes to evaluating media and technology. In this course, we will concentrate on a number of philosophical approaches that help us understand the relationship between media and technology and our lived exeperience. We will discuss media theory (McLuhan, Innis , Ong, Kittler) and discuss whether specific technologies and media, like writing and print, provoke structural changes in patterns of thought, action and experience. We will also deal with the critical philosophies of technology in the Marxist tradition (Marcuse), the metaphysical tradition (Heidegger) and the feminist tradition. These topics encourage us to discuss whether the machines that are supposed to serve us, are now turning the tables on us, making us humans their servants. Is technology alienatin g us from life and from our humanity? We will then move on to present day philosophy of media and technology that steers away from essentialist condemnations or praises of technology and media. We will address the work of Don Ihde and Peter Paul Verbeek on technological mediation and the hermeneutics of technology. We will examine work that examines the moral aspects of emerging technologies. We will conclude by examining the role that robotics and alogrithms play in organizing our sociotechnical world.

Swinnen, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Literature and Arts, a.swinnen@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Humanities Prerequisite At least one Humanities course . Objectives To understan d the way in which visual culture is conceptualized in relation to its disciplinary, historical, and theoretical context. To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different theories of visual culture. To select the appropriate theor(ies) and methodologi cal tool(s) for analysis that best suits the material and argument. To communicate the way in which different approaches to visual culture mobilize disciplinary points of view using specialized terms. To demonstrate awareness of the larger social, politica l, and sexual issues involved in the academic study of visual culture as it relates to the body/subjectivity. To recognize the interdisciplinary nature of visual culture in its historical and contemporary overlap with scientific, artistic, and economic ima ginaries. Description of the course This course will explore the variety of visual cultures and the theoretical insights garnered by the study of this interdisciplinary field. Straddling cultural studies, art history, museum studies, media studies, perform ance studies, literary studies, and science studies, the field of visual culture at its most expansive combines theories and methods from across the academy. We will investigate visual cultures from these exciting and challenging (inter)disciplinary perspe ctives. The course presents visual culture as a ubiquitous facet of modern life that perhaps more than any other component shapes and informs our understanding of self, society, and the world. Hence, it demands our careful attention and critical parsing of its workings at all levels of daily life. Our foray into the field will include examining the benefits of this inclusive mode of analysis, for instance in the range of objects available for study, as well as the drawbacks, particularly in terms of methodo logical rigor and the overinvestment in ocularcentric forms of knowledge. The student will be invited to scrutinize their disciplinary assumptions, to develop their toolbox of concepts, and to analyse objects that are rarely considered inside the universit y. Starting with an introduction to visual culture, we'll investigate the terms vision, visuality, and image in conjunction with varying conceptualizations of culture. Each subsequent unit will deal with a \"site\" of visual culture that offers an object of study, a theoretical problem, and an interdisciplinary opportunity. We will study visual cultures from high to low, and examine how these forms are quickly transforming and breaking barriers of category and genre. The principle sites of inquiry traverse f ashion, gaming, museum exhibitions, medical imaging, comics, and cinema. The methods from visual culture studies we will experiment with include cultural materialism, psychoanalysis, semiotics, poststructuralism, narratology, phenomenology, affect theory, feminism and cultural analysis. Key theorists include Hal Foster, Raymond Williams, Susan Bordo, Fredric Jameson, John Berger, Martin Jay, Vivian Sobchack, Richard Dyer, Mieke Bal, M.J.T Mitchell, Amelia n Dijk.

Objective To introduce students to the history of philosophical thought concerning language, including the implications of several important theories abo ut language for how we think about knowledge and the possibility of making judgements . Description of the course The philosophy of language is concerned with the role that language plays in thinking, or more specifically: knowing. As such it is closely rel ated to epistemology and philosophic theories on truth. But ultimately, the role of language also turns out to be essential when we make the transition from judgements about the world to moral judgements, i.e. judgements that express how we should act with in that world. In this course we will show you how the study of language has been at the focus of interest of philosophers throughout the history of philosophy, and that the way in which the function of language is interpreted, is intimately connected with a philosopher's world view in general. We shall specifically pay attention to the philosophers Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein, but shall also touch upon the works of a variety of other philosophers, such as William of Ockham, David Hume and Immanuel Kant . We shall explore the fundamental properties of language that allow it to be a medium of thought and knowledge. Among these properties are truth, meaning and reference, notions that are closely linked together in what is often called the 'triangle of lang uage'. Developing the skills of thinking philosophically about language will have an impact beyond the immediately related philosophical topics. You will become a more powerful thinker, better prepared to make important decisions and less susceptible to b eing tricked and manipulated by others. Literature William G. Lycan, G.

Objectives To provide an introduction into the social studies of scie nce, society and technology. To provide a basis for a critical reflection on our high -tech society. Description of the course While modern culture relies heavily on sophisticated instruments, techniques, and systems, most people think that the actual ma king of science and technology is the exclusive domain of scientists, inventors, engineers, and technicians: people who are fascinated by \"how things work\" and \"making things work\". Those not directly involved in the design or development of science and technology (\"users\" or \"consumers\") are thought to have little interest in the facts, materials, principles, or procedures found in the world of scientists and technicians. The only thing they seem to care about is the use of the scientific output and techno logy. However, people who do not spend much thought on the making of science and technology commonly do not merit its use serious reflection either. Once things have been made or discovered, our interaction with them is understood to be a straightforward m atter. We pick up our mobile phone, make some funny pictures with it, listen to music, twitter some details about what we do and where we are and chat with our friends. We board an airplane, fly from point A to point B, and then we get off the airplane. Al though we are surrounded by the results of scientific endeavor and technologies of various kinds, they have become almost invisible and we take them for granted. However, we live in a technological culture. Technology and science shape society, from the shaping of mobility patterns and gender and sexual identities, to the standardization of practices in health care. Mobile phones have changed what it means 'to be alone'; organ transplantation has redefined our understanding of life; 'scientific planning' h as reshaped our policy -making practices. Technologies do not merely assist us in our everyday lives; they are also powerful forces acting to reshape our activities and their meanings. There is, vice versa, a cultural influence on science, technology too. T hus we can only hope to understand science and technology when we acknowledge their socio -cultural base. Historical and comparative studies have shown how different socio -cultural circumstances yield very different forms and contents of science and technol ogy. Science and technology are, finally, also cultures themselves. In this course we will analyze techno -science as a socio -cultural phenomenon. This course offers an introduction to Science and Technology Studies (STS). It will introduce you to the multi ple ways in which science and technology, individuals and institutions mutually shape one another to the benefit and sometimes detriment of society. In this course, we take a \"critical\" approach to science and engineering. By this, we don't mean being nega tive about science nor technology. But like a good movie critic, you will think critically but constructive about aspects of science and technology by focusing on different empirical domains such as human enhancement (e.g. Google glasses, Ritalin, Blade ru nner], disasters [e.g. Fukushima, Hurricane Katerina], the gene revolution (Monsanto) and the politics of artifacts (e.g. park benches, the UCM building and nuclear plants) while using a set of principles and approaches from the field of Science and Techno logy Studies .

Recommended HUM1014 Great Novels 1850 - Present, HUM2022 Digital Media and HUM3036 Narrative Media. Objective s To reflect upon the distinctive features of the contemporary literary field by reflecting critically on the salient themes and forms of contemporary (Anglophone) fiction; To introduce students to academic debates on translation and postmodernism, print an d post -print media ecologies, human rights and global war, and environmental problems including climate change; To familiarize students with concepts such as world literature, post -postmodernism, intermediality, anthropocene and petroculture; To introduce students to relevant methodological insights that will enable them to process and respond to current debates in literary studies and contemporary society. Description of the course This course examines the multifaceted character of literature at the start of the twenty -first century. As many commentators have argued, the basic features of literary culture seem to be changing. In a world of screens and e -readers, does literature still coincide with print or has it become a more expansive notion that overlap s with other media? Should our conception of literature include the 'quality tv' associated with HBO, for instance? At the same time, contemporary society is changing rapidly too. We now live in a world shaped by Big Data, the war on terror and climate cha nge. That is why the course does not just explore changes in the field of literature but also investigates how fiction is responding to new social questions. Literature continues to plays a vital role in public debate, after all, serving 'as an \"antenna\" . .. for a range of opinions, attitudes, and intuitions that have not yet fully congealed in public discourse' , as Caren Irr puts it ( Toward the Geopolitical Novel , 15). More specifically, the course addresses the following themes: 1) translation and the spatial boundaries of contemporary literature, 2) the afterlife of postmodernism and the turn toward history a nd memory, 3) the intense interaction between literature and other media, especially the internet and 'quality' television, 4) the fictional reflection on war, terror and human rights, 5) literature's response to species extinction and climate change. In t he final analysis, all of these topics deal with the future or with different imagined futures, be that the future of English, the future of the past, the future of writing, the future of human communities, and the future of the environment. Differently pu t, they examine different 'ways of being we', to use a phrase from Peter Boxall's introduction to contemporary literature (177). These topics are the subject of this course.

Rulof, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, History, bernard.rulof@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Humanities Prerequisites At least two courses in the field of history. Recommended (for example): HUM1013 The Idea of Europe: The Intellectual History of Europe or HUM2007 States and Nations in Europe, from the Middle Ages to the First World War. Objectives To offer an introduction to the discipline of Urban History. To stud y the history of the urban phenomenon in Europe since the Middle Ages until today . Description of the course Today, more than half of the world population lives in what is commonly described as cities and towns - concepts which are often vaguely defined. From the first settlements in Mesopotamia onwards, the rise of urban communities has had a great impact upon human life. Consequently, the urban experience draws, and will continue to draw, attention amongst policy makers, scientists from a wide array of d isciplines, artists, etc. Urban history is a field of study that aims to answer some basic questions about the nature of European urbanised societies. This particular 'branch' of History often tends to be multidisciplinary. At least four major approaches e xist: a focus on the urbanisation process, urban biography (the history of a particular place), a third approach that deals with numerous themes in the context of cities within an historical framework, and, finally, a more constructivist study of cities wh ich suggests that urban centres have been, and continue to be, shaped by notions of how society at large should be organised. In the latter instance, the argument will be made that urban planning has always been (and still is) - either explicitly or implic itly - infomed by social, political and cultural beliefs and preferences. Taking their inspiration from cities such as Berlin, Barcelona, Rotterdam and even Maastricht, some of the assignments in the second part of the course in particular focus upon this complex process. In subsequent assignments, the above -mentioned approaches will be presented in the context of a discussion of key issues of European urban history. Not only will a variety of European cities be discussed in the course, the study of co ncrete examples will also help students understand how the urban past of Europe was given shape between the High Middle Ages and today.

Verkerk, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Philosophy, m.ve rkerk@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Humanities Prerequisite None . Objectives To help us to live in a better and freer world. To reflect upon our own moral behavior in society. To explore the most important et hical approaches that are necessary to understand the main societal problems of today and to act adequately. To study primary texts of ethics written by the most eminent philosophers of the past millennia. To support ethical decision making by analyzing pr ofessional practices. Description of the course We live in a fast -changing world. We have to make decisions about our study, our social relations, and our future. All these decisions are influenced by the norms and values we have developed in the course o f our life. The importance of moral considerations is strongly growing. Nowadays, talk about ethics is everywhere, in the bar, in the boardroom, on the shop floor, on television, and in the journals and daily papers. In this course we will explore the fiel d of philosophical ethics: a scientific reflection about morality. In the first part of this course, we will study the grand narratives in ethics, examining Aristotelian, Stoic, Christian, Kantian, utilitarian, and postmodern approaches to ethics. We wil l discuss different questions: What is the nature, role, and foundation of ethics? Is ethics about 'the right thing to do', 'the good life', 'the good man', or all three together? Is there a universal moral framework, or can we only speak about a plurality of approaches? What is the relation between ethics and religion? In the second part of this course, we will study some key disciplinary approaches in ethics. We will discuss environmental ethics and business ethics. Especially, we will pay attention to the application of the grand narratives in ethics to major problems in our society. We will analyze professional practices to identify different ethical aspects .

Objectives To enhance our understanding of modern terrorism and the way we talk about it. To explore its historical and philosophical contexts, its aims and motives and the societal, political and reli gious contexts within which it occurs. To study its reception and interpretation by contemporary philosophers. To hone critical and conceptual analysis skills. Many of the questions that will be raised will therefore be of a philosophical nature, and the emphasis will be on exploring ideologies, concepts, and interpretations. Description of the course In the first part of the course we will begin by exploring the difficult issue of defining terrorism, and by making an overview of the typology and structur e of modern terrorist groups. Having thus established the object of our research, we will first familiarize ourselves with the historical and ideological roots of modern terrorism in the revolutionary and nihilist movements of the nineteenth century. In th e second part we will take a closer look at the various motives and rationales behind terrorism, tentatively grouped together under \"nationalism\", \"religion\" and \"ideology\". During the second part, teams of two or three members of the tutorial groups will make brief presentations, thus providing their fellow group members with specific information on several terrorist groups or regions traditionally associated with certain types of terrorism. In these presentations considerable attention will be paid to the difficulties of defining terrorism, as well the ideological, social and philsophical context of each group. The last part of the course deals with the perceptions of and responses to terrorism. How does the public respond, how do governments react, how sh ould comments such as those made by opinion makers as Noam Chomsky be understood? The emphasis here will not be on the way the so - called \"War on Terrorism\" is being carried out, but rather on the underlying perception of the terrorist threat and its origin s. The conclusion of this course will consist of a discussion of the analysis of modern terrorism as given by John Gray in his book Al Qaeda and what it means to be modern , J\u00fcrgen Habermas in Philosophy in a time of terror , and Jean Baudrillard's The Spir it of Terrorism.

Koenis, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Philosophy , s.koenis@maastrichtuniversity.nl (corresponding coordinator) Semester Period ECTS Conce ntration Spring 4 5 Humanities Prerequisite None. Recommended HUM1007 Introduction to Philosophy and/or COR1004 Political Philosophy. Objectives To acquaint students with pivotal philosophical texts. To help students read primary texts of important philo sophers. To introduce some classical philosophical problems. To become aware of different styles of philosophy. Description of the course In this course well known philosophical texts will be read and analyzed in detail. Reading philosophers, that is, the reading of some of their primary texts is not just a pleasure in itself: most of the more interesting philosophers are also famous stylists. But it is also important to read the original texts instead of always relying on handbooks or (internet) encyclope dia to acquaint oneself with the central ideas of philosophers. There is a lot to learn from reading philosophers themselves, to see how they position themselves in the tradition of philosophy and in the contemporary intellectual debate, to determine what interesting problems are, and how one could go about searching for some answers or even solutions. Reading philosophers themselves also has merit for another reason: it turns out that philosophers use a variety of writing styles and publication media like a scientific treatise, a monograph, an essay, a collection of aphorisms or a novel. And last but not least: they provide the best introduction into some of the classical philosophical problems like: What can we know? How should we valuate? What is justice? Is there something like moral sense? In the course we single out a group of 6 philosophers (with reservation): Plato, Spinoza, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Wittgenstein and Margalit. They are responsible for some of the best philosophical work that has been p roduced in the western tradition.

Boon , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , louis.boon@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Humanities Prerequisites This course is incl uded under the Humanities, but is also very relevant for Social Science students focusing on psychology. It is important to note that this is primarily a course in history, dealin g with psychology as it s topic. It is not a psychology course with a historic al dimension. As prerequisite for the course students will either have done some course(s) in history or in psychology, or, ideally, in both. Objectives To become familiar with the development of psychology since the 16th century. To acquire knowledge abo ut the scientific and social context in which psychology developed. Description of the course Psychology has always straddled the borderlines between the natural and the social sciences. Modern psychology has its origins in the scientific revolution of 16t h century. The category of consciousness according to some defied physics, while others set out to reduce the mental to the material. In the 19th century the theory of evolution made inroads into traditional introspective philosophy of mind, and led to new approaches in the study of behavior. For some the proper object of psychology should be behavior instead of consciousness. So, over time, psychology has exhibited interesting ambiguities both about its own nature. This course will follow some of these amb iguities, and will illuminate a number of traditional and modern problems of psychology. The following issues will be dealt with: - The Scientific revolution as the origin of modern psychology; - Consciousness. Mind and body, materialism and spiritualism; - The experimental method and the rise of psychology in the 19th century; - Man's place in nature. The theory of evolution and it's influence on psychology; - Mental health, medicine and psychology; - The psychological society. The diffusion of psychology in the workp lace, culture and our personal life; - The cognitive revolution. The return of mind in psychology; - Brain as mind. The rise of cognitive neuroscience and its implications for the mind. Literature All reading material will be handed out at the beginning of the course .

U.Brunotte, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Arts and Literature, u.brunotte@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Humanities Prerequisites HUM1003 Cultural Studies I and two 2000 -level courses in the Humanities and/or Social Sciences. Objectives To familiarize students with some of the key theoretical and methodological approaches within cultural memory studies. To provide students with an introduction into trauma (theory) and memory. To teach students close reading of literary texts and analyze literary strategies, styles and narration s of remembrance and trauma. To teach students to reconstruct the interaction of memory imagination and poetic imagination. To enable students to identify and analyze the role of gender in constructions of cultural remembrance of the Holocaust. To introdu ce students to the (political) debate around the paradigms of archive and repertoire as concepts of cultural memory. Description of the course Taking its cue from the current focus of the humanities on practices of collective cultural remembrance, the course focuses on literature as narrative and performative medium of memory. Literature fulfils a crucial role in recreating aspects of the past in the present. Without remembrance and representation, cultural and individual life would be impossible; the same counts for cultural oblivion: total recall would mean madness. Not only individuals, but also social groups and nations as a whole construct their identities by re -appropriating and 'inventing' the past. Here memory and identity politics merge. The course will introduce central theories of memory and remembrance. Around 1900, the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs and the art historian Aby Warburg independently developed theories of \"collective memory\". Yet, it was not until the 1980s that Pierre Nora's lieux de m\u00e9moire and Jan and Aleida Assmann's concept of Cultural memory made memory studies resurface. Moreover, cultural remembrance depends entirely on processes of (re -)mediation. That is where literature, rituals, and the arts enter the field. Beginning with modern authors like Proust and Poe, the theoretical texts will be accompanied by close readings of literary texts that shed light on the poetical creation of remembrance. With regards to literary analysis it is important to define the way in which remembr ance and poetic imagination interact. Memory studies started within Holocaust studies at the very moment when the generation of survivors passed away. Therefore, research in trauma and remembrance has taken centre stage. The course follows a genealogical approach to the \"trauma paradigm\" in memory studies. It refers back to Sigmund Freud's theory of \"traumatic neurosis\" and connects it with new approaches in trauma theory. It will focus on the question of how traumatic experiences have been expressed and r epresented in modern literature. Our central example is Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse 5 (1969). The course connects questions of cultural remembrance and trauma experience via literary narration, style, and intertextuality. Its focus on the role of gender in memory draws attention to the relevance of body images and gender myths for the construction of narrations and images of the past. A post -colonial dimension will be added when we take a close look at the debate around the contested concepts of archive and repertoire in memory studies. If we link the performative repertoire to cultural memory, we will have to go beyond the long established Western model of memory as a fixed, mostly written \"storehouse\" of the past. If we take repertoire into accou nt, we will have to consider and acknowledge embodied, sensual remembrance, narrated oral memory and gestural ritual repertoires as equal to texts, monuments and objects.

Objectives To familiarize students with the academic study of religion as a cultural phenomenon against the background of a secularizing world. To provide an insight into key ideas, themes and arguments on the nature, function, and politics of reli gion. Description of the course The course provides a broad approach to religion as a cultural phenomenon. It focuses on the following groups of questions and topics: 1. Defining religion What is religion about? How does religion differ from the sciences and the arts? What do secularization processes involve? In this part of the course we will look into some significant philosophical perspectives on the nature of religion and secularism. 2. On the contents of religion We will briefly consider the most impo rtant characteristics of the major world religions. Against this background we will discuss a number of key narratives and themes from the Judeo - Christian heritage, taken from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (such as the creation story, book of Job, death and resurrection of Christ, epistles by Paul). 3. On the politics of religion The last part of the course will look at the role of religion and religious institutions within political power structures, ranging from the Vatican to the Middle -East.

Objective To introduce students to the general t heories on totalitarianism and familiarize students with various 20th century totalitarian regimes and movements. Description of the course This course is a history course that will study 20th century totalitarianism over a broad front. Attention is paid t o both theories on totalitarianism as on totalitarian movements and regimes during the previous century. All the different variants of totalitarianism will be studied: national socialism in Germany, fascism in Italy, as well as communism in the Soviet Unio n and Eastern Europe. Postwar phenomena such as right -wing extremism, populism, and Apartheid in South Africa will be given attention as well. In each case we will see whether and in how far the different forms of totalitarianism can be understood from the perspective of the different theories about it. Special attention is given to the 'politics of memory' - collective remembrance and historical writing - and problems related to political transformation processes in various countries (Germany, Eastern Euro pe, South Africa).

Recommended HUM 1007 Introduction to Philosophy Objectives To introduce depth psychological literary criticism. To help students develop their sensitivity for depth psychological dimensions that works of art and literature may have. To provide the means to distinguish adequate literary interpretations from less adequate ones: on what reasonable grounds, if at all, can we decide that one (depth psychological) interpretation of a work of literature does more justic e to the text than a competing one? Description of the course In the first part of the course students will become familiar with the basic elements of psychoanalysis (Freud) and analytical psychology (Jung). Special attention will be paid to depth psychol ogical theories on art and literature. In the second part we shall read a number of widely diverging depth psychological interpretations of literary texts, such as Sophocles's Oedipus rex , Saint Wuthering Heights , Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , several fairy tales, myths, poems, and short stories. The last part of the course is devoted to some epistemological aspects of depth psychological literary criticism. W e will go into three main questions: What types of rules are to be observed when interpreting literary texts? To what extent does depth psychological literary criticism qualify as an academic discipline? And, finally, to what extent do depth psychological theories like psychoanalysis and analytical psychology qualify as academic disciplines?

Objective To understand major issues and episodes that have shaped the history of mankind. The focus will be on themes and topics that have had or are still having long term influences on historical development. Description of the course Flowing f rom this objective, t he course deals with the over all history of mankind, and the decisive transformations involved in that history. What sort of creatures are we? How have we evolved from and lived before we became homo sapiens? What sort of animals are our ancestors? Impor tant topics nearer in time are the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The agricultural or neolithic revolution has changed us and the world permanently. In a relatively brief period we went from hunting and gathering to tilling the soil and domestica ting plants and animals. Why and how did we do this? Since the agricultural revolution our numbers have multiplied beyond comprehension. Societies became increasingly complex and stratified. The industrial revolution lifted everything to a new unprecedente d plane. A type of society arose, driven by industrial innovation and run on fossil fuels. We are still living in that kind of society today, so it is interesting to know how it came about. The course will also deal with topics like the role of war, disea se, religion, worldviews and finance in shaping history. Take disease. Their ways of life brought men in contact with all sorts of diseases. Especially after the agricultural revolution we had to adapt to diseases we caught from our domesticated animals. W e still have to do this. Look at present day threats like bird flu. Living in some form of armed peace with diseases has always been a major characteristic of societies. How did we do this? Finally the course also touches upon the 'Rise of the West'. The contentious rise of Western Europe and North America as a dominant factor in worldhistory over the last 5 centuries will be the closing topic of the course .

Swinnen , Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Arts and Literature , a.swinnen@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities Prerequisites At least two 200 0-level courses in the Humanities or Social Sciences. Objectives To familiarize students with the methods of narratology (the study of storytelling) and important theories revolvi ng around narratology. To analyze different media such as literature, paintings, photographs, comics, film, film music, digital literature and computer games. Description of the course The first part of the course introduces main concepts from narratology , such as story, discourse, authorship, and narration. In addition, students will learn the differences between a structuralist and a postclassical approach to narratology. During the second part of the course, narrativity in different media will be subjec t of investigation. We ask how different media construct stories and to what extent these stories are medium -specific. The media under study are the short story, the fixed image and series of images, comics, film, hyperfiction and digital games. For studen ts with particular interest in literature, the Handbook of Narrative Analysis (2005) will be most instructive, while Narrative across Media will be most useful to students who are more oriented towards other media. We will read chapters from both books in this course as well as other literature that addresses the narrativity of media. The final essay has to show that students are able to apply the methods introduced during the course to a case study the they are free to choose. Examples are the novel House of Leaves , the short story collection Olive Kitteridge , the comic Deadpool and its film adaptation, the graphic novel Persepolis , the film 5x2, and the game L.A. Noire . As this is a course in the humanities, an approach to storytelling from the social sci ences or psychology is only possible in comparison to methods from the humanities. Literature The following handbooks are the most crucial: Herman, L. and Vervaeck, B. (2005). Handbook of Narrative Analysis . Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. Ryan, M. -L. (2004).

Objectives To acquaint students with contemporary configurations of gender, sexuality, 'race', and ethnicity, and the way in which these 'crucial differences' structure contemporary cultural processes, as well as social and individual identities and institutions. To familiarize students with topical debates, themes, and theories in contemporary gender and diversity studies. To teach students how multiple identities and experiences of difference and inequality interact, by familiarizing them with intersectional approaches to gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class. To provide students with the analytical skills to examine the dynamics of the continous production and reproduction of identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality today. Description of the course This course considers a variety of contemporary configurations of gender, sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class. You will learn to examine the way i n which these 'crucial differences' are constituted in the late twentieth and early twenty -first century, as well as to analyze the ways in which they function on sociocultural, political, and symbolic levels. The emergence of the various social movements during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the women's movement, the civil rights movement, and gay and lesbian liberation, and their lasting impact on society today, serves as a starting point of the course. We will examine how these diverse movements have shape d and reshaped the form and content of the identity of various minorities on individual and collective levels. Special attention will be directed to theories of intersectionality, which examine how the interactions between multiple inequalities and social hierarchies shape personal and social experiences, as well as political strategies and policies. Subsequently, we will take a closer look at the complexity of such multiple inequalities, by tracing the entangled workings of gender, sexuality, and race/ethn icity through a variety of topical cases and questions. What was the role of social and embodied differences in the late twentieth century 'ethnic conflicts' in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia? How does the interaction of norms of gender and sexuality str ucture contemporary performances of identity? In what ways are current practices of terrorism and counterterrorism inflected by dynamics of race, gender, and sexuality? How do advanced technologies such as cosmetic surgery and new reproductive techniques i mpact the human body, and how do such practices function as 'technologies' of gender, race, and class? How is intersexuality viewed in the Western world, and why is it medicalized? How do constructions of whiteness function in a globalized world? How can w e analyze and evaluate the emergence of sexual nationalisms across Europe today? Why do women's sexual liberation and gay rights occupy such a prominent place in contemporary debates about Islam and multicultural citizenship? As these cases indicate, the c ourse draws on a variety of geographical and cultural locations and contexts. Diversity is also exemplified in the interdisciplinary approach that characterizes gender and diversity studies as an academic field. The texts used in this course draw on theori es and methods from disciplines such as philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies, as well as from the fields of feminist theory, postcolonial theory, and queer studies. Through critical inquiry into concrete cases as well as major texts - including modern classics in the field such as Judith Butler's Gender Trouble and Joan Scott's The Politics of the Veil - this course offers you dynamic ways to think through the complexities of our times, and to examine the multiple ways in which processe s of identity and difference, inclusion and exclusion, equality and inequality are produced and reproduced in ongoing flows of negotiation and transformation.

Dekker, Faculty of Humani ties and Sciences, University College Maastricht, teun.dekker@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Humanities & Social Sciences Prerequisite COR1004 Political Philosophy. Recommended HUM1007 Introduction to Philosophy and/ or HUM2051 Philosophical Ethics. Objectives To examine some recent developments in political philosophy in the field of distributive justice. To engage with the work of today's leading political philosophers in this field and critically evaluate their ar guments. To discover one's preferred conception of justice. Description of the course Distributive Justice concerns the morally correct way of distributing the burdens and benefits of social cooperation among citizens. In the wake of the publication of J ohn Rawls's monumental A Theory of Justice, there has been an explosion of political philosophizing about this issue, one that continues to this day. This course will examine the work of some of today's most prominent political philosophers working in the field of justice. In doing so we will study several topics that are related to some of the issues discussed in COR1004 (Political Philosophy). As such the course is designed to be a sequel to that course, and familiarity with the concepts and authors discu ssed in that course is presumed. Having said that, this course is distinctive in several respects. First of all, the course will strictly focus on debates within academia, rather than hot political debates within the wider community. Secondly, the course will exclusively use original primary texts, i.e. original scientific articles and book chapters. Thirdly, the course will be particularly concerned with the construction and evaluation of the minutia of argument. We will be looking at the strengths and weakness of the arguments presented for certain ethical claims and positions, with the aim of figuring out whether we agree with them, and to determine what our own conception of justice is. Literature E-Reader containing contemporary papers and chapters. Instructional Format Tutorial group meetings. Examination A final paper presenting the student's considered views on the question of distributive justice, and a critical review of one of the articles discussed. 50 HUM3049 Science, Power and the Construction of Facts Course coordinator Dr. C.

Description of the course Science is the system of knowledge production through which truths are constructed in much of Western societies, and as a consequence is an incredibly powerful institution that requires critical examination. At the same point in time, significant contemporary movements of \"alternative facts\" (Conway 2017) and \"post -truth politics\" are underway (Roberts, 2010) . What is the relationship betwe en these two phenomenon, and how is power enacted through the establishment of \"facts\"? In order to understand the power Science enacts in its production of \"facts\" this course looks to the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic contexts thr ough which science is practiced and scientific knowledge is circulated through society. In doing so we will take a closer look at the production and dissimination of technoscience outputs, and will study science in action in its immediate environment as w ell as in its role and position in society. To do so we consider science and its scientists as 'a tribe'. To take this idea seriously we need to critically analyze notions of objectivity, expertise, commercialisation, integrity, and credibility that are ce ntral to scientific knowledge production. This perspective will help us to understand how science operates in today's complex world. To gain insight in science we zoom in on the organization of knowledge production and its collaborative character. We also study processes in which credible facts are established and published. Furthermore, this course also pays attention to the integrity of science and in particular its grey areas. Beside the immediate context in which scientific facts are established (i.e. t he lab), the course also takes into account the wider socio -economic context in which science operates. This involves not only the commercialization of science, but also the way its promises and expectations are related to our hopes and fears. Finally, you will gain insights into the way the cultural -historical contexts affects the interpretation of facts. It is along these lines that we enter the world of the scientists. Based on discussions and analyses of these topics the course aims to make you reflect critically on 'common sense' views of the making and use of scientific claims . Besides tutorial meetings, the course also involves lectures, discussion meetings, video analysis, and a visit to a scientific lab for an interview. Literature E-Reader con taining diverse academic journal articles. Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, lectures, and a visit to a scientific lab/ or interview with a scientist. Examination Participation in and preparation of tutorial meetings, an individual paper and i ndividual presentation. 51 HUM3050 A Cultural Critique of Our Aging Society Course coordinator Prof. d r. A. Swinnen, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Maastricht University a.swinnen@maastrichtunive rsity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Humanities & Social Sciences Prerequisite A 1000 - or 2000 -level course in humanities or social sciences, for instance HUM1003 Cultural Studies I: Doing Cultural Studies, HUM2003 The Making of Crucial Differences, SSC1029 Sociological Perspectives or SSC1003/2065 Theories of Social Order. Objectives To understand age as an identity category that intersects with other categories like gender, sexuality, disability, and ethnicity. To distinguish between multiple, disciplinarily -influenced ways of defining 'age' including chronologically, functionally, subjectively, and culturally. To recognize ageist discourses (cf. the reduction of aging to physical and mental decline) and practices and to reflect on at titudes towards age. To distinguish between realistic concerns and the alarmist hype surrounding global population aging. To understand different methods that are implemented in aging research, ranging from visual analysis to ethnographic approaches. Descr iption of the course If you have enjoyed courses in crucial differences, cultural studies, and identities, this course will be another eye -opener. It focuses on age as identity marker and is set up in true interdisciplinary fashion encompassing perspective s from economy, history, the arts, globalisation and gender studies amongst others. If you believe aging is a far removed from your personal sphere - think twice and continue reading! Headlines everywhere tell us that ours is a graying world and that pop ulation aging will be a defining influence on our twenty -first century, radically affecting public health and national economies. These demographic predictions \u2014the result of the trends of declining mortality and increasing longevity \u2014are typically accompani ed by dire warnings of the challenges ahead: unsustainable pension systems which will encumber younger generations, the critical need for more caregivers and more resources to care for the increasing numbers of those who are frail and dependent, concerns a bout maintaining technological progress and competitive workforces with an aging labor force, etc. Rarely are such numbers presented in terms of the possible benefits that population aging might bring, such as in experienced leadership, informal caregiving , and a more flexible labor force less hampered by child care. Also often excluded from these projections is any sense of what life is actually like for the diverse millions of people who grow into old age. How do we know what these numbers will mean for o ur economies, our social structures, our loved ones, and ourselves? To begin to address that question, we need to understand better what it means to grow old in the twenty first century and how this meaning may have developed or changed over the course of history or be differently shaped by national and transnational cultures. Also, it requires research into the many images and stories of aging that circulate in popular culture and influence the way we think about older people. This, then, will form the hea rt of the inquiry we will make in this course. We will explore what aging is and means from different disciplinary, historical and (trans)national perspectives, examining the concerns raised about aging societies and the causes and consequences of ageism, which is prejudice or discrimination based upon a person's age. Aging is a topic that we all have a stake in. On one level, this stake is very personal. If we live the long lives we desire, we will all become old, whether or not the label \"old\" is one we fear or desire. On a larger scale, the concerns of population aging cross every discipline and ageism pervades all parts of our social and personal lives, even when we don't recognize it. Whatever occupation you pursue, a deeper understanding of aging wil l have relevance. This course will prepare you to engage critically in the current and future debates about our aging society and to interrogate your hopes and fears for your own aging experiences. Theoretically and methodologically, this course is part of diversity studies as it adds the category of age to other identity markers, such as gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity, and religion. Literature E-reader containing excerpts from books and relevant journals. Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, (guest) lectures, and a feed -back session in relation to the final paper . Examination The assessment of this course is based on (1) classroom participation and your performance as discussion leader, (2) a presentation, and (3) a final paper . 52 HUM305 1 Medi cal Humanities: Bodies & Minds, Histories of the Normal and the Pathological Course coordinator Dr. R. Houtepen , Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences. Department Health, Ethics & Society , r.houtepen @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Humanities & Social Sciences NB: This course is highly interdisciplinary (philosophy, history, cultural studies, medical anthropology & sociology, several branches of medicine).It is situated at the crossroads of Social Sciences, Humanities and Science . Prerequisite COR1002 philosophy of science Objectives To gain knowledge of different influential conceptions of 'body' and 'mind', 'healthy' and 'sick', 'normal' and 'pathological', 'regular' and 'deviant'. To gain understanding o f how cultural, social, economic, legal, scientific and religious contexts play a role in the construction and consequences of these distinctions . Description of the course Medical humanities acknowledge that instead of being fixed entities, health and ill ness are constantly changing, ambiguous phenomena. What is called healthy (sane) or ill (insane) depends indeed on a large variety of issues and dynamics: cultural, socio -economical, and religious aspects; moral system; legal system; science; technology; a rt and media etc. This course approaches the question of health and illness through a philosophical, anthropological and sociological exploration of \"bodies\" and \"minds\". Through a historical and cross -cultural perspective it will discuss various concepts of body and mind. We will discuss how and why some bodies and minds are considered as normal and others as abnormal or pathological. For this we will draw on scientific, social, cultural and economic contexts, but also on how bodies and minds are represent ed in art and (popular) culture. Cases include cosmetic surgery; the modern hospital; boxing in the ghetto; organ menopause; prostheses in Paralympic athletes; medical imaging technologies; the war on cancer. Literature E-Reader. (Articles that are not included in the E -Reader will be made available for photocopying during the course). A book on a special topic in this field, selected by you from a list offered .

A.F. Harmsen & Dr. M.P.M. Vluggen , School of Business and Economics, Accounting and Information Management, f.harmsen@ @maastrichtuniversity.nl, m.vluggen@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Sciences & Social Sciences NB: This course was formerly known as SCI1005 The Information Society . The course is an introductor y course to the Information Sciences curriculum, providing an overview of topics related to the use, embedding and management of information and information technology. The emphasis will be on the organizational (enterprise) context, but we will also touch upon the broader societal impact of information technologies. Prerequisite None. Objectives To introduce students to the role of data, information and knowledge in several contexts: enterprises, but also society in general. To familiarize students with th e background of knowledge management, its models and application. To introduce students to the methodologies used in developing information systems (e.g. the systems development lifecycle method versus agile methodologies). To introduce students to the or ganization and governance of data, information and knowledge. To introduce students to the managerial challenges associated with the use of information systems in enterprises . Description of the course Too often IT is viewed as the province of technocrats, a domain inhabited by technical experts with little relevance to real -world problems. And yet, the economic importance of information, information systems, and thus information management has been growing constantly over the last decades, thanks to the re lentless increase in computer performance. We are increasingly dependent on information systems and data to make decisions in a wide range of domains. Sensor and network technology helps us to collect and analyze data in real -time, and to speed up decisio n making in all areas of our society. The possibilities of information and computer science are endless, but they also raise concerns: for instance about privacy, security, and identity, but also about interpretation and perception of data. All these deve lopments have led to the present -day \"digital enterprise\". In digital enterprises, the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of information is a significant economic activity. The digitization of enterprises also has consequences for s ociety. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called digital citizens. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society. The digital society can be bo th a threat and an opportunity to enterprises - this is, for instance, clearly visible in sectors such as retail (traditional retailers vs Amazon & Co), accomodation (traditional hotel vs AirBNB) and transportation (traditional taxis vs Uber). This course offers an overview of role of digital concepts in enterprises: the digital enterprise. The course provides both a theoretical grounding and a pragmatic approach to applying key concepts. Drawing on ideas, tools, and techniques from such disciplines as ec onomics, sociology, cognitive science, organizational behavior, and computer science, the course shows the digital enterprise from different perspectives: its position in society and the market , but also elements such as governance, information technolo gy, and people. The course serves as an introduction to other Information and Computer Science courses, in which the various topics of the Digital Enterprise will be discussed in more detail. Literature Reader Instructional format Tutorial group meetings a nd lectures. Examination During the course the students make several small assignments. Theoretical aspects of the course are applied and concepts are translated to practical usability. Another part is a written exam . 56 SCI1009 Introduction to Biology Cour se coordinators Dr. B.

It is strongly suggested that stud ents with substantial high school experience in biology consider taking relevant 200 0-level courses directly (for an indication of the relevant topics, see SCI -B, p. vi-viii). Prerequisite None. Objectives To provide students with a good basic knowledge r equired to enter more specialised courses in life sciences. To gain insight in the biology of organisms. To increase appreciation and knowledge of the science of life. Description of the course Biology, the science of life, studies the organisms as the basic units of life. How they are evolved, how they are build up, how they act, how they communicate with each other, how they are related to the non-living environment, and how they reproduce. Since organisms are built up of cells, the basic unity of all life forms, the course will start with providing insight in the basic structure and function of cells and their organelles and the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We will continue by discussing the biomolecules essential for life and the processes that generate these molecules in the cell. Because organisms also grow and reproduce, the course will further focus on topics such as the genome and its replication, transcription and translation, basic (Mendelian) genetics and the principles of cell growth and differentiation, metabolism and reproduction. The course will end with a comparison of the cycle of life of different species. Literature Sadava et al., Life, the science of biology , 10th edition, 2012. Alberts et al.

Objectives To gain a basic understanding of the (various perspectives on the) concept of sustainable development and some of the main related contemporary ideas, concepts and theories. To gain insights into (the limits to) our immense global human impact on the earth's syste ms and the underlying drivers of these unsustainable trends To evaluate the usefulness of some contemporary ideas about how to achieve a more sustainable society. To be able to translate and apply general theories and concepts of sustainable development to relevant cases. Description of the course Today it is acknowledged that achieving sustainable development at the local, regional and global scale is one of the greatest challenges for the 21st century. But in many cases the term 'sustainable development' functions as little more than a vacuous buzzword. So what does sustainable development actually mean? How unsustainable is our global society at the moment? Are we contributing to irreversible climate change? Are we already passing dangerous global envi ronmental tipping points? Why are humans acting in such unsustainable ways? And, of course, what are sustainable ways forward? This course aims to enhance student's understanding of 'sustainable development', based on the notion that human development can only be sustainable when environmental boundaries are respected. The course introduces the main concepts, ideas and theories related to the term sustainable development. Students will gain insights into (the limits to) humanity's immense impact on the e arth's systems and the underlying drivers of these unsustainable trends. Furthermore, sustainable development requires an understanding that inaction has consequences. Students will learn about some of the contemporary ideas about how to achieve a more su stainable society. As part of the examination students will link theories/concepts/ideas discussed in the course to a self - selected case study (a promising way forward towards sustainability) in a poster presentation.

Studen ts who are unsure if this course is suitable for them can contact the coordinator to discuss their situation. Objective s To make students familiar with several fundamental concepts in mathematics, a.o.numbers, logic, proofs, sets, relations, functions and combinatorics (see description). To get the students to notice how beautiful the world of mathematics is. Description of the course The students will learn the what the following fundamental concepts involve: 1. Numbers: We discuss a.o. integers, natural n umbers, real numbers and prime numbers and properties that these classes of numbers have; 2. Logic: This involves drawing (correct!) conclusions and how to use logic to prove mathematical statements. 3. Sets: A set is nothing more than a collection of items. Oft en those items will be numbers, but this is not necessarily the case. We discuss properties of sets and concepts related to sets, like intersections, and unions; 4. (Mathematical) relations: A relation is essentially a comparing mechanism for elements in a set. E.g. 'smaller than'. We discuss several relations and their properties; 5. Functions: A function is a mapping from one set to another. We discuss several properties that functions may have, like invertibility; 6. Combinatorics, the science of 'smart counti ng': The question is 'In how many ways...', the answer will often be a big number and we discuss how to find them quickly. For this purpose we use concepts like permutations and combinations. Almost every time mathematics is used, it concerns some of the abo ve concepts. A good understanding of these topics is therefore very important and Discrete Mathematics is a perfect course to combine with other mathematics courses. Hence, students who are interested in (applied) mathematics, computer science and/or econ ometrics might find this course particularly useful. Literature Chetwynd, A., & Diggle, P.

Students wishing to take the Lab Skills should concurrently enroll in, o r have completed, this course. Students wishing to take SCI2009 Human Physiology without taking the Lab Skills may do so. Prerequisites SCI1009 Introduction to Biology. Students with substantial high school experience in Biology (For an indication of the relevant topics, see SCI -B, p. vi -viii) can contact the coordinator to request a waiver. Objective To obtain basic knowledge of human physiology. Course Description While Mathematics is seen as the father of science, Physiology is the mother. Physiolog y attempts to explain the physical and chemical factors that are responsible for the origin, development, and progression of life. Human physiology investigates the mechanisms of the human body making it a living being (Guyton). In the healthy human body i t is of the utmost importance that the working conditions for all cells are kept \"constant\". In this respect it is noteworthy that essentially all organs and cells of the human body perform functions that help to maintain this constant nature or homeostasi s by using feed -back mechanisms. We will begin by discussing the physiology of the cell, and the function of the cell membrane. Continuing, we will discuss cardiovascular physiology, respiratory, fluid and salt balance, followed by the autonomic nervous sy stem and the endocrine system and ending with gastrointestinal physiology, control and feedback.

Students who are unsure if this course is suitable for them can contact the coordinator to discuss their situation. Objective To familiarize the students with the fundamentals of Game Theory. Description of the course What is a game? The word game may make you think of things l ike poker, chess or backgammon. However, within the context of this course its meaning is far broader. A ga me is basically a decision problem in which several parties are involved. Generally these parties have different and conflicting interests, and often there is no solution to the decision problem that will make all parties happy. The parties in the conflict are normally called players (or agents), but one should keep in mind that these may just as well be firms competing for their market shares, animals fighting over a territory, children trying to get the biggest piece of cake, or politicians fighting over the distribution of budgets. We encounter very fundamental issues like rationality, expectations, fairness, power, cooperation, threats, manipulations, risk, stability. In some games everything depends on strategic possibilities of the players. In such gam es we also encounter information structures; what does each player know about the other player's possibilities and goals. Does A know that B knows that A knows that B knows etc? Game Theory analyzes different types of games and their solution concepts. A nalyzing, or solving, a game boils down to answering a mathematical question and then interpreting the result. In the games that we discuss in the Game Theory course the solution depends on strategic possibilities of the players. We will discuss the game s in order of increasing strategic possibilities, which means that as the course progresses, the games become more complex. Many examples shall be discussed to clarify the issues and many exercises will be provided to learn how to compute solutions. Liter ature Lecture Notes Introduction to Game Theory by Frank Thuijsman will be provided.

Bonizzi , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering , pietro.bonizzi @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Sciences Prerequisite SCI1010 Basic Mathematical Tools or su bstantial high school experience in Mathematics (For an indication of the relevant topics, see SCI -M, p. vi -viii). Students who are unsure if this course is suitable for them can contact the coordinator to discuss their situation. Objective To provide an i ntroduction to the main topics of linear algebra. Emphasis is on an understanding of the basic concepts and techniques, and on developing the practical, computational skills to solve problems from a wide range of application areas. Description of the cour se Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics which is primarily concerned with problems involving linearity of one kind or another. This is reflected by the three main themes around which this introductory course is centred. The first theme is concerns with what can be recognized without doubt as the most frequently occurring mathematical problem in practical applications: how to solve a system of linear equations. For this problem a complete solution procedure is developed which provides the student wi th a way to deal with such problems systematically, regardless of the number of equations or the number of unknowns. The second theme addresses linear functions and mappings, which can be studied naturally from a geometric point of view. This involves geo metric 'objects' such as points, lines and planes, and geometric 'actions' such as rotation, reflection, projection and translation. One of the main tools of linear algebra is offered by matrices and vectors, for which a basic theory of matrix - vector compu tation is developed. This allows one to bring these two themes together in a common framework, in what turns out to be an exceptionally fruitful way. By introducing the notions of vector spaces, inner products and orthogonality, a deeper understanding of t he scope of these techniques is developed, opening up a large array of rather diverse application areas. The third theme surfaces when the point of view is shifted once more, now from the geometric point of view to the dynamic perspective, where the focus is on the effects of iteration (i.e., the repeated application of a linear mapping). This involves a basic theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which have many applications in various branches of science as will be discussed. For instance, important app lications in problems involving dynamics and stability, and applications to optimization problems found in operations research. Many examples and exercises shall be provided to clarify the issues and to develop practical computational skills. They also ser ve to demonstrate practical applications where the results of this course can be successfully employed. Students will obtain insight that various seemingly different questions all boil down to the same mathematical problem of solving a system of equations. Students will learn to look at the same problem from different angles and will learn to switch their point of view (from geometric to algebraic and vice versa). Literature Lay, David C. (2012).

Objectives To acquaint students with genetics and evolutionary theory. To provide students with insight into the essentials of genetic and evolutiona ry models and their applications in biology, medicine and psychology. Description of the course Within the life sciences there are two kinds of theories that deal with phenomena: proximate -causal theories and ultimate causal theories. Molecular genetics i s indispensable for understanding the proximate causation of phenomena. It explains how genetics information, encoded in the DNA, is transcribed and translated into molecules that are involved in the development of characteristics (phenotypes) of an indivi dual. Evolutionary theory tries to solve problems related to the ultimate causation of phenomena. Why have specific genotypes been selected through selection on phenotypes? Its core discipline is evolutionary genetics. Genetics and evolutionary theory wil l be discussed in this course. The course starts with the mechanisms that cause evolutionary change: natural selection, inheritance, and gene expression. In order to make these mechanisms understandable for students, this course will deal with the essenti als of molecular, Mendel, and population genetics. It then moves on to the evolution of life cycles, sex, and sexual selection. After discussing kin selection it uses genomic imprinting to explain genetic conflicts. Game theory will be used to explain the models that treat conflicts. The course will finish with the evolution of life histories, especially senescence. Besides theoretical and mathematical models, the course will treat the applications of these models within the fields of biology, medicine, an d psychology. For example sexual selection will be used to explain the principles of partner selection in human beings (psychology), kin selection will be treated in the context of conflicts between paternal and maternal alleles during pregnancies (medicin e), and the evolution of sex will be treated in relation to rates of mutation and recombination (biology).

Objectives To provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts found throughout the field of data mining. To provide a practical experience of applying data -mining techniques for analyzing data and deriving new knowledge. Description of the cou rse Data mining is a relatively new scientific field that enables finding interesting knowledge from (very large) data. In practice it is often a mixed -initiative process that has the potential to predict events or to analyze them in retrospect. Data minin g has elements of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistics. A typical database contains data, information or even knowledge if the appropriate queries are submitted and answered. The situation changes if you have to analyze large databas es with many variables. Elementary database queries and standard statistical analysis are not sufficient to answer your information need. Your intuition guides you to understand that the database contains more knowledge on a specific topic that you would l ike to know explicitly. Data mining can assist you in acquiring this knowledge. The course shows you within two months how this works. You will learn new techniques, new methods, and tools of data mining. The course focuses on techniques with a direct prac tical use. A step -by-step introduction to powerful (freeware) data -mining tools will enable you to achieve specific skills, autonomy and hands -on experience. A number of real data sets will be analyzed and discussed. In the end of the course you will be ab le to apply data -mining techniques for research and business purposes. The following points will be addressed during the course: * Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery * Data Preparation * Basic Techniques for Data Mining: Decision -Tree Induction Rule Indu ction Instance -Based Learning Bayesian Learning Ensemble Techniques Clustering Association Rules Tools for Data Mining How to Interpret and Evaluate Data -Mining Results Literature Mitchell, T.

Description of the course Human beings mostly go throug h their lives without paying much attention to their actions such as breathing, eating and even learning. Our brain seems to take care of us in an almost effortless way by planning, initiating and executing our actions and by regulating our somatic homeost asis. The course Brain and Action is concerned with exactly how the nervous system does so. The course deals with the scientific study of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as with some of the latest developments in neuroscience. Via problem based learning tasks, both the anatomy and functions of important neurological structures like the spinal cord and the brain are examined. Questions that will be raised continually during the course are, e.g.: What is the hippocampus? What function does t he corpus callosum have? How does the brain develop both pre - and postnatally? How does neurotransmission take place? Etc. Literature Bear, M.F., (20 16). Neuroscience: Exploring the brain (4th ed.), ISBN: 9780781760034.

Objectives To convey the ideas that have emerged over the past fifty years of Artificial Intelligence research, and about two millenia of related work, expressed in the study of so -called intelligent agents. To discuss the possibility of machines tha t think. To show how algorithms can be used (1) to understand human behavior in terms of underlying processes, and (2) to enable systems to think or act intelligently. Description of the course The course starts with an analysis of the question \"Can machin es think\", and the preconceptions usually encountered in discussions about that idea. Next the metaphor of an \"intelligent agent\" is introduced, that is, of an entity that pursues goals by perceiving and acting flexibly and autonomously in a possibly very complex environment. The main part of the course explores the metaphor of an intelligent agent by introducing a number of state -of-the-art concepts, algorithms, and methods which enable computers (i.e., software and robots) to solve problems in a way w hich deserves to be called intelligent. Topics covered in this part are chosen from AI areas such as intelligent search and constraint satisfaction, architectures for intelligent agents, and coordination among intelligent agents. The course as a whole con veys basic aspects and facets of engineering (analyzing and designing) AI systems. Covered topics are explored and applied in exercises and tasks (in -class and homework).

Recommended Secondary school physics (For an indication of the relevant topics, see SCI -P, p. vi -viii) Objectives To use the tools that participan ts have developed in SCI2018 in a physics environment. This means we will take a journey through a variety of topics of physics. The aim is to simultaneously prepare participants for further studies in the sciences concentration or for admission into futur e program mes but at the same time giving a broad overview of physics as a science. We will review and expand on high school physics as well as observations of the natural world to explore the material world in a quantitative manner. Description of the cour se Physics is the science of measuring the natural world; as a result, physicists have developed a series of properties and laws of the material world. These laws describe many physical phenomena from the composition of atomic nuclei to the evolution of di stant stars. The course describes some of the general laws of nature, valid in the whole universe, and how such laws could be extracted from the results of carefully planned experiments. Clearly the whole of physics cannot be addressed in 6 weeks, so prior to the course beginning, participants of the course will be asked to contribute to the design of the curriculum (including topics covered, PBL tasks and assessment). This gives each year's course a slightly different perspective, but one which is tailored to the specific interests of the participants. Topics offered (but not necessarily taught) are: Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Oscillators, Solid State Physics, Optics, Vibrations and Waves, Special Relativity, Nuclear and Particle Physics, Electronics, Astrophysics and Quantum Mechanics. Literature The required textbook is University Physics , H.D Young and R. A. Freedman, Pearson, 13th ed., 2008. It is strongly advised to buy the book by Young and Freedman, which is an internationally well -known text and wi ll allow you to successfully describe your physics credits in future admission procedures. Earlier and cheaper editions are offered at Amazon and can be used as well. Instructional format The course is based on a series of lectures (parts of which will be posted on Student Portal ), a series of weekly mathematical problems as well as the standard UCM approach of Problem -Based Learning (PBL) in a tutorial group. Examination The assessment will consist of a minimum of two separate examinations, the style and t iming of which will be determined by the participants and the course coordinator. The aim will be that each examination will be in a different style, so as to account for the diversity within the group. 74 SCI2039 Computer Science Course coordinator Dr. E.

Galuzzi, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, c.galuzzi@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concent ration Spring 5 5 Sciences Prerequisites SCI2018 Calculus and SCI2019 Linear Algebra. Objective To become familiar with the basic concepts and methods of optimization. To understand how techniques from calculus and linear algebra are useful for optimiz ation. To become familiar with a diversity of optimization problems and solution techniques. To be able to cast certain real -world problems into the form of optimization problems. To be able to solve certain optimization problems with software (Matlab) . Description of the course In everyday life we are surrounded with applications of optimization. A common drive of human activity is to make things better, to enhance performance, and to carry out the best possible actions in given situations. Often the essen tials of a situation can be captured by a mathematical description (a model, with or without constraints) and the value of a proposed action by a function (an optimization criterion). Then the goal becomes to optimize the criterion for the given model unde r the associated constraints (if any). Depending on the nature of the model, the constraints, and the optimization function, many different mathematical techniques are available to characterize and compute optima. In this course we address the most importa nt areas in optimization and we study the most common techniques. First, we consider the optimization of unconstrained continuous functions in several variables. Some notions we will come across are: partial derivatives; the gradient and the Hessian; stat ionary points; minima, maxima and saddle points; local and global optima. Techniques to compute optima range from analytical and algebraic techniques (i.e., solving systems of equations) to iterative and approximate numerical techniques (e.g., gradient met hods and hill climbing, Newton and quasi - Newton methods, and several others). We will focus on a selection of these. An important class of functions to consider is that of least squares criteria. We will consider both linear and nonlinear least squares pro blems and suitable iterative techniques to solve them. Linear least squares problems are often encountered in the context of fitting a model to measurement data. They also allow one to rephrase the problem of solving a nonlinear system of equations as an o ptimization problem, while the converse is possible too. Second, we address optimization problems subject to a given set of constraints. A well -known such class consists of linear optimization functions subject to linear equality or inequality constraints: the class of linear program mes. The problem of fitting a linear model to measurement data using the criterion of least absolute deviations, can be reformulated as a linear program me. Several methods are available to solve such problems, including active s et methods and the simplex algorithm, but also interior point methods and primal -dual methods. We discuss the Kuhn -Tucker conditions for optimality. For the optimization of nonlinear functions subject to nonlinear constraints we address the Lagrange multip lier method. To demonstrate the various optimization problems and solution techniques, we will provide many examples and exercises. To demonstrate the wide range of applicability, these are taken from different fields of science and engineering. To become acquainted with optimization techniques, one computer class is organized in which the basics of the software package Matlab are presented. 78 Literature Hand -outs will be distributed during the course.

To acquire knowledge of the effects of nutrients on cellular and whole -body energy metabolism. To acquire kn owledge of the effects of training on different body systems and how this relates to exercise . Description of the course The aim of the course is to provide students with a solid understanding of the key aspects in energy metabolism, and the effects of nut rients on skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise of different types. The course requires prior knowledge on some simple (bio)chemical concepts (e.g. the structure and function of macromolecules, common forms of chemical reactions, basic cell structure, and metabolism of macromolecules). The course starts with a theoretical framework in which the basics of exercise biochemistry and exercise physiology are discussed. The course builds on the knowledge students have obtained in basic and intermediate cour ses, such as biochemistry, human physiology, and cell biology. In addition, students are encouraged to relate to appropriate knowledge from other courses. This course is meant as a culmination where all relevant knowledge acquired in previous courses comes together and is applied. The first, theoretical part of the course is rounded off with a midterm exam. In the second part of the course students discuss the individual case studies for the take -home assignments. This is done in the form of presentations. By doing so every student to will have the opportunity to discuss their findings and, if applicable, remaining questions or issues relating to the case study, as well as receive feedback on how to proceed.

Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Sciences Prerequisites SCI2019 Linear Algebra and SCI2018 Calculus. Objectives To have the ability to interpret dynamical phenomena as mathematical systems and to cast them into such form. To understand the basic concepts of linear systems theory . To be familiar with analysis techniques for linear systems, to understand their behavior and interaction. To become familiar with some application areas of mathematical systems and models. Description of the course To describe natural phenomena and proce sses, mathematical models are widely used. The focus in this course shall be on dynamical models (i.e., where time plays a role) in particular those that have interaction with the environment through inputs and outputs. Mathematical systems theory provides the framework to deal with such models in a systematic and useful way. First we consider some general aspects of mathematical modeling. Then we briefly address dynamical systems without inputs and outputs - but which may show nonlinear behavior. We study basic properties such as equilibrium points, linearization, and stability. We then switch to linear dynamical models with inputs and outputs. They are used in many different areas of the natural sciences and in engineering disciplines. We discuss the follo wing topics and concepts. Linear difference and differential equations, Laplace transforms, transfer functions of linear systems; controllability, observability, minimality; system representations with an emphasis on state - space representations and canonic al forms; stability; the interconnection of linear systems including feedback; frequency domain analysis and the relationship with filter theory, Fourier analysis, and time series analysis. To demonstrate the applicability of the techniques and concepts, m any examples from science and engineering are mentioned and briefly discussed.

Objectives To give an introduction into the new field of cognitive neuroscience. To learn which methods a brain researcher can use to investigate the neuronal bases of different mental processes. Description of the course Cognitive neuroscience is a research field that originally emerged from a combination of traditional sciences such as philosophy, psychol ogy, medicine and biology that all investigate the principles of perception, behaviour and cognition from different perspectives. As technical developments of different methods and tools in the field of cognitive neuroscience came forth, and as theoretic al application of different mathematical and computer science -based models were used to explain neuronal functioning, additional disciplines, such as physics, mathematics, bioengineering and computer science materialized as an important part of this resear ch field. Subsequently, an effective research project in cognitive neuroscience requires an interdisciplinary cooperation, in which each scientific discipline contributes its respective genuine theories, models, techniques and tools for the mutual investig ation of the neuronal principles of perception, attention, and cognition. But can we really watch the brain at work? Are there ways to identify where exactly, and when exactly activation in the brain is necessary to perform a specific mental process? This course will help to give some answers on the basic principles of brain research and it will show relevant applications of these techniques in different areas of cognitive psychology.

Recommended SCI2040 Microbiology, SCI2009 Physiology, S KI2088 Lab Skills: Genetics, SKI2077 Lab Skills: Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. Objectives To gain more insight in the field of pathobiology. particularly in immunological and oncological diseases To increase appreciation and knowledge of healthy li ving. To provide students with a good basic knowledge required to enter master courses in life sciences. Description of the course In this course students will have an opportunity to learn how modern medicine has benefitted from our knowledge in the fiel ds of (molecular) cell biology and immunology. Pathobiology is the field that deals with disturbance of normal physiological processes and the consequences of it for adequate functioning of our human body. Our challenge has been to arrange a program me that offers insight in the nature, the causes and processes of disease. The emphasis in this course is on diseases of the immune system and oncology. In this respect, this course builds on the knowledge obtained in the UCM course 'Immunology' and 'Cell Biolo gy'. It is our hope that the acquired knowledge will furthermore enable you to better understand and appreciate the newest developments in treatment of these diseases. The program me comprises PBL tasks, workshops and assignments. PBL tasks will be presente d to you in the form of tutorial group meetings and topic -related lectures. The tasks deal with 1) examples of diseases caused by unwanted reactions of the immune system, e.g. chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, and 2) with oncological diseases in which cells have gone astray, circumvent the body's defence mechanisms and give rise to cancer. Workshops will address immunology - and oncology -related research highlights related to diagnostic, preventive and (immuno)therapeutic developments in immunological and oncological diseases. Assignments consist of writing an essay and giving a presentation on a block -related subject for discussion and deepening in the tutorial group meeting.

To apply knowledge from the natural sciences towards problems in society. To give an accurate account of the work and thought process of academic researchers. To learn to critically read scientific news and perform basic literature research. To learn how to ask questions of a scientist and report others research to a wider audience. To gain familiarity with cutting e dge research within the MERLN and M4I institutes. To access new labs and research lines starting with young Assistant Professors within UM. Description of the course The purpose of this course is to introduce students to recent breakthroughs in the physica l and biological sciences that are now being explored for biomedical applications. The topics will come directly from the research expertise of the lecturers, all of whom are young principal investigators in the new research institutes at the UM: MERLN and M4I. The course will cover a broad range of topics, including nanomaterials for regenerative medicine, supramolecular biomaterials, big data and computer learning, electron microscopy, imaging and diagnostic mass spectrometry, and structural biology of tu berculosis. Each of these fields has the potential to address some of society's greatest challenges, including the health and vitality of our ageing population, and this will be discussed in both the lectures and the tasks. Students will gain firsthand exp erience of scientific research taking place at the UM and will have the opportunity to visit research laboratories as part of a demonstration of some of the topics discussed in the lectures. Students will experience unrestricted access for a firsthand acco unt of a new generation of research lines with a new generation of labs. In addition to a final content -based oral exam, there will be two papers for evaluation. For their midterm, students will choose a recent discovery reported in the press and investi gate the scientific claims and integrity of the reporting. In the final paper, the student acts as the reporter, and will write an opinion piece on a topic of research in either MERLN or M4I; this report will be informed by an interview with one of the lec turers. This course is designed for top students with a concentration in the sciences who wish to advance their learning to the next level, beyond textbooks. Students will benefit from close contact with young scientists from diverse fields and will be ex pected to read scientific literature to enhance their learning. Skills learned within this course will be highly applicable for more advanced degrees (Master's, PhD) within the sciences, and within the competitive job market.

Objectives To engage students in scientific inquiry about psychological processes. To introduce students to the various subfields of psychology as an a cademic discipline. To gain a basic understanding of the methods of psychological research. Description of the course Psychology is all around us. Psychology permeates our everyday lives. It is therefore not surprising that the science of psychology has re ceived great interest from behavioral scientists and the general public alike. We are all amateur psychologists. We all want to know what makes us and other people tick! However, our common sense understanding of how people think, feel and act is often mis guided. The self -referential nature of psychology has caused some people to believe that psychology is not a science at all! This course will show you that psychology is a science, and that it encompasses the collaborative efforts of scientists from many d ifferent disciplines. Psychology is the study of behaviour and mental processes, and as psychologists we aim to describe, understand, predict, and sometimes change behaviour. Psychologists study human behaviour and mental life from different perspectives (i.e. biological, individual and social) and at different levels of analysis (from genes and the brain up to the social and cultural level). We will consider what these different approaches have to offer in our quest for an understanding of the human mind, the brain, and behaviour. Along the way, scientific methods of psychological research will be introduced by addressing some of the main questions that drive contemporary psychology: How do we experience fear or happiness? How do we (think we) see the world around us? How do we learn, remember and forget things? Where should we draw the line between normal and abnormal behaviour? How social are humans? When do people harm or help others? Literature Gray, P. & Bjorklund, D.F. (2014), Psychology (7th ed.). New York: Worth Publishers. E-reader .

Erdogan (MA) , Faculty of Law, International and European Law , birsen.erdogan@ maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall/Spring 1 / 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite Students cannot take this course in their first semest er. Objective To provide students with an introduction to the main approaches and many key issues in International Relations. Description of the course This first part of the course discusses several important theories and issues linked to theories such as the foreign policy of great powers, conflicts in the Middle East, democracy and the European Union, global economic structure and the efficiency of international organisations. This part of the course aims to introduce students to the main approahes and themes of International Relations, including international system, wars, power, nuclear weapons, cooperation and international institutions. The second part of the course covers less mainstream approaches and some neglected issues about the 'other' side o f world politics, for instance environmental issues, the problems of the developing world, gendered -biases, economic inequalities, the construction of partial knowledge, the legitimization of power politics, the representation of images, establishment of s tereotypes and the reproduction of hegemony. Since this is an introductory course establishing a foundation for the follow -up international relations courses, it introduces theories and covers discussions about hw each one of them interprets the world. It is important in this course that students become aware of the theoretical richness of the discipline, and that there is not a single 'right' way to answer questions about what is happening around us in the world. Students are given a chance to dicuss and to apply those theories to different and more specific cases and issues. For this reason, this course is an opportunity to learn and use international relations theories, concepts and models in daily news and real time developments in the world. Case studi es or specific issues are provided by the course literature. In addition to this, in some tutorial meetings, students will be asked to bring news items of their own choice from newspapers and news agencies. Thus, the course is based on active student parti cipation. Literature John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens (eds), 7th Edition (2016 ), The Globalization of World Politics .

Arosemen a, Faculty of Law, Human Rights, gustavo.arosemena@maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall/Spring 2 / 4 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite None. Objectives To introduce students to the basic areas of law (contracts, property, torts, criminal law, international law etc.). To familiarize students with the methods of legal reasoning. To illustrate to students how law arises in response to social problem and how it is different from other domains such as politics and morality. Descripti on of the course This course aims to introduce students to the general content of modern law and to the discipline of legal reasoning. These two go together. Law cannot be fully understood in abstraction of the particular way that lawyers, judges and other expert operators of the legal system look at it. Coming out of the course, students should be able to understand what law is and how it is different from (and similar to) morality, identify the main branches of Law and their basic institutions, recognize and differentiate the principal values underlying those branches and understand the nature of legal reasoning and be able to apply it to legal problems. It is often assumed that to study law means essentially to study the law of a particular jurisdiction. A Dutch lawyer studies Dutch law and a German lawyer studies German law, and there is little that they share beyond the name of their chosen profession. This picture is misleading. Despite the fact that every country establishes its own legal system, there is much less diversity in law than what one would imagine. A key theme of this course is that law arises naturally as a solution to various social problems and, to the extent that human societies face the same problems, similar responses appear almost eve rywhere. Even though details may vary, contract, property, inheritance, marriage, constitutions and crimes exist in almost all modern societies. Instead of focusing on specific sets of rules like the Dutch Civil Code, or the French Criminal Code, this cour se focuses on these widely shared problems and widely shared institutional responses.

Objectives To examine the development of Europen integration during the 20th century. To examine the way Europe operates in the 21st century as well as discuss the problems and challenges it faces. Description of the course This course studies the evolution of European integration from the late 1940s untill today. It first seeks to explain and rationalize the birth of the European Communities in the 1950s, their slow development in the 1960s and 1970s as well as the revival of the integration process from the mid 1980s. After having taken a close look at European integration in the East during the Coldwar time, the course covers a chronological and detailed analysis of the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, the death of t he notorious European Constitution and the final adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. The course will enable students to develop their own views on whether the current European Union can be labelled as a success or not, and to assess the numerous critical vi ews expressed in the media on the future development and direction of the European integration process.

Objectives To intro duce students to the concepts, ideas and theoretical underpinnings which constitute the study of government and politics. To outline the scope of political science and its central themes. To provide the intellectual skills necessary for coming to informe d judgments about political issues. Description of the course This course will be an introduction to a field of study that is often subdivided into five or more disciplines. The subdivision list includes International Relations, Comparative Government, Political Theory/Philosophy, Public Policy/Public Administration and finally a state -centric discipline which depends on your country of origin (i.e. American Politics or Dutch Politics to name two). The course will start with a simple examination of the m eaning of the world \"politics.\" How much of politics is really about solving distribution problems? In other words, a limited amount of resources in society must be distributed in some equitable manner. After this initial discussion, the course will move to consider the central themes of Macro politics, with particular emphasis on the classification of political systems, political ideology and political authority. Themes in Micro politics are addressed in the second half of the course. Micro politics ref ers to the study of how individuals \"fit\" into their political system. Micro political topics will include political socialization, political groups, elections, voting, political parties, party systems and political leadership. The course ends with a look at system performance and how to bring about change in political systems when performance is wanting. To help students understand and relate to the political realm in which they exist, each student is required to embark on an individual research paper abou t their country of origin. It is hoped that this assignment will not only allow students to apply concepts learned in the course , but also prompt them to expand their knowledge of how to use resource materials available via the library.

Description of the course The course introduces basic economic ideas and concepts. In the lectures, we start with mark ets, behaviour on markets, outcomes of markets, and different market forms. Here, we use game theory to analyze situations with strategic interaction (e.g., oligopolistic competition). We then turn to the idea of comparative advantage as an explanation for trade patterns. While this first part of the course mainly covers microeconomic topics, the second part is devoted to macroeconomics. Here, we first consider macroeconomic indicators (e.g., GDP). The last lecture is about economic fluctuations (e.g., the financial crisis) and economic policy. Further topics (e.g., the monetary system) may be discussed in the tutorials.

Objective To become conversant in the foundations of sociological thought and theory. To gain understanding of the primary areas and methods of soc iological analysis. To be able to apply sociological concepts and theories to the study of pertinent social problems. To reflect on the relevance and utility of sociology in the 'everyday' world and public policy - making. Description of the course This cour se offers an introduction to the social scientific discipline of sociology. The course focuses on various foundational areas of sociological research and theorizing in order to explore how sociologists approach the study of various social processes, practi ces and problems. Some key questions explored include: What is Society? How are individuals shaped by society? To what extent can and do individuals shape society? How have different societies developed historically? How do societies distribute wealth, inc ome and other resources? How do societies establish particular kinds of political authority and power relations? How are cultural identities, values and beliefs reproduced over time? What are the sources of conflict, consensus and change in society? Workin g from a global comparative perspective, the course will introduce students to different strands of sociological theorizing, the distinctive levels of sociological analysis, and some of the most central areas of sociological investigation, such as class, r ace/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, culture, media, education, marriage, work and globalization. Periodic attention will be given to applying the sociological lens to the analysis of pressing social issues and problems in the contemporary world, such as ineq uality and violence .

Heins , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , manuela.heins@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite One of the 1000 or 2000 level psyc hology courses offered at UCM. Objectives To make students familiar with the most common psychiatric disorders; their clinical pictures, diagnostic criteria, the etiological theories and the empirical findings that either support or refute the theories, cu rrent ways of treatment, and the effectiveness of the therapies. To give students a basic idea of what clinical interviews are and what it feels like to 'have' a psychiatric disorder by writing a patient role and playing that role. To learn basic clinica l interview techniques. Description of the course The course Clinical Psychology is concerned with mental disorders. It is aimed at understanding mental and behavioural distress and/ or dysfunction and thereby learning about how to promote subjective well -being and personal adaptation. On the basis of case descriptions, important clinical pictures of a.o. different anxiety disorders, eating disorders, addictions, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders are examined. Questions that ar e raised continually during the course are: What is the clinical picture of...? Where is the boundary between no need for care and need for care? What causes such a disorder? And what can be done about the disorder? At the end it will be clear that there is a gap between theory and practice, between scientific thinking and clinical treatment. A number of different theoretical schools will also be examined, and these schools explain/treat psychiatric disorders in keeping with their favorite theory. The choice of theory/treatment in most cases is thus based on ideology and not empirical findings, and the question is whether this situation is so desirable. Literature Various textbooks on clinical psychology (can be found in UM library and UCM Reading Room). E-readers.

Smit, Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Cognitive Neuroscience , h.smit@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite SSC1005 Introductio n to Psychology. Objectives To teach students what kind of changes underlie psychological development. To teach students how children develop psychologically in perception, cognition, language, personality and emotions from infancy to adolescence. To teac h students about developmental disorders such as autism and ADHD. To provide students with knowledge on elementary biological processes that underlie psychological development. To provide students with knowledge about the learning processes that children h ave at their disposal such as habituation and social learning. Description of the course The development of and changes in psychological functions from birth through adolescence are the topic of this course. These changes will be illustrated with many empi rical findings and explained by some theoretical models. Such influential older theories as that of Piaget will be compared to more recent information processing models of development. How does a child reason? How does a child becomes faster and better i n learning? How does a child succeed in developing from almost nothing into an adult? How do children learn to perceive and to think (the so -called cognitive development) ? In addition to these questions, attention will be paid to language development beca use it is amazing to see how a newborn baby, who does not understand a word and cannot say anything, learns to talk within a period of two or three years without, incidentally, the use of dictionaries or grammar books. The social -emotional basis for later development will be explored. It concerns the attachment relations to mothers and fathers. How do infants form attachments? Is attachment important? Do our early attachments influence our later emotional development? Other social - emotional topics are temp erament and aggression. Not every development ends in a \"normal\" child. The course will address deviant development too, such as disorders as autism and ADHD. When is an active young boy normal and when do we say that he has ADHD? Literature To be announce d.

Objectives To provide a birds'eye view of organization theory from its historical roots to the main contemporary issues and controversies. To give students an insight into recent theoretical developments in organization theory to bear on organizational management and professional practice. Description of the course Organization theory is a field of social science that has traditionally been occupied by various disciplines. Economists, sociologists, (social) psychologists, political scientists and cultural anthropologists all have entered the debate in explaining the role and functionin g of organizations and their members. The course starts off with the fundamental question: Why study organizations? Why study theories about organizations and organizing? Is there any immediate practical value to such studies? From then on we deal with v ariety of topics such as design thinking, basic organizational design configurations; organizational culture; environmental contingencies; radical versus continuous change; the impact of institutions; managing innovation in and between organizations; and n ew organizational forms such as virtual and meta -organizations. Literature Academic journal articles, (business) press articles, case texts, et c. Instructional format Introductory lecture and tutorial group meetings: based on PBL with short students' prese ntations at the end.

Nievelstein , School of Business and Economics, Department of Marketing and Supply Chain Management s.nievelstein @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite None. Recommended SSC1027 Principl es of Economics. Objectives To give students an introduction to the communication of brands to consumers. On the one hand a strong theoretical foundation will be built by studying the textbook chapters and journal articles (E - reader). On the other hand, w e will continuously translate this theory to practice, by means of short articles from the business press (E -reader), brief student presentations, and one larger group project. Next to being instructive and interesting, this course can also be a lot of fun . We are confronted with brands and advertising every single day, and it is challenging to explore the processes by which this is done. To have an in depth understanding of the theories concerning branding, marketing communication and consumer behavior, a nd of the implications of these theories for marketing management. Skills that will be developed/ enhanced during this course are: presentation skills, teamwork skills, writing skills, analytical skills, reflection skills and creativity skills. Description of the course This course covers foundations of brand management and marketing communications (including advertising). The course will take a strong consumer -based focus, therefore the foundation of branding and advertising in consumer behavior and consum er psychology theories will be discussed. We will discuss theory that is at the foundation of branding and advertising and then apply it through team assignments on students' chosen brands. The course consists of two parts: In the first part we will deal with brand management: In the brand management part the nature of brands in consumers' minds, the concept of brand equity and instruments to build and leverage brands will be discussed. In the second part we will focus on integrated marketing communicat ions. In the integrated marketing communications part we will have a look at the concept of Integrated Marketing Communications, the communication process and theories of consumer behavior and response. Literature To be announced Instructional format This course consists of 13 tutorial group meetings. Most of the educational group meetings are structured as follows:In the first hour we will critically reflect on and discuss the literature for that meeting. We will explore the theoretical. Concepts discusse d in the articles and chapters and make sure that everyone understands the big picture.In the second hour, we will apply the studied literature to practice. The tutorial groups will be divided into three or four teams, and each team will be responsible fo r a brand during the whole course. For most sessions there is a small team assignment to be prepared by each team about the specific brand the team has chosen. In essence it means using \"your\" brand to give a practical example of the literature. Furthermo re there will be a mid -term assessment in the form of a paper of maximum 8 pages, in which you will have to individually reflect on the brand management topic we discussed in the first part of the course. In week 7 there will be a final assessment in the f orm of a team presentation (an integrated communications plan) about your brand and a proposed brand extension. Students' assignment is to reflect on the decision of extending the brand into the proposed category, to decide what the brand extension should look like and to set up a launch plan for the brand extension (an IMC plan).

Prerequisite SSC1027 Principles of Economics . Objective To understand and analyze the markets of information goods. Description of the course An information good - such as for instance a book or software - significantly differs from a usual good, since it has a very high fixed cost for producing the first copy and a negligible marginal cost for producing every additional copy. Yet, markets of information goods obey the main principles of economic theory. The aim of the course is to study the market of information goods. We will analyze topics from the theory of information goods, such as versioning, bundling or lock -in. The requirement for the course is a solid backgroun d in microeconomics.

Objectives To g ive students the ability to apply basic bookkeeping (making journal entries and preparing basic financial statements) and management accounting techniques (e.g. cost analysis, cost behavior). To provide an understanding of international accounting rules an d principles. To provide an understanding of the basics of related fields like corporate governance, auditing and management control. Description of the course Accounting is usually studied from a financial point of view. This conventional view sees accoun ting as identifying, measuring and communicating financial information to enable informed judgments and decisions by the users of information. From this financial perspective, accounting is mainly split into two complementary fields: financial accounting a nd management accounting. In financial accounting the external use of accounting information is discussed. The most important outcome of the financial reporting process is the annual report, containing the firm's financial statements. During the course stu dents will learn essential bookkeeping techniques, that is, how to make the necessary journal entries and prepare basic financial statements. Furthermore, the underlying principles of financial accounting rules will be studied. In discussing the subject of management accounting, which has an internal focus (aimed at managers), the course will concentrate on the value of management accounting information for the internal decision -making process. In general, the purpose of management accounting is to facilita te (e.g., cost calculations) and influence decision -making (e.g., performance evaluation). This course is however not bound by this (narrow) financial framework. It acknowledges that accounting is gradually evolving from an entirely financially oriented d iscipline to one that also studies non-financial information, including contemporary concepts such as corporate governance and corporate social responsibility. As such, it discusses accounting within a broader framework, extending the notion of accounting to a societal phenomenon. In this respect we will also discuss the role accounting has possibly played in the recent financial crisis. A topic of special importance in accounting and accountability nowadays is corporate governance. In essence, corporate g overnance deals with the relationships between a company's management, its board of directors, shareholders and other stakeholders. Specifically, the course will discuss some major important accounting scandals (Enron, WorldCom) and the role corporate gove rnance played in these scandals. Literature Bhimani, A., C.T.

Westendorp , Faculty of Law, International and European Law, i.westendorp@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite SSC1007 Introduction to Law or another law course. Objective To provide a broad and general insight in the basic concepts of int ernational public law and the dynamics of international law in the last few decades. Description of the course In particular since World War II international law has been subject to considerable change, both in scope and in content. The number of State ac tors has grown as the result of the process of decolonization. A large number of international organizations and institutions have emerged as subjects of international law, and also individuals have international legal personality to some extent. Transnati onal corporations increasingly constitute an important economic power factor in international relations. The need for international cooperation became progressively evident in order to maintain international peace and security, to promote economic and soci al development, to safeguard the environment and to uphold human dignity. The course focuses on some of the more traditional issues of international law as well as on some new developments. The topics are: the changing nature and enforceability of internat ional law, subjects and sources of international law including the law of treaties, recognition, territory, human rights, the law of the sea, State responsibility, international environmental law, peaceful settlement of disputes, and the use of force. One session will be in the form of a moot court on an international environmental law case for which students will prepare by writing a (short) memorandum of pleading. Both the paper and the oral pleading are part of the mid -term examination.

Objectives To help students acquire knowledge of recent as well as classic theories in the field of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, for short - and long -term declarative memory. To provide knowledge of the principles of fo rgetting, reconstructive processes and false memories. To provide knowledge about the biological basis of memory acquisition, storage and retrieval. To familiarize students with relevant basic brain anatomy. To provide experience with common experimental d esigns in memory research . Description of the course In our everyday cognitive functions we rely heavily on multiple types of memory. This includes seemingly trivial actions, such as remembering your grocery shopping list, to navigate through Maastricht, a nd to have a sense of your own identity. How are memories formed and maintained in our mind and brain? Do we have multiple memory systems, or just one memory mechanism from which the richness of memory is derived? What happens if our memory fails us, when we forget or when we remember falsely? This course investigates the cognitive correlates (information processing) and neurobiological mechanisms of declarative, or explicit memory. We will discuss a number of cognitive models, including Baddeley's Working Memory model, the Modal model, and interference theory in forgetting. In addition, we will discuss synaptic and molecular mechanisms of memory, such as long -term potentiation (LTP), the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and retrieval, and the cog nitive and neurobiological mechanisms that may strengthen or weaken an existing memory. These research topics rely on many decades of cognitive and neuroscientific research that has been awarded with Nobel prizes several times (in 2000 to Prof. Kandel for synaptic plasticity and in 2014 to Profs. O'Keefe and Moser/Moser for hippocampal place cells and navigation). Throughout the course, we will discuss relevant methodological issues regarding memory research. Importantly, please be aware that brain anatomy and function are an important part of this course; an interest in and understanding of these fields at the level of Introduction to Psychology or higher is strongly recommended. In addition to the tutorial meetings, students will complete a practical and paper assignment in which memory performance of real subjects is assessed. Literature To be announced. E-reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, practical meeting, and lectures. During the practical meeting, a number of memory tests will be s tudied. Students are required to test several subjects (e.g. friends, family, fellow students) and write a report on their findings. Examination Assessment will be based on a practical report and a final exam. 106 SSC2027 Law and Society Course coordinator Dr. S. Hardt, LL.M, Faculty of Law, Public Law, sascha.hardt@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences Prerequisites SSC1029 Sociological Perspectives, SSC1007 Introduction to Law , or SSC1003/SSC2065 Theories of Social Order . Objectives To study law as a social phenomenon and discuss several theoretical approaches to law and society. To examine a variety of legal processes, such as conflict resolution, lawmaking, social control and change, and to seek to under stand how they function empirically. Description of the course Legal scholars generally focus their attention on the law as it appears in books. They look at formal manifestations of the law, such as constitutions, statutes, legal rulings and court structu res. While this is certainly an important aspect of studying law, we would miss quite a lot if we limited our attention to the formal structures of law, and ignored the larger society in which law functions. While law in action bears some resemblance to la w in books, law as a social phenomenon is often far more complex than is apparent from the formal manifestations of law alone. This course looks at the law in action: it studies law as a social phenomenon. Only when we understand how the major elements of a legal system function together in a specific social context, can we really understand how law affects society and how society in turn shapes law. The first part of the course will introduce the sociological study of law. We will give an overview of the f ield, discuss several prominent theoretical approaches and examine various methods of researching socio -legal questions. The second part of the course will examine several legal processes in detail, using the tools that were developed in the first half of the course. In particular, we will look at the organization of law, the making of law, law as a means of social control, dispute resolution and law as a means of social change. Literature Sutton, J.R.

We will engage with the works of early theorists such as Auguste Comte, Emile Durkheim, Karl Marx, Max Weber, and George Simmel. Some of the basic lines of inquiry we will pursue include: What were the big questions driving the formation 'classical sociology'? Are these questions still relevant today? What is the basis of social order and structure? How and why do societies change? What are the causes and consequences of conflict in society? What place does the individual hold in the study of society? Throughout the course, we will read original materials accompanied some contemporary interpretations of the classics.

Dekker, Facult y of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, teun.dekker@ maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences & Humanities Prerequisite COR1004 Political Philosophy. Recommended HUM1007 Introduction to Ph ilosophy. Objectives To provide students with a basic grasp of the evolution of political thought in the Western tradition. To teach students how to study historical works of philosophy. To identify how issues and questions in contemporary politics and co ntemporary political thought have their roots in historical writings. Description of the course When considering modern political issues it is often instructive, and sometimes humbling, to realize that many such issues have deep historical roots. For as lo ng as human beings have been living together in societies, questions concerning how these societies should be organized have been asked. The answers that historical writers have given to these questions are still relevant today and still inform current pol itical thinking. By investigating the questions historical philosophers were grappling with and how they sought to answer them, we may perceive more acutely the questions facing our societies and discover how we might answer those questions. We will study important texts by 8 seminal political thinkers in the Western political tradition , from several periods in history: Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith and Hegel. Our aim will be to understand the particular problems they were s eeking to solve and how or whether they did so. Although the main texts we will use are historical, the methods we will use are analytic. We will also read several modern texts, which take up themes from these historical texts. By applying the tools acquir ed in Political Philosophy (COR1004) to these texts, we will be able to come to terms with them and apply historical insight to current issues. Literature Cahn, S.

Objectives To provide an introduction to interdisciplinary concepts essentia l to the study of children's rights (human rights and psychology). To provide an introduction to the convention on the Rights of the Child (content, interpretation, implementation and monitoring) . Description of the course This course intends to provide a basic introduction into the root causes of large -scale and serious violations of children's rights all over the world, including in high -income states. 'Root causes' refers, on the one hand, to unmet basic developmental needs of children and, on the other hand, to harmful child -rearing practices in the present and the past. Understanding these root causes, their historical context, and their serious consequences for individuals and society, is seen as essential for further (specialized) study in children's rights (related to, e.g., migration, trafficking, armed conflict, child labor, international monitoring, etc.). Therefore, this course aims to introduce students, on an elementary level, into the science of Early Childhood (Attachment and brain developmen t) and the new unified science of human development based on the ACE Study (long -term consequences of Adverse Childhood Experiences, that is, of childhood trauma and toxic stress), and to relate these new fields of academic knowledge to the universal norma tive State -Parent -Child framework of the CRC (Convention on the Rights of the Child, UN 1989).

To understand theories, concepts and historical roots of global social, political and economic inequality. To gain knowledge of the main global and international actors and networks in the field of development, including their aim, impact and effectiveness. To gain knowledge abo ut contemporary issues in development and the developing world, in particular: o Democratization, human rights and development o Health and development o Global migration and remittances o Food security, natural resources and global crises To analyze changes in 2 1st century geopolitical perspectives with regards to development, including the growing impact of the BRICS countries. To obtain insight in the relations between the various global crises and recent development policies. To discuss future development scen arios. Description of the course This course critically examines structural issues of development on a global scale. Globalization refers to the increasing interdependence of markets, states and civil societies and the resulting effects on people and their environment. By also focusing on inequality - that is, the structural differentiation among actors in terms of access to means, opportunities and resources - issues of (re -)distribution are taken into account as well. The course investigates inequalities and interdependencies on a global, international, national and local level, while considering the role of public, private and civil society actors. Thus, it aims to understand underlying development processes and unlock the ongoing debates. The course focu ses on the following themes: globalization and development; the Global Goals for Sustainable Development; history of inequality; agencies of development; democratization, human rights and development; health and development; global migration and remittance s; and food security, natural resources and global crises.

Recommended SSC2061 Statistics I. Students taking this course should be prepared to use and manipulate basic mathematical expressions. A good knowledge of the analy sis of common functions and their derivatives will be an asset for the course. Objectives To introduce students to the basics of microeconomic theory. To acquire skills in applying its analytical tools to real -life economic problems. Description of the course Economics is the study of exchange and tradeoffs. Qestions about what to buy, what to produce and how to allocate time all involve tradeoffs between different alternatives, and economists develop models to better understand the process by which indi viduals and firms make such decisions. With these models in hand, economists can then develop criteria by which to judge the efficiency and effectiveness of market structures, policies and institutions. This course is a first introduction to microeconomic s. It will present an overview of the basic models that constitute the foundations of modern economics. We will build the theory of the consumer and the producer from the bottom up to create models of market behavior. The goal is not to offer a complete de scription of the world as it exists; rather, we will seek to simplify reality with the goal of providing a concise description of a broad class of real -world circumstances. As we progress we will touch on examples of theory in applied settings to highligh t and discuss how these models characterize much of the economic behavior we observe in the real world. After developing models of the market as a whole, we'll explore extensions of the theory to the strategic behavior of firms and individuals. The theory of strategic behavior will then be used to analyze, among other things, competition policy, environmental policy and political competiton between parties. Literature Varian H.

Recommended SSC1007 Introduction to Law and/or an interest in Law. Objectives The aim of this course is to provide psychology (but also law) students intere sted in legal psychology with an introduction to topics in this field: To gain a general impression of the topics that are within the scope of psychology & law and have knowledge regarding current issues and controversies in PsychLaw research. To be able t o give descriptions of methods typically used and experimental work done in these disciplines. To have insights into the problems that arise when psychology is applied to law in practice . Description of the course This course focuses on applications of psy chology to the legal system. It will provide students with insights and knowledge about typical themes within legal psychology. Such themes range from how reliable eyewitness testimonies in court are to whether criminals have a brain dysfunction making them permanently dangerous to society, to the role of experts in court. The role of psychologists within these themes is to ask questions that have a direct relevance to the legal arena and to conduct research to address these questions. Drawing from areas of social, cognitive, developmental, clinical and neuropsychology this course will deal with questions such as: Why do people commit crimes? Are children more susceptible to suggestion than adults? What is an expert witness? How reliable are different kinds of evidence (eyewitness testimonies, confessions etc.)? Are all criminals competent to stand trial? etc. A number of controversies will also be discussed including the practice of police interrogations, the insanity defense, and the role of psychologists i n court and the use of polygraph as a lie-detector test.

Can, School of Business and Economics , Economics, b.can@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences NB: This course was form erly known as SSC2052 Public Finance. Prerequisite SSC2048 Intermediate Microeconomics, Basic Calculus (differentiation). Objectives To provide a basic knowledge of the functioning and the economic significance of the public sector, with an emphasis on int ernational issues. To be able to reflect and recognize the strength but also some of the limitations of traditional economic theory. To be able to critically assess political and economic discussions pertaining to the public sector. Description of the c ourse Public Economics (or Public Finance) deals with the formulation, execution and effects of government policy, or more generally with non -market mediated policies. Government and government -like organisations differ from other organisations because the y can use legal coercion as a means for the realisation of their aims. The typical allocation mechanism for scarce resources in markets is the price mechanism, which - under particular circumstances - aggregates information and preferences of many differen t individuals in an efficient way. In many instances, however, the necessary requirements for efficient market solutions to the resource allocation problem are not given. This is where the public sector comes into play. When the price mechanism is not avai lable or does not yield an efficient or otherwise desirable solution to an allocation problem other mechanisms for aggregating information and references are needed to allocate scarce resources and coordinate economic and social behaviour. This course prov ides basic knowledge of the functioning and the economic significance of the public sector with an emphasis on international aspects. Some of the topics to be dealt with in the course are: governmental decision -making on the national and international leve l, role and management of the state in times of globalisation and transnational threats like global warming and international terrorism, important issues pertaining to government expenditure, taxation, and other activities (like public goods, international institutions, education, social security, health care), and mechanisms of political influence (elections and lobbying). These issues will be analysed from a normative - welfare economic - as well as from a positive - explanatory - perspective, with emphas is on the relevance and limitation of traditional economic theory.

Objectives To make students familiar with basic issues in public health. To make students familiar with basic issues in public policymaking. To make students familiar with basic issues in public policymaking on public health. Description of the co urse Students will become familiar with the following topics in public health: the epidemiology of mortality and disease; the determinants of health; the ageing of society and its implications for medical care; the unequal distribution of health; moral iss ues in public health; the economics of public health; health systems analysis; public health genomics; markets and public health; public health disasters. Students will become familiar with the following topics in public policymaking: the various component s of public policy (values, objectives, instruments, policy paradigm); the concept of the policy cycle (problem recognition and definition, agenda building, policy formation, policy implementation, policy evaluation and feedback); theoretical approaches of public policy making (rational model, political model, institutionalist model); stakeholder and policy community analysis; types of state -society relationships (elitist model, pluralist model, corporatist model, regulatory agency model, communitarian mode l); the role of power in public policymaking. Regarding the third objective, students will learn to combine the knowledge gained under the first and second objective. Concretely, they learn to understand the implications of public health issues for public policymaking (e.g. how can we effectively tackle the problem of overweight/obesity or the problem of the unequal distribution of health? Which moral issues arise in public policymaking?) and, conversely, the implications of the structure and process of pub lic policymaking for addressing public health issues (e.g. how are public health issues defined? Who dominates the agenda building process? What are the implications of the rational, political and institutionalist model for public health policymaking? What about the role of the state and society in public health policymaking? What are the specific characteristics of public policymaking in case of public health disasters?)

Objectives To provide an understanding of the how, where, when, whom and why of entrepreneurial initiative. However, o ur ambitions go beyond helping you to learn, we also want you to feel (more) empowered to engage in the entrepreneurial process itself: You are able to explain and illustrate the unique qualities of the entrepreneurial process. You are able to explain and illustrate the unique qualities of entrepreneurs. You are able to explain how entrepreneurial opportunities are discovered and created. You are able to explain how entrepreneurs select their opportunities. You are able to explain how entrepreneurs link val ue creation to value appropriation. Description of the course Not many will contest the societal impact of enterprising individuals and entrepreneurial ventures on our economies. Entrepreneurs may start -up companies that challenge (and often replace) incum bents. In the process, they create new jobs and apply competitive pressure on established firms. Entrepreneurs supposedly have an important direct and indirect effect on driving innovation. Despite the heroic image of successful entrepreneurs, entrepreneur ship is much more about failure than about success. What motivates entrepreneurial types to venture of on a path that (at least statistically) will result in failure? Are they na\u00efve, or are they stupid. In this course you will study factors that drive entr epreneurs and the entrepreneurial process. We will focus on new venture gestation: the initial stages of the process that may result in a new company to emerge. Throughout the course you will explore how entrepreneurs not only rely on generic business mana gement principles, but also how they cope with the uncertainty, risk, scarcity of time, capital and other resources that is inherent to all entrepreneurial venturing. Perhaps you will conclude that many entrepreneurs are in fact not really good managers (g ood entrepreneurs will compensate for this by hiring better managers). We start the course by explore the process dynamics of entrepreneurial activity. We then will explore the origins of entrepreneurial opportunity, review how entrepreneurs screen and dev elop the opportunities that they discover, and you will unravel how entrepreneurs seek to appropriate the returns from their enterprising behaviour. This is not a \"how -to\" course, instead the course will introduce you to relevant scholarly insights that p rovide (future) entrepreneurs, an evidence base for entrepreneurial action. Those students that are ready to enact entrepreneurship may want to register for the LaunchBase Pre - incubation programme that we provide to enterprising students and alumni . Litera ture Each student is to select and read a published biography of an entrepreneur. E-reader with papers & Reader with cases (You need to pay for your cases at http://www.thecasecentre.org, approx. \u20ac20). Shane, S. A. 2002. The foundations of entrepreneurshi p. Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Pub. (suggested, not required). Instructional format Case lectures and tutorial group meetings. In the tutorial group meetings you explore the literature. In the case lectures you will explore how the scholarly insights can be used to inform the practice of (ambitious) entrepreneurship. The biography project invites you to link your learning to the life history of an entrepreneur. Examination Student evaluation will be based on 1) a take -home midterm test, consisting of open questions; 2) class participation; and 3) the biography paper. 120 SSC2059 Social Movements Course coordinator Dr. K.

To become conversant in the primary methods driving social movement research. To evaluate and assess social movement research in a critical and constructive manner. To design a case study and initiate an original empirical study of social movements. To reflect on the relevance and utility of studying social movements. Description of the course This course is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of social movements. An overview of the field will be provided by identifying key concepts, theories and methods through examinati on of a variety of case studies. Salient themes addressed will include: democracy, identity, globalization, civil rights, environmentalism, gender, sexuality, class and ethnicity/race. While much attention will be placed on social movements within Europe and North America, a global -comparative perspective will be periodically emphasized. The over -arching goal of the course will be to reveal the ways in which social movements work to both produce and resist social change. Some of the main questions address ed in the course will be: What is a social movement? Why do people join social movements? How do movements gain/lose momentum? What is the relationship between social movements and democracy? And, under what conditions do social movements 'succeed'? Liter ature E-reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings.

Students with substantial high school experience in Ma thematics (For an indication of the relevant topics, see SCI -M, p. vi -viii) can contact the coordinator to request a waiver. Objectives To perform your own (first) research using quantitative techniques. To develop the abilities to read, understand and criticize scientific articles in the domain you study or work, that use quantitative techniques. To gain experience in actively performing such a quantitative analysis yourself, making use of applets provided through the internet. Description of the co urse The course Statistics I provides a general introduction to quantitative research methods commonly used in social and life sciences. Emphasis is on methods of data collection and types of data, descriptive statistics, regression modeling, discrete and continuous random variables, and inferential statistics: the construction of confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, null and alternative hypotheses, p -values. The structure of the course is based on a new paradigm in teaching statistics: that of a simu lation and randomization based approach (please see http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5Dnw46eC -0o for an intuitive motivation). This instructional principle departs from the classical statistics curriculum of first covering descriptive statistics, next discuss probability theory and models of random variables, continue with sampling theory, to deal with inferential statistics only in the very end of the course. Randomization -based courses make a drastical change, and start with inferent ial statistics from the very beginning. A crucial element in the new approach are the applets you will find in the internet, and that allow you to simulate many samples from a hypothesized population, or from a known population, in order to visually clarif y statistical concepts. Active learning is based on solving 5 or 6 statistical explorations from the text: four collaboratively, in the two tutorial sessions, and 1 or 2 individually, at the end of the week. Next, an important role in this course is for th e student project. This project starts in the first weeks, with students working with surveys, and in doing so, collecting data on student characteristics, such as mathematical and statistical prior knowledge, metacognitive abilities and general study styl es and habits. In the Student project, you will perform a statistical analysis of your own data, and after collecting the data of all students, you will develop a statistical model that explains students' achievements in terms of background variables and i nput factors.

Heins , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , manuela.heins@maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences & Sciences Prerequisites SSC1005 Introduction to Psychology or SCI2036 Artificial Intelligence. Objectives To give students on overview of the study of the human mind as information pr ocessing machine over time and to provide insight into the foundations of cognitive science. To make students familiar with the basic concepts used in theories on human information processing and the experimental designs used in cognitive psychology. To pr ovide an insight into the character of cognitive processes; various forms of perception, learning, thinking, etc. Description of the course The mechanization of thought (i.e. regarding the human mind as an information processing machine not unlike a comput er) has always repelled and attracted psychologist and philosophers after the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. As a result, human thought wasn't always the topic of psychology, especially at the time of the rise of radical behaviorism in the early 20th century. Anything referring to mental processes was not to be used in explanations of human behavior. However, with the inventions of machines that could think in combination with the failure of behaviorism to account for even the simples t of human behavior, the mind was back in psychology. And back with a vengeance. During the '60 and '70 of the 20th century information processing theory became the leading paradigm in cognitive psychology. Information processing theory deals with how people receive, store, integrate, retrieve, and use information. The present course is concerned with theoretical and empirical perspectives on human cognition, perception and the experimental methods to study cognition and perception. Eleven basic topics of cognitive science/ psychology are discussed using a Problem Based Learning format. The topics studied in the course are amongst others: The history of the study of the human mind as information processing machine, schema's, scripts, plans, and frames, kno wledge representation, top down and bottom up processing, semantic networks and spreading of activation, intelligence and individual differences, etc. Literature E-reader available on Student Portal .

Capalbo , Faculty of Psychology m.capalbo@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sci ences Prerequisite SSC1005 Introduction to Psychology. Objective Gain insight into the two key subdivisions in the study of human individual differences: personality and intelligence. Description of the course The first part of the course will provide an overview of the most important theories, techniques and methods used by psychologists in the context of personality and intelligence research. Can you measure personality with questionnaires? How many personality traits are there? Does intelligence have mo re than one dimension? During the second part, we will look at explanations for these individual differences. Why are there differences between humans? What role does biology and heredity play? What is the role of evolution in the development of individual differences? During the third part, we will provide a first impression of the role of personality and intelligence in the prediction of life events. How important is intelligence for your career? Do compliant people earn more or less money? Do personality traits predict the duration of a marriage? We will also focus on the reverse question: Do characteristics such as conscientiousness or extraversion change due to certain life events? In the fourth part of the course we will take a look at practical appli cations of the knowledge on personality and intelligence from the perspective of a clinician and an HR professional. What happens when persons are bothered by their personality in such a way that it is a matter of a personality disorder? How can organizati ons select the right personalities for a specific job? Today, personality psychology and research into other differences between humans, such as intelligence, forms an important fundamental basis for the daily practice of psychologists. Psychologists sele ct people for jobs in corporate life based on personality and intelligence research. If psychologists treat psychological disorders, they often first collect the personality and intelligence information of a patient. Personality psychology and intelligence research are therefore an important basis for every student who wants to work in such diverse fields as clinical research, forensic psychology or human resource management.

Student who have already taken SSC1003 Theories of Social Order cannot take it again. Prerequisite SSC1029 Sociological Perspectives or SSC2028 Classical Sociology or COR1005 Theory Construction and Modelling Techniques Objectives To int roduce students to the way classical and modern sociologists theorize about society and in particular, to introduce students to a core theoretical issue in the social sciences: the problem of social order. To develop skills in identifying and analyzing the oretical arguments. To apply abstract theories to new concrete empirical situations. Description of the course The course \"Theories of Social Order\" focuses on one of the most important problems in sociology: the problem of social order. The root of the pr oblem of social order lies in the distinction between the interests of individuals and those of groups (and societies), which these individuals constitute. Whenever individual interest conflicts with group interest, social order is put at some kind of risk . A solution to the problem requires the reconciliation of individual and collective interest, but theorists have provided several distinct strategies for doing so. In this course, we will consider the five most prominent mechanisms to produce social order : individuals, hierarchies, markets, groups and networks. Classical and foundational texts by important sociologists like Marx, Weber, and Durkheim are combined with contemporary extensions and empirical applications that, in some form or another, apply th e arguments made by these earlier scholars. The editorial introductions by Hechter & Horne provide the background for each of these texts and link them to the central problem: how to achieve social order. Throughout the course, the strengths and weaknesses of the various theories are discussed, and attempts are made to relate them to contemporary events whenever feasible. In this way, students will improve their understanding of the social world and will learn to apply the analytical tools to real -life phen omena. Literature Hechter, M. & Horne, C. (2009).

Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite SSC2024 International Law ; Recommended : SSC2037 Conflict Resolution Objectives To provide a substantive introduction to the protection of civilians in situations of armed conflict by examining relev ant international norms and the practice of states and international organizations in an evolving context . Description of the course The large number of civilian casualties and the enormous refugee movements in the conflict in Syria and elsewhere have draw n renewed attention to the often dramatic plight of civilians during armed conflicts, and to the serious problems in protecting them against the effects of hostilities. After an introduction of the main characteristics of contemporary armed conflict we wil l have a closer look at prominent norms of international humanitarian law aimed at protecting civilians (ius in bello), such as the principles of distinction and proportionality. We will examine issues and dilemmas concerning their application in today's w ar zones. Attention will also be paid to the relevance of human rights norms. An important part of the course will be devoted to the practical contributions external actors are trying to make for the physical and humanitarian protection of civilians caught up in conflict. Based on examples from the field this will primarily cover methods employed by UN military and police forces and international humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC and UN agencies. Protections against attack, access for life saving humanitarian assistance and the specific situation of internally displaced persons and internees will be examined more closely. We will briefly also look at contributions of UN human rights mechanisms. The course will then zoom in on the protection provid ed by asylum to persons escaping from conflict and persecution, by discussing the international criteria for refugee status. We will examine the challenges involved in managing large scale refugee movements in a protection sensitive manner. Approaching the overall theme from a holistic perspective, the course will explore to what extent (the threat of) prosecution and punishment may contribute to the prevention of international crimes. We will focus in this context on the activities of the International Cri minal Court. Finally, due attention will be paid to measures by states and organizations for the protection of civilians against terrorist acts, and possible tensions with the requirement to comply with norms of international law .

We discuss the theoretical context and the development of economic thinking. We will extensively pay attention to different views that exist in economic theory. Description of the course Starting from societal problems we will discuss the development of economic thinking. We start with the basic question in any economy: given a number of consumers and a labor force and an amount of capital, how can we organize the economy such that producers produce what consumers want? Who may produce the good? Who can consume the goods? This is the basic question about what to produce? How? And for whom? Second, what organization maximizes welfare? What determines the prices of the goods and the wages? We discuss developments in thinkin g about this central problem of scarcity in an economy. Second, we discuss underutilization of resources in an economy of which unemployment is a major example. Since unemployment is related to many social problems such as poverty and crime, unemployment m ust be prevented. How? How have economists tried to solve this problem? The various views that have been developed to tackle this problem will be discussed in the second part of the course. We will discuss various views and discuss positive and normative a spects of economic thinking. In the discussions we also touch upon the question what economics as a science is and the boundaries of economics. Literature To be announced. We use a textbook and articles .

Objectives To understand the history and the complexity of European Foreign Policy. To understand the political -institutional process in which EU Foreign Policy is made. To grasp the content of European Foreign Policy. To understand relations with important regions and particular states that the European Union has established strong foreign policy relationships. Description of the course In order for the EU to ever be truly a federation there should be a single currency and a common foreign policy. One of these two criteria has been met in most of the Member States of the EU. Does this mean that a major step has been taken on the way to a federation? What of the common foreign policy requirement? Is th ere one foreign policy or many, at least when crises like the Iraq war occur? What is the probability of a European Foreign Policy akin to that of the USA ever forming? These are some of the questions the course will tackle. The course is divided into two sections. The first section will start with a focus on the importance of European Foreign Policy for foreign policy analysis and vice versa. It will also consider what theories in International Relations can help explain the conduct of European Foreign Po licy. This section will then move on to consider the institutional framework of the EU's foreign policy, the role of the Member States in the formation of policy and then finally consider in more detail the main external relations policies themselves . The main policy areas include Common Defense and Homeland Security Policy, Economic and Trade Policy and Enlargement Policy. The second section deals with the important regions and particular states that the European Union has established strong foreign pol icy relationships. These important regions and states include the United States, Russia, the Developing world and Emerging Economies. The second section ends with a consideration of the EU's future role as a global player. Literature Keukeleire, Stephan an d Tom Delreux. (2014).

Objectives To develop a critical analytical approach to public policy evaluation, analysis and public policy making. To provide students with a basic understanding of the key concepts, approaches, models and methods of public policy analysis & evaluation. To develop the basic skills needed to conduct public policy analysis & evaluation and to communicate the results effectively. To provide students with an understanding of the roles and ethics of the poli cy analyst/evaluator in the policy process. Description of the course This course provides students with an academic and at the same time practical and 'hands on' approach to the study of public policy and more in particular, to the professional practice o f policy analysis and evaluation. Public policies can be described as \"a course of government action or inaction in response to public problems\" such as insufficient access to health care or education, environmental degradation, threats to workplace safet y, corruption, overcrowded highways or air pollution (Kraft and Furlong 2010:5). Problems range from relatively simple to highly complex and manifest from the local to the national or global levels. They can reflect conflicts over causes, solutions, proble m definitions as well as over fundamental human values. Decision -makers that take final decisions on these issues need to be informed by sound evidence based policy analysis and evaluation that has carefully weighted, crafted, prescribed and evaluated the policy alternatives. This is important as the decisions taken do not only affect people's lives, but also influence society's key values. It is the task of the policy analyst / evaluator to provide sound evidence, analysis and advice. To acquaint students with, and prepare them for such undertakings, this course is designed to foster critical thinking and understanding about public policy and possible alternative courses of action by deliberating and analyzing the key concepts, models, approaches and metho ds of policy analysis & evaluation, and practicing some of its basic skills. In the first week of the course students explore what policy analysis & evaluation actually is. It intends to shed light on the role of power, politics, institutions and actor s in the policy making process. Subsequently, in the second week the art of problem structuring is explored. In the third week students will be introduced to working with evaluative criteria and choosing policy options for formulating policy advices. With the knowledge gained in these first three weeks students will work in small groups to prepare and present a 'hands on' a policy advice on a real life country case. Finally, just before the midterm exam, students are introduced to two frequently used method s of policy analysis and evaluation: cost benefit and cost effectiveness analysis. The midterm exam consists of two parts: an individually written policy memorandum on a given topic (part 1) and, on the basis of that memorandum, a team role play (part 2 of midterm). After the midterm the focus shifts from having gained the basic knowledge for policy analysis and evaluation (problem structuring, stakeholder analysis, choosing evaluative criteria and using them to benchmark and weigh the different policy alte rnatives) to exploring policy evaluation approaches in more depth. Students will be introduced to plan, process and outcome evaluations on the basis of the realist or theory -based evaluation approach. They will work in small groups on another real life c ase to actually carry out and present a plan (and or) process evaluation themselves. Finally, ethical and accountability aspects of policy analysis and evaluation, as well as the role of the public in this process are explored. The course is built around 6 cases (some spread over 2 tutorials) and 6 lectures by both academics and professional practitioners that share their knowledge and experiences with the students. This together with studying academic and policy literature as well as the 'hands on' work on evaluation cases, provide the main guidance for the student's learning process in this policy analysis & evaluation course. 131 Literature The course combines book chapters from state of the art text books on policy analysis with articles from academic jour nals and real life case study material from practice, next to youtube videos and short documentaries.

Description of the course The emphasis of this course will be on the getting to know some tools and methods used in sustainability assessment. The theoretical knowledge and insights from SCI1016 Sustainable Development: An introduction will be further deepened, and we will analyze several existing case studies to see how the methods and tools were applied. Issues of scale (case studies at global, regional and local level) and of stakeholders (who to involve) and of future -proofing (scenario studies) will be addressed. Key methodological issues and tools will be addressed, such as participatory methods for involving stakeholders, qualitative modeling techniques and scenario analysis, both in normal tutorials and in work sessions which are interspersed with exercises. Ample attention will be paid to t he challenges that can emerge when applying these tools and methods in practice. At the end of the course, students will use the acquired knowledge to design a workplan for an integrated assessment of a case study of their choice (e.g. air quality issues i n Maastricht, the sustainability of Maastricht University or sustainable tourism in Limburg). Literature E-reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, lectures and work sessions . Examination The final grade is based on an individual presentation of method use in an existing integrated assessment and an individual workplan for an integrated assessment of a case study chosen by the student. 134 SSC3017 Social and Environmental Entrepreneurship Course coordinator Dr. M. Carree, School of Business and E conomics, Maastricht Centre for Entrepreneurship, m.carree @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 5 Social Sciences Prerequisites At least two courses at 100 0- or 2000- level in the Sciences and/or the Social Sciences. Recommended SSC2036 Introduction to Business Administration or SCI1016 Sustainable Development. Objectives To understand the key similarities and differences between social and environmental entrepreneurship and commercial entrepreneurship. To understand the relationships between social/environmental problems and social/environmental entrepreneurial opportunity. To obtain practical experience through application of research findings and theoretical predictions to actual challenges and problems that social and /or environmental entrepreneurs face in the starting and growing of their ventures. Description of the course There is an increasing awareness that entrepreneurship can play an important role in solving or alleviating social and/or environmental problems. This course explores the special features of social and environmental entrepreneurship in comparison to commercial entrepreneurship. Attention is given to the ability of social and environmental venturing to solve or alleviate problems that governments, N GOs, or companies fail to address and related topics such as corporate social responsibility, and risks of social marketing. In many cases, social entrepreneurship aims to combine social goals with financial sustainability. Social ventures such as the Bang ladeshi Grameen Bank or the Bangladeshi Aravind Eye Hospitals showcase that profit can be made while serving a social cause. However, social entrepreneurs are not primarily driven by a desire to create economic value, they seek to generate social value. En vironmental ventures such as the British company SolarCentury or the German company E -Max showcase that profit can be made while serving an environmental cause. Other social and environmental entrepreneurial initiatives opt for a not -for-profit status whil e serving their social or environmental cause. Academics have sought to understand why, how and when social and environmental venturing can have a lasting impact. The emerging literature on social/environmental entrepreneurship is used in this course to e nable you to learn how also you can make a difference by pursuing (or helping others to pursue) a social or environmental opportunity. In this course, you will build on the theoretical knowledge and insights from course 1 (SCI1016) to explore how private ( and individual) initiative may help to address environmental or social problems. You will move beyond exploring the relative importance of such initiatives and try to understand the processes through which social and environmental venturing can seek to hav e an impact. Throughout this course you will review and synthesise the relevant literature, and learn how to deploy (conflicting) empirical findings and/or theoretical claims in the addressing of some of the key challenges that social and environmental ent repreneurs face.

Tempelaar , School of Business and Economics, Quantitative Economics , d.tempelaar@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisites SSC2061 Statistics I. Objectives To familiarize students with quantitative research methods, building on SSC2061 Statistics I . To develo p the abilities to read, understand and criticize articles in the domain of your concentration, as a passive use of your knowledge of quantitative techniques. To gain experience in actively performing a quantitative analysis yourself, making use of the (more advanced features of the) tool SPSS . Description of the course In Statistics II, we resume the thread of Statistics I: a discussion of the basic tools of inferential statistics: confidence intervals and hypothesis tests (which in turn involved concept s like null and alternative hypotheses, Type I and Type II errors, rejection points and p -values), all these concepts illustrated in the context of the one -sample tests. In this course you will encounter a whole battery of additional tests, enabling you to examine a large array of questions that may come up in social sciences and life sciences, and that focus on cases you will encounter most frequently: multivariate cases, rather than univariate cases. In the first weeks, we discuss amongst others the two -sample t -test (allowing you to compare the mean of a quantitative variable between two populations), ANOVA (same, for more than two populations), the paired -sample t -test and the chi -square test (allowing you to establish relationships between qualitative variables, using contingency tables). But the main dish of the course is obviously regression analysis, a very flexible technique which allows you to relate a dependent variable to a number of independent or explanatory variables. There will be a strong f ocus on actively doing statistics. Using the great 'How is Life?' data set of OECD, that compares quality of life in many countries, you will do weekly empirical investigations, using SPSS as your modeling tool. And at the finish of the course, you will do another, more major and less structured empirical analysis in SPSS: your student project. The project measures your active mastery of statistical data analysis. In the final exam your passive mastery will be assessed. The exam will consists of pieces of statistical analyses, with the student having to interpret and criticize the outcomes of these analyses. Weekly assignments, as well as the project and exam focus on your ability to apply statistics in relevant areas, beyond 'knowing statistics' . Stats: Models, International Edition, 3/E. Addison -Wesley. 0 -321-75372 -0 (tentatively). Instructional format Besides the lecture, there are two weekly group meetings, of different kind. One group meeting will take place in the computer room, and is dedicated to solving the weekly empirical assignments in SPSS. The other group session is a standard tutorial group session, filled with problems and discussion tasks . Examination Final exam, six w eekly empirical assignments, and the final essay for the student project . 136 SSC3019 Human Reasoning and Complex Cognition Course coordinator Dr. M. Heins , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , manuela.heins@maastrichtuniversity. nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Social Sciences & Sciences Prerequisites SSC1005 Introduction to Psychology or SCI2036 Artificial Intelligence and at least two 20 00-level courses. Recommended SSC 2062 Foundations of Cogitive Psychology . Objectives To help students acquire knowledge of recent (psychological) theories in the field of reasoning, decision making, problem solving, and (moral) judgement. To provide an insight into the role of higher cognitive processes have in directing huma n behaviour; various forms of human reasoning, decision making, problem solving, creativity, etc. To explore one or more of the topics (chosen by the student) in the psychology of higher thought in more detail by writing a paper. Description of the course The present course is concerned with theoretical (psychological) and empirical perspectives on human reasoning and complex cognition. Reasoning involves making deductive or inductive inferences and judging them according to current goals, beliefs and know ledge. Decision making refers to choosing between alternatives (e.g. different mental models). Furthermore, several theoretical and empirical findings on problem solving and judgment are discussed. These topics are of central importance to humans and even though some seem to reason better than others or their decisions seem more sound, thinking remains an important and for some uniquely human feature. Studying human thought belongs to the field of Cognitive Psychology. Like most topics studied by psycholog ists, higher cognition includes a wide range of explanatory models that emphasize different aspects of human thought. Eleven topics of the (cognitive) psychology of complex cognition are discussed using a Problem Based Learning format. The topics include: (hypothetical) reasoning, , the psychology of decision making, , emotions and complex cognition,, deductive and inductive reasoning (heuristics and biases), (creative) problem solving, moral judgement, and socio -economical decision making (pro - social beha vior: risk and trust). Literature Chapters of several basic cognitive psychology books are made available as e -reader or hardcopy. E-reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings and lectures.

Objective To acquaint students with current ideas, philosophical arguments and empirical evidence on the nature of mind and the r elationship between mind and body. We focus on modern cognitive and neuropsychological theories in the area of consciousness. Philosophical reflection on the caveats and problems associated with the notion of consciousness will be stimulated. Description of the course The mind -body problem is a legacy from the scientific revolution which started in the 16th century and reached its culmination point with Newtonian physics. Starting with Galileo's and Descartes' formulation of this problem we will discuss di fferent philosophical positions in a more in -depth fashion. In the behavioral - and neurosciences these problems transform into questions about consciousness, conscious experience, and conscious perception. Those topics disappeared from science with the ris e of behaviorism in the early twentieth century. But now they are back in the behavioral - and neurosciences again. Only over the past few decades consciousness has reappeared in cognitive science and neuropsychology. We will start this course with some ph ilosophy, then we will scrutinize modern day sciences, especially cognitive science and neuroscience for ideas on mind and consciousness. At the end of the course we will go back to philosophy and we will ask ourselves whether all this empirical knowledge from psychology and neuroscience has brought us further in unraveling the brain -consciousness - (or mind -body) problem.

Brkan, Faculty of Law, International and European Law , maja.brkan@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Social Sciences Prerequisites SSC1007 Introduction to Law and at least one of the following cou rses: SSC2060 Comparative Constitutional Law (SSC2012 Comparative Government) or SSC2024 International Law. Objectives At the end of the course, students should have acquired adequate knowledge, practical skills and a critical understanding with respect to the following: The role and significance of law in the European integration process. The legal foundations of the European Union (EU) (as set out in the Treaties). The institutions of the EU, their historical evolution and the horizontal relationship betw een them (as reflected in decision -making procedures). The vertical relationship between the EU and the Member States (including the principles of supremacy, legality, subsidiarity, proportionality and loyalty). The implementation and enforcement mechanism s of EU law (infringement proceedings, enforcement through national courts, review of EU action). The position of the individual as a holder of fundamental rights and a citizen of the Union. In addition, throughout the course the students should have becom e familiar with legal thinking and legal reasoning, and should in particular be able to: Find legal instruments in paper or electronic format. Keep abreast of legal developments. Read a legal document and extract the relevant information from it. Construct a legal argument on a basic issue of EU law. Use EU law to give an opinion on a legal problem. Description of the course This course focuses on the institutions of the European Union . At the same time, this course provides an opportunity for students to b e exposed to legal thinking. Law is central to the process of European integration, and it plays a greater role in European affairs than it does at national or international level. It is accordingly essential for students to become familiar with the ways o f legal thought and legal reasoning, if they want to understand fully the European integration process, and European matters more generally.

Moerland, Faculty of Law, Depar tment of Criminal Law and Criminology, roland.moerland@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Social Sciences NB: This course was formerly known as SSC3032 Atr ocity Triangle: Perpetrators, Victims and Bystanders; A course on the Causes of Gross Human Rights Violations. Prerequisites Two 200 0-level courses in the Social Sciences or Humanities. Objectives To gain a criminological understanding of gross human right s violations and other international crimes by examining their causes on individual (micro), institutional (meso), national and international (macro) levels using a criminological approach that integrates relevant insights from different disciplines (socia l psychology, sociology, victimology, history, international relations, international law and psychology). Moreover, to view the world through the eyes of the perpetrators as well as the victims and the bystanders by focusing on their roles in the occurr ence of gross human rights violations. To make insightful the linkage between gross human rights violations and violent conflicts in the world. To gain an understanding of how to approach the criminological study of complex cases of violence and to be abl e to analyze such cases independently . Description of the course The first part of the course introduces the leading concepts and theoretical frameworks that will structure the course. The course therefore firstly addresses the concept of the 'atrocity tr iangle' and it looks into the relationship between the three actors (the perpetrator, the victim, and the bystander) involved in the triangle. Subsequently, an integrated criminological model will be introduced which sets out the relevant etiological eleme nts that will be addressed in greater detail in the second part of the course. The second part of the course, which focuses on the perpetrators, will start with the forms, functions and effects of (political) violence and the concept of torture in partic ular. The analysis continues on the macro level and addresses the role of policy and ideology. Subsequent analysis focusses on the meso level and the role of military organizations and other institutions is discussed. In this context attention is paid to t he influence of military training and we will discuss how with the help of a bureaucratic system genocide can be planned, organized and carried out. The discussion will thus address several compulsive and determinative features of the environment surroundi ng perpetrators of gross human rights violations. We will furthermore discuss several experiments (Milgram, Ash, Stanford, etc.) on obedience, institutional roles and conformity, but we will also address other social -psychological mechanisms which are help ful in understanding how and why people are able to participate in the perpetration of gross human rights violations. Lastly, the important role that language and discourse plays in conflict and international crime is highlighted. The third part of the co urse will focus on the bystander. We will start the discussion on the role of the bystander by looking into the phenomenon of the 'the bystander effect' in order to address the question why bystanders fail to act. Secondly, the role of bystanders in intern ational politics at the macro -level of both states and international organizations in the field of human rights will be discussed. We will give special attention to the role of the UN Security Council when it was confronted with gross human rights violatio ns. Lastly, in addition to perpetrators and bystanders (collaborators), certain actors in the same situations did not perpetrate or passively stood by, instead they took affirmative action and came to the help of those in need. We will therefore look more closely into the phenomenon of rescuing in order to find out what turns actors into rescuers. The fourth and last part of the course will take a more victimological perspective, which focuses on the position of the victim. Who are the victims and why are they victimized? What is the 140 relationship between these victims and their perpetrators and what are the consequences of this relationship? In this context specific attention will be paid to gender selective violence. More particularly, the phenomena of ra pe as a 'weapon of war' and gendercide (gender selective mass killings) will be discussed. Also, the complex case of child soldiers will be addressed as they are victims and perpetrators at the same time. Several lectures will be held during this course. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice. During the lectures, various guest speaker s will address the subject matter from the practitioner's perspective. In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post -discussion. We hope that, through these documentaries, the subject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract. Case studies play an important role throughout the course and we will therefore pay attention to a wide variety of cases including The Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armenia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.). Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well. Here one could think of the following cases, Chili, A rgentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, East Timor, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Central African Republic, etc. Not to forget the torture practices of the U.S. The insights gathered throughout this course have policy implications and inform us how we could react to gross human rights violations once they have occurred. These policy implications are addressed in greater detail during another UCM course titled The aftermath of atrocity: A course on transitional justice and post -conflict reconstruction (SSC 3052) which will b e taught during the spring semester in period 5.

Recommended SSC2048 Intermediate Microeconomics. Objective To familiarize students with basic concepts, theories and insights of the economic psychology of judgment and decision -making. Descri ption of the course Increasingly, economists are discovering psychology as a means to enrich their models of economic behaviour and well -being and to give them a better foundation. The importance of this is illustrated by the fact that the Nobel prize winn er in economics in 2002 was the distinguished psychologist Daniel Kahneman. He characterizes his research as a quest for the 'logic of the irrational'. Adam Smith already recognized that economic behaviour, just like other behaviour, is motivated by an int riguing blend of 'rational' considerations and 'irrational' sentiments. The great challenge is to investigate the implications of the latter motives for economics. This course aims at giving an intensive introduction into this field. The first part of the course provides an overview of the psychology of judgment and decision making. Basic principles of rational decision -making are compared with actual behaviour.The second part of the course deals with applications of how psychological mechanisms influence e conomic decision -making in the field and their relevance for law and public policy. Students should realize that this course is not easy and that its material also includes some mathematical derivations. Literature Hastie, Reid, and Robyn M. Dawes .

Objective To understand the history, the political process in which policy is made and the policy content of American foreign policy. Description of the cou rse Everyone appears to have an opinion on American foreign policy, however, often such opinions are based on emotion or rhetoric. This course does not want students to be less critical of the United States, rather it strives to inform and educate students on the history, process and sources of American foreign policy, so that opinions are based on a sound footing. The course is divided into four sections. The first section will focus on the field of foreign policy analysis as a subfield in International Re lations. An overview of the various analytical perspectives on U.S. foreign policy will be covered. This first section will also consider the importance of examining American foreign policy in today's world. Section two will concentrate on the history of U.S. foreign policy, covering such events as the Founding of United States, World War I, the interwar years, World War II, the making of a Superpower, the Cold War, the Post -Cold War world, September 11th and ending with recent world events, such as the Ir aq War and the Global War on Terror. Part three will examine the politics and the policy -making process of American foreign policy. Topics for discussion in this section will include the institutions involved in the policy making process, such as the Pres ident, various bureaucracies like the State Department, the Department of Defense and the CIA, plus Congress and the Courts. This section will also consider the role the American public plays in the process of making U.S. foreign policy. The final part of this course will study the instruments used to implement American Foreign Policy. This section will include a discussion of America's use of open or diplomatic instruments, secret instruments, economic instruments and also its military instruments. This final section will end with a task that discusses the future of American Foreign Policy . Literature Hastedt, Glenn P. (2015). American Foreign Policy: Past, Present and Future . 10th edition.

Recommended SSC2028 Classical Sociology or HUM 2014 Philosophers for the 20th Century. This course is not recommended for first year students . Objectives To familiarize students with theories in contemporary sociology and give them the necessary skills to analyze, use, and criticize those theor ies. To discuss what a theory is, how we can theorize, and how theories can illuminate real social problems or issues. Description of the course \"Many people, ordinary ones and scientists alike, hate theory. Yet they could not live without it. When all i s said and done, theory is the more or less disciplined talk by which people make what sense they can of their social worlds\" (Charles Lemert in The Blackwell Companion To Major Classical Social Theorists (2003), p. 267). This course is part two of a seque nce tracing back through the historical development of sociological theory (the first part being Classical Sociology). Whereas in Classical Sociology we focused on sociological theory up until the 1930s, in this course we will be dealing mainly, but not ex clusively, with social theory that has emerged from the 1960s onward. During this time, the historical context started to change in important ways, since it brought about an inclusion of new voices from the Global South, the beginnings of the greatest phas e so far of the women's movement, and a variety of other social movements from environment to gay rights. The 1960s pushed sociological theorists to focus more on processes of social change, on social inequality and processes of marginalization and exploit ation that shape it, power relations and social movements that contest them, and on cultural and other differences among individuals and groups. In the first portion of the course, you will be introduced to four major theoretical schools of thought in mod ern sociology. They are: functionalism, the Frankfurt School, Structuralism, and Interactionism. We will discuss these traditions on the basis of a well founded and accessible text called Understanding Modern Sociology which comes out of the UK. The text i ncludes a comprehensive representation of European and US - American sociological theory. This first part of the course will be enhanced by reading original works by Herbert Marcuse, Howard Becker, Nancy Chodorow and Michel Foucault. Reading original theoret ical material is important since students are then given the opportunity to form their own opinion about what the theorists are saying. Reading original works, of course, can be a very difficult and challenging, but also elating task. In the second part of the course we will continue the work of reading original theoretical texts by focusing on more alternative ways of theorizing about the social world. We will be reading works by Patricia Hill Collins, an African -American standpoint theorist, Pierre Bourdi eu, a French sociologist, and Edward Said and Franz Fanon, two thinkers who are classified as post -colonial theorists. Some of the questions we will be dealing with in this course include: How can we make sense of the social world? How does capitalism impa ct our social reality? How is social reality constructed? What causes social change? What is the link between agency and structure? How is knowledge produced and by whom? Literature Calhoun, C., et al. (2002). Contemporary Sociological Theory.

This course is not recommended for first year students Objectives To learn h ow different categories of social identities operate as categories of socio -structural inequality. To discuss perspectives on race, ethnicity, class, gender and national identities in order to get a better understanding of what they are and how they are c onceptualized theoretically. To learn about and reflect on how you yourself, your thinking and your way of being is affected by these relations of oppression and domination in everyday life. Description of the course Identity is about one's sense of self , it is about personhood, and it is about what kind of person one is. Identities always involve both sameness and difference. Thus, if you are Dutch, you are like other Dutch people and different from the non -Dutch. There is a tendency to see identities as being fixed or given. Sociologists, however, argue that identities are fluid and changeable and that we can acquire new ones. In this course we will explore theoretical texts on the historical, cultural and political construction of social identities. We will focus on class, gender, race, ethnicity and nationality as historically specific, structured relations of oppression and exploitation examining their existence and interaction. Discussions and analyses will be based on how social identities work as o verlapping categories of both inclusion and exclusion and how they are used to divide, rank, and discriminate. Some of the questions to be addressed are: What are the main levels of analysis within which we can explore the interplay between these exploitat ive and oppressive relations? What are their theoretical, cultural, ideological and political implications? The course is designed for students who have a serious interest in the topic and who are open to critically evaluate and understand their own parti cipation within structures of domination and oppression. We will examine and interrogate how heterosexuality, whiteness and class privilege, for instance, function in such a way as to keep systems of oppression intact and discuss how to participate in the struggles against identity -based forms of domination.

Wagner , Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences , Technology and Society Studies , l.wagner@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 2 5 Social Sciences & Humanities Prerequisite SSC2046 Globalization and Inequality or SCI1016 Sustainable Development. Objectives After completion of this course students have acquired knowledge about the impact of urbanization on the interrelationship of development and poverty in an increasingly globalized world In particular, they will learn about: Conceptualizations of globalization and (urban) poverty via processes of urbanization and slum formation. The urban planning consequ ences of the increasing emergence of 'megacities'. Challenges and opportunities cities encounter vis -\u00e0-vis contested diversities and public spaces. Ecological challenges and opportunities in urban slums. Ways in which (urban) poverty impacts on precarity a nd the 'use' of human bodies. Processes of urbanization that provide both major environmental challenges and opportunities. Expressions of and connections between global crises (financial, climate, migration) through major urban centers. Description of the course Since 2008, according to the United Nations Populations Fund, more than half of the world population lives in urban areas. Of particular concern is the fact that over a billion people now live in informal settlements or slums, where poverty and pre carity are highly concentrated. Nevertheless, people continue to migrate to cities, and primarily to informal settlements. Despite their vulnerability to disaster, disease, violence and cultural tensions, they also appear to be focal points of vitality, opportunity and new initiatives. In many ways the city can be conceptualized as a contested site, a compact 'laboratory' where many of the tensions and opportunities related to globalization and development are acted out. Through readings in this course we delve into the human aspects of these loci that embody contrasts and contradictions, and we analyze social, economic and political processes in cities of the Global South. We discuss connections and tensions between urban communities and economic developme nt, the creation of vulnerable populations through urbanization and the precariousness of labor, the structural failures of slum ecologies and how they affect people, but also how citizens nevertheless find uncountable modes of making the city their home. We examine the articulation of neoliberalism in urban space, the consequences of international debt and structural adjustment projects in 'megacities', and we look at how cities are hubs for moving people (most often women) to other places to make a living in the service industries - domestic labor, sex work, cleaning jobs. Furthermore, we examine the opportunities these cities represent: as spaces of creativity, new m\u00e9langes of identities, new cultural forms and novel cultural, economic, social and politic al prospects. In short, we aspire to infuse you with knowledge both of how urban development and poverty are structurally reproduced in highly political ways, and of how cityness also always depends on how people manage to flexibly and inventively arrange their lives on a daily basis.

Arosemena, Faculty of Law, Human Rights, gustavo.arosemena@maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall 1 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite International Law (SSC2024), or Introduction to L aw (SSC1007) and two relevant 2000 level courses on law or politics (SSC2037 Conflict Resolution, SSC2027 L aw and Society, SSC 2042 Rights of the Child, SSC2046 Globalization and Inequality, and SSC2039 History of Western Political Thought) . Objective Provides students with an advanced introduction into the intrdisciplinary field of human rights. Description of the course There is the expectation that in an increasingly multiculutral and postsecular world, human rights provide us with some common ground: however turbulent and changeable social life may be, we can all demand and enjoy the protection of human rights. This expectation might turn out to be misguided. Even within the \"West\", there is intractable disagreement as to th e content and implications of human rights. Activities that are seen as human rights violations by some legal systems are tolerated by others. Even more, activities that are seen to be human rights violations by some legal systems are seen to be rightful e xercises of freedom by others. How deep are these disagreements? Can they be overcome? This course will provide students an advanced introduciton to the field of human rights by exploring and parsing out disagreement on divisive and polemical issues. The course analyzes how a variety of key issues of legal concern, such as hate speech, social welfare, dignity, the death penalty and discrimination, are addressed by a variety of domestic and international institutions, such as the European Court of Human Rig hts, the UN and the Supreme Court of the United States. This course is predominantly legal in character. That means that social scientific explanation and understanding will not be the focus of the course. Rather, the course will concentrate on analyzing t he justification of legal decisions in accordance with legal rules and principles.

Erdogan (MA), Fa culty of Law, International and European Law, International Relations, birsen.erdogan@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Core Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite SSC1006 International Relations. Objectives To understand 'security' as a com plex concept with changing meanings and applications. To discuss the consequences of different meanings for security critically. To deconstruct the given notions and policies about security and ask questions like what is included, excluded, legitimized an d justified in them. To illuminate the main theoretical assumptions of the several approaches of security studies by placing the main focus on the more contemporary and critical ones. To explore the ways how contemporary or critical security studies chall enge traditional security studies. To discuss in what ways contemporary security approaches compare and contrast with each other. To emphasize the empirical application and practical use of such approaches by discussing each approach with a relevant case study. Description of the course Security Studies during the Cold War was a rather limited and narrow sub -field of International Relations mainly focusing on state security and defining threat only in military terms. By the end of the Cold War period, new schools of thought have emerged in the field of Security Studies in parallel with the emergence of new kinds of threats against human well -being and security. Today, Contemporary Critical Security Studies represents a large group of scholars, schools, app roaches and understandings. This course deals with a number of these schools and approaches. It starts with an introduction to the conventional security (Realism and Liberalism) and explains why these approaches are found unsatisfactory by the academic co mmunity at the beginning of the 1990s. Then it explains various theoretical positions from constructivism to Feminism (gender security), Green Theory (environmental security) and Post -Colonialism (security from non -Western perspectives). Then it introduces contemporary concepts like 'Securitisation' which is developed by the Copenhagen School and discusses 'security networks' or 'security apparatus' investigated by the Paris or Sociological school. Another relevant contemporary approach is called 'Human Sec urity,' and the course explains the development of this concept. In general, the course aims at giving an idea to the students of International Relations how Critical Security Studies has developed as a separate sub -field of International Relations, which was the biggest contribution of the Wales or Aberystwyth Schools. The course also discusses several contemporary issues to give a broader understanding to the students about the application of theories and approaches (such as poverty, migration, borders, cyberwar, new technologies and warfare, responsibility to protect, humanitarian intervention, war against terror, and other contemporary security issues).

Examination During the course, students can choose what kind of midterm assignment they will do after they discuss it with the tutor. These assignments can range from presentation(s) to midtermpaper(s), from writing journals to making book/movie reviews. Each assignment will be analytical and will reflect the application of the relevant literature. Different deadlines will be applied to different assignments. In the final examination students will write an extensive and analytical final paper (on a topic students choose and approved by the tutor).

Moerland, Faculty of Law, Department of Criminal Law and Criminology, roland.moerla nd@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Core Spring 5 5 Social Sciences NB: This course was formerly known as SSC3052 Criminology and Transitional Justice. Prerequisites Two 2000 -level courses in the Social Sciences or Humanities . Objectives An understanding of transitional justice and how to deal with grave historical injustices from the past. Although the course addresses the roles of many different actors, the role of the victim will receive more substantial attention. To examine different ap proaches to post -conflict justice (retributive, restorative and transformative approaches) and their policy implications. To provide for a critical overview of different instruments for transitional justice, such as, apologies and forgiveness, memorializat ion and commemoration, truth telling and truth commissions, impunity, pardons and amnesties, compensation, restoration, restitution of property (especially looted and stolen art), international and regional criminal courts and tribunals, lustration and vet ting, etc. and to examine their impact and effectiveness. An understanding of issues in post -conflict reconstruction which focuses on the challenges (military, political, and social) that post -conflict societies are facing and how they impact on the consol idation of peace and stability . Description of the course The course will first introduce and define the field of transitional justice. We will look into its historical evolution and address the rationales underlying it. The introduction furthermore includ es an overview of the main mechanisms/components that can be part of the process of transitional justice and how they are interrelated. The course will subsequently address several of these transitional justice mechanisms and in this analysis we will pre dominantly focus on the perspectives of the victims. Victims (and survivors) are not only a group, but also individual human beings and their wishes and interests in the aftermath of large scale conflict can be very diverse and even contradict the wishes o f other victims or the group as such. What are their interests and what are their views on transitional justice including possibilities of remedy and reparation? In this context specific attention is given to the impact of violent conflict on women and chi ldren. Throughout the course critical attention is paid to the following justice mechanisms: apologies and forgiveness, memorialization and commemoration, truth telling and truth commissions, pardons and amnesties, compensation, restoration, restitution, international and regional criminal courts and tribunals, lustration and vetting. The analysis will be concluded with a discussion of the various justice mechanisms and their potential to contribute to (or jeopardize) sustainable peace. How effective are t hese approaches in breaking cycles of violence? Can they bring reconciliation? In addition to issues such as justice and reconciliation, other matters are also significant in post -conflict societies as they greatly affect the consolidation of peace and s tability. Justice and reconciliation only form one pillar of reconstruction, but also in other areas constructive action is required. Such other areas of concern include, for instance, security, wellbeing, and governance. The course therefore looks into th e process of reconstruction and discusses which actions are required in order to move from the precarious early stages of post conflict transition to a more sustainable situation which allows for the consolidation of peace and stability. Several lectures will be held during this course. These lectures will be used to illustrate the discussed materials and to provide the participants with a deeper understanding of the subject matter by presenting the linkage between theory and (research) practice. During th e lectures, various guest 152 speakers will address the subject matter from the practitioner's perspective. In addition, we will screen a number of documentaries that will be analyzed during the post -discussion. We hope that, through these documentaries, the s ubject matter of this course will become more accessible and less abstract. Case studies play an important role throughout the course and we will therefore pay attention to a wide variety of cases including The Holocaust and other cases of genocide (Armen ia, Australia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur, etc.). Although cases of genocide will play an important role in this course, the caseload is certainly not limited to genocide and other violent conflicts will be addressed as well. Here one could think of the following cases, Chili, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, East Timor, Iraq, Syria, Congo, Central African Republic, etc. Not to forget the torture practices of the U.S. Literature Handbook (t.b.a) E-Reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meeti ngs, compulsory lectures and screening of documentaries . Examination A midterm - and final take -home exam both consisting of a paper. The themes and topics of the papers will be announced in due course. 153 SSC3053 Corporate Finance: Behavioural Foundations Course coordinator Prof. Dr. R. Bauer , School of Business and Economics, Finance, r.bauer @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisite Students should have taken one or more of the following three c ourses: SSC1027 Principles of economics, SSC2022 Accounting and accountability or SSC2036 Introduction to Business Administration. Objectives You get a broad overview of the field of finance. You will be able to better understand financial articles in news papers like the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist. You will be able to apply your knowledge to understand basic financial information of the firm or institutions you will work for. You deepen your knowledge on a specific financial topic of your choice on which you will work for your project. Description of the course Today's business environment is more complicated than ever. This is illustrated by the recent financial crisis and its aftermath and emerging topics like climate change and corporate social responsibility increasingly affecting corporate decision making. The field of corporate finance deals with the financing and investment decisions made by the management of companies in the pursuit of shareholder wealth maximization an d dealing with the preferences of other stakeholders. This course gives a broad overview of important issues in corporate finance and combines insights from (behavioral) economics and finance. The economic side of corporate finance deals with the maximizat ion of shareholder wealth. Managers aim at securing the greatest possible return in exchange for accepting the smallest amount of risk. For instance, a company can finance itself by borrowing money from banks, by issuing bonds or through issuing equity at the stock market. These types of decisions influence the expected return and risk of the company. Traditional economics assumes that managers and investors are rational, self -interested people. However, there is a large body of evidence from social psychol ogy and behavioral economics that people often act irrationally and behave pro -socially by taking the social impact of (investment) decisions into account. This course also shows how decision making biases managers and investors in their financial decision s and how social preferences of shareholders and stakeholders impact corporate social responsibility. Investors in both equity and debt claims of these companies have (heterogeneous) social preferences. Increasingly, large institutional asset owners such a s public pension funds exert pressure on the management of companies with the purpose to increase the governance quality, and the environmental and social performance of their investments. The course is largely based on real -life cases that we discuss in a n interactive manner during tutorial groups. Students will debate on topics such as \"What amount of risk should companies take?\" and \"Is it important for firms to put corporate social responsibility high on their agenda?\".

Alexovicov\u00e1, Faculty of Law, Department of International and European Law, i.alexovicova@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Spring 5 5 Social Sciences Prerequisites SSC2024 International Law Objective To gain a better understanding of the World Trade Organization and its basic legal framework. Description of the course The recent revival of (economic) nationalism in various parts of the world, including some traditional towers of trade liberalization, has been a wake -up call to many who believed that the failure of the so -called Doha round of international trade negotiations conducted under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to deliver improved global trade rules and new trade deals was the most significant challenge this organization was facing at present. With the entry into office of the new US administration in January 2017 arguably a greater challenge has arisen for th e WTO and its global membership. Praising trade protectionism and bilateralism and attacking the independence of the WTO dispute settlement, generally recognized as the most successful and effective international dispute settlement system in history, the U S seems to threaten the very basics of this multilateral rules -based system that go far beyond the failure of the Doha round of negotiations. To understand the context - and content - of these developments, comprehension of the main institutional and subst antive aspects of the law and policy of the WTO developed over the past decades is indispensable. It will also enable students to understand preferential trade agreements that have been mushrooming as a result of the failure of the Doha round to reach mult ilateral consensus, thereby shifting trade negotiations partly away from the WTO. Depending on the political and economic position of the involved states, some of these agreements may well set new standards for future international trade (and investment) r egulation. This applies to agreements such as the Trans -Pacific Partnership (TPP) involving eleven countries around the Pacific incl. Canada, Australia, Japan but also Chile and Vietnam (though the US withdrew from this agreement right after the new admini stration had taken the office); Canada - EU Trade Agreement (CETA) but, if it goes ahead, also the US -EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). All these agreements contain various WTO plus arrangements and will be of importance for future developments in international trade law and policy. By taking this course, students will gain understanding of not just the WTO but also of many other recent developments in the world. This introductory course on WTO law and policy is built around a number of true -to-life international trade problems represented in the form of case studies. The course addresses six themes. It starts by examining the phenomenon of economic globalization and, the arguments for and against free trade, as well as the role of la w in international economic and trade relations. Secondly, the course looks at the history, objectives, structure, functions, decision -making and membership of the WTO. Thirdly, the WTO's unique system for the resolution of trade disputes is discussed. Fou rthly, the principles of non - discrimination in WTO law (namely the obligations of most -favoured -nation treatment and national treatment) are examined. Fifthly, the WTO rules on market access, dealing with tariff barriers and some non-tariff barriers to tra de in goods and services are addressed. Finally, the provisions of WTO law that aim to balance trade liberalization with other societal values (such as health, environment, development and regional integration) by means of exceptions to WTO obligations are discussed.

Moes (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, jeroen.moes@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall / Spring 1 / 4 2.5 Prerequisite None. Objectives After taking Research M ethods I, you will know about: What research is, its philosophical foundations, and what the concepts are by which to evaluate it. Formulating a good research question, and matching it to a systematic research design. Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Me thods, and what their respective advantages are. Interpreting research outcomes from a wide variety of approaches. Basic statistics, sampling strategies, and survey question design. Working with SPSS and executing basic commands. Description of the course Research is \"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge [...]\". This goal can be achieved in a wide variety of ways. We can count \"things\", add them up, calculate statistics about them, and get a reliable overv iew of \"things\". We can also describe those \"things \" in great detail and question why they are the \"things \" that they are, and what that means in the context of those \"things \". Which approach is better? The answer is that this depends on what you want to l earn about those ''things\". In other words, if we want to \"increase the stock of knowledge\", it partly depends on which knowledge you are interested in increasing (your \"puzzle'' and specific questions), and pa rtly also on what you consider \"knowledge\" to be in the first place. In Research Methods I, we will address these issues in great detail, and we will go into how a research project can be set up in alignment with the answers to these questions. Research Methods I (SKI1004), Research Methods II (SKI10 05), and the Research Project (PRO1012) form one coherent semester -long block of courses in which you will start from scratch and end with your own finished research project. Along the way, we will discuss a wide variety of research approaches frequently u sed in the humanities, social sciences, and the sciences. Another goal of this sequence of courses is for UCM as an academic community to further develop its multi/interdisciplinary character, and for students to be able to reflect and comment on each othe r's work, no matter how diverse that may become in the course of the next three years. The first component of this three -course block is Research Methods I. Within this block, you will learn the basics of research: about the systematic and logical aspects that are (virtually) universal across research styles, and about the differences that define them. We will develop a common vocabulary to evaluate and talk about research, and we will work on where it all begins: asking the right questions. From there, we will consider the sub -questions and hypotheses that flow from the central research questions, the data (broadly defined) that we would need to find answers, and how we can analyze that data.

Schell -Leugers, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, jenny.schell@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall/Spring 1 / 4 2.5 This course is not open to exchange students. Prerequisite None. Objective To acquaint students with the academic skills neces sary for university and for future employment, and to facilitate students' dev elopment of these skills through several written assignments and in -class exercises. Description of the course The transition from secondary to tertiary education is often experienced as a rather challenging one for students, especially considering the ex pectations at university with regard to students' academic skills, such as essay writing, critical and analytical thinking, or skills such as argumentation. It is therefore imperative to support and train students right from the start to take on a professi onal ethos with regard to their university studies and their personal and academic development. The skills course Introduction to Academic Skills consists of a semester -long program me spanning three periods. In this skills course students are encouraged to take their academic development into their own hands. Seminars, practical sessions and (written) assignments will focus on acquainting students with the core academic skills needed to be successful at university. Moreover, the sessions are set up in such a way that students will be able to put their newly acquired skills and insights into practice in the courses that run parallel to this skills course. Through continuous reflection on their personal learning process, in combination with periodic assessmen t of this process, students will be able to conclude this course with a clear overview of their competencies with regards to general academic skills as well as specific skills such as: academic study skills, research skills, analytical and critical thinkin g skills, academic writing skills, (time) management , and organizational skills.

Prerequisite SKI1008 Introduction to Academic Skills I. Objective To acquaint students with different skills concerning 'Thinking through Writing'. By the end of this skills course, students will have practiced several analytical writing skills, and will be ready to embark upon writing a longer academic paper during the project period. Description of the course The transition from secondary to tertiary education is often experienced as a rathe r challenging one for students, especially considering the expectations at university with regard to students' academic skills, such as essay writing, critical and analytical thinking, or skills such as argumentation. It is therefore imperative to support and train students right from the start to take on a professional ethos with regard to their university studies and their personal and academic development. The second part of the Introduction to Academic Skills series will require more 'academic intens ity' from students. Whereas the focus of Introduction to Academic Skills I was on the notion of academia as an institution centered on 'thinking', with critical and analytical thinking and reflection as its most apparent skills, Introduction to Academic Sk ills II will expand on the academic skill of 'thinking' by examining how one can use writing as a tool to think. The theme or red thread of Introduction to Academic Skills II will therefore be 'Thinking through Writing', focusing on writing as a means to a n end rather than an end in itself. The assignments of Introduction to Academic Skills II will focus on becoming acquainted with the (analytical) tools of describing and summarizing, of comparing and contrasting, and of assessing a theory by applying it t o a relevant example. These three analytical tools are inherent to almost all written papers, both in the context of the university but also within academia as a whole. The several assignments will be assessed on their level of compliance with the requirem ents set for the assignments, as well as English grammar and spelling, style, and structure. Tutors will provide extensive feedback to students on their writing skills in order for students to reflect on and improve their academic writing skills. Literatur e Fowler, H. R., & Aaron, J. E.

Description of the courses Students can choose a language course from the list of courses that are on offer for UCM students as long as it is not English or their native language. It goes without saying that the choice of a certain language course can be related to future plans and the country students select for doing their semester abroad. However, this is not obligatory. Literature Most courses use standard text - and workbooks that can be obtai ned at Studystore. In some courses materials will be used that the Language Centre UM has developed. Those materials will be handed out to you by your tutor or they will be sent to you by e -mail or Student Portal . Further information on the books that need to be obtained can be found at the website www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/languages Instructional format Dutch courses run for 7 weeks (two sessions per week) or 14 weeks (with one session per week). The modern languages courses run for 14 weeks (with one se ssion per week). Please note that the majority of language courses are taught in the evenings. Examination All language courses will use an assessment procedure to determine whether or not you have passed or failed the course. The test results will be gra ded on a 10 -point scale. Attendance Language courses have an attendance requirement of 85%, which means that you are allowed to miss two sessions. If you miss three sessions you must give your tutor a valid reason. The tutor will then decide on the valid ity of the reason. Only if your reason is held to be valid, you will be given an extra task by the tutor. If you miss four sessions or more you fail the course. Registration procedure A list of language courses open to UCM students is printed on the regist ration form that can be obtained at the Office of Student Affairs and the course registration environment under \"UCM Students\" in Student Portal . The registration procedure consists of Selecting a training using the special UCM registration form. This for m will be distributed with the regular UCM course registration form. An intake interview. If necessary the Language Center will send you a request for an intake interview to determine your current proficiency. On the form, you will find a more detailed de scription of registration and the deadlines that are applicable. Please read it carefully before registering! 161 SKI2005 Back to the Sources Course coordinator Dr. P. del Hierro, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, History, pablo.delhierro@maastrichtuniver sity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Spring 4 2.5 Prerequisite None. Objectives To familiarize students with the most important types of primary sources (esp. on the history of the EU) and the ways to find these sources (heuristic objective). To stim ulate a critical and methodical attitude towards sources (critical objective). To differentiate between primary and secondary sources. To appreciate the importance of primary sources for the study of historical phenomena in general. To recognize the diffe rent characteristics and pitfalls of the several types of primary sources. Description of the course Reading history is not the same as researching it. Researching history means pursuing one's own enquiry into the past, instead of following another histori an's argument about it. Above all, researching history implies not relying on 'second -hand' information. Instead, it involves going back to the primary historical sources as much as possible. However, going back to the sources is not as simple and straight forward as it may sound. There are all sorts of difficulties involved, intellectual as well as practical. This Skills training offers a first introduction to the ways historians deal with these difficulties. During the Skills training, students will discu ss the information -value of several historical sources, especially public political statements, archival records and public opinion sources. The s everal specific sources that stdents will discuss during the course will all be related to one specific theme: the origins of the first European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1952 (and the first that ceased to exist, in 2002). This early episode in the history of European integration is particularly suited for an introduct ion to historical research because a variety of archival and other primary sources is readily available. It is also an interesting topic because it has led to controversy among historians. What was the role of the leading politicians and officials involved , especially Schuman and Monnet? To what extent did existing idealism about European unity play a role? Or was the initiative to establish the ECSC rather inspired by national self -interest of the states involved? This Skills training will be a useful guid e to those students who are keen on doing historical research in the future. But it will also prove to be of value to those with a general interest in history and in the history of the European integration process in particular. By offering knowledge and insights on how the historian works, it will mentally equip students to assess the strong and the weak aspects of the histories they will be reading. This will enable them to inform themselves on specific topics, especially topics concerned with the process of European integration. Literature E-reader . Instructional format Four meetings in which the literature and the written assignments are discussed. Examination Written assessment. Three short papers spread over the course. 162 SKI2007 Presentation Skills Course coordinator A. Wellum , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht alice.wellum@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall/Spring 1 / 4 2.5 Prerequisites Students must be familiar with PowerPoint or other types of slideware, such as Prezi. A PowerPoint training will be posted on the student portal, so students who did not attend the training or would like a refresher course can prepare themselves. Objectives To identify the essential components of an academic pr esentation. To structure a clear, concise and persuasive message. To explore ways to engage the audience and make your message stick. To convey complex information clearly through visual and oral presentation skills. To handle nerves and tension and incre ase your confidence as a presenter, using techniques from psychology and theater. To give constructive feedback for an academic presentation. Description of the course All students will give at least four presentations: a short presentation on a topic set by the course coodinator and three 15 minute presentations of an academic nature. Students may choose their own topics for the academic presentations, although it is highly recommended to choose a topic you have already studied and are interested in. Exten sive feedback is given after each presentation in oral and written form. During the training we will pay attention to: Delivery: gestures, energy, and of the interaction with visual aids. Content: working out an introduction, body and conclusion for your presentation, employing forms of support such as explanations and examples, setting up main points and subpoints, and comparing and contrasting information. Structure: using a logical sequence of information. Audience: analyzing the audience and adapting to its knowledge, interacting with it and dealing with questions. Feedback: providing your peers with constructive feedback as well as receiving and dealing with feedback from your audience. Besides presenting, an important aspect of this training is givi ng and receiving constructive feedback. Both the trainer and your fellow students will provide you with feedback and you will be asked to give written feedback twice. The training will help you to prepare for future presentations, either at UCM or as part of a future job or postgraduate degree programme . Literature E-reader . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings and a lecture.

Giernalczyk (M Sc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , wolfgang.giernalczyk @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall/Spring 1 / 4 2.5 Prerequisite None. Objectives This skills training provides a general introduction to the analysis of arguments. At the end of the skills training students should be able to: Identify and carve out the underlying structures and logical connections of written and verbal arguments. Translate these structures into a visual representation by drawing patterns of these arguments. Evaluate arguments with regards to their structure and content by applying Govier's \"ARG method\" (this entails the ability to identify fallacies). Build and present own a rguments in a structured and cogent fashion, taking the evaluative criteria of the \"ARG method\" into account. Improve their approach to structure papers, exam answers and presentations. Description of the course In this skills training we work from two fun damental assumptions regarding arguments: 1. They have a specific structure, which can be made visible and evaluated. 2. The quality of an argument depends on its structure as much as it depends on its content. In order to \"get a grip\" on arguments the course is divided into four parts that introduce information and exercises to gradually develop the skill of argument analysis. The first part will serve as an introduction discussing the general characteristics and typology of arguments. Furthermore, in this part students learn how arguments can be standardized and how their structure can be visualized by drawing patterns. The core question this part of the course seeks to answer is: What is the structure of arguments and how can one reveal that structure? This part of the course will also contain an introductory lecture, entitled \"Standardizing Arguments\". In part two an informal but systematic method for evaluating the quality of arguments, the ARG - method, is introduced. By assessing the acceptability of premise s, the relevance of premises with regards to the conclusion they are supposed to support, and the logical connection between premises and the following conclusion, the ARG -method enables us to examine both structure and content of an argument. During this part of the course an introduction to bad arguments, so -called fallacies, is provided as well. A Lecture, \"Evaluating Arguments\", will accompany this part of the course. In the third part the knowledge and skills provided in the first two parts will be app lied to complete texts, seeking to isolate the arguments they present in a systematic way and evaluate whether or not they are good arguments. Examples in the context of academic discourse and politics will be examined. Part four moves beyond the analysis of already existing arguments. In this part, standardization and patterns of arguments, as well as the ARG -method, will be used to construct arguments. Note: Students considering enrolling for the skill trainings in argumentation should be aware that t he course will not focus on rhetoric and debating skills (although it can be assumed that the analytical skills acquired in this course will be helpful for debates). Literature E-reader with various articles and chapters on argument analysis and logic. Instructional format Assignment -based discussion, supplemented by lectures . Examination A midterm assignment asking students to do an analysis of one of their own papers using the techniques of argument analysis and a final assignment in which students compo se an argument of their own. 164 SKI2077 Lab Skills: Cell Biology Course coordinators Dr. B.

Wellum , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht alice.wellum @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall/Spring 2 / 5 2.5 Prerequisite None. Objectives To develop awareness of the conventions of academic writing. To understand how to write clearly and coherently in an academic context. To g ain awareness of the grammatical and structural conventions in academic writing. To develop writing through peer - and tutor feedback. To practice pre -writing and proofreading techniques . Description of the course This course is designed to help students polish their academic writing skills. Since an important aspect of good writing is the ability to convey ideas as clearly as possible to the reader, we will examine the \"nuts and bolts\" of writing that are essential to this. This may include rules of synta x and how to make your writing more accessible, paragraphing and overall coherence, a closer look at the structural parts of an academic paper, and how to improve the conciseness and coherence of your paper. Furthermore, we will practice proofreading tools such as the reverse outline and creating a personal checklist. During the course, we will look beyond the general ideas of academic articles and papers to see the mechanisms of how these papers work, especially on a technical level. This will be done in the form of weekly exercises that you will prepare in advance and discuss in class, and by giving in -depth feedback to your peer's writing during in -class evaluations. Additionally, you will put what we discuss in class into practice by revieweing an you r own papers and critiquing other students' papers. It is safe to say this course is interactive and writing intensive and that you will be reading and writing both inside and outside of class. Although sharing your writing with others can be intimidating for some students, rest assured that this writing course is a safe space for you to work, make mistakes, and improve your skills in.

M\u00fcller , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , ulrike.mueller@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall 1 2.5 Prerequisites SKI1004 Research Methods I, SKI1005 Research Methods II and PRO1012 Research Project. Recommended This course is for students with a background or sincere interest in sociology, anthropology and/or cultural studies. Objectives To get a general impression of the qualitative research process and its fundamental differences to quantitative data analysis. To become familiar with the \"art\" of qualitative interviewing. To practice taking fieldnotes. To provide students with hands -on experience in crafting their own study and writing a feasible research proposal. Description of the cour se Qualitative Research is an overarching term for a diverse range of approaches and methods within different research disciplines. Qualitative researchers essentially \"study things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or interpret, phenomena in terms of the me anings people bring to them\" (Ritchie 2003: 3). Ethnography is one form of qualitative research and means literally \"writing culture\" (Hesse -Biber 2006: 230). Often called \"participant observation\", ethnography is based on the simple idea, that in order to understand what people are up to, it is best to observe them by interacting with them up close and personal within their everyday lives. Ethnographers provide detailed accounts of the everyday practices of a culture, subculture, organisation or group by \"hanging out\", observing and recording the ongoing social life by taking fieldnotes and/or providing \"thick descriptions\" (Hesse -Biber 2006: 230). This is part one of an overall sequence of three skills trainings within which students design and implement their own study, analyze the data collected, and report on their research findings. In this first module students will learn about various research tools, such as participant observation and qualitative interviewing. Students will learn how to take fieldno tes and will be introduced to various forms of interviewing, such as the structured interview, the in -depth interview, focus groups and life history interviews. Taking fieldnotes and interviewing will be practiced in and outside of the classroom. Moreover, students will be guided through the process of crafting a feasible research question and the appropriate design for the study that they will pursue in the follow up modules of this course. The research questions will provide the basis for students' invest igations. What is to be investigated is entirely up to the student(s). However they will be provided with guidance in the formulation of their topics. In this course, students will have to conduct at least one interview, thus you will need to have access to a tape recorder and/or video camera. Note : This is a time and labor intensive skills training, especially once you have begun data collection in the second module of the course. Most of the work that you are required to accomplish will occurr outside of the class setting. Students are expected to work independently and should count on having to invest an extra two to four hours per week for interviewing, transcribing the interviews and working on the data analysis .

Giernalczyk (M Sc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht , wolfgang.giernalczyk @maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Prerequisite SKI2049 Argumentation I. Object ives Argumentation II is the sequel to Argumentation I. In this respect the main objective of Argumentation II is to further develop the skills of argument analysis and design. The particular focus of this skills training will be on the structure of argume nts. At the end of the course students should be able to: Formally evaluate the validity of arguments by applying the basic methods of sentential logic. Identify and assess the different functions different parts of an argument fulfill according to the Tou lmin model. Build and present arguments of their own according to the Toulmin model. Description of the course In this sequel to SKI2049 Argumentation I, we will zoom in on the structure of arguments. In the first part of the skills training we will utiliz e a strictly formal, almost mathematical approach, to argument analysis and explore basic sentential logic. Sentential logic introduces a simple set of r ules and procedures that allows students to test whether an argument is formally valid, i.e. if its str ucture is correct, independent of its content. To test for the validity of an argument in this way, the structure of English sentences will be separated from their content by translating the sentences into symbols; afterwards formal rules will be applied (by using truth tables and semantic tableaus) to check whether an argument logically works or not. While the first part of the skills training concentrates on skills related to logical reasoning, the second part aims to demonstrate how such skills can be u sed, even if a strictly formal way of argument analysis is not applicable. This is done by introducing the Toulmin model of argumentation. This model goes beyond the basic distinction of premises and conclusions as constituent parts of arguments by disting uishing the different functions that premises can fulfill. The Toulmin model is more flexible than argumentative analysis based on formal logic, but also more specific than the tools introduced in Argumentation I. Therefore it can be a powerful tool for sp ecific and sophisticated argumentative analysis. Such analyses wil l be conducted during this skills training , first on small, simplified academic arguments and afterwards on a larger scale, analyzing an academic paper. Finally, in the final assignment, stu dents are asked to apply the Toulmin model to design an argument themselves . Literature E-reader . Instructional format Assignment -based discussions supplemented by lectures. Examination A written midterm exam concerning the use of formal logic and a final assignment that requires students to design an argument using the Toulmin model . 172 SKI3050 Preparing Conference Course coordinator W. van Dellen (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, wilfred.vandellen@maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Skills Fall 2 2.5 NB: Students who register for SKI3050 Preparing Conference must also take PRO3006 Conference . It is not possible to take either of these modules separately due to the specific nature of this skills training and the project . Prerequisite Students should be at least in their fourth semester at UCM, i.e. it is necessary that students have passed several courses, skills trainings and projects on a 200 0 level and/or a 300 0 level in Humanities, Sciences and/or Soci al Sciences . This is necessary, since students will base their individual contribution to the conference on their UCM curriculum. Recommended SKI2007 Presentation Skills. Objectives To train students in skills required for preparing an academic conference. To give students the opportunity to position their interest within a field of their choice and academic fields in general and express that by means of activities at a conference such as lectures and workshops. To train students in reviewing a topic in the ir field of interest and turn that into an informative session and workshop for the conference. To train students to work together and set up a plan for a conference. To train students in using a framework for instructional design and apply its principles to their individual contributions to the conference. To train students in writing lesson plans for their individual contributions to the conference and the plenary sessions that will be offered. To train students in working together on preparing a conferen ce. Description of the course A conference is a platform for scholars or professionals to meet and share ideas, to present new discoveries and to connect to fellow academics. At a conference papers and research posters are presented, workshops are offered for skill development, and seminars are held to familiarise the scientific community with current academic topics and new developments. As an academic you visit a conference to present your own work, see others' work and to start possible collaborations. This skills training focuses on the preparation and planning of a conference. Students will write an extensive plan for the annual UCM Liberal Arts and Sciences conference to be held in the third period of this semester. Students will do the following in o rder to develop the conference plan and blueprint: 1) Discuss the shared assumptions, values and goals of Liberal Arts and Sciences and an open curriculum and turn that into a subtheme for the conference. 2) Discuss and compare individual interests within the gr oup to find similarities and differences and turn that into illustrative examples of Liberal Arts and Sciences that can be used for workshops and informative sessions at the conference. 3) Conduct an analysis of the target audience for the conference. 4) Discuss instructional design (teaching and learning ) in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes and use that to work out lesson plans for the conference for workshops and informative sessions. Note that this skills training is not only about presentation and or ganisation skills. It also aims at giving students the opportunity to learn more about education and teaching and instructional design. The skills training relies heavily on students' personal experiences from having been in a liberal arts and sciences pro gram me for several semesters and on being able to make that explicit to others. On the one hand , this will be used while preparing the conference and to inform first semester UCM students. On the other hand, participating students will benefit from the ski lls training and its follow -ups by fostering a preparation for e.g. Capstone and master's applications for which a profound understanding and expression of a student's academic interest will be necessary. 173 The skills training puts a strong emphasis on instr uctional design. Individual contributions to the conference are considered to be educational units and approached as such. For participating students, this will be an opportunity to gain experience with developing and designing intended learning objectives and then implementing teaching and learning activities for a target group and audience. Students will inform themselves on different approaches to teaching and apply them to - preparing lesson plans for the informative sessions, workshops and plenary sessi ons offered at the conference. A wide variety of individual interests in the Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities is welcomed in order to offer a diverse conference. This skills training fosters an interdisciplinary approach among the participating stu dents. Literature E-reader . Instructional format Training, feedback and peer review in small groups. Examination Students will be assessed and graded on (1) the conference plan, which also includes an audience analysis and material for registration and log istics (group assignment), and (2) the lesson plans for their informative session and workshop (individual assignment). 174 SKI3052 Ethnography and Qualitative Interviewing II Course coordinator Dr. U.

This module builds on what students have learned in part I and is designed to guide them through the steps of data collection for their own qualitative study. Students will work on gaining access to th eir research site and will begin the interview process and/or their observations and conversations with their research participants as participant observers. Students will be introduced to the process of transcribing the interviews, coding the data and mem o writing. A ll three steps are part of qualitative data analysis. As students develop their research projects, they will be challenged to link their specific research questions to larger processes and forces. They will also be asked to consider who might f ind their research useful and how the results of their investigations might be utilized to promote social change. In-depth analysis of the intricacies underlying contemporary social, cultural, and political discourses and practices, provides the basis for good social research. Note : This is a time and labor intensive skills training , especially once you have begun data collection. Most of the work that you are required to accomplish for the training will occurr outside of the class setting. Students are e xpected to work independently and should count on having to invest an extra two to four hours per week for interviewing, transcribing the interviews and working on the data collection.

Schell -Leugers, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, jenny. schell@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall/Spring 3 / 6 5 This course is not open to exchange students. Prerequisites SKI1008 Introduction to Academic Skills I and SKI1009 Introduction to Academic Skills II. Objective The aim o f this project is to acquaint students with the process and practice of writing a research paper. Furthermore, the goal is to familiarize students with working in a group. The tutor will assist students in this process and will be available to offer suppor t, guidance and feedback. The emphasis of this project, however, will lie upon students' own input, planning and group work. Description of the course Communication plays an important part in everyday life; however, within academia communication is essenti al. Having good communication skills involves being able to express your ideas and findings in a clear and concise manner, within the strict guidelines laid out by the \"scientific community\". In this project students will practice writing an academic piece that adheres to these guideli nes and that can be considered \"academically sound\" . Students will be expected to put the skills learned in Intro to Academic Skills I & II into practice and write an extensive research paper. The project is mainly based on pe er-to-peer education; by writing a paper within a small group , students will be able to both share their skills and knowledge and learn from each other. Literature Required reading material will be available in PDF format on the Student Portal . Instructio nal format Tutorial group meetings. Examination Written assignments. 177 PRO1012 Research Project Course coordinator J. Moes (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, jeroen.moes@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall/ Spring 3 / 6 5 Prerequisites SKI1004 Research Methods I and SKI1005 Research Methods II. Objectives After doing the Research Project, you will know about: Conducting a well -designed research project from start to finish. Academic writing in t he context of empirical research. Presenting empirical research outcomes. Description of the course Research is \"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge [...]\". This goal can be achieved in a wide variety of ways. We can count \"things\", add them up, calculate statistics about them, and get a reliable overview of \"things\". We can also describe those \"things\" in great detail and question why they are the \"things\" that they are, and what that means in the contex t of those \"things\". Which approach is better? The answer is that this depends on what you want to learn about those ''things\". In other words, if we want to \"increase the stock of knowledge\", it partly depends on which knowledge you are interested in incr easing (your \"puzzle'' and specific questions), and partly also on what you consider \"knowledge\" to be in the first place. In Research Methods I, we will address these issues in great detail, and we will go into how a research project can be set up in alig nment with the answers to these questions. Research Methods I (SKI1004), Research Methods II (SKI1005), and the Research Project (PRO1012) form one coherent semester -long block of courses in which you will start from scratch and end with your own finished research project. Along the way, we will discuss a wide variety of research approaches frequently used in the humanities, social sciences, and the sciences. Another goal of this sequence of courses is for UCM as an academic community to further develop it s multi/interdisciplinary character, and for students to be able to reflect and comment on each other's work, no matter how diverse that may become in the course of the next three years. The Research Project is the conclusion of your research methods train ing, and an opportunity to put everything you learned in to practice. We will build on the foundation laid out in Research Methods I, and on the practical skills learned in Research Methods II. You ended Research Methods II with a final research proposal, which forms the starting point for the Research Project. Assuming that this final proposal was indeed fully ready for execution, you can start gathering data and/or analyzing your data from day one of the Research Project. You will finish with an extended paper that presents your findings. Recommended Literature Gray, D. E. (2014). Doing Research in the Real World (Third ed.). London: Sage Publications . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings for feedback on the paper. Examination Grades are based on t he final research project outcome. It is assumed that this normally takes the form of an empirical paper, but alternative forms such as a documentary, photographic exhibition, etc. are possible and encouraged if your tutor and the course coordinator approv es. In addition, each research team presents their findings during the final conference (graded), and tracks their progress through weekly reports (ungraded). 178 PRO2003 Writing Project: \"The Journal\" Course coordinator A. Wellum , of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht alice.w ellum@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall/Spring 3 / 6 5 Prerequisites SKI1008 Introduction to Academic Skills I, SKI1009 Introduction to Academic Skills II and PRO1010 Introducing Ac ademic Communication: A Writing Project. Also SKI2084 W riting in an Academic Context or SKI 2049 Argumentation I . Objectives To further enhance academic writing skills, as well as systematic literature research skills and editing skills . To do an in -depth a nalysis of a topic, using the knowledge (theoretical framework, factual context, overall interpretations and analyses) acquired during regular content courses. To learn how to set up an writing review workshop, write an academic review of a paper, and how to respond to such reviews in a professional manner. To gain familiarity with academic journals and their mode of operation. Description of the course The overall format of the project is that of a fictitious academic peer -reviewed journal, for which the members of a tutorial group serve both as editors and contributors. Students will select a tutorial group dedicated to a particular topic. Under the guidance of their tutor and aided by the feedback from their peers, students will write a research paper in which they explore the topic of their group, and use, refer to and compare several sources dealing with the topic. The general topic is the same for all members of a group but students may examine their own specific research question within the broader to pic. There will be a separate workshop dedicated to the systematic searching of literature within this topic to ensure high quality sources for the paper topic can be found. During the process of researching and writing, the work of all group members will be evaluated by their peers, on the basis of criteria agreed upon by the group as relevant and fitting for their journal (in addition to a set of basic criteria given beforehand). Students will present their findings in a writing review workshop, which ser ves to give all students in the group a thorough understanding of what it means to write an excellent paper in their chosen field. The final papers will be bundled in the journal of that tutorial group. Literature Reading lists from tutors of each tutorial group. Independent literature research. Please be aware that: Towards the end of period 2 or 5 (depending on when the project is taken) students must sign up for a specific journal topic. There is a choice of several different topics that reflect the e xpertise of UCM academic staff (international relations, economics, law, sociology, psychology, the arts, history and philosophy). Short descriptions of each topic will be published on the s tudent portal in due course and students can sign up for their to pic of their choice on the student portal . Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, workshops and a lecture. Please note that the project spans over the four weeks of the project period and that there is a 100% attendance requirement. In addition to tutorials, groups are highly encouraged to meet without the tutor in order to ensure a unified and cohesive product (the physical journal) in the end. Examination A research paper (individual grade), writing review workshop organisation (group grade), a p roposal (pass/fail), literature guide from systematic literature workshop (pass/fail), a critical review of another student's work (individual grade), and an academic journal (group grade). 179 PRO2004 Project Academic Debate Course coordinator Dr. C. Rausch , Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, christoph.rausch@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall/Spring 3 / 6 5 Prerequisites Courses relevant to the topics of that particular year. Objectives To equip s tudents with essential debating and communication skills. To introduce students to the practice of speaking in a public setting. To become an expert on a topic of their choice (the debate topic). Description of the course Debating skills are an important c omponent of academic life. In this 20 00 level -project, students will prepare, present and defend a position for an academic debate. There will be a \"yes\" (pro) and a \"no\" (con) position for each group's particular theme. The topics that are available are c entral issues that have emerged out of a wide range of UCM courses from different concentrations taught during the academic year. Each topic group will have two teams, each arguing one side of the case. In this course you will work on your debating and com munication skills. The emphasis lies on delivery and content. It is not only important to think about what you deliver, but also about how you deliver it. It is your job to persuade an audience as to the correctness of your position. In order to do this, y ou need a coherently structured, logically laid out set of arguments that you will present in a clear and self -assured way. Your task is to make the issue involved come alive. Literature Students will choose, read and use literature that is related to the ir debate topic. Some of the literature will be suggested by the tutor; however, most literature has to be found by the students themselves. Instructional format Tutorial group meetings, lecture s/workshop s on debate and debating skills, and a debate on th e last day of the project. Examination A position paper (individual grade) and a debate (group grade). 180 PRO2011 Project Deep Reading Course coordinator Dr. K. Heidemann, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, kai.heidemann@maas trichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall 3 5 Prerequisites None. Objectives Students will undertake an in -depth reflection and commentary on a single seminal text linked to the humanities, social sciences or natural sciences. Students wi ll learn about the process of 'deep reading' as well as the genre of writing critical and substantive book reviews. Description of the course In this project students will engage in a deep reading of a text linked to seminal themes and issues in the humani ties, social sciences, or natural sciences. Deep reading is a process of thoughtful and deliberate reading through which a reader actively works to critically contemplate, understand and ultimately enjoy a particular text to the fullest extent possible. Ra ther than selectively skimming for facts or speed -reading for summaries, the process of deep reading means slowing down, re -reading and even stopping periodically to more fully contemplate specific pages or passages. Having considered and recognized what a text says, deep reading goes a step further and strives to reflect upon the broader implications or consequences of the text; i.e. what does the text 'do'? Although deep reading is a profoundly personal experience, within the context of problem -based lea rning the process of deep reading also rests on the premise that profound understanding and appreciation of a text emerges through group -based discussion and deliberation . Literature A single seminal text (classic or contemporary) will be assigned by indiv idual tutors. Instructional format Tutorial group meetings and individual and collaborative work. Examination Final paper in the format of an extended book review and several short reflective essays . 181 PRO2012 EU Strategy and Negotiation Simulation Course coordinator Dr. M. Stout, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, mark.stout@ maastrichtuniversity .nl Prof. dr. M. Segers, Faculty and Sciences, University College Maastricht, mathieu.segers@ maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Project Spring 6 5 Prerequisites At least one of the following: COR1003 Contemporary World History, SSC1025 Introduction to Political Science, SSC1009 Introduction to European Integration . Objectives To teach students the strateg y and negotiation skills required to achieve optimal outcomes in a multilateral setting like the EU. To teach students to make a detailed position paper from the perspective of: an EU member state, EU institution, a non EU state. Students will acquaint themselves with the negotiating approach of the country, institution they are representing. To train students in planning negotiations carefully -deciding on most useful alliances etc. Students will participate in a complex negotiation of around 6 -8 hours w here they will to put into practice what they have learnt. Description of the course In this project students will learn about international negotiations and how countries plan and seek to achieve their national goals. Success in negotiations is often not about out maneuvering the other party, although that may happen, but rather by applying diplomatic negotiating skills to finding the possibilities for consensus. Success in negotiations is closely associated with having a clear strategy - where possible po ints of compromise have already been considered, and detailed planning of the various phases of the negotiation. Students will be trained in negotiation skills and the requirements of a complex EU negotiation. They will receive training on writing a positi on paper where they explain the negotiating position and approaches of a particular country. In the final EU simulation, students will enjoy the challenging experience of participating in an international negotiation. Instructional format Tutorial group m eetings/workshops and individual study and feedback. Examination Students will have to submit a detailed position paper of a particular country. A detailed journal where they reflect on the goals they aimed to achieve, the negotiation approaches and techn iques to be used, the success or lack of it in the final simulation. Students will be assessed on their negotiation skills as demonstrated in an 8 hour final simulation. 182 PRO3006 Conference Course coordinator W. van Dellen (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, wilfred.vandellen@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall 3 5 Prerequisites SKI3 050 Preparing Conference . Recommended SKI2007 Presentation Skills Objectives To train students in skills requir ed for preparing an academic conference. To train students in rehearsing, adapting and fine -tuning their contributions to a conference. To train students in offering a conference. To train students in evaluating a conference . Description of the course In this project, students will finalize and offer the conference that has been prepared in the second period of this semester. The purpose of the conference will be to provide a platform for an audience of approximately 200 first semester students, scholars an d professionals. The conference will allow people to meet and share ideas, present findings and discoveries and connect to fellow academics. The project consist s of three parts, being: 1) Final preparations for the conference, including dress rehearsals, pe er feedback and dealing with the organisation of the conference. 2) Offering the conference to the target audience, organisation on the conference day(s) and gathering information for evaluation of the conference. 3) Evaluating the conference and writing a repor t with evaluations and recommendations for future editions A wide variety of individual interests in the Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities is welcomed in order to offer a diverse conference. The project fosters an interdisciplinary approach among t he participating students. Literature E-reader . Instructional format Training, feedback and peer review in small groups and a conference setting . Examination Students will be assessed and graded on (1) the opening and closing session of the conference (group assignment), (2) the informative session and workshop (individual assignment), and (3) the evaluation report (group assignment). 183 PRO3008 Think Tank Course coordinators W. van Dellen (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastri cht, wilfred.vandellen@maastrichtuniversity.nl (corresponding coordinator) O. van den Wijngaard (MA), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, oscarvandenwijngaard@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall/Spring 3 / 6 5 Prerequisites At least two modules the following list: SKI2049 Argumentation I; SSC2061 Statistics I COR1005 Theory Construction and Modelling Techniques . In addition, the project and the nature of the assignment require some experience in academia. Therefore students can only take the project in their fourth semester or later. This also allows students to do well and gain more from the project. The coordinators would like to emphasize that Think Tank is a time -consuming project with a high workload, that requires highly motivated students. Students should have a broad interest in e.g. policy de velopment and research and analysis. Due to the specific nature of the project and the fact that group work is an essential element, students should take into account that they need to be available during entire weekdays throughout the project. Participat ing in Think Tank as part of the regular workload at UCM is doable but demanding. Therefore, having a higher workload due to e.g. additional or parallel projects is not allowed. Objectives Let students work together and set up a problem analysis based on t he assignment given by an external client, i.e. to develop skills concerning critical analysis, including the analysis of a problem, conceptualizing a problem as a case study (the ability to see the particular problem within a wider context), and to genera te new knowledge relevant to the case at hand (Boyer's 'discovery' and 'integration') Let students work together and do research based on the assignment that was given to them, i.e. to develop skills concerning organization of work, and collaboration in a team (not specifically related to Boyer, yet instrumental towards all four aspects at the level of collaborative learning); Let students write a report based on an assignment that was given to them, i.e. skills related to formulating finding and recommenda tions in a comprehensive yet concise manner ('application' and 'teaching') Let students present their report to the representative and a group of experts ('teaching'). Description of the course Students will form a 'think tank' and write and present an ext ensive and elaborate (policy) recommendation for an external client, i.e. a company or organization. The project coordinators will offer a topic in advance. A creative and critical analysis of the problem at hand will lead to the application of knowledge and skills acquired at UCM through previous course work, and new insights developed during the project. The first week will focus on a problem analysis and an analysis of the knowledge and expertise of the members of the think tank. The second week will f ocus on doing research. The third week will deal with discussing and formulating solutions. During the final week students will present their report to an audience of experts. Besides having meetings with their fellow students and a tutor, the group might meet with guest experts (either invited by the coordinators or by the students themselves) and undertake self -organized field trips and external visits in order to obtain the required information. . Literature There is no general literature or course books that students need to buy or possess. Students will choose, read and use literature that is specifically related to their topic. E-reader . Instructional format Students will meet with their group on a daily basis by means of tutorial group meetings, exter nal visits and workshops. Examination Problem analysis (group assignment), individual research memo, final group report and a final presentation of the report (group assignment) . 184 PRO3009 Ethnography and Qualitative Interviewing III Course coordinator Dr. U. M\u00fcller, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, ulrike.mueller@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall 3 5 Prerequisites SKI2085 Ethnography and Qualitative Interviewing I and SKI3052 Ethnography and Q ualitative Interviewing II. Objective To produce a comprehensive narrative of their research findings. Description of the course This is the third part of a three module course on qualitative research methods. In this module students will be mainly engaged in writing the final analysis of their research findings. The relevance of their findings must be contextualized within the larger social and political forces within which the research is embedded. The course will end with a symposium where students will have the opportunity to present their research. Literature Hesse -Biber, S.N. (2011). The Practice of Qualitative Research.

Bevers, Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, lonneke.bevers@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Project Fall 3 5 Prerequisi te Courses that are appropriate for the project that you choose. Note: This is a time -consuming, full -time project with a high workload. In principle, students should take into account that they need to be available during entire weekdays throughout the pr oject. Objective To offer students the opportunity to apply their knowledge of the Natural and Life Sciences in the context of a project. Description In the Science Research Project students will join an ongoing research project. We offer two directions: one neuroscience oriented project (for more information and ongoing research, see https://band -lab.com/), and one tissue engineering -oriented project (for more information and ongoing research, see http://merln.maastrichtuniversity.nl/merln - Department of Complex Tissue Regeneration). Since it is impossible to provide the specific research topics in advance, we ask all students interested in the Science Research Project to get in touch with Lonneke Bevers (Lonneke.Bevers@maastrichtuniversity.nl) until the 18th of May at the latest. Based on the specific research topics, you may need certain prerequisites. As a result, the coordinators reserve the right to deny a student access to the project, should the student not meet the prerequisites. If this should happen, the student will be allowed to register for another project. Literature There is no general literature or course book that students need to buy or possess. Students will choose, read, and use literature that is specifically related to their topic. Instructional format Students will meet with their group and supervisor in the laboratory on a daily basis. Examination The assessment depends for a large part on the supervisors and the projects. There will be (at least) two moments and (preferably) two for ms of assessment (e.g. a presentation of the results during a general research meeting of the department and/or a written report of the findings). 186 CAP3000 Capstone Course coordinator W. van Dellen (MSc), Faculty of and Sciences, University -6 10 Prerequisite To participate in Capstone students should be in their last semester at UCM (usually the 6th except for transfer students) and h ave at least 140 ECTS at the start of Capstone. Note that Capstone encompasses the regular two skills trainings and project of a UCM semester. Participating in Capstone as part of the regular workload at UCM is doable, but demanding (i.e. next to the two courses per period). Therefore, having a higher workload due to e.g. additional courses, skills trainings and/or projects is not recommended. Objectives To enable students to express their individual academic profile through a scholarly project during the ir last semester at the College. To assist senior students in the transition from undergraduate education to a master program me or the labor market. Description of the course Capstone is the culmination of a students academic work at UCM and is comparable in function to a bachelor thesis. It is a full semester module for which students receive 10 ECTS. During the first weeks students will work on writing a proposal in which they formulate their individual goals and determine a topic and format. In addition , students will choose an advisor. The advisor provides the student with advice and guidance on the content of the Capstone product . Students work on Capstone individually. There will be meetings with the tutors, fellow students, and the coordinator. These meetings support the individual work on Capstone, by way of presenting one's own work to other students and giving and receiving feedback. Furthermore , the meetings are intended to monitor the progress and writing process. Students will meet with their in dividual advisor separately from the group meetings. Those meetings are intended for discussing the content of the Capstone and for receiving individual feedback on the work in progress and the final product. An outline is handed in at the start of the se cond period of Capstone. A complete draft is handed in before the third period of Capstone. Both the outline and draft are discussed with the advisor. The last period is for completing and revising the Capstone. Literature There is no mandatory literature . Students will choose, read and use literature that is related to their Capstone topic . Instructional format Individual work, tutorial group meetings, guidance from Capstone advisor and support hours. Examination Students will be assessed on a proposal, an outline, and the final version of their Capstone. In addition, they will present their Capstone to fellow students in the second period of the project. 187 UCM Undergraduate Research (UGR) 188 UGR2001/UGR3001 UCM / Undergraduate Research MaRBLe Project c oordinators J. Moes (MSc), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, jeroen.moes@maastrichtuniversity.nl (corresponding coordinator) U. Mueller (PhD), Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, Ulrike.muelle r@maastrichtuniversity.nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration Fall/Spring 1 - 3 / 4 - 6 10 per semester NB: Exchange students who a re interested in doing the MaRBle project can only apply if they stay for a full year and then only in their second semest er. MaRBLe is an acronym for Maastricht Research Based Learning, and is Maastricht University's excellence programme that brings multidisciplinary scientific research to the bachelor phase. It is a semester long research program me carrying 10 ECTS. The le vel of the project depends on the subject matter and the required academic background of the participating students, and can be either 2000 or 3000 level. Successful MaRBLE participants may be allowed to continue their research for more than one semester. MaRBLe encompasses the two Skills and one Project offered during a semester. In most MaRBLe projects, the first course period will be mainly dedicated to an introduction into the specific field and related methodologies, and a research plan or proposal wi ll be written. During the second and third periods the students will engage in their own research, while staying in touch with the other members of their group to discuss progress and challenges. At the end of each semester UCM will organize a symposium du ring which all participating students will present their research to their fellow researchers and the larger UCM community. Prerequisites More than anything else, the MaRBLe undergraduate research program me is aimed at students with a great appetite for le arning and research. Students should ideally have a progress rate of 0.9, and a grade average of 7.5. In addition, specific courses may be required for particular projects (these prerequisites will be mentioned in the announcement of offered projects). At least as important as these 'technical' requirements, we expect students who apply for MaRBLe to be motivated, and to have a clear idea on how the project they apply for fits into their individual UCM curriculum. Students will apply by writing a letter of motivation, and if eligible, can be invited for an interview. Description of the project MaRBLe is a form of RBL, Research -Based Learning. In RBL, learning is based on research that students do themselves, rather than being dependent on research done b efore and by others. Small groups of students will conduct research under the guidance of a senior researcher. They will act as a group, but engage in individual work as well. MaRBLe offers a unique opportunity to develop one's own research topic within th e context of a pre-defined research program me. In this way, student researchers will make an actual contribution to ongoing research, and will experience first -hand what is involved in doing research. During the project, specific skills will be addressed a t the appropriate time: e.g. problem analysis, writing a proposal, data selection and analysis reporting and presenting. Literature Varies per research topic. Instructional format Research -Based Learning, group meetings and individual research. Examinati on Examination may vary and depends on the nature of the research conducted, but will usually include: Presentation of findings (at UCM). Research paper or report. Further assessments can be set by the project supervisor. Stud ents who are interested in Ma RBle are encouraged to contact the coordinators. 189 UGR3002 UCM Undergraduate Research / The Documentary Project coordinator Dr. K . Heidemann , Faculty of Humanities kai.heidemann @maastrichtuniversity .nl Semeste r Period ECTS Concentration Spring 4 - 6 10 per semester NB: Exchange students who are interested in UCM Documentary can only apply if they stay for a full year and then only in their second semester. Prerequisites First year students are not eligible f or this course. There are no prerequisites for this project, however, the Ethnography track or topic related courses such as Film Art and Narrative Media are recommended. Nevertheless, a definite requirement is enthusiasm and the motivation to work hard and to develop new skills. Students are required to have a progress rate of at least 0.9 and a GPA of at least 7.5. Students will have to apply individually by writing a motivation letter, which should include an intended research topic. As this is a group p roject, we encourage students who would like to work together to already indicate this in their letter. However, students who apply will be accepted on an individual basis. Project objectives To familiarize students with both the theory and the practice of the medium documentary. To allow students to apply their already acquired research skills and to experiment with a novel method of conducting and presenting research. To provide students with the practical and technical skills necessary to execute and fin alize their research through film. Description of the project UCM Documentary is a semester long group research project carrying 10 ECTS. The level of the project is equivalent to that of a 3000 level course, as we expect students to acquire entirely new skills while building upon their already acquainted knowledge and research skills. UCM Documentary encompasses the two skills and the project offered during the Spring Semester. During the first period, students will be acquainted with the theoretical under pinnings of the medium documentary. Simultaneously, the groups will start to develop their research. In the second period, students will conduct their research through film, and attend workshops to teach them the skills necessary to do so. In the final per iod, students will edit their collected footage, thus finalizing their documentary. Special emphasis will be put on peer reviewing each other's work to enhance the quality of the final product. Literature E-Reader Instructional format Tutorial sessions as well as lectures and workshops. Examination Multiple reflective essays, research proposal, collaborative research paper, several short group presentations and final film. 190 UGR3003 Applied Research & Internship Project Project coordinator I. R\u00f6mgens, Facu lty of Humanities and Sciences, University College Maastricht, maastrichtuniversity .nl Semester Period ECTS Concentration / 4 -6 10 per semester NB: In this project, students can apply to work for an external client.. The pa rticipating clients and their assignments are published via the Student Portal . If you want to apply for one of the cases, please follow the instructions in the case -description carefully. Prerequisites This project asks for highly motivated students, wh o are willing and able to work hard, and represent UCM at an external client. Students that are interested in participating are invited to consult the list of clients in the Student Portal to find out if a case is offered that fits their background and i nterests. Specific prerequisites in terms of courses and skills apply for each case. Eligible students must have a clear idea of how the client's case relates to their curriculum and future plans. The selection procedure includes submitting a CV and motiv ation letter and attending a personal interview with the client and the academic supervisor . Project objectives To enhance the learning experience of students by providing an opportunity to apply academic knowledge and skills acquired at UCM to a r eal-life case from a client that is active in the work -field of the student's interest. To prepare students for applied problem solving and applied research outside academia. To provide students with an opportunity to gain insights in a professional context in the ir field of interest. To reinforce the awareness of how academic work relates to society and how academic knowledge and skills can be used to address practical, societal issues . Description of the project In this project students will apply their academic knowledge and skills to a case presented by an external client (e.g. a company, a NGO or a governmental organization). The student produces an academically -grounded, but practically useful work -product that satisfies the needs of the client and UCM's acade mic requirements. The nature of the work -product differs depending on the discipline, client and case. The research in this module is practice -based and catered to the needs of an external client. At the same time, the work for the client is research -oriented. The core of the project is the research the student conducts based on the case the client presents. In order for the student to gain knowledge about the client's professional environment, the context of the case and stakeholders involved, the module includes a four -week period of on - site work at the client's workplace (the internship). Additionally, the project contains two periods of 7 weeks in which the student works on the project one day per week independently. The precise set -up of the project an d the tasks per period depend on the individual assignment the student gets. At the end of the semester, the student presents his/her work to both the client and the academic supervisor. Similar to MaRBle and The Documentary, the Applied Research & Inter nship project takes a full semester and encompasses two skills courses and one project. No general literature is assigned. Students need to select literature and conduct research that applies to their case. Instructional format This project is an individua l 'live -case study'. Students meet up with their client and academic supervisor regularly . Additionally, students present their work in plenary peer -feedback sessions . Examination The assessment in this course includes writing a case -analysis and project p roposal; writing a research update report and giving presentations.. At the end of the semester, students hand in a concrete 'work product'. The nature of this work product depends on the case and the client. Student and supervisors specify the scope, expected outcome and assessment criteria at the start of the project in a 'project contract'. 191 Appendix Courses at Maastricht Science Program me & University College Venlo From 2016 -17, it is possible for UCM students to take courses at the Maastricht Science Program me and University College Venlo, provided they meet the prerequisites of those courses. This appendix lists the courses available. As these program mes are sister program mes to UCM, the courses listed here, in the UCM course catalogue but tak en at MSP and UCV, are considered internal courses for purposes of graduation, meaning that they do not count towards the 60ECTS maximum for external education and that they do not have to be at the 3000 -level. However, UCM cannot guarantee that there is n o clash of schedules between these courses and the courses offered at UCM. Students must register for these courses through the external course booking module on MyUM, indicating backup courses on the course registration form. These courses are not availab le to exchange students. After students have filled in the request in MyUM, and their academic adviser has approved it, the request will automatically be forwarded to the UCV/MSP Office of Student Affairs, where the course will be booked and made visible on MyUM two weeks prior to the start of the relevant period. 192 Courses Available at Maastricht Science Program me UCM students are welcome to register for the following courses, provided they meet the prerequisites. Students wishing to take courses at MSP not listed in this appendix may file a request with the Board of Examiners .
