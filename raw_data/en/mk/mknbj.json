[Laboratoriadiagnostikk ved fl\u00e5ttb\u00e5rne infeksjoner: Systematisk litteraturs\u00f8k Norwegian Institute of Public Health , 201 9. 3 Key message Key message The Norwegian Directorate of Health and The Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Tick -borne diseases asked The Norwegian Institute of Public Health t o perform a sys- tematic literature search followed by an overview of available research o n laboratory diagnosis and co -infections of tick -borne diseases. We performed t he work in two parts. Objective The objective of part one was to identify research on laboratory diagnosis of people with long -term complaints after borrelia infection, including seven tick -born infections other than disease (Bartonella spp) . The objective of part two was to identify re- sear ch on tick -borne co-infections, also encephalitis (TBE ). Method We performed a systematic literature search for research published between 2007 and 2018, and categorized potentially relevant references according to the studied in fec- tions and study design. Results Part 1: Laboratory diagnostics : We included and sorted 458 references by type of tick-borne infection and by study de- sign ( diagnostic studies , case studies or case series) . Part 2: Co -infections : We found four systematic reviews, eleven non- systematic re- views, 15 diagnostic studies, 50 prevalence studies and 25 case -studies on L yme borre- liosis co -infections. We did not read the papers in full text, and we did not assess the methodological qual- ity of the studies, nor did we summarize the results. We present references to the stud- ies with links to the studies' abstracts fulltekst. 5 Contents Contents PREFACE 7 BACKGROUND 8 Objective 8 Systematic literature review with a sorted reference list 9 Included study types 9 METHODS 11 Selection criteria 11 Literature search 12 Selection and sorting of relevant studies 13 RESULTS PART 1: LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF TICK- BORNE INFECTIONS 15 1 Diagnosis of more than one infection 16 1.1 Diagnostic studies 16 1.2 Case studies or case series 17 2 Longterm complaints after tick bite (chronic Lyme disease) 18 2.1 Systematic reviews 18 2.2 Diagnostic studies 18 2.3 Case studies or case series 19 3 Anaplasmosis (A naplasma phagocytophilum) 20 3.1 Diagnostic studies 20 3.2 Case studies or case series 21 4 Rickettsiosis (Rickettsia conorii or R helvetica) 27 4.1 Diagnostic studies 27 4.2 Case studies or case series 28 5 Neoehrlichiosis (Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis) 34 5.1 Case studies or case series 35 6 Babesiois ( Babesia spp) 35 6.1 Systematic review 36 6.2 Diagnostic studies 36 6.3 Case studies or case series 40 7 Hard tick relapsing fever (Borrelia miyamotoi) 50 6 Contents 7.1 Diagnostic studies 50 7.2 Case studies or case series 51 8 Tularemia ( Francisella tularensis) 54 8.1 Diagnostic studies 54 8.2 Case studies or case series 57 9 Cat scratch disease ( Bartonella spp) 60 9.1 Systematic reviews 60 9.2 Diagnostic studies 61 9.3 Case studies or case series 64 RESULTS PART 2: CO -INFECTIONS 80 Sorting categories 80 Lyme borreliosis co -infections 81 Systematic reviews 81 Review articles (non -systematic) 81 Diagnostic studies 83 Prevalence studies 85 Case studies/case series 92 Other study types 94 Other tick -borne co -infections 95 Diagnostic studies 95 Prevalence studies 95 Case studies or case series 96 COMMENTS 98 REFERENCES 100 APPENDIX 102 Appendix 1: Search strategy part 1 - diagnostic tests 102 Appendix 2: Search strategy part 2 - co-infections 109 Appendix 3 : A selection of studies on diagnostic methods other than laboratory diagnostics 112 Appendix 4 : Review articles 114 7 Preface The Nor wegian Directorate of Health ha s initiated a Nordic collaboration regarding di- agnosis and follow up of patients with long -term complaints suspected to be associated with tick -borne diseases. The aim is to establish a Nordic consensus for medical assess- ment and follow -up of patients with suspected tick -borne infections. The Norwegian In- stitute of Public Health, Division of Infection Control and Environmental Health is a member of the Nordic consensus working group , and is responsible for Workpackage 1: Systematic literature search on diagn ostics of tick -borne infections. We have performed a systematic literature sea rch to identify possibly relevant re- search on the diagnos is of patients with long -term complaints after suspected tick - borne diseases. The project group consisted of the following members, all from The Norwegian Insti- tute of Public Health: Ingvild Kirkehei (project leader) , research librarian, Cluster for Reviews and Health Technology Assessments Signe Flottorp , research director , Cluster gy Assessments Audun Aase , Ingeborg Aaberge , specialist d irector Division of Infection Control and Environmental Health We thank the Nordic con sensus group lead by The Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Tick -borne diseases for input , and Elisabet Hafstad for peer K\u00e5re Birger Hagen Ingvild Kirkehei Department director Research director Project leader 8 Background The incidence of tick-borne infections is increasing in the Nordic countries, and so is the awareness and fear of tick bites and tick -borne infections in the public. The healthcare system has access to guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis of the most common tick -borne diseases, Lyme borreliosis (cause d by a member of the family Flaviviridae ) (1-6). Newer recommendations for patients with long -term complaints after borrelia infection, sometimes referred to as chronic Lyme disease or Lyme disease with persistent symptoms , are scarce. There are also few recommendations for the diagnosis of other, less prevalent tick -borne infec- tions . Other relevant tick-borne infections in the Nordic countrie s are (7-9): - anaplasmosis (caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilium) - rickettsios es by helvetica and Neoehrlichia mikurensis) - babesiois (caused by the parasite Babesia sp p.) - hard tick relapsing fever (caused by the bacterium Borrelia miyamotoi ) - tularemia (caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis) - cat scratch disease (caused by the bacterium Bartonella spp .) Some people may be infected with more than one of these pathogens at the same time . Such co -infections may lead to more severe symptoms and make the diagnosis more compl ex (10) . Objective The aim of this report is to pr ovide a n overview of p ublished research from 2007 to 2018 on: 1. the performa nce of laboratory tests for the diagnosis of tick -borne diseases other than Lyme borreliosis and TBE. 2. the prevalence and laboratory diagnosis of patients with tick -borne co - infections. This may include studies that aim to answer the following clinical questions: 9 - In patients with long -term complaints possibly related to previous tick bite(s) and with negative laboratory diagnostic tests for borrelia infection, what other diagnostic tests c ould be performed to diagnose or exclude other tick -borne in- fections? - Which methods for laboratory diagnosis of other tick -borne infections than bor- reliosis and TBE are relevant in patients after tick bite(s)? - In patients with long -term complaints after borrelia infection, wh at other diag- nostic tests could be performed to investigate if the patient also have a tick - borne infection other than borreliosis? - Are there any laboratory tests that can reliably support the diagnosis of persist- ing borrelia infection in spite of antibiot ic treatment? Systematic literature review with a sorted reference list This kind of research overview may be referred to as a systematic literature search with a sorted reference list. In a systematic literature search with a sorted reference list, we perform a systematic literature search based on one or more clinical question s. The search is comprehensive and rigorously developed to find all potential ly relevant articles. The search strategy must be documented and verifiable (11) . We screen t he references from the search to sift out the non -relevant references , and we then present the possibl y relevant references in lists or tables. We do not retrieve the fulltexts, we do not perform any critical appraisal of the studies and we do not report or summarize the studies' results. Included study types In this report , we have included references to research with different study designs. Systematic review: \"A review of a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select, and critically appraise relevant research, and to collect and analyse data from the studies that are included in the review .\"(12) Diagnostic study: Diagnostic research can be categorized in to four phase s, with stud- ies answering four different types of questions ( 13): 1. Do test results in affected patients differ from those in normal individuals? 2. Are patients with certain test results more likely to have the target disorder? 3. Do test results distinguish patients with and without the target disorder among those in whom it is clinically sensible to suspect the disorder? 4. Do patients undergoing the diagnostic test fare better than similar untested patients? The thre e first diagnostic questions can be examined with studies with cross sectional, case control or cohort designs. The last question is a question about the clinical effec-tiveness of a diagnostic test, hence best evaluated in a randomized trial. 10 Case studies and case series: Descriptive studies reporting on something that has happened or been observed with a single patient (case study) or a set of patients (case series). The studies mainly focus on the manifestations, clinical course, and prognosis or outcome for the patient (14). Prevalence study: \"A type of cross -sectional study that measures the prevalence of a characteristic \". Prevalence is \"the proportion of a population having a particular condi- tion or characteristic \"(12) . 11 Methods We divided the work into two parts: - Part 1: Laboratory diagnoses of tick -borne infections - Part 2 : Co-infections of tick -borne infections In both parts, we pe rformed a systematic literature search , and screened through the search results according to pred efined selection criteria. Selection criteria Part 1 - Laboratory diagnoses of tick -borne infections Population: Adults, young people and children with long -term com- plaints after tick bite (\"chronic Lyme disease\" or \"post treat- ment Lyme syndrome\") or symptoms spp .) Diagnostic methods: All laboratory methods identified in the literature search were relevant, e.g. enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays and culture. Comparison: For diagnos tic studies: Reference All methods were rel- evant for inclusion . Outcomes: Statistical measures of diagnostic performance or test accu- racy measures, such as sensitivity/specificity, positive pre- dictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios. 12 We did not e xclude studies based on reported outcomes . Study design: Systematic reviews, cross sectional studies, case control studies . We also included case series and case studies men- tioning diagnos es or diagnostic tests in the abstract. Publication year: Laboratory methods used before 2007 are less relevant to- day, and thus we limited the search to publication year s 2007 -2018. Language: All langu ages Exclusion : Because of already existing guidelines, w e excluded studies on tests for the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and early localized - and disseminated Lyme borreliosis. We excluded studies on infections in ticks and domestic or wild animals. Part 2 - Co-infections Inclusion: All studies reporting prevalence or diagnostic methods for identifying co -infections between two or more of the ten in- fections included in part 1 about diagnostic tests . In addition , we included studies on all stages of Lyme borrelios is and tick- borne ence phalitis (TBE) . This search was also limited to publication year 2007 -2018. Exclusion: We excluded s tudies on patients with other co-infections than tick-borne diseases , e.g. HIV. Literature search A research librarian (Kirkehei ) performed systematic search es based on the inclusion criteria. Part 1 - Laboratory diagnoses of tick -borne infections We searched t he following databases : MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Data- base of Systematic Reviews (Cochrane Library), Database of Abstra cts of Reviews of Ef- fects (CRD DARE) , Technology Assessment s Database ( CRD HTA) , Registry Platform (ICTRP) . 13 All searches are reported in detalis in Appendix 1 . Another librarian , the project group and the Nordic expert group on systematic review of scientific literature on diagnostic methods for tick -borne diseases assured the quality of the search strategies. Kirkehei performed t he se arches in January 2018. The search es consisted of subject headings and freetext terms describing the included tick -borne diseases and terms typ- ically used when describing diagnostics (for instance diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity) or relevant study designs (for instance cross -sectional studies) . The first search was limited to studies mentioning \"ticks\" (and other terms describing tick -bites) in the title or abstract. In a second supplementary search, we removed this limitation. The search was limite d to publication year as of 2007. We exc luded s tudies on animals or ticks (wit hout mentioning humans) from the search. Part 2 - Co-infections We search ed the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Epistemonikos, ISI Web of Science . Kirkehei performed t he search es in August 201 8. The search consisted of subject head- ings and freetext terms describing the included tick-borne diseases, limited to terms describing \"co -infections\" (e .g. co-occuring infections, simultan eous infections ). The search was limited to publication year as of 2007. There were no limits to study design. We excluded s tudies on animals or ticks (without mentioning humans) from the search. Selection and sorting of relevant studies References from the literature searc h were exported to the online screening tool Covi- dence. Two people independently screened a ll references (Kirkehei, Flottorp, Aaberge or Aase), and we resolved disagreements through discussion . We screened the refer- ences based on title and abstract , and we did not read the studies in full text. Included references were exported to the reference managent system EndNote, where one person (Kirkehei) sorted the references into cat egories by infection type , study de- sign (diagnostic studies or case studies/case series) and publication year. The project group checked the final sorting result. Initially, we planned to categorize references according to type of diagnostic study, e.g. case control og cross sectional studies a ssessing if the test can be used to sort sick from healthy people (diagnostic phase 1 studies) and cross sectional studies comparing the diagnostic test to be assessed with a reference test (diagnostic phase 3 studies). How- ever, we found it difficult to do this based on abstracts only, and decided to pre sent all diagnostic studies in one category . 14 In part 1 (diagnostic tests) we also extracted information on di agnostic methods stud- ied or used. Kirkehei extracted information about the tests used based on t he infor- mation provided in the abstracts and the project group helped standardize the text. We categoriz ed and extracted data based on the titles and abstracts only and this may have led us to include irrelevant references. To ascertain relevance and to assess meth- odolocical quality it is necessary to read the s tudies in full text. Due t o copyright restrictions, we have not include d abstracts in the report . The reader may follow the internet link to the publication's abstract and possibl y available full text. 15 Results part 1: Laboratory diagnosi s of tick -borne infections The search resulted in 3916 unique references , wheras we included and sorted 458 ref- erences according to infection type. In Table 1 we have summari zed the numbers of incl uded and sorted references.

High suspicion of bacillary angiomatosis in a kidney transplant recipie nt: a difficult way to diagnose -case report 125. Afshari Results part 2: Co -infe ctions The search resulted in 52 4 unique references . 118 references were possibly relevant according to the inclusion criteria. Sorting categories Because of the nature of \"co -infections\" where two or more infections are studied at the same time, it was not meaningful to categorize the studies based on infection type. The majority of the references referred to studies on co-infections with Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia ), and we sorted these into one category. This also i ncludes references w here the main object was to study one of the other tick -borne infections, but where the au- thors men tion ed the prevalence or identification of co-infection with borreliosis in the abstract . We then categorized t he references into systematic reviews, non -systematic reviews, prevalence studies, diagnostic studies and case studies/case series. We also categorized other studies not mentioning borreliosis according to the same study types. 81 Lyme borreliosis co-infections We found four systematic reviews, eleven non-systematic reviews, 15 diagnostic studies, 50 prevalence studies and 25 case studies on L yme borreliosis co - infections.

We may still have lost relevant studies. We limited the search to studies mentioning tick or tick- bite in title or abstract. However, not all studies on tick -bite diseases explicitly mention \"ticks\", and thus we performed a supplementary search without this limitation . Instead we limited the sear ch to those described as cross -sectional studies or diagnostic accu- racy studies . This gave some additional references, mainly about diagnostics of Fran- cisella Tularensis and Babesiosis . Nonetheless , due to the study design limitation used in the supplement ary search, we may have missed relevant studies. We included c ase studies and case series to provide information on diagnostic methods typically used in clinical practice. Screening for inclusion of these studies was challeng- ing, because many of the references lacked abstracts. In addition, c ase studies that did not use words describing diagnosis in title or abstracts have not been identified by the search. This may have led to some bias in the identification and inclusion of cas e stud- ies and case series . In part 1, the search for Lyme disease (borreliosis) was limited to studies on so called \"chronic Lyme disease \". To find as many relevant studies as possible, we also used search terms as \"chronic or persistent or lingering or long -term\". However, we may have lost studies that have used other descriptions for this condition. During the reference screening we identified studies on other diagnostic methods than laboratory diagnostics . These studies did not match our inclusion criteria, but may be of relevance to the question on how to manage patients with long -term complaints af- ter borrelia infec tion . See Appendix 3 for examples. This is not a comprehensive list of all relevant studie s on the topic, and is not the result of a systematic literature search. Studies in part 2 were only identified if they mentioned \"co -infections\" in title or ab- stract. There may be additional relevant studies in part 1 , reporting on co-infections in the full text . Appendix 4 presents non- systematic review articles that may refer to studies not iden- tified in our search. For updated evidence -based recommendations about diagnostic methods of tick -borne infecti ons, we also refer to clinical point of care tools such as NEL (Norsk elektronisk . 100 References 1.
