Saying goodbye to summer is always difficult, but fall is a favorite for many of us. When a new season arrives, it's important to prioritize our health. Weather changes, including crisp autumn temperatures, can challenge our immune system and aggravate seasonal allergies. Did you know there are several ways to give your immune system a natural boost and feel more energized? Chiropractic care can address chronic pain, fatigue, muscle weakness or tightness and decreased mood. Coupled with the right supplements, regular chiropractic treatment can provide the lift you need to feel your best this season! Benefits of Chiropractic Care October is National Chiropractic Health Month and Spinal Health Month! Especially during this unprecedented pandemic year, it's crucial to care for our bodies from head to toe. When the body experiences forms of excessive stress, the nerves can become irritated. Over time, areas of the spine may start to weaken and cause unexplained pain. Chiropractic adjustments open the nerve pathways to our most vital systems. Taking this undue pressure off the nerves and eliminating interferences can also help the immune system function properly. On this subject, did you know certain nutrients help protect our body's main systems? As chiropractors, we are trained to treat the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. Consider adding the following supplements to your daily wellness regime to support their health. 1. Vitamin D3 Vitamin D is actually a hormone that's naturally produced by the kidneys. Perhaps most commonly known to promote strong bones, Vitamin D also boosts immune cellular function. Vitamin D3 is the most bioavailable form, meaning it's absorbed well by the body. The recommended daily dosage of Vitamin D3 is 5,000 - 10,000 IUs. 2. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant that promotes immune strength. It's also known to help with the growth and repair body tissues. Vitamin C supports healthy bones, teeth and iron absorption. Iron plays an important role in transporting oxygen throughout the body. The recommended daily dosage of Vitamin C is 500 - 1,000 mg. 3. Zinc (30-60mg) Zinc is a key mineral that supports immune function. Studies have linked zinc deficiency to increased risk for chronic inflammatory diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis. Getting the proper amount of zinc can keep your immune system strong and helps with wound healing. The recommended daily dosage of Zinc is 30 - 60 mg. 4. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) This sulfur-containing amino acid stimulates the production of immune cells. NAC also helps replenish glutathione, a powerful antioxidant in the body, and can alleviate symptoms of chronic respiratory conditions. Studies have further illustrated NAC's ability to impede the lifespan of the influenza virus. The recommended daily dosage of NAC is 600 mg. Including Vitamins D3 and C, Zinc and NAC in your everyday routine can help boost the strength and performance of the body's major systems. Along with regular chiropractic care, this regimen can help you lead a healthier lifestyle!
