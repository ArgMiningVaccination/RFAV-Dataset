Using holistic, herbal, and energetic medicine, she guides her clients through their healing voyage so they can vibrate at a higher frequency, feel better and achieve ultimate wellness. Dr. Zepf pursued a career in alternative, integrative and complementary medicine because of her belief that the human body can heal itself when the proper environment is created and supported. Her work with \"wounded warriors\" and PTSD, Insomina, IBS and Traumatic Brain Injury has been a catapult for Dr. Zepf's passion to helping those using scientific technology to help them return to their happy fulfilling self. Using herbs, homeopathic remedies, energetic medicine, botanicals, biofeedback, cranial sacral treatments, aromatic medicine therapy, micro-current therapy, foot-bath detox and far infrared sauna, Dr. Zepf's clients leave her clinic feeling healthier, more energetic, and on the path to restoring the body back to its right and natural balance. They feel enlightened, grounded and have a sense of wellbeing. Dr. Zepf explains, \"The physical, mental, emotional and spiritual journeys for people are all different. If I can help one person vibrate at a higher frequency through vitality; every person's path they cross will also be affected in a positive way because that person will have a better sense of health, love and gratitude and that state is contagious!\" Zepf also shares, \"We are all a collective. This vital and synergistic connection is Quantum energy. It's the epigenetic of the evolutions in which the world is turning towards. Just like the caterpillar not fully knowing his journey, he comes to find out he is changing, metamorphosing into something beautiful. I feel that my calling is to do just that, with people...to have that special connection to our spiritual, mental and emotional Being.\" Dr. Zepf holds 4 Doctorates and a PhD in Natural Medicine and is an informative and sought after speaker and educator, who delights and educates her audiences with vital, alternative, and integrative medicine therapies and information.
