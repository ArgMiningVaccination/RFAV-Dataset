The reduction wouldhave gone into effect on Jan. 1, 2007,in addition to the average 8 percentcut doctors of chiropractic will incur inFebruary 2007. Instead, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the omnibus bill thatcontained the physician fee provision,provides no increase in thecongressionally mandated sustainablegrowth rate (SGR) mechanism whichworks to hamper spending in theMedicare program. The president wasexpected to sign the bill. \"The ACA is pleased that Congress has halted this portion of the upcomingcuts in physician Medicare payments,\"said ACA President Richard G. Brassard,DC. \"It is completely unreasonable toexpect providers to take on furtherfinancial constraints when they arealready being hit from all sides with feedecreases. We applaud this move as asignificant recognition of theincreasingly stressful environment forphysicians in Medicare.\" Although the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 gives some measureof relief, providers in Medicare stillface fee cuts for 2007. Under a finalrule \u2014 issued by CMS per thecongressionally mandated five-yearreview of the work values of billingcodes \u2014 doctors of chiropractic willface an average 8 percent cut startingin February 2007. This rule alsoimposes significant cuts to radiologicaland imaging services. The bill includes a provision that will allow for a 1.5 percent increase inreimbursement for providers whoreport on existing quality measuresestablished by CMS.

The results of the study were published in the October 2006 issue of the Archives of Physical Medicine andRehabilitation from the U.S. Spine and Sport Foundation in San Diego. DOMS is defined as muscle soreness that occurs within 24-48 hours after unusual exertion during physicalactivity such as exercise, sports, and heavy lifting. Painand soreness are often caused by microscopic tearing ofthe muscle fibers. To date, preventative measures against DOMS have mainly included stretching and low-impact activity (warm up), but the efficacy of these behaviors has not beenclinically proven, according to researchers. DOMS iscommonly treated with cold packs, low-impact workoutsto increase blood flow to the area, and over-the-counterpain medications. \"Simply wearing a portable heat wrap immediately prior to exercise cut pain intensity and disability almost inhalf as compared to control treatment. Additionally, heatwrap therapy provided 138 percent greater pain relieffrom DOMS as compared to cold pack treatment,\" saidJohn Mayer, DC, PhD, principal investigator for this project.

And for oncethey have nothing to do with football on the campus of 50,000students and several thousand morefaculty, staff, and other employees. Not even a stone's throw from Woody Hayes Drive and just across the Olentangy River from the university's most famous building \u2014 Ohio Stadium \u2014sits a less descript structure, but one where excitingthings are happening \u2014 the OSU Center forIntegrative Medicine (CIM). The center can be likened to a supersized shopping center. If a typical one-stop shop offering chiropracticand other various medical services is like Target, theOSU center is like Mall of America. The 6,400 square-foot center has 30 rooms, 18 of which are devoted to patient care and treatment,including chiropractic, massage, and acupuncture. Ithouses its own office, and has two reception and waitingareas, a large conference room, and a large classroomarea that can be used for anything from educationalactivities to yoga. INTEGRATED WELLNESS CARE The CIM's central purpose is found in its name \u2014 healthcare integration. It brings a little bit of every corner of the healthcare world, including chiropracticand most disciplines associated with it, into onebuilding and makes it part of the much larger medicalcommunity. Open less than two years, the CIM is visited by an astounding 1,400 patients per month and an eye-popping 75 new patients per week. Although themajority come to see the center's family physicians, agrowing number come to see the center's twochiropractors and other alternative practitioners. While not completely one of a kind (similar facilities exist at universities in Arizona, Maryland, California, andMinnesota, among others), the CIM is certainly uniquein its combination of vast patient offerings and researchcapabilities. It is a learning lab for medical students andprovides an environment for traditional med students tolearn about less traditional healthcare offerings. But the primary role of the CIM is to serve as a practice center. DC-MD ALLIANCE Chiropractic is a small but growing part of the practice center. For the two chiropractors on staff, Drs.Robin Hunter and John Grandominico, merely being involved in what could be a trend-setting healthcare outpost is invigorating. (See page 24 to meet thechiropractors.) The opportunity to interact with and work alongside professionals from all parts of thehealthcare industry merely adds to the excitement. \"It has been extraordinarily good,\" Hunter says. \"We're looking at Ohio State, a very strong medical community...it's a very strong environment. But there's been astrong drive from the leadership, mostly the primary-careleadership, to integrate. It took some of the leaders ofOhio State University some time to get this place open.\" That's because, like many new ventures, this one met with skepticism.

AtOSU, people are quickly learning. Mary Jo Welker, MD, chairperson and professor of Clinical FamilyMedicine and associate dean forPrimary Care at OSU was the primemover in the creation of the center.She recognized the desire of patientsto branch out into nontraditionalfields of care, such as chiropracticand massage therapy. But medical doctors, she said, are confronted with a problem inmaking referrals to complementaryand alternative healthcare providers:They often don't know where torefer for quality care. \"As physicians, we have no way of knowing who to refer to or whattheir credentials really are,\" Welkersaid. \"By having our own site andcredentialing our own providers, Ican be sure that when patients ask tosee one of these providers that I canmake a referral and know they willbe getting good care.\" Although the center opened amid a certain amount of interdisciplinaryskepticism, the focus on patient carewas something all sides could agreeon. Hunter said that patient care isthe foremost part of the three-pronged system. The other twoprongs are education and research. WORKING ACROSS BOUNDARIES At a top research institution such as Ohio State, new discoveries are being made every day. And whileperhaps nobody at the CIM isreinventing the wheel, there iscertainly evidence of a rapidevolution within the healthcarecommunity. The ability to workacross the boundaries of disciplinescreates a provider- and patient-friendly system. Hunter and Grandominico are both former private practitioners andknow how different every patient'sneeds are. They also realize that noteven the best chiropractor can solvethe problems of any one person. With that in mind, it's nice to have not only the facilities andequipment to tap into for alternativetreatments, but also the knowledgebase of a staff of MDs and otherproviders. Patients routinely seemore than one practitioner at theCIM, often on the same visit. \"It does come into play quite often with the chiropractors,\"Grandominico says of multi-discipline cases. \"The family doctors,the massage therapists \u2014 all areinvolved. My specialty is in rehab. Ifsomeone has a patient who maybe Being a part of the Ohio State medical community gives the Center for Integrative Medicine immeasurable credibility on a worldwide scale. And that credibilityfilters down to chiropractic, an important part of thecenter. The two DCs on hand, Drs. Robin Hunter and John Grandominico, are in an environment in which theirspecialties cross paths with professionals in numerousother medical areas, as well as in an educational arena. It's the integration aspect that excites Hunter, who sees the mega-multidiscipline center on the cuttingedge of patient care, not because the patients have somuch to gain from the environment, but because thepractitioners do. \"This is the next part of healthcare, really truly being providers, all getting along and understanding whateverybody does,\" she says. \"I see that happening in thislittle environment here. It has changed so much fromthe day I started, to where it is now. It is just incrediblein how it's grown.\"The affiliation with OSU and its large medical community mean the center's capabilities don't end atits door and walls. \"We also have the advantage of being part of the university, to be able to refer out to neurology oroccupational medicine,\" Hunter explains. \"Now we canbe integrated with the whole medical centerthroughout the university.\" Both Hunter and Grandominico see such facilities as the CIM as a growing trend, although traditionalchiropractic clinics will continue to thrive. As long asthere are patients, there will be a need forpractitioners, and there will always be patients whoonly need one thing or another. \"There are people out there who are looking for just chiropractic or acupuncture or just going to a massagetherapist,\" Grandominico says. \"There's always goingto be a place for the individual practitioner out there.But I think it's always important to be part of a group.That's what attracted me.\"Integrated medicine: Both practitioners and patients gainCONTINUED ON PAGE 26 Cover Story Mary Jo Welker, MD, chairperson of Clinical Family Medicine, was the primemover in creating WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL53: I SSUE 1 J ANUARY 19, 2007Robin Hunter, DC, graduated from Logan College of Chiropractic in 1986.

One thing that is left to chance is the primary goal: patient care. Nomatter the discipline, patients usuallycome to a practice, big or small, forone basic reason: They have ahealthcare problem. At CIM, it isalmost guaranteed that someone cansolve it. And all of the doctors arefocused on providing the right solution. \"When somebody comes through the door here and into our domain \u2014chiropractic \u2014 it's up to me as achiropractor to get a good history andreally decide if their pain syndrome issomething I can treat or is it bettertreated by some other approach,\"Hunter says.At that point, the caregivers' second most important skill comes into play:communication.

Hunter and Grandominico it goes far beyond that. As part of a university with a renowned medicalschool, the Center for Integrative Medicine offersplenty of opportunities to educate far more than justthe patients. The doctors are in an environment in which nearly every medical discipline is either taught or practiced. They can further their own educations and have theability to interact with medical professionals as well asstudents of multiple disciplines. It's not uncommon formedical residents at OSU's medical school to dorotations at the center. \"There are many residencies here at Ohio State,\" Hunter says. \"The ones we see most of the time arefamily-practice residents. A lot of them will choose thisas a rotation instead of some other elective. From whatI understand, those slots are filling up.\" When she was in private practice, Hunter frequently used to have medical students shadow her, watchingher go through the various phases of her day. At the CIM because of its affiliation with the medical school, many students do a similar undertaking. Although they aren't pursuing chiropractic as part oftheir practice, they want to experience something new. Medical students who use the center as a learning facility have more at their disposal than at manymedical schools, which do not typically havechiropractic facilities, or even chiropractors on staff. \"They'll get a full-scope experience here,\" Hunter says. \"The different providers here are involved ingoing out with the residents. They give them talks onchiropractic, or the acupuncturists will go in and talk tothem, or the other providers. We're also teaching somein the medical school here.\" The DCs still educate patients, as any practitioner would. But as Grandominico points out, affiliation with a university takes that opportunity to a wholenew level. \"Here we can focus more on furthering our education and educating people on what we do,\" hesays. \"And we're able to a lot of teaching.\"Taking chiropractic education to a higher level are learning the system of collaboration and informationexchange \u2014 getting notes to primary-care doctors. That system, like thecenter itself, is a work in progress. PRACTICE, NOT PRACTICE-BUILDING Because of the structure of the center, all practitioners focus onpracticing their specialties \u2014 not building a practice or managing apractice. They are doctors all daylong, not managers, not marketers,not recruiters. They take care ofpatients. \"The benefits are awesome,\" Hunter says. \"Who wouldn't saythat? I don't have to worry about themechanics of running a business. Ifthe copier breaks, it gets fixed. Here,the majority of time is spent withpatients. I don't have to worry aboutany of those other things. The stresslevel is way down.\" The one sacrifice, if you can call it that, is a bit of freedom, in terms ofvacation and similar benefits.

On the other side of that coin is a wide world of patient-care possibilities. With roughly 60patients visiting every day (andgrowing), the doctors never knowwhat they might see, treat, or learnabout next. \"You have a more diverse population than in private practice,\"Grandominico says. \"You havepatients who are more into holisticmedicine and who are involved innot just seeing a chiropractor, but aremore into health [wellness] ingeneral. It's nice that we can seemore patients here.\" Hunter and Grandominico have been on both sides of the fence andboth see the OSUCIM as the waveof the future. As the chiropractic andmedical fields continue to integrateand coexist under the same roofs,large facilities with manypractitioners, perhaps affiliated withuniversities or just other medicalcenters will be more beneficial toproviders and patients alike. \"It's already happening,\" Grandominico said. \"It's growing.

When done correctly, adding a physical therapist (PT) to your practice can be a true win-win situation. But, to assure success in expanding your practice in thisdirection, do your homework, weigh all the factors (bothpro and con), then make a decision. PATIENT BENEFITS Let's look at some of the important benefits your patients receive when you include a physical therapist aspart of your treatment team. Second professional opinion. Patients gain the benefit of a second opinion from a professional inanother discipline. Convenience. Patients will be able to get this opinion conveniently, without having to leave youroffice. Expanded rehab. Chiropractic adjustments and rehabilitation exercises go hand in hand, creating asynergistic effect that is usually greater than the effect ofeither therapy alone. This is why so many chiropractors also add rehab modalities to their treatment plan. With a PT on boardyou will be able to offer expanded rehab services to yourpatients along with their chiropractic treatment. Yourpatients will appreciate this extra care and attention. More one-on-one time. In a busy practice it is unlikely that you would be able to spend the sameamount of time as the PT doing rehab with yourpatients. This is because physical therapy emphasizesactive care. More extensive insurance coverage. Insurance companies don't always recognize the value ofchiropractic services in their reimbursement policies, asreflected in limits on chiropractic benefits. This is notusually the case for physical therapy. PT benefits under many insurance plans are greater than chiropractic benefits. This means that in some caseslong after a patient has exhausted their chiropracticbenefit they will still be able to receive physical therapyin your office.These are just a few of the benefits that will accrue to your patients. As you do your homework, you will surelythink of others. Few services you offer can give so muchfor your patients. PRACTICE BENEFITS Having a physical therapist on board can also provide some very substantial benefits to your practice. Stand-alone business. The physical therapy department in your practice can function as anautonomous business. This opens up a business opportunity to an entire demographic of patients you currently don't see \u2014 suchas patients who do not want or are not candidates forchiropractic treatment, but clearly need some form ofrehab; patients who have excellent PT insurancebenefits, but poor chiropractic benefits; Medicarepatients who are only covered for modalities andrehabilitative exercises performed by a licensed physicaltherapist; and post-surgical patients who you may have CONTINUED An added degree of wellness Patients and practice both benefit from DC/PT relationship BY MARC H.

More free time. Much of therehab you now do yourself or iscurrently done under your supervisioncan be done by the PT. This leavesyou free to concentrate on marketingand running the practice. A step toward financial freedom. As a practice owner, you will also be able to gain more freedomand take a big step towards financialindependence and perhapsretirement, when you hire a physicaltherapist. This is because you will becreating a business system that iscapable of running itself, withoutyour presence in the office. Eventually you could hire an associate and put the whole practiceon auto pilot. In the future, you cansell the business for a lump sum, or letPhysical therapists are trained rehabilitation professionals. Like chiropractors and medical doctors, they go through a rigorous program of graduate professional education thatincludes both didactic and practical hands-on clinical work. They also must pass a licensing exam and be licensed before they can practice. In all states PTs are governed by their own PT boards, just as chiropractors and medical doctors are governed by their respective boards. In addition, PTs may supervise PTAs(physical therapy assistants), just as medical doctors supervisePAs (physician assistants) and NPs (nurse practitioners). In some states the supervision PTs give to PTAs may be indirect (the PT may not be in the office). In others, the PT must be onsite. (Note that for Medicare patients thePT must always be onsite.) PTs are able to design and implement a complete rehab program for a variety of conditions, from post stroke injuries to herniated discs and sports injuries. A physical therapist can help you design and can completely direct your rehab department, as well as perform all of the therapies, except for chiropracticmanipulation.

BEFORE YOU START Although the benefits can be great, the decision to hire a PT is animportant one, and mistakes can becostly. Here are some basics to help you. 1. Assess your situation carefully. Consider that adding a PT may notbe right for you. Examine your own practice philosophy. If youbelieve that chiropractic alone is theanswer to every problem and don'tfeel that physical therapy will helpyour patients, then obviously a PTwill never be right for your office. 2. Consider using a consultant. You may not have the capital tocover the cost of hiring the PT untilthird-party payments begin to comein. Similarly you may need to getyour PT enrolled on several insuranceplans, which can often take several months. A knowledgeable practice consultant can help in thesescenarios, by arranging credentialingand by helping with financialprojections. 3. Be realistic about costs. If you decide to add a PT to your office, theprocess of finding and hiring the rightperson can be frustrating. PTs are ingreat demand now, and there is ashortage. Those who are available canbe expensive. Assess your financial situation carefully and be realistic about pay,benefits, and the cost of setting up aseparate business entity. 4. Weigh the PT's philosophies. Other potential obstacles include PTswith a prejudice against chiropractic,PTs who don't want to work in aphysician's office, and PTs who preferto supervise and create treatmentplans as opposed to providing hands-on services. 5. Bone up on the Stark law. Under the guidance of a healthcareattorney and/or your consultant,become knowledgeable about Starklaw. (The Stark law prohibitsphysicians from making referrals forcertain designated health services toany entity with which the physicianshave a financial relationship.) However, if you have made the decision to add physical therapy toyour office and you can surmountthese obstacles or be lucky enoughnot to encounter them, the rewardswill be great for your patients andyour practice.

Despite this, instrument adjusting \u2014 especially high- end computerized instrument adjusting \u2014 is growing in popularity. Three reasons may explain this phenomenon: Laws of physics, patient preferences, and repeatability. Laws of physics. The first, and perhaps the most important, reason is that the laws of physics apply tochiropractic adjustments as well as any other area thatinvolves the transfer of momentum or energy. The theory says that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. As a chiropractor, if you use amore robust and forceful impulse in the adjustment, thegreater the force that is applied to your own body. Students learn that the ideal adjustment is one in which the impulse is delivered as fast and forcefully aspossible. This lesson may be contributing to the earlyretirement of many chiropractors through the self-infliction of repetitive stress injury. Many, if not most, of the individuals who use computerized instruments have suffered adjustment-related injuries and wish to extend their careers byincorporating instrument adjusting into their practices. Patient preferences. The second reason is due to the chiropractic profession's loss in the healthcare marketshare. From 1997 to 2002, the chiropractic professionlost almost 30 percent of the healthcare market share. Instrument adjusting is more patient-friendly and able to attract patients who might otherwise never seekchiropractic care. In part, this attraction may be the lowerforce that is required for adjustment when compared tomanual adjusting. The attraction may also be due to thevisual evidence of the effects of adjustment provided bythe computerized system screens and printouts. Repeatability. Finally, in addition to being gentler on the chiropractor and patient, the analysis of spinalresistance performed with the computerized assessmentinstruments has shown remarkably high repeatability,especially when compared to the lack of repeatability ofmanual palpation. Not only are the computerized analyses more repeatable, but with many instruments, the patient canbe shown the graphical results before and after theadjustment whether the adjustment is done with theinstrument or manually. In addition, recent studies of the effectiveness of computerized multiple impulse adjusting systems indicatethat their use may be just as effective or even moreeffective for some patients as adjusting by hands alone. It will be interesting to watch the continuing development of this rapidly evolving technology and itspotential effect on long and strongly held beliefs withinthe profession. Joseph M.

EVANS, PHD USE A 'DOWNLOAD' BOX A small plastic box similar to those you use in a desk drawer to hold tape, staples, and miscellaneous items can increase your patient flow. Most women keep their personal items in a handbag, but most men need somewhere to place their glasses, keys, and change. A download box does this. Offer each patient a box when he (or she) checks in. He can empty his pockets before you enter the adjusting room, and when you are done, he can take the box with him to the front desk and free upthe room more quickly.

Canyou provide some general guidelines so I can be sure I am billing properly and coding compliantly? Since changes occur to CPT codes and ICD-9(diagnosis) codes every year, you are making awise decision learning as much as possible about CPT coding. Here is a list of the most common CPT coding and compliance dos and don'ts: 1. Do not bill 98941 (spinal, 1-2 regions) or 98942 (spinal, 3-4 regions) on every patient for every visit \u2014unless you can absolutely, with 100 percent accuracy,prove medical necessity in your notes. 2. Incorporate re-evaluations. Keep the doctor and insurance company (and the patient) aware of thepatient's progress. 3. Create a written treatment plan for every new patient. 4. Do not routinely waive co-pays, deductibles, and co- insurance. 5. Do not tell the patient you will accept the co-pay amount listed on their insurance card if you are out-of-network. This may cause the patient to assume you arean in-network provider. 6.

Only bill insurance companies for medically necessary visits. Do not automatically bill for the amount of visits they cover. For example: Just because an insurancecarrier may pay for 20 visits, do not bill for all 20 visits. 8. Know how and when to code and bill for group therapy (CPT code 97150) vs. individual therapy. 9. Do not bill for time-based codes if the procedure only takes one to two minutes to perform. 10. Do not bill 97140 (manual therapy) if you're really doing a 98940 procedure (spinal, 1-2 regions). 11. Do not routinely take full-spine x-rays on every new patient. 12. Make sure your new patient-intake questionnaires are properly completed and make sense. For example: Ifthe intake questionnaire only relates to one region of thespine, it is not possible to bill 98941 (spinal, 3-4 regions)or 98942 (spinal, 5 regions). 13. Do not bill for a report of findings. If you choose to bill for counseling/coordination of care, make sure you cansubstantiate it in your documentation. 14. Re-evaluate your CPT/ICD-9 codes every month or whenever clinically necessary. 15. Do not bill new-patient codes unless the patient has not seen you for three years. 16. Do not bill Medicare using the AT modifier for maintenance care. 17. Use caution when billing modifiers 25 and 59. (Modifier-25 indicates a significant, separately identifiableE/M service by the same physician on the same day of theprocedure or other service. Modifier-59 identifiesprocedures/services that are not normally reportedtogether, but are appropriate under the circumstances.)T wo HHS Office of Inspector General reports stated thateach modifier was used incorrectly nearly 40 percent ofthe time.

Whichpath is better for you depends uponthe results you are looking to achieve. One child-friendly design is created for the convenience of parents. The other is created to promote health benefits for children under chiropractic care. The \"convenience\" design has elements that entertain children while the parent gets adjusted. It keeps childrenoccupied, but it does nothing to promote pediatricchiropractic wellness and usually places a huge burden onyour staff. The \"health benefits\" design creates a child-friendly environment that promotes pediatric chiropracticwellness. Whichever you choose, here are some things you should consider: Location, location, location. A children's play area in the reception room should welcome kids to yourpractice and make them feel safe. Proper design creates a place for children to congregate. The area should be decorated to adviseparents that your clinic is a \"child friendly\" environment.It should also be the first hint that there are numerousbenefits to having children under chiropractic care. Remember, it's never too early to educate patients, even young ones. Who's the babysitter? Position the children's play area so your staff does not have to babysit the children,but keep them away from the front door. Some childrencould be out the door and halfway down the block beforeanyone could begin the chase. Colors. Decorate this area with primary colors and child-level artwork. Back to basics. Utilize safe, fun toys to keep kids' attention. Remember that younger children love to putthings in their mouths. Limit toys to those that are easilywashable and large enough to not be swallowed. Instead of building elaborate, interesting, or unique play areas, go to the basics. Furnish this area with adurable play desk or table and chairs. Open or closed room. Although a private orsoundproof room forchildren sounds like a great idea, itcan actually work against your primary purpose forhaving a kids' space. Creating a private area may give children a \"free for all\" feeling. It might also give parents a false sense offreedom \u2014 that they do not have to watch their ownchildren, because the staff will. Half walls (typically 42 inches) surrounding the play area are a better design choice. This area can be as smallas 5 feet by 5 feet, although larger is better. Avoid sharpcorners by using round \"corner bead\" to finish thecorners of the drywall in this area. Do not place any electrical outlets in or near this area. HIPAA compliance. Be cautious about adding a \"tree of life\" that displays pictures of the children youadjust unless you have a signed release that complieswith HIPAA rules. It is important, however, to visually explain the importance of having children checked. Ensure that yourpediatric patient educational brochures are situated forsimple distribution to all patients early in theirchiropractic experience. Entertainment. Keep the children's area interesting, but not entertaining. The primary purpose of the area isto prevent children from losing their attention spanbefore you have the chance to \"check or adjust\" them. Kids' play areas are often so much fun that they actually extend the typical visit by as much as 10 percentor more, which is not in anyone's best interest. Note: If you offer video entertainment, take advantage of the opportunity to train young minds for the behavioryou want. Adjusting area. A semi open adjusting area is the perfect location for a children's play area. Their parents arepresent to control them, and they are where you need themto make it easy to get them checked. An added benefit isthat your front-desk assistant does not have to babysit.

The only time this is aproblem is when the doctor has nocontrol over the facility. At no timeis it OK for children or adults to turnyour adjusting area into a socialevent. If you practice in a closed-room environment, acclimate your youngpatients to the fun aspect ofchiropractic. Do not alienate themwith mixed messages. Let childrenexperience the sights and sounds ofthe adjusting environment before theactual adjustment. This helps toeliminate any fear and anxiety thechild may experience before theadjustment. A family room is a perfect solution for this. Simply adding two feet to thewidth of any standard adjusting roomwill allow you to add a \"sub-waitingroom\" within the adjusting room. The sub-waiting area can be as simple as a bench that can seat theentire family (approximately 6 or 8feet long), installed on the same wallas the door opening. The bench letsthe children snuggle to the safety ofthe parent as they transition to theirown adjustment.

Unless you have numerousrooms with special children's tables,you will severely restrict patient flowwhen more than one family arrives atyour practice at the same time. Safety first. Locate switches to powered tables out of reach of children\u2014 at least 6 feet above the floor. Avoid trailing power cords from the table across the floor to the walloutlet. Install floor outlets directlyunder the table or use high quality\"thresholds\" to safely hide thispotential tripping hazard.

They go through hormonal,postural, and emotional changes in pregnancy, and their nervous systemdoes not function optimally. Fulfillingthis need can be an exceptional way togrow your practice. Creating and promoting a pregnancy chiropractic practice may be easier than you think. Here are several things you can do to get started: Obtain the proper knowledge. Learn all you can about pregnancy to communicate effectively andprofessionally. Become proficient in the special needs of apregnant woman. Become extremely familiar with thecommon complaints associated with each pregnancy stage. For instance: Primary complaints in the first trimester are nausea and headaches, while in the third trimester,low back pain is a predominant concern. Learn how toaddress these complaints effectively while communicatingthe importance of a properly functioning nervous system. Purchase the right equipment. Have the proper equipment available now so you are prepared before youneed to be. During the first trimester of pregnancy, a woman's breasts are tender and painful so having a soft table or cushion willhelp to alleviate any discomfort. When a woman isapproaching the end of the second trimester, you will needto accommodate her growing abdomen with cushions or anadjusting table with a tilt up pelvic piece or a break awaylumbar piece. A knee chest table is also excellent. Get connected. Take advantage of your established relationships with your own medical doctor, obstetrician,or midwife. Call on area midwives, doulas, childbirtheducators, and obstetricians to introduce yourself andyour expert services. Inform these professionals of the benefits of chiropractic care as related to them. For example: Prenatal chiropractic care may enable a lower c-section rate. Obstetricians, however, may notperceive this to be a benefit to them. But, explaining thatlowering the c-section rate may also reduce theirmalpractice insurance and liability may get their attention. Teach MDs the value of drugless chiropractic care, especially during pregnancy. Offer classes to pregnancy-care specialists and teach them when their patientswould benefit from chiropractic care. Provide appropriate examples. Give pregnancy- care specialists tools to help them make referrals, such asa checklist of people who qualify as prenatal chiropracticpatients or a list of major discomforts that can bealleviated by chiropractic, so they can confidently identifypeople in their practice who need your precision care. For example: A woman complaining of round ligament pain may need the pubic bone evaluated by achiropractor. Become exclusive. Build a relationship of exclusivity. When yourpatients need the services of a midwifeor doula, refer exclusively to her, inexchange for the same favor when one ofher patients/clients needs chiropractic care. Put the word out. Make or purchase pregnancy brochures and pass them out atplaces pregnant women go such as babysupply stores or shops with baby registries. Perform lectures and screenings at La Leche League meetings, childbirthclasses, children's specialty stores, andlibraries. Advertise your lectures inthe local newspaper. Organize a yoga class specifically for pregnant womento prepare for childbirth andopen it up to your wholecommunity. If possible, hold theclass in your office and use it as ateaching opportunity. Post photos in your office of pregnant women getting an adjustment to buildcuriosity and get pregnant women tolearn more about chiropractic care. Remember: Doctor means teacher.

And the wellness revolution is a clear example of that.Without wellness innovation, wellnessrevolution would not be taking place. Innovation can occur in a number of different areas of chiropractic, such as: Techniques. Many new techniques have been introduced to chiropractic within the last 111 years. Many new techniques will continue to be introduced inthe future. Instrumentation (analysis and adjusting). From the neurocalometer to sEMG and thermography, findingbetter ways to measure what we do is essential to ourevolution. Schools. New and different curricula and experiential processes help ensure progress in how weeducate the next generation of chiropractors. Patient education. The methods of communicating to patients and the public what we do and why we do itbenefit from constant improvement. Models of practice. You can always find a way to deliver service more efficiently, with better results, and ina more cost-effective manner. Systems for practice (software, business, etc.). With ever-evolving technology comes constantimprovement in office systems. You may already have ideas you'd like to develop in one or more of these areas. For most people having newideas is not the difficult part. The challenge lies inputting action behind the idea and developing it intoreality. Having the determination to work out the detailsand withstand the resistance to new concepts is whatmakes the difference between seeing innovation come tofruition and suffering through years of asking \"what if.\" FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY Here are some things to do to go from concept to reality with your ideas: 1. Schedule regular creative thinking time. Start by putting aside some time in your weekly schedule forsome meditative thinking time with no interruptions ordisturbances. This is when visualization of ideal solutions to everyday challenges can take place. Once this practicebecomes routine, consider making it a daily event to freeyour mind from the confines of day to day business. 2. Write down all your ideas. Get into the habit of keeping a notepad handy at all times. When an idea pops into your head, write it down and let all the details download from your head to the paper beforea distraction occurs. Many times the idea comes along, butthe details don't follow until several days or weeks later. Always keep a pen and paper on your nightstand to capture your most creative ideas that usually occur in themiddle of the night when you're fast asleep. 3. Build a team. When it's time to take action on an innovative idea, it is very important to have a teamassembled that can help ensure things are done correctlywith some measures of protection. An intellectual property (IP) attorney is essential to this team to protect your ideas by filing for copyrights, trade-marks, or patents. Other key team members includeindividuals who are familiar with business development,grant writing, and marketing of new products and services. Strategic alliances and endorsements from prominent names in an industry can be another very helpful part ofyour team. 4. Budget time and money.

What are the steps neededto achieve the ideal result and who isinvolved in that process? Answeringthese and other questions will helpkeep the thought process on trackand allow you to monitor if you areaccomplishing what you set out to do. Innovation comes from all of us and it can happen at any time. It isthe foundation of progress both forthe individual and the profession.The important thing at this point isto take action and decide what to dowith your new idea, as a wise manonce said \"either do it, delegate it,or dump it.\" If you have new ideas,get them on paper, put the energybehind it, and get started!

CIRCLE WWW .CHIROECO .COM SSUE 1 J ANUARY 19, 2007It's worth repeating: Chiropractors who do public speaking in their communitiestend to have more successful practices than those who don't. Speaking is one of the fastest, easiest, and least costly ways to become better known in your community and it gives you tremendous credibility that only increasesover time. Most DCs already have the qualifications and ability to be effective public speakers since it is just anextension of in-office patient education. So, what keepssome of you from doing public speaking? According to The Book of Lists, the fear of public speaking ranks number one in the minds of the majorityof people. Far above the fear of death and disease, comesthe fear of standing in front of a crowd. Psychologists explain stage fright as merely emotional excitement. Its impact on a speaker can be negative or positive, depending on the meaning attached to it. If you think of stage fright as a sign of nervousness orinadequacy, then it will reinforce those feelings and makeyou anxious and afraid. But if you think of the extra adrenalin being pumped into your system as a normal, healthy response toemotional excitement, stage fright acts as a booster. Youremotional response will reinforce your positive feelingsand enable you to think clearly, speak better, and bemore enthusiastic. Follow these steps to better your public speaking: Be prepared. The first and most important way to conquer stage fright is with thorough preparationwhich involves three important things: researching,writing, and rehearsing. The more time you spend on these steps, the more familiar you will be with your presentation. This willsignificantly enhance your self-confidence and delivery. The smooth delivery of an accomplished speaker is deceptive. It is rarely as easy as it looks. As Mark T wainonce observed, \"It takes me about five-and-a-half weeksto prepare a good impromptu speech.\" Breathe. Another way to cope with nerves is with deep breathing. Just before your presentation, fill your lungs as completely as possible. Then exhale asmuch as you can. Repeat this exercise 10 or 12times. It will help reduce shortness of breath, putyou at ease, and improve your delivery. Relax. Other tricks to help you relax include listening to music; doing isometrics that tighten and release muscles; and meeting and talking withmembers of the audience beforehand. Remember, nervousness doesn't show one-tenth as much it feels. People who are most bothered by stage fright are those who are least accustomed to public speaking. The remedyis simple: practice, practice, practice. Bob Levoy is a seminar speaker and writer who focuses on the healthcare industry.

To avoid this misperception: Don't give out business cards unless asked for one; Don't make repeated references to your practice and your patients; and Keep your presentation informative and low-key.

Despite that financial burden, those same laws can also ease the financial \"bite\" you face when compelled to make changes to your practice or to the way you operate. These changes can be lumped into several categories: Improvements, Access for the disabled, Leases, Intagible assets, Inventories, and Accounting methods. IMPROVEMENTS The costs of making improvements to any business asset, regardless of whether those changes were mandatedor not, is a capital expense, because the improvementsoften add to its value, or adapt it to a different use. Newelectrical wiring, a new roof, new plumbing, bricking upwindows to strengthen a wall, and lighting improvementsare all capital expenses. However, you can currently deduct or write off repairs that keep the property in normal, efficient operatingcondition. Reconditioning, improving, or altering theproperty as part of an overall restoration plan aregenerally capitalized \u2014 but not always. ACCESS FOR THE DISABLED The Americans with Disabilities Act, which passed in 1990, requires businesses to make their premises moreaccessible to disabled, handicapped, and elderly patients,as well as employees. The Act also contains tax deductions that affected businesses can use to reduce their out-of-pocket expensesfor making needed improvements. Costs paid or incurred to completely renovate or build a facility, or to replace depreciable property in thenormal course of business, do not qualify for this expensededuction. But you can deduct up to $15,000 each year, the cost of removing architectural, communication, physical, ortransportation barriers that prevent your practice frombeing accessible or usable by disabled and elderlyindividuals. You also have the option of a reduction ofthe operation's tax bill rather than a deduction from itstaxable income. All eligible small practices and businesses, those with fewer than 30 employees or gross receipts of less than $1million last year, are entitled to a tax credit forexpenditures to make the premises accessible to disabledindividuals. The amount of that credit is 50 percent ofthe amount of all eligible access expenditures from $250to $10,250 each year. CHANGING A LEASE Sometimes, franchise organizations, government bodies, the courts, or your patients mandate changingyour practice's lease. Whether you modify an existinglease or negotiate a longer term, these changes mayrequire the payment of additional amounts of \"rent\" overpart of the lease period. Unfortunately, you cannot deduct payments made to modify or change a lease, even if they are described asrent in the agreement. But, you can capitalize thosepayments and deduct them over the remaining period ofthe lease. If you make permanent improvements to leased property, you can depreciate the costs of thoseimprovements over the recovery period for the property.You cannot, however, amortize them over the remainingterm of the lease. INVOLUNTARY GAINS Special tax rules exist when property is destroyed, stolen, condemned, or disposed of under the threat ofcondemnation. In these situations, you normally reportgain from an involuntary conversion of business propertyand deduct losses on your annual tax return for the year Depending on the type of replacement property, you may not have to report the involuntary conversion. Youwould not report, for example, a gain on an involuntaryEasing the 'bite' of mandated changes BY MARK E.

You can defer your tax bill if you buy a qualifying replacementproperty within a certain time periodif you receive other property ormoney in payment, such as insuranceor a condemnation award that is notsimilar or related in service or use tothe involuntarily converted property.The basis in the new property will bethe same as the basis, or book value,in the converted property. ABANDONED PROPERTY At the root of the tax law's financial helping hand are the basic tax rules forabandonment or obsolescencelosses. Under the tax rules, youcan claim a loss for theabandonment of anydepreciable asset such as abroken chiropractic table, apollution-producing businessvehicle, and the building thathouses the practice. The abandonment loss is the figure listed on the practice'sbooks for the abandonedproperty and its adjusted basis.Your practice must, in thewords of our lawmakers \"manifest anirrevocable intent to abandon(discard) the asset, so that it willneither be used again by the taxpayernor retrieved for sale, exchange, orother disposition.\" INTANGIBLE ASSETS The impact on the intangible assets is often overlooked whenchanges are required. Our tax rulesgenerally classify intangible assets asthe practice's \"good will\" \u2014covenants compete, leases,patient lists, and even so-called\"workforce in place.\" Intangible assets are not ordinarily tax deductible unless they have been\"acquired,\" such as when buying anew practice or negotiating a lease.Often times, you have alreadywritten off the time and expensesinvested in creating the intangibleassets as ordinary business expenses. If, however, that intangible asset has a value on the practice's books,should the practice fold, a lease belost, or a patient list becomeoutdated, the practice can quicklyclaim a loss deduction forabandonment. That loss deductionequals the amount shown on thebooks for that intangible asset. INVENTORIES As in any practice, inventoried supplies, goods, or products becomedated, obsolescent, or merelyunusable. Whether you use the\"cost\" or the \"lower of cost ormarket\" methods to value yourinventories, inventoried goods thatbecome unsalable or unusable shouldbe valued at bona fide selling price,less the cost of selling. You can perform a valuation adjustment, on a reasonable basis butnot less than scrap value, for unsalableor unusable inventory items. ACCOUNTING METHODS One of the most annoying changes facing you \u2014 and your practice \u2014may be a change in the accountingmethod which the IRS may mandateto better reflect income and expenses. A change in accounting methods can encompass the way various typesof income are treated or expensestracked, and the time when youenter income or expenses on thebooks \u2014 but does not includecorrections of mathematical orposting errors or errors in computingtax liability. An accounting method change involves adjustments to income in the year of the change becauseit might result in bunching ofincome. If the adjustmentsincrease taxable income bymore than $3,000, you mayapply two methods of limitingthe tax in the changeover year. The tax increase in the year of changeover is limited to thetax increases that would resultif the adjustments were spreadratably over that year and thepreceding tax years. For thislimitation to apply, the oldmethod of accounting had tohave been in use in the twopreceding years. Government entities, landlords, suppliers, or evenyour patients may demandchanges. Fortunately, our tax rules contain a variety of provisionsto enable every practice to not onlycomply with those mandatedchanges, but in many cases,substantially reduce the out-of-pocket costs of that compliance.

I have established roots in thiscity with my family and do not want to move. However, I signed a non-compete clause in the originalcontract. I heard that non-compete clauses may not beenforceable. Is this true? This is a very common question on both sides ofthe equation. The associate wants to break theagreement, and the employer wants to enforce it to the fullest. Many variables exist in state laws regardingnon-compete employment clauses so you will want tohire a local attorney familiar with this specific issue toassist you. Some states do not allow non-compete provisions, while others are very strict on their enforcement. Theconsequences of not investigating can be financiallydevastating if you decide to just \"wing it.\" While the potential variations are high, you can start your analysis with a couple of basic provisions. Thefoundation is reasonableness. The geographic boundariesand timelines for the non-compete terminology must bereasonable in scope. The courts will look to find what isnecessary to protect the employer's business, yet notimpede the associate chiropractor's ability to work. A timeline of two years is generally reasonable. When the restriction goes beyond this, it is difficult for theemployer to justify the restrictions for the protection oftheir business. The geographic radius is somewhat more variable. Population density appears to be one factor that playsimportance in this analysis. Rural area practices tend tohave higher geographical zones for protection than moreurbanized practices. Thus, a rural chiropractic practice may have a geographical restriction of 15 miles and be consideredreasonable, where an urban practice may only have arestriction of blocks or one to three miles for the samereasonableness. The key is to look at what appears to bethe precedent for your region. Review cases of doctors who have challenged their non-compete clauses to see what the courts havedecided. For example: In a case in Wisconsin, a young doctor agreed to a two-year, 20-mile radius in her contract.Upon leaving the employer chiropractor's office, she setup a new office, but only went 19.8 miles away, thinkingthat would satisfy the 20-mile radius. The employer did not agree and filed for an injunction. The courts agreed with the employer, and hewas able to enforce the injunction and shut down theyoung doctor's new office. The ensuing financial issuesgrew for this doctor, since she now had signed contractsfor the building, equipment, and utilities, but was notable to practice in the location. Although an associate may have multiple reasons for breaking the contract clause, such as an employer'sbreech of other provisions of the contract, thesejustifications may not provide a legal basis to violate thenon-compete. There are cases in which the courts have found the original contract provisions to be unreasonable, butinstead of disallowing the entire clause, they havecreated or written restrictions that are reasonable. Hire a local attorney and take the time necessary to find the correct information regarding your obligationsassociated with the employment contract you signedbefore you sign any new leases for buildings and/orequipment. The non-complete clause is one clause that employer doctors will usually strive to enforce as they believe itwill dramatically affect their business. While it may seemexpensive to hire an attorney, it will actually save youtime and money in the end.

Before you venture into this scary thing called \"chiropractic practice,\" take some time to get to know yourself better, so you'll know your strong points andthose you need to work onbefore going into practice.

First, what about you personally? Do you know what kind of person you are? Do you knowhow well you communicate with others? Do you knowyour personality type? Many personality tests are available to get a better insight into yourself. Let's start with the \"Big Five,\" atool that measures your personality across fivedimensions: extroversion, emotional stability, orderliness,accommodation, and intellect. It is similar to the Meyers-Briggs and the DISC personality types, but it includes the dimension ofemotional stability that they lack and which is a vitalelement in your ability to relate to patients. Here's theWeb link for the test:http://similarminds.com/bigfive.html. So why do you need to know your personality type? In addition to getting to know yourself better, you can learnmore about your personality type as it relates to yourability to start your business. For example: If you are an extrovert you will have little trouble talking to lots of people before you start yourpractice. On the other hand, if you are an introvert, you will have to work harder at overcoming your resistanceto meeting people. Or you will have to find other ways toget people into your practice. Another valuable way to analyze your personality is to use the Wilson SocialStyles, which tell you a lotabout the ways in whichyou interact with others, inorder to enhance yourinterpersonal effectiveness. Of all the skills you need to succeed in practice, yourability to relate to (that is, to win friends and influence) people, is paramount, andthis instrument gives you a sense of how you relate toothers. This instrument provides you with descriptors ontwo continuums: assertiveness and responsiveness. Taking the test gives you two high descriptors of four (Driver, Amiable, Expressive, Analytical). For example: You might be an Amiable Driver, or an Expressive Driver.
