FULL PRE SCRIBIN G INF ORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ProQu ad is a vac cine indicat ed for active immunization for t of measles, mumps , rubella, and vari cella in children 12 mo nths through 12 y ears of age. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRA TION For Intramuscula r or Subcutaneous administration only 2.1 Dose and Sched ule A single dose of P roQuad is approximately 0.5 mL. T he first dose is ad ministered at 12 to 1 5 mont hs of age but may be given anytime through 12 years of age. The second dose is adminis te red at 4 to 6 years of a ge. At least 1 month should elapse betwe en a dose of a measles -containing vaccine and a dose of ProQuad. At least 3 months sho uld elapse b etween a dose of varicell a-containing va ccine and ProQua d. 2.2 Preparation for Admini strat ion The sterile diluent for ProQuad is provided in either a vial or prefilled syringe. Sterile Diluent Vial Use a sterile syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents for each injection and/or reconstitutio n of the vaccine because these substances may inactivate the live virus vaccine. To reconstitute, use the sterile diluent vial supplied with ProQuad . The sterile diluent does not contain preservatives or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine viruses . To reconstitute the vaccine , withdraw the entire volume of the suppl ied sterile diluent from the vial and slowly inject into the lyophil ized vacci ne vial. Gently agitate to dissolve completel y. Discard if the lyophilized vaccine cannot be dissolved. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit. Visually inspect the vaccine before and after reconstitution prior to administration. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline plug. ProQuad, when reconstituted, is a clear pale yellow to light pink liquid. Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if particulates are present or if it appears discolored. Withdraw and administer the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine . Administer ProQuad immediately after reconstitution. If not used imme diately, the reconstituted vaccine may be stored at room temperature, protected from light, for up to 30 minutes. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 30 minutes. Sterile Diluent Prefilled Syringe To reconstitute, use the sterile diluent prefilled syringe supplied with the vaccine since it does not contain preservativ es or other antiviral substances which might inactivate the vaccine viruses . Attach a needle to the prefilled syringe. Reconstitute the vaccine by slowly inject ing the entire volume of sterile diluent contained in the prefilled syringe into the lyophilized vaccine vial. Gently agitate to dissolve completely. Discard if the lyophilized vaccine cannot be dissolved. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Visually inspect the vaccine before and after reconstitution prior to administration. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline plug. ProQuad, when reconstituted, is a clear pale yellow to light pink liquid. Do not use the reconstituted vaccine if particulates are present or if it appears discolored. Withdraw and administer the entire volume of the reconstituted vaccine.3Administer ProQuad immediately after reconstitution. If not used immedia tely, the reconstituted vaccine may be stored at room temperature, protected from light, for up to 30 minutes. Discard reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 30 minut es. 2.3 Administration Inject the vaccine intramusc ularly or ENGTHS ProQuad is a suspensi on for injection supplied as a single dose vial of lyophilized vaccine to be reconstituted using the accompanying sterile diluent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and How Supplied/S torage and Handling (16) ]. A single dose af ter reconsti tution is approximately 0.5 mL . 4 CONTRAI NDICATIONS 4.1 Hypersensitivity Do not administer ProQu ad to individuals with a history of hypersensitiv ity to any component of the vaccine (including gelatin) {1} or to a previous dose of M-M-R II (Mea sles, Mumps, Rubella, Live), ProQuad or VARIVAX mumps , varicella -containing vaccine. Do not administer ProQuad to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to neom ycin [see Description (11)]. 4.2 Immunosuppression Do administer ProQuad vaccine to individuals who are immuno defici ent or immunosuppressed due to disease or inclusion body encephalitis {2} (MIBE) , pneumonitis {3} and death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported in i mmunocompromised individua ls inadvertently vaccinated with measles -containing vaccine. In this population , disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection have also been reported. Disseminated varicella disease and extensive vaccine -associated rash have been reported in individuals who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient who were inadvertently vaccinated with a varicel la-containing vaccine {4}. 4.3 Moderat e or Severe Febrile Illness Do not administer Pro Quad to i ndividuals with an active febrile illness with fever >1 01.3F (>38. 5C). 4.4 Active Untreated Tub erculosis Do ad minis t er ProQuad vaccine to indi viduals with active untre ated tuberculosis (TB). 4.5 Pregnancy Do not administer ProQuad to individua ls who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregna nt in the next 3 month s [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patie nt C ounseling Information (17 )]. 5 WARNINGS A ND PREC AUTIO NS 5.1 Fever and Febrile S eizures Admi nistration of ProQuad (dose 1) to children 12 to 23 months old who have not been previo usly vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, or varice lla, nor had a history of the wild-type infections, is associ ated wi th higher rates of fever and fe brile seizur es at 5 to 12 days after vaccination when com pared to children vaccinated with a first dose of M-M-R II and VARIVAX administered concomitantly [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)] . Exercise caution when administer ing ProQuad to persons with an individual or family history of febrile seiz ures. 5.2 Hypersens itivity to Eggs Individuals with a history of anaphylactic , anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breath ing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of im mediate - type hypersensitivity rea ctions after receiving ProQuad vaccin e. The potential risks and known benefits should be evaluated before considering vaccinatio n in these individuals vaccin ation with measles , mump s and rubel la vaccine. Carefull y evaluate the potential risk and benefit of vaccin ation in children4with thromboc ytopenia or in those who experienced thrombocytopenia after vaccination with a previous dose of a and rubella History Immunodef iciency Vacc ination should be deferred in individua ls a family history of congenital or heredi tary immunodeficiency until the individual 's immune status has been evaluated and the individual has been found to be immunocompeten t. 5.5 Use i n HIV -Infect ed Individua ls The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommendations on the use of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected individu als. 5.6 Risk of Vaccine Virus Transmission Post-licensing experience suggests that transmission of varicella vacci ne virus (Oka/Merck ) resulting in varicella infect ion including disseminated disease may occur betwe en vaccine recipients (who develop or do not develop a varicella -like rash) and contacts susceptible to varice lla including healthy as well as high-risk individual s. High- risk individuals suscep tible to varicella include: Immunocompromised individuals ; Pregnant women without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or laborat ory evidence of prior infect ion; Newborn infants of mothers without documented positive history of varicella or laborat ory evidence of prior infection and all newborn infants born at <28 weeks gestation regardless of maternal varicella immunity . Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, to the extent possibl e, close association with high-risk individuals suscept ible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination . In circumstances where contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella is unavoidable, the potential risk of transmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and transmitting wild-type varicella viru s. Excretion of small amount s of the live, attenuated rubella virus from the nose or thro at has occurred in the major ity of susceptible individu als 7 to 28 days after vaccin ation. There is no confirm ed eviden ce to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accept ed as a theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significan t risk. However, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to infants via br east milk has been documented [see Use in Specific Population s (8.2)]. There are no repor ts of transmission of the more attenuat ed Enders' Edmons ton strain of measles virus or the Jeryl Lynn st rain of mumps virus from vaccine r ecip ients to susceptible con tacts. 5.7 Immune Globulins and Transfusions Immune Globulins (IG) and other blood produc ts should not be given concurrently with ProQuad [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. These products may contain antibodies that interfere with vaccine virus replication and decrease the expected immune response. The ACIP has speci fic recomme ndations for of conta ining produc ts and live virus vaccines . 5.8 Salicylate Therapy Avoid the use of salicylates (aspirin) or salicylate -containing products in children and adolescents 12 months through 12 years of age, for six weeks following vaccination with ProQuad due to the asso ciation of Reye syndrome with salicyla te therapy and wild- type varicella infection [see Drug Interactio ns (7.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 6 ADVERS E REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Ex perience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse rea ction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be direc tly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Vaccine-related adverse reacti ons reported during clinical trials were assessed by the study investigator s to be possibly, probably, or definitely vaccine -related and are summarized below .5Children 12 Through 23 Months of Age Who Rec eived a S ingle Dose of Pro Quad ProQuad was administer ed subcutane ously to 4497 children 12 through 23 months of age involve d in 4 randomized clinical trials withou t concomitant a dministration with other vaccines. The safety of ProQua d was compared with the safety of M-M-R II and VARIVAX given concomitantly (N=2038) at separa te injection sites. The safety profile for ProQ uad was similar to the component vaccines. Children in these studies were monitored for up to 42 days postvaccinatio n using vaccination report card-aided surveillance. Safety follow-up was obt ained f or 98 % of children in each grou p. Few subje cts (<0.1%) who received ProQuad discontinued the study due to an adverse reaction. The race distribution of the study subjects across these studies following a first dose of ProQuad was 0.2% American Indian. The ra cial distributi on of the control group was similar to that of the group who received ProQuad . The gend er distribution across the studi es following a first dose of ProQu ad was 52.5% male and 47.5% female. The gender distribution of the control group was similar to that of the group who received ProQuad. Vaccine -related injection-site and systemic adverse reaction s observed among recipient s of ProQuad or M-M-R II and VARIV AX at a rate of at least 1% are shown in Table 1. Systemic vaccine -related adverse react ions that were reported at a significantly greater rate in individuals who received a first dose of ProQuad than in individuals who re ceived first doses of M-M-R II and VARIVAX concomi tantly se parate injecti oral 1.8). Both fever and measles -like rash usually occurred within 5 to 12 days following the vaccination, were of short duration, and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain/tendernes s/soreness at the injection site was reported at a statistically lower rate in individ uals who re ceived P roQu ad than in individuals who receive d M-M-R II and VARIVAX concomitantly at separate injection sites adverse reactio n that was more frequen t among recipients of ProQuad than recipients of M-M-R II and VARIVAX was rash at the injection site Tabl e 1: Vaccine - Related Injection -Site an d Systemic Adve rse Reactio ns Repor ted in 1% of Children Who Received Pr oQuad Dose 1 or M -M-R II and VARIVAX at 12 to 23 Months of Age (0 to 42 Days Postvaccination) Adverse Reactions ProQuad (N=4497) (n=4424) % M-M-R Ecchymosis Rash 22.0 14.4 8.4 1.5 2.3 26.7 15.8 9.8 2.3 1.5 Systemic Fever, Irritability Measles -like rash Varicella -like rash Rash (not otherwise specified) Upper respiratory infection Viral exanthema Diarrhea 21.5 6.7 3.0 2.1 1.6 1.3 1.2 1.214.9 6.7 2.1 2.2 1.4 1.1 1.1 1.3 * Injection -site adverse reactions for M-M-R II and VARIVAX are based on occurrence with either of the vaccines a dministered.

Rubella - like rashes were observed in <1% of s ubjects following a first dose of ProQuad.6In these clinical trials, two cases of herpes zoster were reported among 2108 healthy subjects 12 through 23 months of age who were vaccinated with their first dose of ProQuad and followed for 1 year. Both cas es w ere unremarkable and no sequelae w ere reported. Children 15 to 31 Months of A ge Who Received a Second Dose of ProQuad In 5 clinical trials, 2780 healthy children were v accinated subcutaneously with ProQuad (dose 1) at 12 to 23 months of age and then admini stered a second dose approximately 3 to 9 months later. The race distribution of the study subjects across these studies following a second dose of ProQuad was as follows: The gender distributio n across the studies following a second dose of ProQuad was 51.5% male and 48.5% female. Children in these open -label studies were monitored for at least 28 days postvaccination using vaccination report card-aided surveillance. Safety follow -up was obtaine d for approximately 97% of children overall. Vaccine -related injection -site and systemic adverse reactions observed after Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad at a rate of at least 1% are shown in Table 2. In these trial s, the overall rates of systemic adverse reaction s after ProQuad (dose 2) were comparable to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose. In the subset of children who received both ProQuad dose 1 and dose 2 in these trials (N=2408) with follow -up for fever, fever 102.2\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) was observed significantly less frequently days 1 to 28 after the second dose (10.8%) than after the first dose (19.1%) (risk CI: 6.4, 10.3). to 12 after vaccinations were also repor ted significantly less frequently after dose 2 (3.9%) than after dose 1 (13.6%) (risk difference 9.7%, 95% CI: 8.1, 11.3). In the subset of children who received both doses and for whom injection -site reactions were reported (N=2679), injection -site e rythe ma was noted significantly more frequently after ProQuad (dose 2) as compared to ProQuad (dose 1) (12.6% and 10.8%, respectively, risk difference -1.8, 95% CI: -3.3, - 0.3); however, pain and tenderness at the injection site was significantly lower after dose 2 (16.1%) as compared with after dose 1 (21.9%) (risk difference, 5.8%, 95% CI: 4.1, 7.6). Two children had febrile seizures after ProQuad (dose 2); both febrile seizure s were thought to be related to a concurrent viral illness [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Clinical Studies (14)]. These studies were not designed or statistically powered to detect a difference in rates of febrile seizure between recipients of ProQuad as compared to M -M-R II and VARIVAX . The risk of febrile seizure has not be en eva luate d in a clinical study comparing the incidence rate after ProQuad (dose 2) with the incidence rate after concomitant M-M-R II (dose 2) and VARIVAX (dose 2) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Children 4 to 6 Years of Age Who Received ProQuad After Prim ary Vaccination with M -M-R II and VARIVAX ].

Chil dren in these studies were m onitored for up to 42 days post vaccination using vaccination report card-aided surveillance. Safety follow -up was obtained for >98% of children in each group. The race distribution of the study subjects following a dose of ProQu ad was as a dose of ProQuad was 52.1% male and 47.9% female .

Safety in Trials T hat Evaluated Concomitant Use with Other Vaccines ProQuad Administered with Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed b Conjugate (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine In an open -label clinical trial, 1434 children were randomized to receive ProQuad administ ered subcutaneously given with adsorbed b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine concomitantly (N=949) or non -concomit antly with ProQuad given first and the o ther vaccines 6 weeks later (N=485). No clinically significant differences in adverse events were reported between treatment groups [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The race distribution of the study subjects who receive d ProQuad was American Indian. The gender distribution of the study subjects who received ProQuad was 53.6% male and 46.4% female.8ProQuad Administered with Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine and/or Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated In an open -label clinical trial, 1027 healthy children 12 to 23 months of age were randomized to receive ProQuad administered subcutaneously (dose 1) and pneumoc 7-valent conjugate vaccine (dose 4) concomitantly (N=510) or non-concomitantly at different clinic visits (N=517). The race distribution of the study subjects was of the study subjects was 54.5% male and 45.5% female. Injection -site and systemic adverse reactions observed among recipients of ProQuad administered concomitantly or non - concomitantly with pneumococcal 7 -valent conju gate vaccine at a rate of at least 1% are shown in Table 4.

In an open -label clinical trial, 699 healthy children 12 to 23 months of age were randomized to receive 2 doses of VAQTA (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated ) (N=352) or 2 doses of VAQTA concomitantly with 2 doses of ProQuad administered subcutaneously (N=347) at least 6 months apart. An additional 1101 subjects received 2 doses of VAQTA alone at least 6 months apart (non-randomized), resulting in 1453 subjects receiving 2 doses of VAQTA alone (1101 non-randomized and 352 randomized) and 347 subjects receiving 2 doses of VAQTA concomitantly with ProQuad (all randomized). The race distribution of the study subjects following a dose of ProQuad The gender distribution of the study subjects following a dose of ProQuad was 49.3% male and 50.7% female. Vaccine -related injection -site adverse reactions (days 1 to 5 postvaccination) and systemic adve rse events (days 1 to 14 post VAQTA and days 1 to 28 post ProQuad vaccination) observed among recipients of VAQTA and ProQuad administered concomitantly with VAQTA at a rate of at least 1% are shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. In addition, among the randomized cohort, in the 14 days after each vaccination, the rates of fever (including all vaccine - and non-vaccine -related reports) were significantly higher in subjects who received ProQu ad with VAQTA concomitantly after dose 1 (22.0%) as compared to subjects given dose 1 of VAQTA without9 ProQuad (10.8%). However, rates of fever were not significantly higher in subjects who received ProQuad with VAQTA concomitantly after dose 2 (12.5%) as compared to subjects given dose 2 of VAQTA without ProQuad (9.4%). In post-hoc analyses, these rates were significantly different for dose 1 (relative risk (RR) 2.03 [95% CI: 1.42, 2.94] ), [95% CI: 0.82, 2.13]). Rates of injection -site adverse reactions and other systemic adverse events were lower following a second dose than following the first dose of both vaccines given concomitantly.

N = number of subjects vaccinated. n = number of subjects with safety follow -up. In an open -label clinical trial, 653 children 12 to 23 months of age were randomized to receive a first dose of ProQuad administered subcutaneously VAQTA and pneumoco ccal 7-valent administered subcuta neously and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine concomitantly and then vaccinated with VAQTA 6 weeks later (N=323). Approximately 6 months later, subje cts received either the second doses of ProQuad and10VAQT A concomitantly or the second doses of ProQuad and VAQTA separately. The race distribution of the study subjects was as follows: 60.3% White ; 0.3% American Indian . The gender distribution of the study subjects was 50.7% male and 49.3% female. Vaccine -related injection -site and systemic adverse reactions observed among recipients of concomitant ProQuad, VAQTA, and pneumococcal 7 - valent and pneumococcal 7 - valent conjugate vaccine at a rate of at least 1% are shown in Tables 7 and 8. In the 28 days after vaccination with the first dose of ProQuad, the rates of fever (including all vaccine - and non-vacci ne-related reports) were comparable in subjects who received the 3 vaccines together (38.6%) as compar ed with subjects given ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (42.7%). The rates of fever in the 28 days following the second dose of ProQuad were also comparable in subjects who received ProQuad and VAQTA together (17.4%) as compared with subjects given ProQuad separately from VAQTA (17.0%). In a post-hoc analysis, these differences were not statistically significant after ProQuad (dose 1) (RR 0.90 [95% CI: 0.75, 1.09]) nor after dose 2 (RR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.70, 1.51]). No clinically significant differences in adverse reactions were reported among treatment groups [see Clinical Studies (14)] .

In a randomized open - label clinical trial (NCT 00402831 ), conducted in France, 405 children 12 mon ths through 18 months of age received 2 doses of ProQuad, admin istered 30 days apart (a non-US licensed interva l), by either the intramuscular (n=202) or subcutaneous (n=203) route . In the overall population, 50.9% were male and the median age was 13.3 mont hs. Local and systemic solicited adverse reactions were recorded by parents or guardians using standardized diary cards. Local solicited reactions were recorded for 4 days after vaccination, and systemic solicited adverse reactions wer e recorded for 28 days after vaccination. In the event that a participant experienced a rash or a mumps -like illness, parents and/or guardians were instructed to contact the investigator for an examination as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours following onset of sympt oms. The nature of any rash was characterized by principal investigator either as measles -like, rubella -like, varicella -like or \"other \". Study investigators reviewed the diary card with the participant or participant's legal guard ian 30 days and 42 days after dose 1 and do se 2, r espectively to ensure consistency with protocol definitions.

Unsolicited adverse events (0-28 days po st-vaccina tion 1 and 2) and serious adverse events (day 0 to last visit) were recorded using diary cards supplemented by medical review. Data on unsolicited adverse events were transcribed into the study database during an on-site visit at day 30 and day 42. Serious adve rse events occurred at a rat e of 1% and 0.5% in ea ch group post - dose 1 and 2, respectively . None of the serious adverse events that occurred were considered related to the study v accination. Herpes Zoster ProQuad and VARIVAX virus vaccine strain . Clinical trial data with VARIVAX are therefore, relevant to ProQuad. Overall, 9454 healthy children (12 months to 12 years of age) and 1648 adolescen ts and adults (13 years of age and older) have been vaccinate d with VARIVAX in clinical trials. Eight cases of herpes zoster have been reported in children during 42,556 person -years of follow -up in clinical trials, resulting in a calculated incidence of at least 18.8 cases per 100,000 person -years. The completeness of this reporti ng has not been determined. One ca se of herpes14zoster has been reported in the adolescent and adult age group during 5410 person -years of follow -up in clinical trials, resulting i n a calculated inc idence of 18.5 cases per 100,000 person -years. All 9 cases were mild and without seque lae. Two cultures (one child and one adult) obtained from vesicles were positive for wild-type VZV as confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis {11}. The long-term effect of VARIVAX on the e of herpes zoster, those vaccinees exposed to wild-type var icella, is unknown at present. In children, the reported rate of herpes zoster in VARIVAX recipients appears not to exceed that previously determine d in a population -based study of healthy children who had experienced wild-type varice lla {12}. The incidenc e of herpes zoster in adults who have had wild - type varicella infection is higher than that in children. 6.2 Post- Marketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approva l use of either the components of ProQuad or ProQuad. Because the events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure . or vaccine strain ProQuad may establ ish latency of varicella zoster virus in im munocompetent individuals, with the potential for later deve lopment of herpes zoster. Cases of encephalitis or meningitis caused by vaccine strain varicella virus have been reported in immunocompromised and immunocompet ent individuals previously vaccinated with VARIVAX (same varicella vaccine strain as in ProQuad) months to years after vaccination. Reported cases were commonly associated with preceding or concurre nt herpes zoster rash .

A historical comparison group included 69,237 age-, gender-, and date-of-vaccination - (day and month) matched subjects who were given M-M-R II and VARIVAX concom itantly. The primary objective was to assess the incidence of febrile seizures occurring within various time intervals after vaccination in 12- to 60-month-old children who had neither been vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella, nor had a history of the wild-type infections (N=31,298 vaccinated with ProQuad, including 31,043 who were 12 to 23 months old). The incidence of febrile seizures was also assessed in a historical control group of children who had received their first vaccination with M-M-R II and VARIVAX concomitantly (N=31,298, including 31,019 who were 12 to 23 months old). The secondary objective was to assess the general safety of ProQuad in the 30-day period after vaccination in children 12 months to 12 years old. In pre-licensure clinical studies, an increase in fever was observed 5 to 12 days after vaccination with ProQuad (dose 1) compared to M-M-R II and VARIVAX (dose 1) given concomitantly. In the post-marketing observational surveillance study, results from the primary safety analy sis revealed an approximate two-fold increase in the risk of febrile seizures in the same 5 to 12 day timeframe after vaccination wi th ProQuad (dose 1). The incidence of febrile seizures 5 to 12 days after ProQuad (dose 1) (0.70 per 1000 childre n) was higher than that in children receiving M-M-R II and VARI VAX concomitantly (0.32 per 1000 children) [RR 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 4.65]. The incidence of febrile seizures 0 to 30 days after ProQuad (dose 1) (1.41 per 1000 children) was similar to that observed in children receiving M-M-R II and VARIVAX concomitantly [RR 1.10 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.69)]. See Table 11. General safety analyses revealed that the risks of fever (RR=1.89; 95% CI: 1.67, , 2.64) wer e significantly higher after ProQuad (dose 1) compar ed with those who received concomitant first doses of M-M-R II and VARIVAX, re spect ively. All medical events that resulted in hospitalization or emergency room visits were compared between the group given ProQuad and the historical comparison group, and no other safety concerns were identified in this study. Table 11 : Confirmed Fe brile Sei zures Days 5 to 12 and 0 to 30 After Vaccination with ProQuad (dose 1) Compared to Concomitant Vaccination w ith M -M-R II and VARIVAX (dose 1) in Ch ildren 12 to 60 Months o f Age Time Period ProQuad cohort (N=31,298) MMR+V cohort (N=31,298) Relative risk (95% CI) n Incidence per 1000 n Incidence per 1000 5 to 12 Days 22 0.70 10 0.32 2.20 (1.04, 4.65) 0 to 30 Days 44 1.41 40 1.28 1.10 (0.72, 1.69 ) In this observationa l post-marketing study, no case of febrile seizure was observed during the 5 to 12 day postvaccination time period among 26,455 children who received ProQuad as a second dose of M-M-R II and VARIVAX . In addition, detailed general safety data were available from more than 25,000 children who received ProQuad as a second dose of M-M-R II and VARIVAX, most of them (95%) between 4 and 6 years of age, and an analysis of these data by an independent, external safety monitoring committee di d not identify any speci fic safety concern. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Immune Globulins and Transfusion s Admi nistration of immune globulins and other blood products concurrently with ProQuad vaccine may interfere with the expected immune response [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 7)] {9-11}. The ACI P has specific recommendations for intervals between adminis tratio n of antibody containing products and live virus vaccines.167.2 Salicylat es Reye syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type varicella infection. Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccinati on with ProQuad [see Warnings and Precautions (5. 8 ) and Patient Cou nseling Information (17) ]. 7.3 Corticosteroi ds and Immu n osuppressive Drugs ProQuad vaccine should not be admi nistered to individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including high dose corticosteroids . Vaccination with ProQuad vaccine can result in disseminated disease and extensive vaccine -associated ras h in individuals on immunosuppressive drugs [see Contraindications (4.2)]. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory d meas les, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitiv ity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks af ter ProQuad. 7.5 Use w ith Other Vaccines At least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a measles-contai ning vaccine and a dose of ProQ uad, and at least 3 months should elapse between administration of 2 doses of ProQuad or varicell a-containing vaccin es. ProQuad may type b conjugate (mening ococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant). Additionally, ProQuad may be administered concomitantly with pneumococcal 7-valen t conjugate vaccine , and/or hepatitis A (inactivated) vaccines [s ee Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPU LATI ONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary ProQuad vaccine contains attenuate d measles, mumps, contr aindic ated for use in pregnant women because infection during pregnancy with the wild-type viruses is associated with maternal a n d fetal adverse outcomes. For women who are inadvertentl y vaccinated when pregnant or who become p regnant within 3 months of adminis tration of ProQuad , the healthcare provider should be aware of the following: (1) Reports have indicated that contracting wild-type measles during pregnancy enhances fetal risk. Increased rates of spontaneo us abortion, stillbirth, congenital defects , and prematurity have been observed subsequent to infection with wild-type measles during pregnancy. There are no adequate studies of the attenuated (vaccine) strain of measles virus in pregnancy ; (2) Mumps infec tion during the first trimester of pregnanc y may increase the rate of spontaneous abortion. Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placen ta and fetus, t h ere is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans {12}; (3) In a 10-year survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after conception (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with conge nital rubella syndrome {13}; and (4) Wild-type varicella , d durin g pregnancy, can sometimes cause congenital varicella syndrome . Available data on inadve rtent administration of ProQuad to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine -associate d risks in pregnancy . There are no relevan t animal data. All pregna ncies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recogniz ed pregnancies is 2% t o 4%, and 15% to 20% , respectively { 14,15}. Data Human Data In a 10-year CDC survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 month s before or after conception (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalitie s compatible with congen ital rubella syndrome {13}.178.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether varicella, measles, or mumps vaccine virus is exc reted in human milk. Studies have shown that lactating postpart um women vaccin ated with live rubella vacc ine may secrete the vir us in breas t milk and transmit it to breastfed infants [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5. 6)] {16,17}. The development al and healt h benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with th e mother's clinical need for ProQuad, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ProQuad or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Do not administ er ProQuad to infants younger than 12 months of age or to children 13 years and older. Safety and effectiveness of ProQuad in infants younge r than 12 months of age and in children 13 years and older have not been established [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use ProQuad is not indi cated for use in t he geriatric population ( 65). 11 DESCRIPTION ProQuad (Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live) is combined, attenuated, live virus vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. ProQu ad is a sterile lyophilized preparation of (1) the components of M-M-R II (Measles, Mumps , and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live): Meas les Virus Vaccine Live, a more attenuated line of measles virus, derived from Enders' attenuated Edmonston strain and propagated in chick embryo cell culture ; Mumps Virus Vaccine Live, the Jeryl Lynn (B level) strain of mumps virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture; Rubella Virus Vaccine Live, the Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus propagated in WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts; and (2) Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Oka/Merck), the Oka/Me rck strain of varicella -zoster virus propagated in MRC -5 cells. The cells, virus pools, bovine serum, and recombinant human albumin used in manufacturing are all teste d to provide assurance that the final product is free of potential adventitious agents. ProQuad , when reconstituted as directed, is a sterile suspension for intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. Each approximately 0.5 mL dose contains not less than 3.00 log10 TCID varice lla virus. After reconstitu tion, each 0.5 mL dose of the vaccine also contains 21 mg of sucrose, 11 mg of hydrolyzed gelatin, 2.4 mg of sodium chloride, 1.8 mg of sorbitol, 0.40 mg of 0.34 mg phosphate dibasic, 0.31 mg of recombinant human albumin, 0.17 mg of sodium bicarbonate, 72 mcg of potassium phosphate monobasi c, 60 mcg of potassium chloride; 36 mcg of potassium phosphate dibasic; and residual components from the manufacturing process: MRC -5 cells including DNA and protein; <16 cin, 0.5 mcg of bovine calf serum , and other buffer and media ingredient s. The produ ct contains no preservative . 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ProQuad has been shown to induce measles -, mumps -, rubella-, and varicella-specific immunity, whi ch is thought to be the mechanism by wh ich it protects against these four childhood diseases. The efficacy of ProQuad was established through the use of immunological correlates for protection against measles, mum ps, rubella, and varicella. Results from efficacy studies or field effectiveness studies that were previously conduct ed for the component vaccines were used to define levels of serum antibodies that correlated with prote ction against measles, mumps, and rubella. Also, in previous studies with varicella vaccine, antibody responses agains t varicella virus (not commercially available) similarly correlated with long- term protection. In these eff i cacy studies, the clinic al endpoint for measles and mumps was a clinical diagnosis of either disease confirmed by a 4-fold or greater rise in serum antibody titers between either postvaccination or acute and convalescent titers; for rubella, a 4 -fold or greater rise in antibody titers with or without clinical symptoms of rubella; and for varicella, varice lla-like rash that occurred >42 days18 postvaccination and for which varicella was not excluded by either viral cultures of the lesion or serological tests. Specific laboratory evid ence of varicella either by serology or culture was not requ ired to confirm the diagnosis of varicella. Clinical studies with a single dose of ProQuad have shown that vaccination e licited rates of antibody responses against measles , mumps, and rubella that were similar to those observed after vaccination with a single dose of M-M-R II [see Clinical Studies (14)] and seroresponse rates for varicella virus were similar to those observ ed after vaccination with a single dose of VARIVAX [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The duration of protection from measles, mumps, rubella, and varice lla infectio ns after vaccination with ProQuad is unknown. 12.6 Persistence of Antibody Responses after Vaccin ation The persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2107 children enrolled in the clinical trials. Antibody was detected in 98.9% (1722/1741) of following a single dose of ProQuad. Experience with M-M-R II demonstrates that neutralizing and ELISA antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in 95-100%, 74-91%, and 90-100% of individua ls respectively, 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination series {18-24}. Varic ella antibodies were present for up to ten years post vaccination in most of the individuals tested who received 1 dose of VARIVAX. 13 NONCLINICAL T OXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesi s, Muta genesis, Impairment of Fertility ProQuad has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic poten tial, or its potential to impair fertility. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Formal studies to evaluate the clinical e fficacy of ProQuad have not been p erformed. Efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella component s of ProQuad was previously establish ed in a series of clinical studies with the monovalent vaccines. A high degree of protection from infection wa s demonstrated in these stud ies {25-32}. Immunogenicity in Children 12 Month s to 6 Years of Age Prior to licensure, immunogenicity was studied in 5845 healthy children 12 months to 6 years of age with a negative clinical history of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 trials. The immunog enicity of ProQuad administered subcutaneously was similar to that of its individual component vaccines (M-M-R II and VARIVAX), which are currently used in routine vaccination. The presence of detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriate ly sensitive enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay rubella, and by gpELISA for varicella. For evaluation of vaccine response rates, a positive result in the measles ELISA corresp onded to measles antibody concentrations of 255 mIU/m L when compared to the WHO II (66/202) Ref erence Immuno globulin for Measles. Children were positive for mumps antibody if the antibody level was 10 ELISA units/mL. A positive result in the rubella ELIS A corresponde d to concentrations of 10 IU rubella antibody/mL when compared to the WHO Internat ional Reference Serum for Rubella; children with varicella antibody levels 5 gpELI SA units/mL were considered to be seropositive since a response rate based on 5 gpELISA units/mL has been shown to be highly correlated with long - term protection. Immunogen icity in Children 12 to 23 Months of Age A fter a Single Dose In 4 randomized clinical trials, 5446 healthy children 12 to 23 months of age were administered ProQuad subcutaneously , and 2038 children were vaccinated with M-M-R II and VARIVAX given concomita ntly at separate injection sites. Subjects enrolled in each of these trials had a negative clinical history, no known recent exposure , and no vaccination history for varicella , measles, mu mps, and rubella. Children were excluded from study participation if they had an immune impairment or had a history of allergy to components of the vaccine(s). Except for in 1 trial [see ProQuad Administered with Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellula r Pertussis Vaccine Conjugate and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine below] , no concomitant vaccines were permitted during study participa tion. The race distrib ution of the study19subjects across these studies following a first dose of ProQua d was American Indian. The gender distribution of the study subjects across these studies following a first dose of ProQuad was 52.6% male and 47.4% female. A summ ary of combined immunogenicity results 6 weeks following administration of a single dose of ProQuad or M -M-R II and VARIVAX is shown in Table 12. These results were similar to the immune response rates induced by concomitant administration of single doses of M-M-R II and VARIVAX at separate injection sites (lower bound of the 95% CI for the risk difference in measles, mumps, and rubella serocon version rates were > -5.0 percentage points and the lower bound of the 95% CI for the risk difference in var icella seroprotection rates was either >-15 percentage points [one study] or > - 10.0 percentage points [three studies]).

The mumps antibody response was assessed by a vaccine - strain ELISA in Protocols 009 and 011 and by a wild - type ELISA in Protocols 012 and 013. In the former ass ay, the serostatus was based on the OD cutoff of the assay. In t he lat ter assay, 10 mumps ELISA units was used as the serostatus cutoff. n = Number of per - protocol subjects with evaluable serology. CI = Confidence interval. GMT = Geometric mean titer.

Immunogenicity in Children 15 to 31 Months of A ge After a Second Dose of ProQuad In 2 of the 4 randomized clinical trials described above, a subgroup (N=1035) of the 5446 children administered a single dose of ProQuad subcutaneo usly admi nistered a second dose of ProQuad subcutaneously , approximately 3 to 9 months after the first dose. Children were excluded from receiving a second dose of ProQuad if they were recently exposed to or developed varicella, measles, mumps, and/or rubella prior to receipt of the second dose. No concomitant vaccines were administered to these children. The race distribution across these studies following a second dose of ProQuad 0.10% mixed. The gender distribution of the study subjects across these studies following a second dose of ProQuad was 50.4% male and 49.6% female. A summary of immune r espo nses following a second dose of ProQuad is presented in Table 13. Results from this study showed that 2 doses of ProQuad administered at least 3 months apart elicited a positive antibody response to all four antigens in20greater than 98% of subjects. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) follow ing the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2-fold each for measles, mumps, and rubella, and approximately 41-fold for varicella.

Samples from Protocols 009 and 011 were assayed in the legacy format Measles ELISA, which reported antibody titers in Measles ELISA units. To conver t titers fr om ELISA units to mIU/mL, titers for these 2 protocols were divided by 0.1025. The lowest measurable titer postvaccination is 207.5 mIU/mL. The response rate for measles in the legacy format is the percent of subjects with a negative b aseline me asles an tib ody titer, as defined by the optical density (OD) cutoff, with a postvaccination measles antibody titer 207.5 mIU/mL. Samples from Protocols 009 and 011 were assayed in the legacy format Rubella ELISA, which reported antibody titers i n Rubella ELISA un its .

Immunogenicity in Children 4 to 6 Years of Age Who Received a First Dose of ProQuad After Primary Vaccination With M-M-R II and VARI VAX In a clinical trial, 799 healthy 4- to 6-year-old children who had received M-M-R II and VARIVAX at least 1 month prior to study entry were randomized to receive ProQuad subcutaneously and placebo (N=399), M-M-R II and placebo concomitantly at separate injection sites (N=205), or M-M-R II and VARIVAX concomitantly at separate injection sites (N=195). Children were eligible if they were previously administered primary doses of M-M-R II and VARIVAX, either concomitantly or non- concomitantly, at 12 months of age or older. Children were excluded if they were recently exposed to measles, mumps, rubella, and/or varicella, had an immune impairment, or had a history of allergy to components of the21vaccine(s). No concomitant vaccines were permit ted during study participati on [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) for ethnicity and gender information ]. A summary of antibody responses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella at 6 weeks postvaccination in subjects who had previously received M-M-R II and VARIVAX is shown in Table 14. Results from this study showed that a first dose of ProQuad after primary vaccination with M-M-R II and VARIVAX elicited a positive antibody response to all four antigens in greater than 98% of subjects. Postvaccination GMTs for recipients of ProQ uad were similar to those following a second dose of M-M-R II and VARIVAX administered concomitantly at separate injection sites (the lower bound of the 95% CI around the fold difference in measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second dose of M-M-R II given concomitantly with placebo (the lower bound of the 95% CI around the fold difference for the comparison of measles, mumps, and rubella GMTs excluded 0.5).

Percentages are calculated as the number of subjects who met the criterion divided by the number of subjects contributing to the per - protocol analysis. gpELISA = Gly coprotei n enzy Confidence interval; GMT = Geometric mean titer; N/A = Not applicable; N = Number of subjects vaccinated; n = number of subjects in the per - protocol analysis.22Immunogeni city Following 2 D oses of ProQuad Administered I ntramuscularly or S ubcutaneously In an open label clinical trial (NCT00402831 ) 405 children 12 through 18 months of age received two doses of ProQuad , administered 30 days apart (a non-US licensed eithe r intramuscular varicella viruses were measured by ELISAs sera obtained 30 days post-dose 1, and 6-weeks post-dose 2. For anti-measles virus, anti-mumps virus, anti-rubella virus and anti-varicella virus, seroresponse rates were defined as the percentage of children seronegative at baseline who achieved antibody titers above the respective seroresponse threshold for each assay 30 days post-dose 1 and 6 weeks post-dose 2. Seroresponse thresholds were defined as 255 mIU/mL, 10 EU/mL, 10 IU/mL and 5 gpELISA units for anti-measles virus, anti-mumps virus, anti-rubella virus and anti-varicella virus antibodies, respectively after each dose . For each vaccine antigen at least 87% of enrolled children were seronegative at baseline. The s eroresponse rates to measles, mumps, and varicella viruses after dose 1 were noninferior in the intram uscular g roup compared to the subcu taneous group in a post hoc analysis (lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in seroresponse rates [intramuscular group minus subcutaneous group] -5%). The seroresponse rate to rubella virus narrowly missed meeting the criterion for noninferiority (lower bounds of the 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate measl es, mumps, antigens, lower bound of the 95% CI of the seroresponse rate was 90% after intramuscular administration .

Immunogenicity F ollowing Concomitant Use with Vaccines with Pneumococcal 7 - valent Conjugate Vaccine and/or VAQTA In a clinical trial, 1027 healthy children 12 to 15 months of age were randomized to receive ProQuad su bcutaneously and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine concomitantly (N=510) subcutaneously and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine non-concomitantly (N=517) at separate clinic visits [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) for ethnicity and gender information ]. The statistical analysis of non-inferiority in antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella at 6 weeks postvaccination for subjects are shown in Table 15. In the per-protocol population, seroconversion rates were not inferior in children given ProQuad and pneumoc occal 7-valent conjugate vaccine concomitantly when compared to seroconversion rates seen in children given these vaccines non-concomitantly for measl es, mumps, and rubella. In <1.25 gpELISA units/mL, the varicella seroprotection rates were not inferior when rates after concomitant and non-concomitant vaccination were compared 6 weeks postvaccination . Statistical analysis of non-inferiority in GMTs to S. pneumoniae serotypes at 6 weeks postvaccination are shown in Table 16. Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) for S. pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F were not inferior when antibody titers in the concomitant and non- concomitant groups were compar ed 6 wee ks postvaccination.

In a clinical trial, 653 healthy children 12 to 15 months of age were randomized to receive VAQTA 6 weeks later (N=323) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) for ethnicity and gender information ]. Statistical a nalysis of non -inferiority of the response rate for varicella antibody at 6 weeks postvaccination among subjects who received VAQTA concomitantly or non-concomitantly with ProQuad and pneumococcal 7- valent conjugate vaccine is shown in Table 17. For the va ricella component of ProQuad, in subjects with base line antibody titers <1.25 gpELISA , the proportion with a titer 5 gpELISA units/mL 6 weeks after their first dose of ProQuad was non - inferior when ProQuad was administered with VAQTA and pneumo coccal 7-valent conjugate as alone. analysis of non-inferiority of the seropositivity rate for hepati tis A antibody at 4 weeks postdose 2 of VAQTA among subjec ts who received with ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine is shown in Table 18. The seropositivity rate to hepatitis A 4 weeks af ter a secon d dose of VAQTA given ProQuad and pn eumoc occal 7- valent conjugate vaccine (defined as the percent of su bjects with a titer 10 mIU/mL) was non -inferior to the seropositivity rate observed when VAQTA was administered separately from ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine. Statistical analysis of non-inferiority GMT to S. pneumoniae serotypes at 6 weeks postvaccination among subjects who received concomitantly or non-concomitantly with ProQuad and pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine is shown in Table 19.24Additionally, the GMTs for S. pneumoniae types 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F 6 weeks after vaccination with pneumococcal 7 - valent conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with ProQuad and VAQTA were non-inferior as compared to GMTs observed in the group given pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine with ProQuad alone. An earlier clinical study involving 617 healthy children provided data that indicated that the seroresponse rates 6 weeks post vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella in those given M-M-R II and concomitantly (N=309) were non-inferior as compared to histor ical controls.

ProQuad Administered with Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) and Hepatitis B (Recombin ant) Vaccine In a clinical trial, 1913 healthy children 12 to 15 months of age were randomized to receive ProQuad subcutaneously plus diphtheria and tetanus acellular b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine concomitantly at separate injection sites (N=949), ProQuad at the initial visit followed by DTaP and Haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine given concomitantly 6 weeks later ( N=485), or M -M-R II and VARIVAX given concomitantly at separate injection sites (N=479) at the first visit [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) for ethnicity and gender information ]. S eroconversion rates and antibody titers for measles, mumps, rubel la, varicel la, anti- PRP, and hepatitis B were comparable between the 2 groups given ProQua d at approximately 6 weeks postvaccination indicating that ProQuad and Haemophilus b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccine may be administered concomitantly at separate injection sites (see Table 20 below). Response rates for measles, mum ps, rubella, varicella, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B were not inferior in children given ProQuad plus Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombinant) vaccines concomitantly when comp ared to ProQuad at the initial visit and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (meningococcal protein conjugate) and hepatitis B (recombin ant) vaccin es given concomitantly 6 weeks later.
