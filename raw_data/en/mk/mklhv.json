They offer a chance to take a few minutes to step out of the crowds to relax, unwind, and refresh. You can choose to follow one of our meditation tracks, relax to one of the soothing nature soundtracks, or simply close your eyes and enjoy some time to yourself. Guided meditation sessions A group meditation has a beautiful way of bringing everyone into the present moment, leaving us feeling grounded, clear, and positive. Our meditation teachers host sessions for large and small groups with simple, easy-to-follow guidance. Everyone is welcome, from beginners to regulars. \"Meditating can be quite daunting as how do you not think about anything?

From gong baths to crystal bowls, our sound healers use the vibrations of exquisite instruments to bring deep relaxation with their art. "}
