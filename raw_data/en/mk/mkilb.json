It delivers a supportive presence. This presence can add to spiritual and emotional health and well-being. Spiritual care offers a compassionate, listening presence. This honours the dignity and value of each person. Spiritual conversation enables a person to explore their inner resources and outer supports. This exploration can sustain them through tough times. Our Spiritual Care team is a part of the multidisciplinary team. They deliver support for patients, families, and friends. A spiritual carer is available in each ward of the hospital. A pastoral carer works throughout the ambulatory areas. Spiritual care can be beneficial at any stage of the cancer experience. Spiritual care can be particularly beneficial when: - A person is recently diagnosed with cancer - A disease status changes - A patient receives news that highlights the uncertainty of their future - A person has questions of life, meaning, and purpose - A person is feeling sad - A person is feeling lonely or isolated - Family members need support - A person moving towards the end of life - There are specific religious or spiritual needs Reflection Space The Reflection Space is open 24 hours a day and supplies a quiet space for: - Reflection - Personal prayer - Meditation - Sanctuary Our Reflection Space welcomes people of all faiths and those with no religious affiliation. Within the Reflection Space there is an organ and a piano. Patients, visitors, and staff are welcome to use this piano. A bookshelf with sacred texts and icons is on the right before entering the Reflection Space. This includes texts and icons for Christian, Islamic, and Jewish faiths. There is also a book for people to write their prayers into. These can be prayers of thanksgiving, hope, despair, and request. You can find it in the corridor leading to the Reflection Space. The Reflection Space is on our ground floor within Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (VCCC) building in Melbourne. Spiritual Care services We hold a time for reflection in the Reflection Space every weekday morning from 9:00 to 9:15 am. We hold meditation sessions in the Wellbeing Centre on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 10:30am - 11.00am We hold an annual memorial service in November. During this time, we reflect on and remember the lives of our patients who have died throughout the year. Meditation We run group meditation classes each Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 1030am - 11,00am. This is in the Wellbeing Centre on the 1st floor at Peter Mac within the VCCC building, Melbourne. We welcome inpatients, outpatients, relatives, friends, and staff to take part. This participation is regardless of level of experience. Meditating in a group deepens the practice of quieting the mind and relaxation. This can help create inner stillness and peace. It can allow your wisdom, courage, and insight to be present.
