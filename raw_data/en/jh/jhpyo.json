Acupuncture is particularly helpful when working with patients who have suffered trauma, either physically or emotionally. Chronic pain and/or other complex medical and psychological illnesses can be a result of old wounds the body has harbored over time. Acupuncture is a wonderful way to restore energetic flow to help heal these old wounds and restore integral health and wellness. Dr. Edsall is a Board Certified Medical Acupuncturist and has been incorporating acupuncture in her practice since 2014. She has used acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for patients on inpatient medical wards, in outpatient active-duty military clinics, at Stanford's Integrative Medical Clinic, at Dignity Health's outpatient clinics and most recently at Quantum Integral Healing Arts.
