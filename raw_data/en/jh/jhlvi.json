Ae. aegypti is a major vector of dengue hemor - rhagic quinquefasciatus is a vector for Japanese encephalitis (JE) and causes annoyance and dermatitis. An. dirus is an important malaria vector along the border of Thailand. There is currently only a vaccine against JE, but not malaria or dengue infection; therefore, only vector control measures are available (Shultz et al, 2008). Insecticides are needed, especially during epidemics of disease. Insecticides remain the mainstay of mosquito vector control programs. Synthetic pyrethroids and DDT were previously effective but resistance to these chemicals has occurred (N'Guessan et al, 2007) among Ae. aegypti (Paeporn Yaicharoen et al, (Sathantriphop et al, 2006) and An. dirus (Van Bortel et al, 2008). EFFICACY OF HERBAL ESSENTIAL OILS AS INSECTICIDE AGAINST and Mayura Soonwera Entomology and Environment Program, Plant Production Technology Section, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Lat Krabang, Lat Krabang, Bangkok, Thailand Abstract. The essential oils Syzygium aromaticum using the WHO standard susceptibil - ity test. These were applied in soybean oil at dose of 1%, 5% and 10% (w /v). C. citratus had the KT50 values against the three mosquito species tested but the knockdown rates (at 10, 30 and 60 minutes) were lower than some essential oils. C. citratus oil had high insecticidal activity <0.1, 2.22 and <0.1%, respectively. Ten percent C. citratus gave the highest mortality rates (100%) 24 hours after application. This study demonstrates the potential for the essential oil of C. citratus to be used as an insecticide against 3 species of mosquitoes. Keywords: Aedes aepypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, AsIAn J t rop Med publIc HeAltH 1084 Vol 42 No. 5 September 2011 Synthetic insecticides may have adverse environmental effects, high cost and poor community acceptance. Essential oils have received atten - tion as potentially controlling vectors of mosquito-borne disease (Sutthanont et al, 2010). Natural products used as insecti - cides may have less of an environmental impact due to shorter latency, possibly resulting in reduced resistance (Hardin and Jackson, 2009). Sukumar et al (1991) evaluated 344 different plant species to control mosquitoes instead of synthetic chemical insecticides. Some essential oil derived compounds may be used on humans similar to some conventional insecticides, are selective and have fewer harmful effects than some conventional insecticides (Mumcuoglu et al, 2002). The aim of this study was to deter - mine the mosquitocidal activities of seven herbal essential oils: dirus using a standard WHO susceptibility test at varying concentrations under labora - tory conditions (WHO, 1998). MATERIALS AND METHODS Mosquitoes Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. dirus mosquitoes were used in this study. Ae. aegypti and An. dirus eggs were obtained from the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS). Cx. quinquefasciatus eggs were obtained from the Department of Medical Entomo- logy, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Ma - hidol University. They were maintained at the laboratory of Entomology and En - vironment, Plant Production Technology Section, Faculty of Agricultural Technol -ogy, King Mongkut Institute of Technol - ogy Lat (KMITL), Bangkok. Mos - quitoes were reared at 30-35oC and 70-80% relative humidity. Larvae were reared on a diet of floating fish food. The adults were maintained in screened cages and fed 5% glucose solution in water soaked on cotton pads. One to two day old emerging female mosquitoes were randomly selected for adult bioassays. Prior to testing, they were starved by providing them with only water for 12 hours. Plant materials Cananga odorata Lamk. (ylang Stapf and stems), Cymbo - pogon nardus L (citronella grass leaves), Eucalyptus citriodora Hook (eucalyptus leaves), Ocimum basilicum L. (sweet basil leaves) and Syzygium aromaticum L. (clove flowers) were collected and the essential oils were extracted by steam distillation, and prepared as 1%, 5% and 10% solutions in soybean oil. All formulations were kept at room temperature before testing. WHO susceptibility test Susceptibility testing was carried out using the standard WHO protocol (1998) using diagnostic kits and impregnated paper. Each tube was marked with a red spot or a green spot, indicating its use for holding insecticide paper or for holding mosquitoes 1 hour after exposure. Twen - ty-five mosquitoes were collected from a cage with an aspirator and blown into green spot tubes lined with clean white paper, with a movable slide attached. Fil - ter paper (Whatman\u00ae No.1) 12cm x 15cm was cut for the bioassay. The filter paper was treated with essential oils and placed into red spot tubes. These were screwed onto the opposite side of the movable slide; the slide was then opened and the InsectIcIde ActIvIty of HerbAl essentIAl oIls AgAInst MosquIto vectors Vol 42 No. 5 September 2011 1085 Herbal essential oils 1% 5% 10% LC50 (%) KT50 % Susceptibility KT50 % Susceptibility KT50 % Susceptibility (min) Mortality (min) Mortality (min) Mortality Cananga odorata oil 151.94 8.8bc oil 0.0e (Soybean oil) CV (%) 41.7 32.4 16.7 Table 1 KT50 and LC50 values caused by seven essential oils against Ae. aegypti adult mosquitoes.

Cymbopogon gently blown into the red spot tube after which the slide was closed again. Twenty-five female mosquitoes were exposed to the impregnated paper for 1 hour in each tube while the mosquitoes used as controls were exposed to paper without insecticide and then gently blown back into the green spot tube. Each test was performed in five replicates with simul - taneous control sets; the negative controls were im - pregnated with soybean oil only. Knockdown rates were recorded at 10, 30 and 60 minutes during the 1 hour exposure. At the end of the exposure period mosquitoes were transferred to recovery tubes and provided with 5% glucose solution. Mortality was observed after 24 hours. Statistical analysis KT50 and LC50 values were calculated using pro - bit analysis. The mortality data was analyzed with the Duncan's multiple range test using SPSS for Windows (version 16.0). The susceptibility re - sults were determined for each insecticide using WHO criteria (WHO, 1998): 98- 100% mortality indicated susceptibility, 80-97% mor - tality suggested possible resistance needing confir - mation and mortality <80% suggested resistance.

Experi - mental tests with >20% control mortality were discarded and repeated. RESULTS One kg of each plant was used for this study to obtain the essential oils as follows: 2.5% S. aromaticum. Three essential oil-soybean oil concentrations were used for this study: 1%, 5% and 10%. Mortality with the seven tested essential oils was determined using essen - tial oil impregnated papers using WHO test kits against Ae. aegypti as shown in Table 1. The highest KT50 values for C. citratus (at 1, 5 and 10% con - centration) were 27.31 minutes, 17.36 minutes and <1 minute, respectively. Fig 1 shows the knockdown rates at 10, 30 and 60 minutes. Ten percent C. ci - tratus gave better knockdown rates from 10 minutes to 60 minutes than the other oils. Ten percent C. citratus and 10% C. nardus gave mortality rates of 100% and 97.6%, respectively.

Cymbopogon exposure. One percent and 5% C. citratus gave KT50 values of 20.08 and 7.75, respectively, against Cx. quinquefasciatus (Table 2). At 1% and 5% C. citratus gave knockdown rates lower than C. nardus and S. aromaticum (Fig 2). Cx. quinquefasciatus was re - sistant to all seven essential oils at oil concentrations of 1, 5 and at 10% it was re - sistant to all essential oils, except for C. citratus , C. nar - dus and S. aromaticum . The susceptibilities of adult Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to 1, 5 and 10% C. citratus were 38.4, 75.2 and 100%, respectively. Of the seven essential oils tested, Cx. quinquefasciatus was most susceptible to C. citratus ; the LC50 ranged from 2.2 to 20.8% 24 hours after expo - sure. C. citratus Ci. sinensis gave LC50 values of 2.2, 4.1, 5.0, 8.8, 11, 12.2 and 20.8%, respectively. The KT50 values, mor - tality rates and suscepti - bilities of An. dirus adult mosquitoes are shown in Table 3. An. dirus adult mosquitoes were resistant to all seven essential oils at 1% and 5% concentration; the mortality rates ranged from 23.2% to 92.8% with the 1% essential oils and from 40.0% to 97.6% with InsectIcIde ActIvIty of HerbAl essentIAl oIls AgAInst MosquIto vectors Vol 42 No. 5 September 2011 1091 the 5% essential oils. The mortality rates with the 10% essential oils ranged from 76.8% to 100%. An. dirus mosquitoes were resistant Ci. sinensis , O. nardus , S. aromaticum and C. citratus . There were significant differences in mean mortality rates by treatment using ANOVA ( p<0.05). C. citratus gave KT50 and minutes and 92.8% (at 1%), <1 minute and 97.6% (at 5%) and < 1 minute and 100% (at 10%), respectively, against An. dirus . The LC50 for the 10% essential oils ranged from <0.1% to 5.0%. Fig 3 shows the knockdown rates for the essential oils at concentrations of 1, 5 and 10%. The seven essential oils gave knock down rates from 0 to 100% (at 1%), 20.8 to 100% (at 5%) and 70 to 100% (at 10%) against An. dirus female mosquitoes. DISCUSSION Our study found C. citratus oil has insecticidal activities against various ar - thropods. Previous research by Hanifah et al (2011) demonstrated C. citratus extract has more acaricidal activity against Der- matophagoides farina and D. indica at 50% concentra - tion. Samarasekera et al (2006) found C. citratus oil had good knockdown and mortality activity against adult M. domes - tica at LD50 of 1.71 \u00b5g in Sri Lanka. Sent - hilkumar et al (2009) reported lethality varied by type of mosquito and to be most effective against An. stephensi. Several studies have also focused on lemongrass oil for controlling mosquitoes as a larvicide and a repellent with varied results. C. citratus essential oil has been studied, showing toxicity against Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae with a LC50 value of 24 mg /l (Nazar et al, 2009) giving 100% protection for up to 5 hours at a concen - tration of 5.0 mg /cm2 (Pushpanathan et al, 2006). C. and larvicidal activity against at a concentra - tion of 100 ppm similar to O. gratissimum (Cavalcanti et al, 2004). Mgbemena (2010) found the essential oil of O. gratissimium had greater larvicidal activity than C. citratus. Purwal et al (2010) evaluated the activity of C. citratus and Mentha piperita essential oils in combination against Pe- diculus humanus Capitis and found a mean time to death of 60 minutes. Sukumar et al (1991) found C. citratus caused significant growth inhibition and mortality during later developmental stages of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. C. citratus may be included in disease vector control programs, it may be obtained easily and at low cost. C. citratus oil may be considered an ef - fective insecticide against mosquitoes in Thailand, and could be used instead of chemical insecticides.
