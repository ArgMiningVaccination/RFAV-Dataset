Schedule an appointment using [MyChart](https://mychart.hfhs.org/mychart/Authentication/Login?&utm_medium=text&utm_source=url&utm_medium=text&utm_source=url&utm_medium=url&utm_source=redirect). Children under age 18 must be Henry Ford Health patients and accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to receive a vaccination at Henry Ford Health. Original, monovalent vaccine no longer given In accordance with the Michigan Department of Health and Humans Services directive, Henry Ford now only administers the bivalent vaccine. The bivalent vaccine is effective against the original coronavirus strain as well as the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. If you or your child is set to begin or complete your primary vaccine series - dose 1 or 2 - you will now receive the bivalent vaccine to complete your series, even if the first dose was the monovalent version. If your appointment to receive those doses is scheduled in the next few days, it may need to be rescheduled as we update our electronic ordering systems to reflect the change to bivalent only. Why does Henry Ford Health offer only the Pfizer vaccine? - While all the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, we limit our vaccination supply to the Pfizer vaccine. - The Pfizer vaccine was first to be authorized. - The COVID-19 vaccines have different storage and dosing requirements. Using the same brand of COVID-19 vaccine at our many Primary Care and Pediatric centers simplifies ordering, storing, transporting and delivering the vaccine to our patients. "}
