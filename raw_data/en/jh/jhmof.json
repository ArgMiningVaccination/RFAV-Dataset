Baker, who serves patients in Eagan, Minnesota. Dr. Baker is a chiropractor who is currently serving patients at her private practice - Baker Chiropractic - in Eagan, Minnesota. She founded Baker Chiropractic in 2008. It is her goal to offer safe and effective chiropractic care to help the body heal and perform to its optimal potential. Dr. Baker was raised in a health-conscious family, with both of her parents teaching health/physical education classes and coaching sports. After dealing with many injuries during high school and collegiate cross country and track careers, and foregoing surgery or drugs as an answer, she turned to a more natural form of healing in chiropractic. She now strives to unleash the potential to be well that resides in all of us by removing interference to the nervous system. Due to the fact that minor physical, biochemical, and emotional stresses can create problems just as easily as major stresses, she focuses on education, prevention, and lifestyle counseling. Academically, Dr. Baker earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and Psychology from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. She then went on to graduate Magna Cum Laude with her Doctor of Chiropractic degree from Northwestern Health Sciences University. Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine that mainly deals with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. A chiropractor uses spinal adjustments, manipulation and other techniques to manage patients' health concerns, such as neck pain and back pain. They aim to improve patients' functionality and quality of life by properly aligning the body's musculoskeletal structure and enabling the body to heal itself without medication or surgery. Happily married, Dr. Baker and her husband, Michael, are parents to twins - Harriet and Theodore. In her spare time, she enjoys running, doing kettlebell and functional fitness training, reading, and cooking healthy foods for her family.
