Methodology/approach: A literature review and a syst ematic creation of principles have been applied. Findings: It has been detected that the original meaning of \"spiritual\" has not been considered in the existing research. From the original meaning of \"spiritual\" a new construct for Spiritual Intelligence has been derived and is proposed for further research. Originality/value: The origins of \"spiritual\" have not been studied before, hence the new construct of Spiritual Intelligence will be the new fundament for further research Keywords: spiritual; leadership; spirituality; framework; intelligence Introduction Both the topic of Spiritual Intelligence (Skrzypi ska, 2021) and Spiritual Leadership (Oh & Wang, 2020) have been widely studi ed in recent years and shar e the challenge of having many different definitions and understa ndings. It is interesting to note that the two topics have developed in parallel and are al most unrelated. The concept of Sp iritual Intelligence (SQ) as an own form of intelligence has been critiqued multiple times, e.g., Eysenck, M.W., ed., (1994); Sternberg, (1983). Nevertheless, th ere are many approaches and defi nitions that see \"spiritual\" as its own form of intelligence (Emmons, 2000). It is similar to the topic \"Spiritual Lead ership\". Many different definitions and basic understandings have recently been well studi ed and presented (Oh & Wang, 2020). The model of \"Spiritual Leadership,\" which was one of the first to be studie d and then developed over time, was proposed by Fry (2003) and has been develope d more widely over the years (Fry et al., 2010; Fry et al., 2011; Fry, 2013; Fry et al., 2017). For this study, we take his model, which at its core consists of the Vision, Hope/Faith, a nd Altruistic Love triad, influenced by Inner Life/Mindfulness. This Leader ship practice aims at spiritu al wellbeing through Calling and Membership. Ultimately, it all flows into organi zational commitment, un it productivity and life satisfaction (Fry et al., 2017). In this study, we aim as a first step to compile th e different definitions of \"Spiritual Intelligence\" (SQ), to assess them against commonalities and subsequently to create an overview of the main principles of SQ. As a second step, we will have a look at the historical background of \"spiritual\". Then, as the word \"spiritual\" is rooted in the biblical and Christian tradition, we will investigate if there is a deeper or different conno tation of \"spiritual\" and how this could translate into a (secularistic) model or at least how in principle it could look like. Finally, we will combine the results and apply them to Spiritual Leadership. Many Definitions of Spiritual Intelligence There are numerous different definitions of Spiritual Intelligence. Part of our study is to collect them, compile, compare them and look for common patterns. Therefore, the existing literature International Journal of Management, Knowledge and Learning | ISSN 2232-5697 Volume 11 (2022) 9-15 | https://www.doi.org/10.53615/2232-5697.11.9-15has been scanned and analyzed. Many defin itions of SQ revolve around the concept of wholeness - which assumes that everything in the world is somehow connected. For example, according to Wolman (2001), SQ is about the co nnection of everything. A similar construct of wholeness and expanding the borders can be f ound in Nobles description of SQ (Noble, 2001). According to Frances Vaughan, \"Spiritual Intelligen ce is concerned with the inner life of mind and spirit and its relationship to being in the world.\" (Vaughan, 2002). Furthermore, Vaughan puts forward that SQ \"Implies a capacity for a deep understanding of existential questions and insight into multiple le vels of consciousness..., awareness of spirit as the ground of being or as the creative lif e force of evolution.\" (Vaughan 2002). Dorothy Sisk describes SQ as well as the connection with the universal mind (Sisk, 2002). Kumar defines Spiritual Intelligence as \"the capacity of an indi vidual to possess a socially relevant purpose in life by understanding 'self' and having a hi gh degree of conscience, compassion and commitment to human values.\" (Kumar, V.V., and Mehta, M, 2011). Neena Sawhney defines Spiritual Intelligence as \"the human capacity to ask questions about the ultimate meaning of life and the integrated relationship between us and the world in which we live.\" (Sawhney & Bansal, 2015). Ken O'Donnell proposes to integrate Spir itual Intelligence, ra tional intelligence and emotional intelligence. (O'Donnell, 1997). To measure Sp iritual Intelligence, he proposes to look at required energy to receive a certain result, respectful relationships, dignity for ourselves and others, staying relaxed in stress, decision-making process, resilience, positive thinking. David King proposes a four-factor mode l for Spiritual Intelligence (King & DeCicco, 2009) consisting of critical existential thinki ng, personal meaning produ ction, transcendental awareness, conscious state expansion. Many schola rs define SQ as the capability to develop meaning, vision and value (Kumar, Ashish, 2020). Intentionally we concentrate on Spiritual Intelligence concepts as such whilst disregarding studies regarding workplace spirituality, e.g., Abdullah, A. G. K., Alzaidiyeen, N. J., & Aldarabah, I. T., (2009); Gi acalone & Jurkiewicz, (2003). Four concepts are perceived to describe more comprehensively Spiritual Intelligence. According to Robert Emmons ( Emmons, R.A. 2000), there are fi ve main components of SQ (the fifth was removed by himself later; Emmons, R.A. 2000a): The capacity to transcend the physic al and material. (Transcendence) The ability to experience heightened states of consciousness. (Mysticism) The ability to sanctify everyda y experience. (Sanctification) The ability to utilize spiritual resources to solve problems. (Re ligious and spiritual coping) The capacity to be virtuous. (Virtuous traits) Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall, in their book \"SQ - The ultimate intelligence\" developed a comprehensive concept of SQ, proposing 12 in dications for a highly developed SQ (Zohar & Marshall, 2000): Self - Awareness: Knowing what I believe in and value; deepen what deeply motivates me. Vision and value Led: Acting from principles and deep beliefs and living accordingly. Positive use of Adversity: Learning and growing from mistakes and suffering. Holistic: Seeing larger patterns, relations hips and connections; having a sense of belonging. Compassion: Having the quality of \"feeling with\" and deep empathy. Celebration of Diversity: Rega rding other people for their differences, not despite them. Hagemann | A New Supplement to Spiritual Leadership 10 Field-Independent: Standing against the crowd and having one's own convictions. Ask Fundamental \"Why\" questions: Needing to understand things and get to the bottom of them. Ability to Reframe: Standing back from a situation/problem and seeing the bigger picture. Spontaneity: Living in and being responsive to the moment. Sense of Vocation: Feeling called upon to serve, to give something back. Humility: Having the sense of being a player in a larger drama, of one's true place in the world. According to Yosi Amram, SQ is defined as th e ability to apply and embody spiritual resources and qualities to enhance daily func tioning and wellbeing (Amram, 2007): Consciousness: Developed refined awareness and self-knowledge; Grace: Living in alignment with the sacred manifesting love for and trust in life; Meaning: Experiencing significance in daily ac tivities through a sense of purpose and a call for service, including in the face of pain and suffering; Transcendence: Going beyond the separate egoic self into an interc onnected wholeness; Truth: Living in open acceptance, curiosity, and love for all creat ion (all that is); Peaceful surrender to Self (Truth, God, Absolute, true nature); and Inner-Directedness: inner-freedom ali gned in responsible, wise action. In the Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale (ISIS), Amram and Dreyer use only five main domains of the seven characteristics menti oned above: Consciousness, Grace, Meaning, Transcendence and Truth (Amr am, Y., and Dryer, C., 2008) . Cindy Wigglesworth came up with a system of four quadrants w ith a comparable structure to Daniel Goleman's EQ m odel (Wigglesworth, 2012): Higher Self / Ego self Awareness Universal Awareness Higher Self / Ego self Mastery Spiritual Presence / Social Mastery According to her, SQ is defined as \"the ab ility to act with wisdom and compassion, while maintaining inner and outer peace, regardless of the circumstances.\" (Wigglesworth, 2006) . She breaks down the SQ competencies into 21 skills, arranged into four quadrants Spiritual Intelligence (SQ) Skills. As the literature research has shown, there are many different definitions of SQ, some of which complement each other (approximat ely all statements that have to do with the level of consciousness and orientation towards community), some of which call themselves elements of SQ, but could also be elements of other intel ligences, especially Emotional Intelligence, and some of which are very controve rsial - for example regarding the question of what can be called spiritual and what can be called religious. Nevert heless, although the definitions are often fuzzy, clear patterns can be observed. That's why in this study, though we compile the repeating elements of the previously described different definitions and put them into an order. Four Main Qualifications of SQ A deeper look into the different concepts reveals that almost all authors explicitly or implicitly mention four areas, or under which almost all qu alitative attributes can be subsumed that are not already covered by another intelligence area, such as Emotional Intelligence. Hagemann | A New Supplement to Spiritual Leadership 11Most scholars define elements that occur to the area of awareness of oneself, describing the experience of self-cognition, self-a wareness - in philosophical terms: the discovery that I am aware of my deeper self. The other area is captured by th e description of transcenden ce, which is the opposite of immanence again in philosophical terms. Trans cendence refers to the idea of goodness or at least a higher Consciousness. The third area regularly mentioned as part of th e SQ definition refers to the relationship to somebody else, including compassion and the ab ility to create fulfilling relationships. Finally, the awareness of the connection of everyt hing and the ethical impet us to take care of the society and the world as a whole is regard ed by many as a core definition of Spiritual Intelligence. To summarize: This fourfold structure of Awareness of oneself Striving for Transcendence Relationship orientation World orientation captures well the main aspects of spirituality that many scholars describe in many different ways. The Original Meaning of \"Spiritual\" in the Biblical/Christian Tradition Interestingly, the word \"spiritual \" is used in research on Spiritual Intelligence as well as on Spiritual Leadership without refe rring to its original meaning. Th erefore, the original meaning will be examined first to derive a basic understanding in the secular context. Spiritual is derived from the Latin word \"spiri tualis\" (Online Etymology Dictionary), which is the translation of the Greek pneuma and Hebrew ruach and means breath or wind. The Latin \"spirare\" translates to breathing or blowing. In Christian theology, the \"Holy Spirit\" is regarded as the th ird person of the Triune God (Emery, 2012). The term spirituality means living w ith the Holy Spirit in following Jesus Christ (Emery, 2012). The so-called discipleship refers to a personal transforma tion, in Christian terms called conversion, and, by following Jesus Christ, a world transformation, in Christian terms called the building of the kingdom of God, re spectively the kingdom of love. (Agnew, 2008; Cunningham & Egan, 1996; Dreyer & Burrows, 2005). To summarize: spiritual in the original sense of meaning is directly linked to the Christian religion and means living with the Holy Spirit. In the bible and especially in the New Testament, there can be found a lot of charact eristics of what \"spiritual\" in terms of living with the Holy Spirit means. It can be summarized in the discipleship of Christ, which encompasses the individual transformation and th e transformation of the world. The word spirit entails both aspects: breathing as a fundamental aspe ct of human life to surviv e and to make the \"human system\" running and transforming blowing as a fundamental aspect of depl oying energy and effect for transformation In this study, we ignore the development and furt her history of Christian spirituality. The word spiritual got even in Christian history differe nt meanings over time. Interestingly enough, in other religious traditions, the term \"spiritual\" as such doesn't exist orig inally. We don't discuss either the root causes for the current, mostly common understandi ngs of spiritually that are Hagemann | A New Supplement to Spiritual Leadership 12based on the detachment of spirituality from religion since the middle of the 20th century only, c.f. (Kenneson, 2015; Mercadante, 2014). In this study, we want to build on the original understanding of \"spiritual\" that translates into the main movements of personal and world transformation. In othe r words, there is a vertical and a horizontal movement of spiritual. In light of the original understa nding of \"spiritual\", the personal vertical transformation contains two aspects: the change or adjustment of personal behaviour and the direction of the transformation (discipleship regarding Christ). Trying to \"translate\" this from the original Christian to a secular context, the two asp ects of personal transfor mation would look like: Personal transformation Individual transformation Transcendental orientation The horizontal World transformation contains tw o aspects as well: Christian discipleship is oriented to the commandment of love: \"Love yo ur neighbour as yourself\" (Mt 22) and through this to transform the society and subsequently the whole world. Hence, the \"translation\" into the secular contex t would look like: World transformation Social (directly - human) orientation Society (indirectly - world) transformation. Following this definition, a secular concept of spiritual life, derived from the original meaning of the word \"spiritual\", c ontains the four aspects: Individual Transformation Transcendental Orientation Social Orientation Society Transformation Discussion and Conclusion The analysis of research on SQ in recent year s has shown that although there are many different definitions of Spiritual Intelligence, almost all research can be summarized in these four areas: Awareness of oneself, Searching and striving for transcendence, relationship orientation and world orientation. These four dimensions consis t of many different attr ibutes. However, the four dimensions cover nearly all of the diff erent definitions and entail elements that are distinguished enough and cannot be put immediately under other concepts like Emotional Intelligence. The research regarding the origin al meaning of \"spiritual\" lead s to an interesting discovery. From the word's origin, four different meanings can be derived that co rrelate highly with the four dimensions chosen to encompass and de scribe best the dimensions of Spiritual Intelligence. Table 1: SQ and historical understanding Commonalities in SQ-definitions Historical understanding Awareness of oneself, Individual Transformation Striving for transcendence, Transcendental Orientation Relationship orientation and Social Orientation World orientation Society Transformation Hagemann | A New Supplement to Spiritual Leadership 13As can be seen at first glance, the biblical-his torical investigation of the original meaning of \"spiritual\" confirms the meanings derived from mo st descriptions of \"Spi ritual Intelligence\". This results in a new framework of \"Spiritual Intellig ence\" that has not been proposed in this way before. This new framework can become the basis for further research. At the same time, the framework offers aid to understanding Spiritual Leadership and its implementation. A spiritual leader is someone who 1) is self-aware, rooted in hope/faith, 2) makes a transcendent movement, acts in a visiona ry way, 3) has a strong relational orientation in altruistic love and 4) does not only act profit-oriented but in the end, contributes to a better world (triple-bottom-line). Table 2: Comparison SQ/Historical/Spiritual Leadership Commonalities in SQ-definitions Historical understanding Spiritual Leadership Awareness Individual Transformation Hope/Faith Transcendence Transcendental Orientation Vision/Calling Relationship Social Orientation Altruistic Love World orientation Society Transformation Triple bottom-line Limitations and Further Research We tried to achieve in this study a review of definitions of Spiritual Intelligence, a summary, compilation and assessment of the principles to pu t them into a simple structure. From there, we derived the main principles and researched the original meaning of the word spiritual and put a concept forward of how Spir itual Leadership can be formed. The first limitation of this study is the focus on the biblical meaning of \"spiritual\" and the neglect of historical development. Further re search should look especially at the different meanings of \"spiritual\" in the different centu ries, taking into account the philosophical and theological background of the spir ituality of the last 2000 years and research the development of the past 50 years in-depth. In addition, the traditions of spir ituality in other religions were out of scope for this study and should be further researched. This includes an investigation into the extent to which Eastern ideas indirectly influence spirituality. At this point, the difference betw een mystical religions and so-called revelation religions should also be considered. The overall topic of Spiritual Leadership is an important interdisciplinary research theme. Therefore, scholars from theology, psychology, neurobiology, social sc ience, and business administration should commonly e nhance the understanding and usage of the proposed model to clarify the \"Spiritual Leadership further\" framework.
