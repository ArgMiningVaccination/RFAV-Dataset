These changes reinforce the focus of responsibility to manage COVID-19 on individuals rather than institutions. Please review the changes to Chapman's primary protocols for keeping our community healthy. COVID-19 Guidelines All members of the Chapman community are encouraged to learn about the safety guidelines, testing procedures and vaccine resources for Chapman University. Guidelines for keeping healthy are based upon recommendations from the CDC and local health authorities. By working together and following these guidelines, we can help protect the health of everyone on campus and in our community. This information is offered to help you know your risk, protect yourself, take action if exposed to COVID-19 and take action if you are sick or test positive. Vaccination Based on the advice of California public health agencies, the university continues to recommend remaining current with [COVID-19 vaccination and boosters](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?s_cid=11368:10%20year%20old%20covid%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21). However, students, faculty and staff are no longer required to report their vaccination status to Chapman. Some programs on the Rinker campus continue to require vaccination and documentation. We remain committed to easy access to vaccinations and will continue to offer vaccination clinics on the campuses. Testing Take action if you are sick or exposed to COVID-19. Testing is not required to return to campus from a break. The university continues to provide on-campus testing at no cost to Chapman community members at the Student Health Center. Students and/or faculty in certain programs (e.g. Dodge College) are required to get tested according to program requirements.
