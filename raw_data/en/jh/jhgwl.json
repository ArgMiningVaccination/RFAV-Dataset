INTRODUCTION What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a natural medicine science that has been used worldwide and continues to increase in popularity. It is a safe and effective treatment for acute and chronic illnesses and can improve your immune system to help balance and restore health. It provides effective treatment for mental, emotional and physical ailments. In addition, it is beneficial for all ages ranging from pre-natal to post-natal, children, adults and seniors. [Definition of Musculoskeletal disorders](https://www.homeopathy360.com/musculoskeletal-or-joint-disease-types-symptoms-treatment-with-homeopathic-medicine) (MSDs) \"These are injuries or pain in the body's joints, ligaments, muscles, nerves, tendons, and structures that support limbs, neck and back. MSDs are degenerative diseases and inflammatory conditions that cause pain and impair normal activities . It typically affects areas of the neck, shoulders, upper and lower extremities and back. MSDs are a major concern in our society as it can progress from minor incidents to severe disability. It has many causes like age, occupation, activity level and lifestyle. Some questions we can ask include: 1. Could this be from genetic predispositions? 2. Does stress play a role in our everyday lives and contribute to [musculoskeletal problems](https://www.homeopathy360.com/musculoskeletal-or-joint-disease-types-symptoms-treatment-with-homeopathic-medicine)? 3. Is it our daily routines whether its work or home related? 4. Are we really eating a healthy and nutritious diet? 5. How often do we engage in exercise? 6. How long has our body been communicating to us but only to ignore the symptoms until it sends a direct message. TYPES OF MSDs A. Back Pain. Lumbar pain -acute lumbar pain. -chronic lumbar pain. B. Neck Pain. NECK PAIN DISORDERS CONSIST OF Degenerative disc disease (DJD) Neck strains Injuries such as whiplash Herniated disc Pinched nerve Occupational injuries C. Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI) Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) It is a constant repetitive movement or an awkward posture position, which may lead to pain and limited function. According to Statistics Canada (2006), over two million people experience RSI, which causes serious limitations to their daily functions. D.Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is comprised from the Greek origin osteo meaning the bone, arthr means joint and itis meaning inflammation. \"It is a degenerative [ joint disease](https://www.homeopathy360.com/musculoskeletal-or-joint-disease-types-symptoms-treatment-with-homeopathic-medicine) (DJD), a progressive disorder of the joints caused by gradual loss of cartilage and resulting in the development of bony spurs and cysts at the margins of the joints\" (Osteoarthritis, n.d.). The synovial fluid provides a protective barrier to the joints and allows the cartilage to move freely. Overtime, the cartilage may wear down and joints end up rubbing against one another thus, affecting the breakdown of the structure. E. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) It is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the joints and tissues resulting in inflammation. The inflammation causes pain, stiffness and swelling of the joints. After a while, damage to joints progress leading to deformities and reduces the ability of movements. Typically, RA could affect any body part, but is generally symmetrical. F. Fibromyalgia. It is another common MSDs similar to osteoarthritis. It is a chronic syndrome that affects the muscles, soft tissues of the joints, and organs. This is accompanied by pain, fatigue and exhaustion. G. Sciatica The sciatica nerve is located in the lower portion of the spine. It travels through the pelvis and buttocks down the leg, behind the knee and then to the feet. H. Bursitis Bursitis is inflammation of the bursae that contains fluid. The bursae act as a cushion to protect the bones, tendon and muscles. The primary purpose is to help diminish the amount of friction, rubbing and irritations. Some common sites where bursitis occurs are the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, tendons and even the big toe. Bursitis is common amongst adults. I. Tendonitis It is inflammation of the tendon that attaches bone to muscle. It creates movement of the muscle to push and pull the bone in different ways. Tendonitis may affect any individual, but it's more common in adults. J. Gout It develops from too much uric acid known as hyperuricaemia in the blood levels. Once hyperuricaemia levels build up eventually it begins to form crystals in the joints. These crystals are deposited into affected areas of the wrists, fingers, elbows, knees, feet and ankles. It causes pain and swelling around the joints. Gout is said to be a common form of arthritis, and if treated in the homeopathy Objectives HOW A HOMEOPATH ASSESSES A CASE Hahnemann states in \u00a73, protocols that all practitioners are required to follow. He states: To be a genuine practitioner of the medical art, a physician must: 1. clearly realize what is to be cured in disease, that is, in each single case of disease (discernment of the disease, indicator), 2. clearly realize what is curative in medicines, that is in each particular medicine (Knowledge of medicinal powers), 3. be aware of how to adapt what is curative in medicines to what he had discerned to be undoubtedly diseased in the patient, according to clear principles.
