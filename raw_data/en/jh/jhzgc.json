Recent investigations of the effect of this agent on gene expression help explain both its efficacy and toxicity. Amphotericin B has immunomodulatory properties, including the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Rogers et al.[ [14](javascript:void(0);)] measured mRNA expression and cytokine production in human cells exposed to amphotericin B in culture. Both mRNA expression and cytokine production were increased by exposure to amphotericin B. These results suggest a mechanism for toxicity of amphotericin B, as well as an additional mechanism of action. The induction of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression may be related to some of the infusion-related toxicities that are characteristic of a cytokine release, including fever, nausea, chills, and hypotension. Proinflammatory cytokines also activate monocytes and macrophages and promote chemotaxis. These activities then enhance the immune response of the individual to the infection.
