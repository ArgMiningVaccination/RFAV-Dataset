Together, our organizations represent approximately 13,500 physicians who provi de care to millions of patients suffering from asth ma and allergic diseases. The AAN is a multidisciplinary, patient-centered network dedicated to ending needless death and suffering due to asthma, allergi es, and related conditions and reaches over 10 mill ion people each year with its magazine Allergy & Asthma Today . Our organizations are writing to request that the USP maintain the current Chapter <797> rules ap plicable to allergen extracts pending completion of a full and fair review that includes collaboration wi th affected stakeholders and an analysis of the pro found and serious consequences on the future use of well- established safe and effective treatment for patien ts with allergic diseases. Facts supporting this requ est are set forth below in detail. Executive Summary Our organizations, representing physicians and pati ents, strongly oppose the USP's proposed revision t o Ch. <797> that would remove the special rules for prepa ration of allergen extracts for the following reaso ns: xAllergen extracts have been safely prepared by physi cians using aseptic technique for over one hundred years. xThe sterility record of allergen extracts prepared under current Ch. <797> rules is well-established i n both the medical literature and clinical practice. xThere is no evidence that current Ch. <797> rules p ose any threat to patient safety. xThe proposed rules were developed without an analys is of their impact on public health and costs to our health care system. xThe process did not follow USP Convention resolutio ns. xThe proposed rules are inconsistent with recently pr oposed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Industry Guidance which recognizes special treatmen t for allergen extracts. xIf the proposed rules are adopted, access to allerg en immunotherapy, a proven treatment for asthma and allergic diseases, would be severely curtailed, costs of care would rise dramatically, disparities in health care would be increased, and overall patient health would suffer. We strongly urge that the current USP <797> rules a pplicable to allergen extracts be maintained and th at any future changes to USP <797> applicable to allergen extracts be developed through an open and fair proc ess that includes full participation of patients and ot her affected stakeholders and a thorough analysis o f the impact on public health and costs of care. I. Introduction Our organizations are extremely concerned by the Co mpounding Expert Committee's (the Committee's) proposal to eliminate the special rules for allerge n extracts adopted by this same Committee and by the USP less than 10 years ago. 1 Those rules provide that allergen extracts are no t subject to the personnel, environmental, and storage requirements applicable to other compounded sterile products (CSPs) if the eleven criteria set forth in Tab 1 are met. The safety record of allergen immunotherapy extract preparation using aseptic technique is well-establ ished in both the medical literature and in clinical practic e going back over one hundred years. We are aware of no reports in the medical literature of infections res ulting from non-sterile allergen immunotherapy admi subcutaneous aller gy immunotherapy injections are given annually in t he United States to over 2.6 million people. Yet, out of the many millions of injections administered to mill ions of patients over several decades, there are no reporte d infections. This is clear evidence of the safety of current practice. Yet, with no explanation, and in a compl ete reversal of policy adopted only ten years ago, the USP now proposes that allergen extracts intended for su bcutaneous injection must be subject to the same restrictive and extremely costly environmental and engineering controls, sterility testing requirement s, and drastically shortened beyond use dates (BUDs) appli cable to high risk preparations intended for intrav enous, spinal, or other systemic means of administration. If adopted, these standards will make it virtually impossible for allergists to safely prepare allergen immunothe rapy for their patients. 1USP standards for allergenic extracts is attached, see Tab 1.Allergen immunotherapy is the only proven therapy f or asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunct ivitis that is disease modifying and offers patients a possibil ity for cure. Other currently available therapies provide symptomatic relief and control while on treatment b ut withdrawal inevitably leads to disease reoccurre nce. Therefore, the public health consequences if this p roposal is adopted are enormous. We are especially concerned about the lack of trans parency in the USP's revision process. Although USP is a non-governmental organization, it is well aware tha t its standards are enforced by the FDA as well as state legislatures, state boards of pharmacy, and private accrediting bodies such as The Joint Commission. Thus, changes to its standards have far-reaching effects a nd, consequently, the lack of transparency is espec ially troubling. For example, the Committee has offered no explanation for the major changes to its sterile compounding guidelines for allergen extracts and no rationale for the replacement of the current allerg en extract rules. Nor is there any analysis of the im pact of its revisions on public health or financial implications for our health care system. Although the public is given an opportunity to provide written comments, that process is limited by USP's failure to provide any rationale for its proposed changes. Thus, there is very little opportunity for meaningful public input. The Committee's proposal is also inconsistent with many of the Resolutions adopted by the USP Conventi on membership at its April 25, 2015 meeting. 2 Resolution VIII states that USP will collaborate with stakeholders to develop, strengthen, revise and promote adoption of health care quality standards that address quality and saf ety related to the use of medications and that are of value to patients and practitioners. (with emphasis) However, the Committee has failed to make the case for how its elimination of the current allergen ext ract rules will be \"of value to patients and practitione rs.\" In fact, just the opposite is true. As discu ssed below in more detail, the new rules will have the effect of drastically reducing, if not eliminating, patient a ccess to allergen immunotherapy - a proven treatment for pati ents with asthma and other allergic diseases. The proposed rules also ignore Resolution XI which states that USP \"will increase its commitment to gl obal public health\" by, among other things, strengthenin g systems \"that ensure access to quality foods and medicine.\" The proposed revisions will, instead, r educe access. Also troubling is the Committee's failure to provid e for an open process in which those impacted by it s proposed rules, including physicians and patients, can meet and discuss their concerns. Resolution VI specifically calls upon USP to \"promote alignment w ith stakeholders to develop quality standards for b iological medicines, ensuring that innovation and availabilit y are facilitated and complemented.\" Even more significant, the USP's proposal is also i nconsistent with the position taken by the FDA in i ts draft Industry Guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Product s Outside the Scope of an Approved 2U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, 2015-2020 Resolutions (April 25, 2015), http://www.usp.org/about-usp/2015-2020-resolutions .Biologics License Application (Draft Guidance). 3In the Draft Guidance, the FDA allows physicians to continue to prepare allergen extracts for their patients pro vided certain conditions are met. The FDA states it s intent to continue to allow compounding of \"prescription sets ,\" defined as a \"vial or set of vials of premixed with an appropriate diluent prepared according to instructi ons from a prescription or order by a licensed phys ician for an individual patient.\" Physicians who prepare pre scription sets that meet FDA criteria would not be subject to enforcement actions for violations of the Public He alth Service Act or the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Those criteria include the current USP <797> rules for all ergen extracts which the Draft Guidance accepts as reasonable. Resolution 1 of the USP Convention states that the \"USP will increase communication and collaboration with the FDA to promote alignment with the FDA's regulat ory and scientific policies from the inception of t he standards planning and development process.\" Howev er, it does not appear that the USP has communicate d with the FDA on this issue. Resolution 1 also stat es that \"USP will work with FDA, industry, and othe r stakeholders throughout the process to increase und erstanding of the regulatory impact of such proposa ls.\" Yet, the proposed rule changes, and in particular t he elimination of the allergen extract rules, seems to have been developed in complete disregard of their publi c health impact. The USP proposal also fails to take into account th e serious impact on public health that would result if allergy immunotherapy is no longer available because the co sts of allergen extract preparation are prohibitivel y expensive. The new standards would require, among other things: xRedesign of office space to meet the stringent engi neering controls necessary to maintain an ISO Class 5 environment for compounding, an ISO Cla ss 8 ante-area, and an ISO Class 7 buffer area; xEnvironmental sampling for viable and non-viable ai rborne particulates; xOngoing sterility testing requiring culturing of vi als in accordance with USP specifications and delaying distribution to patients; xDiscarding of all preparations after either 28 or 4 2-days regardless of manufacturer BUD dates. Especially important is the last item - the significantl y shorter BUD. This would require more frequent mi xing of allergen extracts which would actually increase t he risk of an adverse event due to an allergic reac tion because of extract lot variability with respect to content and potency which can cause allergic reacti ons. We strongly object to these additional requirements th at would jeopardize patient safety. In addition to safety concerns, these shorter BUD r equirements would impact efficacy of therapy. This potential lack of efficacy relates to immunotherapy induction of tolerance developed when maintenance dosing is achieved, and the linkage to the timing of injec tions that are typically given monthly once the mai ntenance dose is reached. If the allergen preparation for m aintenance therapy must be remade every month, it w ould 3FDA, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Product s Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics Licens e Application (Draft Guidance) (Feb. 2015), http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov -drugs-gen/documents/document/ucm434176.pdf ;see Tab 2.prevent the patient from reaching the maintenance d ose (and desensitization) because the schedule woul d have to be restarted with each newly prepared aller gen extract material. Furthermore, for those few large groups or laborato ries that are able to meet USP rules, the additiona l costs of compliance will be substantial and will inevitably have to be passed on to patients and insurers, incl uding Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental payers. We are especially concerned about the impact of hig her costs and resultant lack of access this would have on vulnerable populations, especially in underserve d inner cities and rural America where access and coverage of allergen immunotherapy for individuals with asth ma and allergic rhinitis already presents a challenge. This will increase disparities of care in direct opposition to the goals of the National Strategy for Quality Impr ovement in Health Care as set forth in Section 3011 of the Affordable Care Act which call for reducing \"health disparities across health disparity populations . . .\" It also undermines the specific goals of the 2012 Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial an d Ethnic Asthma Disparities .4 We believe that the proposed changes will make acc ess to care for these vulnerable populations a significant issue negatively impacting their heal th. In summary, the Committee's proposed revisions were not developed in a manner consistent with the USP Convention's resolutions and policies. Nor are the y supported by scientific or clinical evidence. In fact, as discussed below, existing studies demonstrate just the opposite - that allergen extract preparation is safe and presents no infectious risk to public health. We believe the Committee needs to withdraw the prop osed revisions, start this process anew, and ensur e that any future revisions proposed for Ch. <797> fo llow the policies established by the USP Convention . Specifically, the USP must engage in a full and fai r process with affected stakeholders and conduct a public health analysis of the impact of its proposal on pa tients with asthma and allergic diseases. We therefore request that the current standards appl icable to allergenic extracts be maintained and tha t any proposed revisions to those standards be developed in collaboration with affected stakeholders and bas ed on a complete analysis of the public health ramification s. II. Development of the 2007 USP Sterile Compounding Standards The USP's reversal of its position is especially be wildering in view of the extensive discussions and dialogue the allergy specialty organizations had with the USP pr ior to adoption of the current rules. In 2006, dur ing the development of the current USP Ch. <797> sterile co mpounding standards, the allergy specialty organiza tions worked closely with USP staff and members of the St erile Compounding Committee to address safety conce rns surrounding compounding of allergen extracts. This included a meeting with USP staff in December 2005 and a presentation made at the USP Compounding Stakehol der Forum held on June 16 th, 2006. 4See President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risk s and Safety Risks to Children, Coordinated Federal Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Disparities (May 2012), http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014- 08/documents/federal_asthma_disparities_action_plan .pdf .We understood, at that time, that the Sterile Compo unding Committee had concerns about the safety of allergen extract preparations. Although allergenic extracts had been made by allergists in their offi ces since the early part of the 20 th century using aseptic technique, there was, at that time, no set of uniform safety guidelines. Consequently, our organizations worked to develop a set of guidelines for allergen extrac t preparation that addressed product sterility and pa tient safety. The guidelines included proper train ing of personnel mixing extracts, oversight by physicians, inclusion of proper concentrations of glycerin and phenol for bacteriostasis, use of an aseptic technique, an d refrigerated storage. They also specified that a llergen immunotherapy is only intended for subcutaneous inj ection. Those standards, which were approved by th e boards of each organization, were published as part of the Allergen Immunotherapy Practice Parameters Third Update. 5 They were also provided to USP as part of the 20 06 revision process. We intended that these guidelines would be viewed b y allergists as an example of best clinical practic e and used in the same way as practice parameters and ask ed that USP either adopt them or incorporate them b y reference. The USP did not adopt these guidelines but did exclude allergenic extracts from the strin gent standards applicable to other compounded sterile pr oducts as long as certain standards specific to all ergenic extract preparation were met. These standards have been in effect since 2008 and have been widely ado pted by the majority in the allergy community. The prop osed revisions to Ch. <797> would eliminate these standards and treat allergen immunotherapy extracts the same as all other compounded sterile products. This would require, among other things, the use of a ded icated clean room, ventilation hood, air sampling, frequent testing of personnel, ongoing culturing of vials fo r sterility testing, and discarding of multi-dose p atient vials after 28 to 42 days. III. Safety and Efficacy of Allergen Immunotherapy Allergen immunotherapy, administered through subcut aneous injections, is a proven clinically effective treatment for individuals with allergic rhinitis, a llergic asthma, and hypersensitivity to efficacy of allergen immunotherapy is well-establis hed in the medical literature. 6 There are approximately 5,300 physicians in the Uni ted States who prepare and provide allergen immunotherapy extracts to their patients and it is estimated that over 16 million allergen immunothera py injections are administered annually in the United States. 7 Allergists have been preparing allergen immunotherapy extracts in their offices for over on e hundred years. Patients are closely monitored fo r reactions to the injections and cases of anaphylaxi s have been reported as well as lesser reactions. However, a medical literature search we conducted of the ove r one hundred year history of this treatment found no reported cases of endotoxicity, abscesses, or sepsi s. Nor do we see such events in our clinical pract ice. This 5Cox L, Nelson H, Lockey R. Allergen Immunotherapy: A practice parameter third update. Joint Task Force Report. (2010) J. Immunol.

Medicare utilization data indicates that Medic are alone paid for approximately 6.7 million doses of allergy immu notherapy in 2014 and it is reasonable to estimate, assuming monthly injections, that this represents approximately half a million i ndividual patients in the Medicare population alone .gives us assurance that allergen extracts prepared in physician offices are safe and sterile. This conc lusion is supported by several studies, both retrospective an d prospective. 8(See discussion below) A. Preparation of Allergen Immunotherapy Extracts Allergen extracts are prepared based on the allergi st's written order specifying the content, concentra tion, and dosing schedule. When a patient begins immunothera py, he or she typically begins with diluted doses a nd the concentration gradually increases over time. Usual ly, by the end of a year, a patient is on a mainten ance dose and receives injections once or twice every month. Injections are typically between 0.5 and 1.0 mL and are administered subcutaneously. The mixing of allergen extracts begins with FDA app roved allergenic extracts. Most, but not all, comme rcial allergenic are 50% glycerinated. The alle rgenic extracts or \"concentrates\" are combined in a sterile vial using sterile syringes. Serial 5-fold or 10-fol d dilutions are then made from the vial of concentr ate using sterile saline (either normal saline typically USP Ch. <797> guidelines or the standard s set forth in the Practice Parameters 9is followed and the vials are labeled and stored in refrigerated co nditions. BUDs are assigned based on the most recen t expiration date of any of the component antigens. A typical multi-dose vial of maintenance extract co ntains 10 doses designed to last over a 10-12 month period. 10 Dilutions, which are given at the onset of treatm ent, are also prepared in 10 dose vials but storage time is less because the injections are given more frequently ( e.g. , weekly to bi-weekly). Patients often experience reactions to their immuno therapy extracts that are generally addressed by th e treating allergist through dosage adjustments or ch anges to the allergenic extracts themselves. Furth ermore, patient history and physical well-being are assesse d before each injection and modifications are imple mented to protect patients, such as dose reductions or no administration, for example, when a patient has an asthma flare. It is important that the allergist be able to make these changes on a timely basis so that the course of treatment is appropriate and not delayed. 8See Lay PC, Bass R, Lin S.

See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.68 Preparation of allergen extracts in the allergist's office for their own patients, based on a prescrip tion established by the allergist, is quite different fr om pharmacy compounding in a number of important wa ys. First, patients who receive allergen immunotherapy in the physician's office are closely monitored by the physician for reactions for at least 30 minutes pos t-injection. Further, patients receiving immunothe rapy come to the physician's office at least monthly for inje ctions. Before the patient receives his or her nex t injection, the patient is queried by the nurse regarding any r eactions to the last injection. The injection site is also physically examined. Any problems are reported to the physician. In contrast, in the pharmacy enviro nment the pharmacist may never see the patient and is oft en not involved in his or her ongoing care and thus may not be in a position to quickly learn about problem s associated with a compounded product. In summary, allergen extract injections are only ad ministered subcutaneously and in small volumes of 0 .5 to 1.0 mL. They are never injected intravenously or i nto body cavities or the central nervous system. T hus, they present significantly less risk compared to CSPs ad ministered through intravenous or spinal injection. We believe the unique aspects of the doctor/patient re lationship should be considered in the development of compounding standards for allergen extracts. A. Studies Supporting Sterility of Allergenic Extrac ts Prepared Using Aseptic Technique Several recent studies support the safety of allerg enic extracts prepared under aseptic technique. A report by allergists at Lackland Air Force Base described 10 years of bacterial cultures performed on allergen immunotherapy vials and found that of the 2,085 cul tures completed between 1998 and 2009, 2,084 cultu res were negative. 11 No information was available on whether the singl e positive culture was administered to a patient, but the authors reported no known cases of infections at their institution. Another single-blinded, prospective, case-control s tudy performed in 2008 that compared mixing of alle rgenic extracts in the office using aseptic technique with preparation under an ISO Class 5 vacuum ventilated hood also supports the conclusion that the risk of bacte rial contamination in immunotherapy prepared in the office under aseptic conditions is extremely rare. 12 A second prospective study supports sterility of allergenic extracts over several months. In that study, 136 v ials of allergenic extract were cultured at the tim e of expiration over an 8-month period after multiple do ses were given from each vial. All culture results were negative. The authors concluded that immunotherapy vials are at low risk for contamination when prepa red in the office using aseptic technique. 13 A 2007 retrospective study of 272 patients given 26 ,795 injections from January 2000-June 2006 at a university clinic showed no documented skin or syst emic infections as a result of allergen injections.14 Nor did 11 Letz AG, Tankersley MS, Dice England RW.

None required antib iotics or medical treatment for infection. Althou gh there was incidence of both systemic and local allergic react ions, they all related to reactions to the antigens themselves and not the presence of contaminants in the antigen preparations. 15 A pilot study has recently been completed at 2 majo r academic medical centers in Boston (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) in which an association between episodes of administration of allergen immunotherapy using extr acts prepared with aseptic technique and subsequent evidence of skin or soft tissue infection (within 5 days) was examined over a 10-year time frame. CPT codes 95115 and 95117 identified episodes of allergen to identify dermatitis and skin/soft tissue infection. In this study 145,930 separate episodes of administration o f allergen immunotherapy were identified, in which there were 46 episodes of dermatitis or skin/soft tissue infec tion occurring in the same patient within a 5 day period . Chart review of those 46 episodes of documented dermatitis or clinical infection was undertaken to ide ntify the precise clinical process prompting utiliz ation of the ICD-9 code. All dermatitic or clinical infectio us episodes were identified as being remote from th e site of immunotherapy administration and included the follo wing clinical descriptors: folliculitis (15), dermatitis w rosea, paronychia and inclusion cyst (1 each). The conclusion was that no infectious compli cations of administration of allergen immunotherapy, with extr acts prepared using aseptic technique, were identif ied among these 146,930 administrations (unpublished da ta Aidan Long et al). The absence of reported sterility problems is due i n large part to the antibacterial properties of add itives used in preparation of allergenic extracts. A 2012 in vitro study examined microbial growth in allergen immunotherapy vials prepared with varying concentra tions of glycerin, phenol, and a combination of bot h. This study demonstrated the role of these additives in inhibiting bacterial growth and concluded that based on results of this study and analysis of other data, t hat current standards of immunotherapy vial mixing using aseptic technique without the need for a ventilatio n hood are supported by the literature. 16 Another study at the Mayo Clinic compared the effects of microbial g rowth by using lower than recommended concentration s of phenol and glycerin in two experiments in which one group of vials was prepared using a laminar flow ho od and appropriate attire, including gown, mask, and s terile gloves and the other set were prepared on th e bench top and included alcohol wipes of the vials and rea gent bottles. 17 None of the vials showed microbial growth and no difference was found between hood or bench t op preparations. We believe the implementation of the current Ch. <7 97> standards in 2008 and the standards developed by our specialties which began in 2007 has helped ensu re sterility in allergenic extracts. The proposed changes will have a negative impact on public health and in crease the overall cost of medical care in the Unit ed States. 15 Id. 16 Gilbert KC, Sundrarehsan V, Bass RM, Lin SY. Antibacterial properties of additives used in injec tion ( Tab 5); see note 8. Rossow K, Butler MA, Lowe D, Li JT. Bacteriostatic agents and sterility requirements fo r allergen immunotherapy . Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology 2011; 106:76-77 (Tab 9). If the current published data are insufficient, the task of undertaking a prospective study to prove a negative at the clinical level ( i.e. lack of infectious complications associated with al lergen immunotherapy), would require massive data gathering. The need for the e xtraordinarily large sample size is related to the extremely low event rate and the need to power the study appr opriately to achieve acceptable scientific rigor in terms of study design. However, at a minimum, the allergy c ommunity should be allowed to assess the feasibilit y of embarking on a surveillance project that would furt her substantiate the safety of allergen immunothera py prior to any changes to the current Ch. <797>. At the sa me time, we would ask that any data the USP has regarding safety concerns relative to allergen immu notherapy be shared in a timely way with the allerg y community so that we can work together to resolve t hem (if they exist). IV. Public Health Impact if Proposed Standards are A dopted A. Impact on Access to Care Respiratory allergies affect more than 50 million A mericans. The most common respiratory allergy, all ergic rhinitis, represents the 5 th leading chronic disease overall, and the third lead ing chronic disease among children under age 18. 18 Those with allergic rhinitis can experience distu rbed sleep, decreased energy, depressed mood, poor concentration, decrements in performance at school and work, and millions of lost work and school days annually. 19 In 2005, estimated total direct U.S. costs of aller gic rhinitis exceeded $11 billion and in 2011 the direct costs were estimated to exceed $14 billion. 20 Survey data suggests that there are approximately 2 .6 million individuals in the United States that re ceive approximately 16 million allergen immunotherapy subcut aneous injections for allergic diseases and conditi ons each year. 21 Numerous well-designed controlled studies have de monstrated that allergen immunotherapy is effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis as well as such life-threatening conditions as asthma and stinging insect hypersensitivity. 22 Randomized controlled studies also show that it i s effective in preventing the development of asthma in individuals with allergic rhinitis. 23 In fact, allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only treatment known to provide long-term benefit a nd alter the course of allergic disease. 24 Allergen immunotherapy also reduces health care cos ts. In a groundbreaking study involving an analysi s of 10 years of Medicaid claims (1997-2007) in Florida, ev idence showed that over an 18-month period, childre n with allergic rhinitis who received allergen-specific immu notherapy incurred 42 percent lower per-patient hea lth care costs than those who did not receive allergen- specific immunotherapy, or a savings of $3,865 per 18 The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunolo gy (AAAAI).

Allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and as thma . Drug Benefit Trends 2008;20:1-6.patient. 25 A similar analysis involving claims data for adul t patients was equally compelling. Over 18 months, health care costs for adults with allergic rhinitis who received allergen-specific immunotherapy were 30 percent lower than those who did not - a savings of $4,397 per patient. 26 If the proposed USP Ch. <797> rules are finalized, patient access to allergen immunotherapy will be dr astically reduced, if not eliminated, because allergists will no longer be able to prepare allergen immunotherap y vials for their patients. Moving allergen extract prepa ration to large compounding laboratories or pharmac ies is not a viable alternative due to safety considerations. This is because patients often have allergic reacti ons to their immunotherapy injections that require the allergist to change the content or dilution of the vials bef ore they can receive the next injection. For example, if a p atient comes in for an injection and reports that a fter the last injection they experienced a reaction to his o r her last shot, depending on the nature of the rea ction, this would require the allergist to change the dilution or possibly even change the specific allergens in t he vial in response to specific sensitivities. Failure to do so could re sult in a life-threatening systemic allergic reactio n. These adjustments would need to be done while the p atient is in the office if the patient's treatment schedule is not to be interrupted or delayed. Compounding p harmacies, located off-site from the allergist's off ice, would not be able to make these adjustments in a ti mely fashion. Furthermore, any requirement for ste rility testing prior to revised extract release introduces an unsustainable delay in treatment, as well as pa tient safety and efficacy concerns. A. Impact on Coverage Medicare does not cover allergen immunotherapy manufactur ed by a third party vendor. CPT code 95165, which is recognized by Medicare, is for the direct physician supervision of the making of allergen immunotherapy extract. This code would not be applicable for allergen immunotherapy manufactured by an outside source and the use of this code, by a physician or benef iciary to be reimbursed for allergen immunotherapy could be considered Medicare fraud. In addition, commercial insurers recognize CPT Code 95165 f or reimbursement for allergen immunotherapy and, as with Medicare, it is not clear that there are any alter native CPT codes that would be recognized for reimbursement of allergen immunotherapy that is compounde d outside of a physician's office. The direct consequence of the USP eliminating the special rules for all ergen immunotherapy compounding is that Medicare recipients, and potentially Medicaid and commerci ally insured patients, would no longer have allergen immunotherapy as a covered service. USP would be effectively making a medical policy decision that would directly and negatively impact the health care of hundreds of thousands of Medicare recipients and oth ers. This potential change could transfer the cost of a previously covered benefit to the beneficiary. 25 Hankin CS, Cox L, Wang Z, Bronstone A. Allergy immunotherapy: reduced health care costs in adults and children with allergic rhinitis. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013; 131:1084-1091 (Tab 10) . 26 Id. Finally, even if Medicare and other payers did reimburse for allergen extracts prepared by outside laboratories or compounding pharmacies, based on data obtain from third p arty vendors, charges for antigens prepared using current USP 797 standards are already as much as five ti mes the cost per dose recognized by Medicare. If those vendors had to implement the more stringent rules pr oposed by the Committee, it is certain that those costs would be significantly higher. V. Conclusion Although we strongly support the USP's mission of p rotecting patients from harm caused by contaminated compounded products, we cannot help but think that applying the proposed USP <797> standards to allerg en extracts is a solution in search of a problem. Our goal as physicians is to ensure that the care we p rovide is both safe and effective. Decades of clinical exper ience plus several recent studies indicate that all ergenic extracts prepared in the allergist's office under a septic technique and administered through subcutane ous injection do not present a risk of infection. As s uch, the proposed Ch. <797> standards, as applied t o allergenic extracts, are not supported by the scien ce. Nor do they take into consideration the very s erious public health impact that would result from reduced access to effective immunotherapy for hundreds of thousands of Americans who rely on or are in need o f this treatment. We strongly urge you to retain t he current USP <797> standards for allergenic extracts . In the alternative, we ask that you work with our organizations to develop workable standards that ar e supported by scientific evidence. The health of our patients is at risk. Sincerely, Brian L.

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE 14 15 This guidance sets forth FDA's policy regarding the mixi ng, 2diluting, and repackaging 3of 16 certain types of biological products that have been licens ed under section 351 of the Public 17 Health Service Act (PHS Act) when such activities are not wi thin the scope of the product's 18 approved biologics license application (BLA) as described in t he approved labeling for the 19 product. 4This guidance describes the conditions under which FDA does not intend to take action 20 for violations of sections 351 of the PHS Act and sections 502(f)( 1) and where specified, section 21 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) , when a state-licensed 22 pharmacy, a Federal facility, or an outsourcing facility 5dilutes, mixes or repackages certain 23 biological products without obtaining an approved BLA. 24 1This guidance has been prepared by multiple offices in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER ), in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluatio n and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the Food and Drug Administration. 2For purposes of this guidance, mixing means combini ng an FDA-licensed biological product with one or m ore ingredients. Not covered by this guidance is dilut ing or mixing a biological product at the point of care for immediate administration to a single patient after receipt of a patient specific prescription or order for that patient (e.g., diluting or mixing into a syringe to adminis ter directly to the patient). 3For purposes of this guidance, repackaging means ta king a licensed biological product from the contain er in which it was distributed by the original manufacturer and placing it into a different container without furt her manipulation of the product. As used in this guidance, the term s mixing, diluting, and repackaging describe distinct sets of activities with respect to a biological product. 4This guidance does not apply to blood and blood com ponents for transfusion, vaccines, cell therapy pro ducts, and gene therapy products 5\"Outsourcing facility\" refers to a facility that meets the definition of a n outsourcing facility under section 503B(d)(4) of the FD&C Act. See FDA's draft guidance, \"Guidance for Entities Considering Whether to Regis ter As Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\" Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 2This guidance does not address the following: 25 xBiological products not subject to licensure under section 351 o f the PHS Act (i.e., 26 biological products for which a marketing application could p roperly be submitted under 27 section 505 of the FD&C Act (see section 7002(e) of the Affordable Care Act)). The 28 repackaging of biological products not subject to licensur e under section 351 is addressed 29 in a separate draft guidance document.630 xProducts intended for use in animals. FDA will consider addressing this issue in a 31 separate guidance document. 32 xMixing, diluting, or repackaging biological products (other t han allergenic extracts) by 33 entities that are not state-licensed pharmacies, Federal fac ilities, or outsourcing facilities; 34 and preparation of allergenic extracts by entities that are not state-licensed pharmacies, 35 Federal facilities, outsourcing facilities, or physicians ( See additional information in 36 section III.A. of this draft guidance document). 37 xRemoving a biological product from the original container at the point of care for 38 immediate administration to a single patient after receip t of a patient-specific prescription 39 or order for that patient (e.g., drawing up a syringe to adminis ter directly to the patient). 40 FDA does not consider this to be \"repackaging,\" for purposes of this guidance document. 41 xUpon receipt of a patient-specific prescription, a license d pharmacy removing from one 42 container the quantity of solid oral dosage form biological p roducts necessary to fill the 43 prescription and placing it in a smaller container to dispense directly to its customer. 44 xMixing, diluting, or repackaging a licensed biological product when the product is being 45 mixed, diluted, or repackaged in accordance with the approved BLA as described in the 46 approved labeling for the product. FDA considers this to be an ap proved manipulation of 47 the product. 48 xMixing, diluting, or repackaging of blood and blood components for tra nsfusion, 749 vaccines, cell therapy products, or gene therapy products (see footnote 4). The guidance 50 does not alter FDA's existing approach to regulating the collec tion and processing of 51 blood and blood components. In addition, FDA intends to consider regulatory action if 52 licensed vaccines, cell therapy products, and gene therapy products are subject to 53 additional manufacturing, including mixing, diluting, or repacka ging, in ways not 54 specified in the product's approved BLA as described in the ap proved labeling for the 55 product. 56 57 As stated above, this guidance does not address the mixing, diluti ng, or repackaging of a 58 biological product for which a marketing application could pro perly be submitted under section 59 505 of the FD&C Act (see section 7002(e) of the Affordable Care Ac t). Accordingly, the term 60 All FDA guidances are available on the Agency's gui dance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry /ucm234622.htm . FDA updates guidances regularly. To ensure that you have the most recent version, pleas e check this web page. 6The repackaging of biological products approved und er section 505 is addressed in a separate draft Gui dance, \"Repackaging of Certain Human Drug Products by Pharm acies and Outsourcing Facilities. \" 7The guidance does apply to licensed biological prod ucts that are plasma derived products, including re combinant and transgenic versions of plasma derivatives, mixe d, diluted, or repackaged outside the scope of an ap proved BLA. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 3\"biological product\" as used in this guidance does not include products for which a marke ting 61 application can be or has been submitted under section 505 of t he FD&C Act. 62 63 Section II of this guidance provides background on biological products and the legal framework 64 for FDA's regulation of these products, and explains that secti ons 503A and 503B of the FD&C 65 Act do not provide exemptions for mixing, diluting, or repackagin g of biological products. 66 Section III describes FDA's policy on mixing, diluting, or rep ackaging of certain licensed 67 biological products that is not within the scope of the produ ct's approved BLA as described in 68 the approved labeling for the product. 69 70 FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establi sh legally enforceable 71 responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's c urrent thinking on a topic and should 72 be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory o r statutory requirements are 73 cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 74 recommended, but not required. 75 76 II. BACKGROUND 77 78 A. Biological Products 79 80 The term \"biological product\" is defined in section 351(i)(1 ) of the PHS Act to mean: 81 82 a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or 83 derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically sy nthesized 84 polypeptide), or analogous product, or arsphenamine or derivative of 85 arsphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applic able to 86 the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings. 87 88 Biological products can be complex chains or combinations of s ugars, amino acids, or nucleic 89 acids, or living entities such as cells and cellular therapie s. Biological products include 90 therapeutic proteins, monoclonal antibodies, allergenic extract s, blood and blood derivatives, cell 91 therapy products, and gene therapy products, preventive vaccin es, and therapeutic vaccines. 92 Generally, biological products have a complex set of stru ctural features (e.g., amino acid 93 sequence, glycosylation, folding) essential to their intended effect, and are very sensitive to 94 changes to their manufacturing process, including, but not li mited to, any manipulation outside 95 of their approved container-closure systems. In addition, many bi ological products are 96 particularly sensitive to storage and handling conditions and can break down or aggregate if 97 exposed to heat and/or light, if dropped, or if shaken during s torage and handling. Accordingly, 98 diluting or mixing a biological product with other components, or repackaging a biological 99 product by removing it from its approved container-closure sy stem and transferring it to another 100 container-closure system, is, in the absence of manufacturing c ontrols, highly likely to affect the 101 safety and/or effectiveness of the biological product. 102 103 Nevertheless, certain licensed biological products may nee d to be mixed or diluted in a way not 104 described in the approved labeling for the product to meet the needs of a specific patient. For 105 example, for some biological products there is no licensed pe diatric strength and/or dosage form, 106 so the product must be diluted for use in pediatric patients . In addition, there may be certain 107 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 4circumstances where a person would repackage a licensed biol ogical product by removing it 108 from its original container and placing it into a different c ontainer(s), in a manner that is not 109 within the scope of the approved BLA as described in the appr oved labeling for the product. 110 Like other drugs, biological products are sometimes repacka ged for various reasons including for 111 pediatric or ophthalmic use. For example, a pediatric dialy sis unit may repackage a larger 112 quantity of a product into smaller aliquots so that the optimal dose may be administered to each 113 pediatric dialysis patient being treated at that partic ular time. 114 115 Repackaging a drug or biological product could change its char acteristics in ways that have not 116 been evaluated during the approval process and that could affe ct the safety and effectiveness of 117 the product. Improper repackaging of drug and biological produ cts can cause serious adverse 118 events. Of particular concern is the repackaging of sterile dru gs, which are susceptible to 119 contamination and degradation. For example, failure to proper ly repackage a sterile drug under 120 appropriate aseptic conditions could introduce contaminants that cou ld cause serious patient 121 injury or death. Repackaging practices that conflict with a pproved product labeling have led to 122 product degradation resulting in adverse events associated wi th impurities in the product or lack 123 of efficacy because the active ingredient has deteriora ted. These risks are often even more acute 124 for biological products due to their complex composition and s ensitivity to variations in storage 125 and handling conditions. 126 127 Cell and gene therapy products often contain viable cells or i ntact/active viral vectors. The 128 manufacturing process for these products is complex and incl udes multiple controls to assure the 129 purity or potency of the product and its safety and effecti veness. Many cell therapy products are 130 cryopreserved, and the procedures for thawing and handling in preparation for administration 131 described in the approved labeling must be followed to mainta in the safety and effectiveness of 132 the product. In addition, because these products are frequently im planted or administered 133 intravenously and are not typically amenable to terminal ste rilization, their microbiological 134 safety is dependent largely on facility design, aseptic techniqu e, and manufacturing protocols 135 that are best controlled by robust quality systems. 136 137 Vaccines are manufactured using biological systems and su pplied by manufacturers in single 138 dose or multi-dose presentations. Unlike most other drugs and bi ological products, vaccines are 139 administered to healthy individuals, including infants, to pr event disease. Vaccines may contain 140 live attenuated organisms, inactivated organisms, or compo nents of bacteria or viruses such as 141 polysaccharides, inactivated toxins, or purified protei ns. The manufacturing process for 142 vaccines is complex and includes multiple controls to assure safety and effectiveness. Each 143 single dose of a vaccine is formulated to deliver the correc t quantity of active ingredient(s) to the 144 recipient. 145 146 The policies in this guidance do not cover cell therapy pro ducts, gene therapy products, and 147 vaccines. Because of the particularly sensitive nature of the se products as described above, these 148 categories of products must be prepared, and if applicable to t hat product's use, repackaged, 149 under an approved BLA, in accordance with section 351 of the PHS A ct. 150 151 The policies in this guidance also do not cover or alter FDA 's existing approach to regulating the 152 collection and processing of blood and blood components for transfus ion. These activities are 153 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 5currently conducted in FDA licensed or registered blood coll ection establishments and in 154 hospital-based transfusion services regulated in part by th e Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 155 Services under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment s of 1988. In all instances, 156 blood collection and processing is already subject to current g ood manufacturing practices 157 (CGMP) under the existing statutory and regulatory framewor k for blood and blood components 158 and will not be subject to the policies described here. 159 160 B. Legal Framework for FDA's Regulation of Biological Products 161 162 Section 351(a)(1) of the PHS Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any 163 biological product unless \"a biologics license...is in effect f or the biological product.\" For FDA 164 to approve a BLA, the BLA must contain data to demonstrate that th e biological product is safe, 165 pure, and potent and that the facility in which the biologic al product will be manufactured, 166 processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to ensure t hat the biological product 167 continues to be safe, pure, and potent. Because manufacturing con trols are so important to 168 ensuring the safety and effectiveness of biological produc ts, FDA licensing of a biological 169 product is based, in part, on an extensive review of chemistry a nd manufacturing controls data 170 submitted by the applicant. This includes a thorough evaluati on of the raw materials, drug 171 substance, and drug product to ensure consistency in manufacturi ng and continued safety and 172 effectiveness. In addition, other data are submitted and reviewe d (e.g., stability and 173 compatibility testing results) to establish the storage and handling conditions appropriate to 174 ensure the safety, purity, and potency of the biological p roduct. 175 176 A biological product that is mixed, diluted, or repackaged outsi de the scope of an approved BLA 177 is an unlicensed biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act. For example, if a licensed 178 biological product is diluted or mixed with components other t han those described in the 179 approved labeling for the product, or if it is removed from its o riginal container-closure system 180 and placed in a new container-closure system that is not descri bed in the approved labeling for 181 the product, these additional manufacturing steps would create a n ew, unlicensed biological 182 product. To be legally marketed, the new biological product wou ld have to be licensed on the 183 basis of an approved BLA that includes, among other things, chemis try and manufacturing 184 controls data. 185 186 C. Sections 503A and 503B of the FD&C Act Do Not Exempt Biological Products 187 from the Premarket Approval Requirements of the PHS Act or from P rovisions 188 of the FD&C Act 189 190 Section 503A of the FD&C Act exempts compounded drugs from sections 505 (concerning new 191 drug approval of human drugs products), 502(f)(1) (concerning la beling of drug products with 192 adequate directions for use), and 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (co ncerning CGMP) provided 193 that certain conditions are met, including that the drug is compounde d pursuant to a prescription 194 for an individually-identified patient from a licensed prac titioner. 195 196 The Drug Quality and Security Act added a new section 503B to th e FD&C Act. Under section 197 503B(b) of the FD&C Act, a compounder can register as an outsourcing f acility with FDA. 198 Drug products compounded under the direct supervision of a licens ed pharmacist in an 199 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 6outsourcing facility can qualify for exemptions from the FDA appr oval requirements in section 200 505 of the FD&C Act and the requirement to label drug products with adequate directions for use 201 under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act if the conditions in section 503B are met. Drugs 202 compounded in outsourcing facilities are not exempt from the CGM P requirements of section 203 501(a)(2)(B). 204 205 Although sections 503A and 503B provide an exemption for certain c ompounded drugs from the 206 requirement to obtain premarket approval under section 505 o f the FD&C Act, they do not 207 provide an exemption from the requirement to obtain premarket a pproval under section 351 of 208 the PHS Act. Manufacturers of biological products must obtain an approved license under 209 section 351(a) or (k) of the PHS Act. Thus, for purposes of secti ons 503A and 503B, a drug 210 does not include any biological product that is subject to lice nsure under section 351 of the PHS 211 Act. Accordingly, such biological products are not eligible fo r the exemptions for compounded 212 drugs under sections 503A and 503B of the FD&C Act. In other words, the FD &C Act does not 213 provide a legal pathway for marketing biological products t hat have been prepared outside the 214 scope of an approved BLA. 215 216 D. Hospital and Health System 8Repackaging of Drugs In Shortage For Use in the 217 Health System (Section 506F of the FD&C Act) 218 219 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA ), signed into law in 220 July, 2012, added section 506F to the FD&C Act. This section exempts ce rtain hospitals within 221 a health system from registration requirements in section 510 of the Act provided certain 222 conditions are met, including that the drugs (including biologica l products) are, or have recently 223 been, listed on FDA's drug shortage list 9and are repackaged for the health system. Section 506F 224 of the FD&C Act defines \"repackaging,\" for purposes of that section only, as \"divid[ing] the 225 volume of a drug into smaller amounts in order to\u2014(A) extend the supply of a drug in response 226 to the placement of the drug on a drug shortage list under sec tion 506E; and (B) facilitate access 227 to the drug by hospitals within the same health system.\" 228 229 Section 506F of the FD&C Act has a termination clause that state s \"This section [506F] shall not 230 apply on or after the date on which the Secretary issues a final guidance that clarifies the policy 231 of the Food and Drug Administration regarding hospital pharmacies r epackaging and safely 232 transferring repackaged drugs [including drugs that are licen sed biological products] to other 233 hospitals within the same health system during a drug shortage .\" 10 These issues are addressed 234 and clarified by this guidance, and the guidance on Repackaging of Certain Human Drug 235 Products by Pharmacies and Outsourcing Facilities . Therefore, when these guidances become 236 final, section 506F of the FD&C Act will no longer apply. 237 8For purposes of this guidance, the term \"health system\" refers to a collection of hospitals that are owned and operated by the same entity and that share access t o databases with drug order information for their p atients. 9See section 506F(b) (providing that the exemption m ay be available if, among other factors, the drug i s repackaged (1) during any period in which the drug is listed o n the drug shortage list under section 506E; or (2) during the 60- day period following any period described in paragr aph (1)). 10 See section 506F(d) of the FD&C Act.

POLICY 239 240 Because biological products sometimes need to be mixed, d iluted, or repackaged in ways not 241 addressed in labeling approved for the product under section 351 o f the PHS Act, but do not 242 qualify for the exemptions in sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act, F DA has developed this 243 guidance to explain the conditions under which FDA does not intend to take action when certain 244 biological products are mixed, diluted, or repackaged in a manne r not described in their approved 245 labeling. 246 247 A. General Conditions 248 249 This guidance addresses the mixing, diluting, or repackaging of a licensed biological product, not 250 a biological product licensed for further manufacturing use onl y, or a bulk drug substance. The 251 policies expressed in this guidance do not extend to any person or entity that mixes, dilutes, or 252 repackages a biological product from any other starting mate rial. Consistent with section 351 of 253 the PHS Act, a manufacturer seeking to mix, dilute, or repackage a biological product licensed 254 for further manufacturing use only, or a bulk drug substance, mus t first submit a BLA and obtain 255 a license for the product. 256 257 Furthermore, the policies expressed in this guidance apply on ly to the mixing, diluting, or 258 repackaging of certain licensed biological products, in accor dance with the conditions specified 259 in sections III.B and III.C of this guidance. Except as described in sections III.B and III.C, the 260 agency will consider regulatory action if a licensed biologi cal product is subject to additional 261 manufacturing, including mixing, diluting, or repackaging, outsi de of the conditions specified in 262 the approved labeling for the licensed product. 263 264 As described in section B, a biological product that is mixed, diluted, or repackaged outside the 265 scope of an approved BLA is an unlicensed biological product unde r section 351 of the PHS Act. 266 To be legally marketed, the new biological product would hav e to be licensed on the basis of an 267 approved BLA, have labeling with adequate directions for use, and be made in accordance with 268 biological product standards and CGMP requirements. Therefor e, biological products that do not 269 meet the conditions in this guidance, including 1) biological pr oducts that are mixed, diluted, or 270 repackaged by entities that are not state-licensed pharm acies, Federal facilities, or outsourcing 271 facilities or 2) prescription sets of allergenic extract s that are not prepared by state-licensed 272 pharmacies, Federal facilities, outsourcing facilities, or li censed physicians, must comply with 273 requirements in the PHS Act, FD&C Act, and FDA regulations appl icable to biological products 274 manufactured by \"conventional\" manufacturers, including, but not limited to, biological product 275 license requirements, and compliance with applicable standards and CGMP requirements. 276 277 B. Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Licensed Biological Products 278 279 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 8FDA does not intend to take action for violations of sections 351 of t he PHS Act or 502(f)(1) of 280 the FD&C Act if a state-licensed pharmacy, a Federal facilit y, or an outsourcing facility11 mixes, 281 dilutes, or repackages a biological product in accordance wit h the conditions described below, 282 and any applicable requirements. 12 In addition, FDA does not intend to take action for violations 283 of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act when a state-licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility 284 mixes, dilutes, or repackages a biological product in accorda nce with the conditions described 285 below, and any applicable requirements. Outsourcing facilitie s remain subject to applicable 286 CGMP requirements. 287 288 The conditions referred to in the preceding paragraph are as fol lows: 289 290 1. The biological product that is mixed, diluted, or repackaged is an FDA-licensed biological 291 product, not a biological product licensed for further manufacturi ng use only or a bulk drug 292 substance. 293 294 2. The biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged in a state-licensed pharmacy, a 295 Federal facility, or an outsourcing facility. 296 297 3. If the biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged in a state-licensed pharmacy or a 298 Federal facility (but not an outsourcing facility), it is mix ed, diluted, or repackaged after (a) 299 the receipt of a valid prescription for an identified, indiv idual patient directly from the 300 prescribing practitioner, patient, or patient's agent; or (b) a written order in a patient's chart 301 in a healthcare setting, 13 unless it is mixed, diluted, or repackaged (but not distributed ) in 302 advance of receipt of such a prescription or a written orde r in a patient's chart in a quantity 303 that does not exceed the expected demand for the biological product within the beyond use 304 date (BUD) on the product, based on a history of receipt of pres criptions or orders for such a 305 biological product for that time period. 306 307 4. The biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged by o r under the direct supervision of 308 a licensed pharmacist. 309 11 As we discuss in section II of this guidance, biolog ical products licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the statutory exemptions offered by sec tions 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act, and if a facility registers as an outsourcing facility but only mixes, dilutes, or repackages such biological products, none of the products made at the facility will be eligible for the exemptions under section 503B. However, this guidance descri bes the conditions under which FDA does not intend to take action for violations of section 351 of the PHS Act and sections 501(a)(2)(B) and 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act if such biological products are mixed, diluted, or repackag ed at a state- licensed pharmacy, a Federal facility, or an outsour cing facility that compounds drug products in accor dance with section 503B. 12 Applicable requirements include, for example, the r equirement that manufacturers not adulterate a biol ogical product by preparing, packing , or holding the drug under insanitary conditions. See section 501(a)(2) (A) of the FD&C Act. 13 Drugs produced by outsourcing facilities, including drugs that are also biological products, remain sub ject to the requirements in section 503(b) of the FD&C Act. There fore, a prescription drug, including a biological p roduct, cannot be dispensed to a patient without a prescrip tion. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 9310 5. Except as provided below for a single dose vial, the biologi cal product is mixed, diluted, or 311 repackaged in a way that does not conflict with the approved label ing for the licensed 312 biological product.14 313 314 For a biological product packaged in a single dose vial that is mixed, diluted, or repackaged 315 into multiple units, the biological product is mixed, diluted , or repackaged in a way that does 316 not conflict with the approved labeling, except for the statem ents designating the product as a 317 single dose or single use product, and related language (e.g., disc ard remaining contents).15 318 319 6. As described in section II of this guidance, biological p roducts are very susceptible to 320 product quality concerns when mixed, diluted, or repackaged. F or example, because 321 biological products provide a rich media for microbial grow th, they are particularly 322 susceptible to microbial proliferation over time, if contami nated. Therefore, the mixed, 323 diluted, or repackaged biological product is given a BUD that i s not longer than the 324 applicable BUD 16 below: 325 326 a. If the biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged by a state-licensed 327 pharmacy or a Federal facility, it is given a BUD that 328 - is not longer than 4 hours, or is equal to the time within which the o pened product 329 is to be used as specified in the approved labeling, whiche ver is shorter;17 or 330 - is up to 24 hours if microbial challenge studies performed on the formulation of 331 the diluted, mixed, or repackaged biological product in the t ype of container in 332 which it will be packaged demonstrate that microbial growth w ill not progress to 333 an unacceptable level within the period of the BUD. (See Appe ndix 1 for a 334 description of microbial challenge study design.) 335 b. If the biological product is mixed or diluted by an outsourc ing facility, it is given a 336 BUD that 337 14 For example, if the approved labeling for the licen sed biological product contains instructions for ha ndling or storage of the product, the mixing, diluting, or re packaging is done in accordance with those instruct ions. Otherwise, it would be considered to be in conflict with the approved labeling for the licensed biolog ical product. 15 For example, Avastin (bevacizumab) is packaged in a single dose vial. This condition could be satisfi ed even if Avastin is repackaged into multiple single dose syr inges despite the fact that the label of the approv ed product states, \"Single-use vial...Discard unused portion.\" However, this condition would not be satisfied if Avastin is mixed, diluted, or repackaged in a manner that conflicts w ith other language in the approved labeling (e.g., regarding the appropriate diluent and storage conditions). 16 The BUD timeframes in this condition begin from the time in which the container of the original biolog ical product to be repackaged or to be used for mixing or diluting is punctured or otherwise opened (\"opened product\"). 17 The 4 hour BUD timeframe in this guidance is consis tent with the labeling of many licensed biological products, which require the disposal of any product not used within 4 hours after the product has been reconstitu ted or the container has been entered. Where another timefram e is provided in the labeling, it is based on data generated under specific conditions by the product's manufacturer an d submitted with the BLA. Such data are not availab le for products mixed, diluted, or repackaged outside the scope of a BLA, as described in this guidance. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 10 - is not longer than 4 hours, or is equal to the time within which the o pened product 338 is to be used as specified on the approved labeling, whichev er is shorter; or 339 - is up to 24 hours if microbial challenge studies performed on the formulation of 340 the mixed or diluted biological product in the type of contai ner in which it will be 341 packaged demonstrate that microbial growth will not progress to an unacceptable 342 level within the period of the BUD. (See Appendix 1 for a descripti on of 343 microbial challenge study design.) 344 c. If the biological product is repackaged by an outsourcing fa cility, it is given a BUD 345 that 346 - is not longer than 4 hours, or is equal to the time within which the o pened product 347 is to be used as specified on the approved labeling, whichev er is shorter; or 348 - is up to 24 hours if microbial challenge studies performed on the formulation of 349 the repackaged biological product in the type of container in which it will be 350 packaged demonstrate that microbial growth will not progress to an unacceptable 351 level within the period of the BUD. (See Appendix 1 for a descripti on of 352 microbial challenge study design); or 353 - does not exceed 5 days or the expiration date of the biological product being 354 repackaged, whichever is shorter, provided that the outsourcing fa cility conducts 355 adequate compatibility studies on the container-closure system (e.g., the syringe) 356 of the repackaged biological product to demonstrate compatibi lity and ensure 357 product integrity. ( See Title 21, section 211.94 of the Code of Federal 358 Regulations for regulations on drug product containers and closure s). 18 359 7. If the biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged in a state-licensed pharmacy or a 360 Federal facility, it is done in accordance with the United Stat es Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 361 <797>, except the BUD is as specified in condition 6; if the biolo gical product is mixed, 362 diluted, or repackaged in an outsourcing facility, it is done in a ccordance with CGMP 363 requirements, except the BUD is as specified in condition 6. 364 365 8. The biological product is not sold or transferred by an e ntity other than the entity that mixed, 366 diluted, or repackaged the biological product. For purposes of this condition, a sale or 367 transfer does not include administration of a biological produ ct in a health care setting. 368 369 18 This longer BUD reflects that outsourcing facilitie s must comply with CGMP requirements and are subjec t to FDA inspections on a risk-based schedule. Conditio ns maintained to comply with CGMP requirements prov ide greater assurance of the quality of manufacturing o perations and the products that are produced at the facility. This longer BUD is not provided for mixed or diluted bio logical products because these activities are more likely to alter the characteristics of the biological product in wa ys that could harm patients, even if performed unde r CGMP conditions. To provide a sufficient basis for FDA to conclude that a longer BUD on a mixed or diluted p roduct was justified, an outsourcing facility would need to su bmit a BLA that included data on the impacts of dil uting or mixing the specific product. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 11 9. The mixed, diluted, or repackaged biological product is d istributed only in states in which the 370 facility mixing, diluting, or repackaging the biological pr oduct meets any applicable state 371 requirements. 372 373 10. If the biological product is mixed, diluted, or repackaged b y an outsourcing facility: 374 375 a.

The outsourcing facility reports serious adverse events to F DA that may be associated 431 with its mixed, diluted, or repackaged biological products. 432 433 C. Licensed Allergenic Extracts 434 435 FDA recognizes that there are circumstances in which licens ed allergenic extracts would be 436 mixed and diluted to provide subcutaneous immunotherapy to an indi vidual patient, even though 437 these allergenic extract combinations are not specified in the approved BLAs for the licensed 438 biological products. Such combinations are commonly referred to as prescription sets.22 For the 439 purpose of this guidance a prescription set is defined as a vial or set of vials of premixed licensed 440 standardized and non-standardized allergenic extracts for sub cutaneous immunotherapy diluted 441 with an appropriate diluent prepared according to instructi ons from a prescription or order by a 442 licensed physician for an individual patient. 443 20 Currently, FDA's electronic drug reporting system i s not configured to accept additional information t hat is specific to biological products, such as license nu mber. In the future, FDA intends to modify the syste m to accept this information. 21 FDA has issued a draft guidance for industry, Electronic Drug Product Reporting for Human Drug Co mpounding Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Fe deral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act , which prescribes how human drug compounding facilities are to submit dru g product reports to FDA. Although this guidance a ddresses reporting of compounded human drug products, outsou rcing facilities should follow the same procedure t o electronically report the biological products they mixed, diluted, or repackaged. 22 Under 21 CFR 610.17, licensed biological products m ust not be combined with other licensed biological p roducts; either therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic, exc ept as covered by a license obtained for the combin ed product. All mixes of allergenic extracts that are not prescript ion sets must be the subject of an approved BLA, or have in effect an investigational new drug application.

The prescription set is prepared in a in a physician's o ffice, state-licensed pharmacy, a 461 Federal facility, or outsourcing facility. 462 463 3. If the prescription sets are prepared in a physician's office, state-licensed pharmacy, or a 464 Federal facility (but not an outsourcing facility), each set i s prepared after (a) the receipt of a 465 valid prescription for an identified, individual patient d irectly from the prescribing 466 practitioner, patient, or patient's agent; or (b) a written order in a patient's chart, unless it is 467 prepared in advance of receipt of such a prescription or a w ritten order in a quantity that does 468 not exceed the expected demand for that prescription set withi n the BUD for the product, 469 based on a history of receipt of prescriptions or orders f or such a prescription set for that 470 time period. If the prescription sets are prepared in an outs ourcing facility, those sets are 471 prepared either after, or in anticipation of, receiving valid prescriptions for an identified, 472 individual patient or a written order in a patient's chart . 473 474 4. The prescription set is distributed to a physician or t o a health system for use within the 475 health system only after the receipt of a valid prescription for an identified, individual patient 476 or a written order in a patient's chart. 477 478 5. The prescription set is prepared in a way that does not confl ict with approved labeling of the 479 licensed biological products that are part of the prescript ion set. 24 480 481 6. The BUD for the prescription set is no later than the earl iest expiration date of any allergenic 482 extract or any diluent that is part of the prescription se t. 483 484 23 See note 12. 24 See note 15.Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 14 7.

The prepared prescription set is not sold or transferre d by an entity other than the entity that 491 prepared the prescription set. For purposes of this condition, a sale or transfer does not 492 include administration of a prescription set in a health ca re setting. 493 494 9. The prescription set is distributed 25 only in states in which the facility preparing the 495 prescription set meets any applicable state requirements. 496 497 10.

The outsourcing facility reports serious adverse events to F DA that may be associated 531 with its prescription sets. 532 533 26 FDA has issued a draft guidance for industry, Electronic Drug Product Reporting for Human Drug Co mpounding Outsourcing Facilities Under Section 503B of the Fed eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act , which prescribes how human drug compounding facilities are to submit dru g product reports to FDA. Once finalized, that gui dance will represent the Agency's thinking on that topic. Alt hough this guidance addresses reporting of compound ed human drug products, outsourcing facilities should follow the same procedure to electronically report the pr escription sets they prepared.

B. 538 539 Microbial challenge studies are designed to demonstrate that t he product in question does not 540 support adventitious microbial growth under the proposed stora ge conditions. Each facility 541 would conduct a microbial challenge study at least once for each mi xed, diluted, or repackaged 542 biological product, to demonstrate that the microbial quality of the biological product mixed, 543 diluted, or repackaged by that facility can be ensured. The m icrobial challenge study should be 544 repeated if the formulation or the container-closure system is changed. The studies should be 545 accurately documented and records maintained for inspection. 546 547 The challenge microbes should include the panel provided in USP<51> Antimicrobial 548 Effectiveness Testing. 27 These strains represent the species Escherichia coli ,Pseudomonas 549 aeruginosa ,Staphylococcus aureus brasiliensis (formerly 550 Aspergillus niger ). should also incorporate typical skin microflora and nosoc omial agents to 551 simulate the types of flora that may contaminate a drug produ ct in a healthcare setting. Finally, 552 the challenge should include strains of the tribe Klebsielleae , as they have been shown to 553 proliferate in infusion products. 28 554 555 Individual containers of the mixed, diluted, or repackaged bi ological product should be 556 inoculated with each challenge organism, with each container r eceiving one type of organism. 557 The inoculum size should be small but also measurable and repea table. For example, if a 558 membrane filtration method is used to quantify the number of org anisms, an inoculum size of 559 fewer than 100 CFU/mL is appropriate. 560 561 Following inoculation of the final product with the challenge organisms, the test units should be 562 stored at the temperature(s) described in the biological product's labeling. Samples should be 563 removed periodically throughout the duration of the study for d etermination of microbial count 564 for up to 72 hours (3 times the maximum BUD). To support a BUD o f 24 hours, each challenge 565 organism should demonstrate no increase from the initial count (where no increase is defined as 566 not more than 0.5 log10 unit higher than the initial inoculum at any time point up to 72 hours) 567 and no evidence of growth. As explained in the example below, d ata from a study of 72 hours' 568 duration should be examined for trending and to establish a maxim um storage time of up to 24 569 hours at a specified temperature. 570 571 Example: Determination of Microbial Growth 572 573 27 USP51/NF26.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft \u2014 Not for Implementation 17 The following table represents data from a hypothetical mic robial challenge experiment where 574 the inoculum is less than 100 CFU/mL, and the requested maximu m hold time is equivalent to 575 Time Point 4. 576 577 578 579 These data reflect no increase from the initial count through Time Point 4. However, as 580 illustrated in Figure 1 below, the semi-logarithmic graph of CFU/mL vs. Time shows clear 581 evidence of growth of the challenge organism at Time Point 4. 582 583 584 585 Thus, a maximum hold time equivalent to that of Time Point 4 woul d pose potential risk to the 586 microbiological quality of the hypothetical mixed, diluted, o r repackaged biological product, and 587 the acceptable BUD would be set at one-third of Time Point 3 . It is also important to note that, if 588 the experiment were concluded at Time Point 4, the ability to predict the trend of the data would 589 be lost. As presented in the graphic, the growth trend appears to signal the start of log-phase 590 growth, which could occur earlier or later with different str ains of a given species. Such growth 591 would produce exponential increases in the microbial popula tion that pose significant risk to 592 patients. This concern is the reason for periodic sampling wh en determining microbial 593 concentration. 594 TAB 3 ORIGINAL RESEARCH Allergen vial mixing and immunotherapy: Risks of infections and vial contamination P.

Injection immunotherapy en- joys a long history as an effective tool in treating allergic disease. Approximately 5 years ago, immunotherapy multidose vials came under greater scrutiny in regard to possible risk s of transmission of infection and the safety of immunother- apy prepared and dosed in an ofce setting was questioned. Three studies have subsequently examined the risk of infec- tion and vial contamination associated with immunother- apy vial mixing and injection performed in a physician's ofce. These studies have shown no evidence of increased infection risk from injection immunotherapy prepared in an otolaryngic allergy clinic. 2-4 The rst study retrospec- tively reviewed 26,795 injections and showed no evidence of infection. 2The second and third studies were prospec- tive, controlled, single-blinded studies looking at vials pre- pared in the ofce using sterile technique vs those prepared under a ventilation hood for any microbiological evidence of contamination. These studies found no signicant risk to patients with either preparation method. 3,4 135 International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, Vol. 2, No. 2, March/ April 2012 Gilbert et al. TABLE 1.

Positive controls in column headed \"1\" and negative con trols in column headed \"7.\" In the current study, we evaluate the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the additives used in the com- pounding of immunotherapy vials. Glycerin and phenol are the most commonly used immunotherapy vial additives in the United States. Glycerin is used to preserve antigenic potency, and phenol is contained in the saline used as a diluent in preparing injection immunotherapy vials. Previ - ous work has shown bactericidal properties of phenol and glycerin at singular concentrations of 0.22% and 1.27% (vol/vol), respectively. 5Our study builds upon this previ- ously published study by varying concentrations of phenol from 0.4% and glycerin from 0% to 25%, repre- sentative of concentrations used in clinical practice when mixing vials. Materials and methods Study vial preparation Glycerin, phenol, and a combination of these 2 im- munotherapy additives were prepared in varying concen- trations in 1.5-mL vials. The vials were then inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus , which was selected because it is a primary pathogen causing skin infections and is a skin-colonization organism. Glycerin solutions were prepared with the following the vials took place in the allergy clinic, under clean conditions without the use of ventilation hoods. Negative control vials without bacterial inoculation were made of 25% (Table 1.) The glycerin and phenol were obtained from Antigen Laboratories, Inc. (Liberty, MO). The glycerin set was prepared from a solution of 50% glycerin, 0.5% NaCl, 0.075% sodium citrate, 0.036% potassium phosphate, and 0.0567% sodium phosphate, which expired 4 years from the time of this study. The phenol set was prepared from a stock solution of 0.9% NaCl and 0.4% phenol, with an ex- piration date 2 years after the completion of our study. The glycerin/phenol set was prepared from a solution phosphate, and 0.0567% sodium phosphate that expired 2 years from the time of our study. These solutions were diluted with phosphate buffered salin e to achieve the desired concentrations for the study. Bacteria The vials were inoculated with 1 mL of a solution con- taining 5 \u00d710 5CFU/mL bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] strain #25923) and the vials were incubated at 37.4 C for 24 and 48 hours. At 24 hours, the vials were examined for visible turbidity, and optical densities were measured with a spectropho- tometer (Genesys 200; Thermo Fisher Scientic, Waltham, MA). The negative control solutions containing 25% glyc- erin, 0.4% phenol, and 25/0.4% glycerin/phenol without bacteria were used to calibrate the spectrophotometer. The study was done in triplicate, and colony counts of selected vials were made at 24 hours on Mueller-Hinton agar. The same was repeated at 48 hours, and the solutions in these vials were then examined for bacterial growth to determine bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the additiv es. Microdilution assay The second set of experiments was performed in which the single highest concentrations of glycerin (25%), phe- nol (0.4%), and glycerin/phenol a broth microdilution assay. Log dilutions of Staphylococcus aureus were prepared and introduced into wells of the plate containing the additives. The bacterial inocula used varie d from 1 to 1 \u00d710 5CFU per well. The test was performed in quadruplicate. At 24 hours the optical densities were measured and colony counts were performed on Mueller- Hinton agar. The same was repeated at 48 hours. Results Vials All inoculated vials showed visible turbidity. The optical densities and observed turbidity increased as the concen- trations of additives decreased (Fig. 1.) The negative con- trol solutions showed no visible turbidity, and the colony counts showed no growth. The highest concentration of the additives (glycerin, phenol, and their combination) ha d minimal visible turbidity, but demonstrated growth on sub- culture (Table 2).

From the broth microdilution assay, none of the wells showed visible turbidity, but some of the optical densities were above zero (Table 3.) At bacte- rial inocula of 1 \u00d710 3CFU/well or less, bactericidal effects were noted.

Discussion The results of the current study suggest that glycerin and phenol, common additives used in immunotherapy vial preparation, have bactericidal effects against Staphylococ- cus aureus , a common skin contaminant. These effects were TABLE 3. Microdilution assay 0 1\u00d710 00 0 0 Control 0 0 0 Optical densities of microdilution assay. The control wells received no inoculum.

Higher concentrations of additive exhibited increased antimicrobial activity. In clinical practice, the concentrations of glycerin and phenol in immunotherapy vials varies based on the num- ber of allergens present and the patient's status in the dose escalation process. Glycerin could conceivably range from as low as 0.0004% to 40%. Phenol content in mixed vials FIGURE 1. Allergy vials inoculated with bacteria. Turbidity increases as additive concentration decreases. 137 International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, Vol. 2, No. 2, March/ April 2012 Gilbert et al. ranges from 0.08% to 0.4%, though the majority contain 0.35% or higher. A common practice is to add glycerin to increase total glycerin content to a minimum of 10% in or- der to maintain potency of the allergens. However, increas- ing the glycerin content in immunotherapy vials to very high levels for bactericidal purposes might not be practica l, as levels of glycerin above 10% may provoke local site reac- tions after injection. While this would not affect the safet y of the patient, local reactions at the injection site prema- turely halt dose escalation for therapy and would prevent achieving an appropriate maintenance level. 6 The questions that arise in light of the results of our study areas are as follows: How are the current study results ap- plicable to clinical allergy immunotherapy vial mixing in the ofce? In particular, what bacterial load would typi- cally be introduced into an immunotherapy vial from con- tamination and a break in aseptic technique? The authors performed a literature review in order to see if data was available to answer what type of contamination 1 \u00d710 3 CFU would represent, which is the level at which in our study bactericidal effects were noted. Unfortunately, the authors could locate no such data in the existing literature . However, 1 recent study may shed some insight into this matter. Brunetti et al. 7cultured the palms and ngertips of healthcare personnel working in the surgical department and intensive care units. Imprints of healthcare workers' hands and ngertips were taken monthly during the morn- ing shift. This study found 75 to 80 CFU from the palms, and 62 to 70 CFU from all 5 ngertips in surgical and in- tensive care workers. If these numbers are representative of those preparing immunotherapy vials in the clinic, this may represent an estimate of the skin contamination to the rubber stoppers on the vials. The number of bacteria ac- tually introduced into the vial via a contaminated needle through the rubber stopper would likely be smaller than the amounts cultured directly from the hand of a health- care worker. Therefore, bactericidal activity against ino cu- lations from 1 \u00d710 2to 1 \u00d710 3CFU appears to be adequate activity against a reasonable skin contamination from the hands. This level of contaminant was shown in our study to be susceptible to the bactericidal properties of phenol and glycerin that were studied in the microdilution assays. It appears that the current method of compounding im- munotherapy vials in a physician's ofce using is safe. Pre- vious retrospective and prospective studies demonstrated no evidence of infection from the current practice. These studies included clinical evaluation of patients as well as evaluation of vial contents both at the beginning and end of their use. Our current study supports the nding of these previous studies, by demonstrating antibacterial ac - tivity of commonly used additives against levels of Staphy- lococcus aureus expected from skin contamination. When combining the results of our current study with the afore- mentioned prior studies of vial contamination and mix- ing practices, 2-4 it appears that current recommendations that immunotherapy vial mixing be performed using asep- tic technique without need for a ventilation hood are sup- ported by the literature. 8 Conclusion Glycerin and phenol independently demonstrated antimi- crobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus in this study. Glycerin-containing solutions exhibited better antibact erial properties than phenol alone. Higher concentrations of ad- ditive had improved bactericidal effects. The concentrati on of glycerin that showed the best bactericidal activity in ou r study may not be tolerated by some patients.

With that caveat, the survey data demonstrate variability among AAAAI members with interest in urticaria. The data presented show that clinicians are indeed prescribing thyroid hormone in some cases when increases of antithyroid antibody levels are found during diagnostic work- up, despite the lack of consensus regarding possible mechanism and conflicting data to date on the clinical effectiveness of thyroid hormone in this situation. Furthermore, there are minimal data on what dose of thyroid hormone to use in these patients (who are often clinically euthyroid) and no consensus as to what should be the target TSH level. Our ndings underscore a signicant need for further large-scale research in this area.

Similar methods have been used safely for nearly 100 years, going back to the time of Noon and Freeman. 2There are no reports in the medical literature of infections caused by immunotherapy injections. 3A retrospective study of immunotherapy records of 272 patients who received 26,795 injections over 6 years showed no evidence of infections caused by allergen immunotherapy injections. 4 The United States Pharmacopeia regulates compounded sterile preparations and in January 2004 issued regulations that would include stringent requirements for allergen immunotherapy mixing (use of a laminar flow biologic safety cabinet, positive- pressure room, and storage limited to 7-14 days after immuno- therapy mixing).1These requirements would have rendered immunotherapy impractical for the majority of patients. The Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology responded to these concerns, and standards for safely mixing allergen immunotherapy preparations were published in ''Aller- gen parameter second update'' 3and recently nalized. 5These standards include proper training of mixing personnel, oversight by physicians, inclusion of proper concentrations of glycerin or phenol for bacteriostasis, use of an aseptic technique, and refrigerated storage and that allergen immunotherapy is only intended for subcutaneous injection. Im- portantly, vials can be discarded according to the manufacturer's expiration dates (not 7-14 days after mixing), and there is no spe- cic requirement for a flow hood or positive-pressure environ- ment. The United States Pharmacopeia considered these guidelines during a public comment period and excluded allergen extracts from the more stringent standards of other compounded sterile preparations as long as certain standards are met, including sterile needle transfer of commercial allergen preparations, inclu- sion of appropriate bacteriostatic agents, use of multidose vials, use of an aseptic technique with handwashing, and use of gloves, hair covers, gowns, face masks, and disinfec- tion with alcohol.6 To provide further reassurance supporting the safety of our profession's current immunotherapy preparation mixing prac- tices, we report the results of 10 years of bacterial cultures performed on allergen immunotherapy vials. At our institution, allergen extracts are mixed by using an aseptic technique in a laminar flow hood in a room without positive-pressure ventila- tion. Gloves are worn during mixing, and vials are wiped with alcohol pads. As part of quality assurance monitoring, 20 vials are cultured each month. At the time of mixing, 0.5 mL is removed from a patient's 1:1 vol/vol and 1:1,000 vol/vol vials BD Vacutainer red-top blood collection tubes; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) by using an aseptic technique. These are stored at 4 8C for up to 30 days and submitted to the laboratory in a batch for culture. The clinical microbiology laboratory then transfers the contents of each tube to both a chocolate agar plate and a thio broth culture medium; therefore the sample collected from 1 vial is cultured by using 2 different methods. Both culture media are obtained from BD. TheJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 123, NUMBER 5LETTERS TO EDITOR 1175chocolate agar plates are cultured in a 5% CO 2environment, the thio broth is cultured in a non-CO 2-enriched environment for 3 days at 35 8C, and then results are reported. The chocolate agar is intended to culture for only aerobic organisms, whereas the thio broth cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. A total of 2,085 cultures were done between 1998 and the present, and 2,084 cultures were negative. Only 1 culture from 1999 grew Enterococcus species (representing <0.05% of all cul- tures). No information was available on whether the positive cul- ture extract had been administered to the patient. There have been no known cases of infections caused by allergen immunotherapy injections at our institution. The frequency of positive cultures at our center is even lower than that reported by Lay et al. 7In this study bacterial contamina- tion was compared between vials prepared either in an ofce set- ting by using an aseptic technique without a ventilation hood or under an International Organization of Standardization classica- tion 5 vacuum-ventilated hood in the hospital pharmacy. Three hundred twenty vials were prepared in the ofce, and 217 vials were prepared in the pharmacy (total 5537 vials). Two (0.6%) of 320 ofce-prepared vials and 1 (0.5%) of 217 pharmacy-pre- pared vials showed positive cultures for bacterial contamination. The 3 patients who received injections from the contaminated vials experienced no clinical infection. Our rate of contamination (1/2085 [0.048%]) compares favorably with their overall rate (3/537 [0.56%]). Mixing personnel at our center use an aseptic technique with gloves and alcohol pads under a laminar flow hood after proper handwashing but thus far have not worn gowns, face masks, or hair covers. Because our flow hood is conveniently available, we will continue to use it. However, a flow hood, gowns, face masks, and hair covers are not required by the present guidelines. 5 Cultures are also not necessarily recommended but were begun 10 years ago at our center as a reasonable means of quality assur- ance. The current guidelines recommend that mixing personnel qualify at least annually by performing a media-ll test. In conclusion, our nearly completely negative culture results over 10 years support the safety of our ofce-based allergen immunotherapy mixing practices at a tertiary referral center. Although most practicing allergists presumably do not use a flow hood for preparing allergen extracts, our data, combined with those of Lay et al 7(who demonstrated a very low rate of bacterial contamination without a flow hood), support the current allergen immunotherapy preparation guidelines in use by the allergy com- munity.5The allergen extract cultures are an imperfect (because of unknown in vivo correlation) but reasonable and practical marker for bacteriostatic safety. Periodic cultures could be con- sidered by any ofce or center preparing allergen extracts for sub- cutaneous immunotherapy as a method of ensuring quality assurance but are not required by the present guidelines (which recommend a media-ll test). Further studies performing cultures without a flow hood would further conrm the safety of mixing without a flow hood. It is especially reassuring that no clinical in- fections caused by allergen immunotherapy injections have ever been reported in the literature. Adrian G. Letz, MD Michael S. Tankersley, MD John P.

Because of their small airway diameters, young children are particularly susceptible to respiratory symptoms. In addition, allergic diseases are fre- quently primed in early childhood, and potential risk factors need to be avoided. For these reasons, we wished to analyze po- tential associations between current use of room disinfectants in private homes and respiratory, cutaneous, and allergic symptoms in young children. To this end, we performed an observational study in 4-year-old offspring from pregnant women participating in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial described in detail elsewhere. 4Briefly, the effects of increased intakes of a sh oil preparation (0.5 g of docosahex- aenoic acid and 0.15 g of eicosapentaenoic acid), 400 mg of 5- methyl-tetrahydrofolate, both, or placebo from the 22nd week of gestation until delivery and birth outcomes were assessed in the main trial. Thus a selection bias with respect to allergic dis- eases and use of room disinfectants would not be expected. Study centers were the University Hospital of Granada (Spain), the University of Pecs (Hungary), and the University of Munich (Germany). Three hundred eleven healthy women between 18 and 40 years of age with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies completed the study until delivery. Mothers who dropped out had a higher body mass index in the 20th week of gestation ( P<.02, Mann-Whitney Utest) compared with mothers who completed the study. This difference was no longer seen in the 30th week of gestation. From 270 women completing the study, 176 off- spring (all white; 43% total dropout rate) attended the clinic at J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MAY 20091176 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR TAB 7 Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Chase Lay Introduction The diagnosis and treatment of allergy in the eld of otolaryngology is important. Many of the disease pro- cessesseeninotolaryngologyclinicssuchasotitismedia, chronic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, and even Me \u00b4nie`re's States is usually subcutaneous injectable immunotherapy (SCIT). There are no reported cases of infection from SCIT, though the possibility exists. Itisessentialthatproperpreparationandhandlingtech- niques be employed when administering injectable immunotherapy. This article and nasal steroids are inadequate tially successful, allergen-SIT signicantly improves a patient's symptom prole and is the only intervention which can potentially cure the patient making it an essential part of any allergy physician's practice. The otolaryngologist can identify patients with potential allergy, who may notknowthey have allergyandsave the patient the expense of traveling to another physi- cian'sofceforallergymanagement.Byofferingallergy evaluation and therapy, the otolaryngologist provides a maximumvalue,'aonestopshop'formanypatientswith ear, nose, and throat disorders, which have an allergic component.The demand is quite high and growing in theeldofotolaryngology.Some10millionpatientsare treatedannuallywithSCITintheUnitedStatesalone [1 /C15].

VOLUME 106, JANUARY, 2011 77 TAB 10 Allergy immunotherapy: Reduced health care costs in adults and children with allergic rhinitis Cheryl S. Hankin, PhD, aLinda Cox, MD,bAmy Bronstone, and Fort Lauderdale-Davie, Fla Background: Research demonstrates signicant health care cost savings conferred by allergen-specic immunotherapy (AIT) to US children with allergic rhinitis (AR). Objective: We sought to examine whether AIT-related cost benets conferred to US children with AR similarly extend to adults. Methods: A retrospective (1997-2009) Florida Medicaid claims analysis compared mean 18-month health care costs of patients with newly diagnosed AR who received de novo AIT and were continuously enrolled for 18 months or more versus matched control subjects not receiving AIT. Analyses were conducted for the total sample and separately for adults (age >_18 years) and children (age <18 years). Results: Matched were 4,967 patients receiving AIT (1,319 adults and 3,648 children) and 19,278 control subjects (4,815 adults and $10,644, P< .0001) lower mean 18-month total health care costs than matched control subjects, with signicant savings observed within 3 months of AIT initiation. Compared with control subjects, signicantly lower 18-month mean health care costs were demonstrated overall (38%; $6,637 for patients receiving AIT vs $10,644 for control subjects, P< .0001), and for both (30%; controls, P< .0001). The magnitude of 18-month health care cost savings realized by AIT-treated adults and children did not signicantly differ ($4,397 vs $3,965, P5.435). Conclusions: Patients with newly diagnosed AR initiating AIT incurred signicantly lower health care costs than matched control subjects beginning 3 months after AIT initiation and continuing throughout the 18-month follow-up period. The signicant cost benets achieved by children with AR diagnoses who initiated AIT were also observed for adults with AR diagnoses who initiated AIT. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013;131:1084-91.)Key words: Allergic rhinitis, allergy immunotherapy, allergy immunotherapy, costs, health care use, Medicaid, matched cohort, retrospective, administrative claims Allergic rhinitis (AR), which affects approximately 1 in 5 persons in the United States, is associated with signicant clinical and economic burden. 1Those with AR can experience disturbed sleep, decreased energy, depressed mood, low frustration toler- ance, poor concentration, decrements in performance at school and work, and millions of lost work and school days annually. 2,3 In 2005, estimated total direct US costs of AR exceeded $11 bil- lion ($14 billion in 2011 1), with 60% of expenditures for prescrip- tion medications (the cost of over-the-counter medications was not assessed).4Additional billions of dollars are reportedly spent to treat conditions for which AR is a predisposing risk factor, such as asthma, sinusitis, and otitis media. 5 Subcutaneously administered allergen-specic immunothe rapy (AIT), which has just commemorated its centennial anniversary since itsrst use totreat allergies, 6isindicatedin the USfor the treat- ment of AR in patients with symptoms not adequately controll ed by medications and avoidance measures, or those experiencing unac- ceptable adverse effects of medications, or who wish to redu ce the long-term use of medications. 7AIT is distinguished from sympto- matic drug treatments by its unique potential to alter the co urse of allergic disease and thereby mitigate progression to asthm a 8-11 and development of new allergen sensitivities, 12-18 as well as to maintain efcacy after discontinuation of treatment. 12,18-25 The signicant cost savings conferred by AIT to US children with AR are well documented. 26-28In a 7-year (1997-2004) retro- spective claims analysis of Florida Medicaid-enrolled children (age <18 years) who were given new diagnoses of AR (with or without asthma) and who were naive to AIT, use and costs of phar- macy, outpatient, and inpatient services were signicantly reduced in the 6 months after versus preceding AIT initiation. 27 In a subsequent study, investigators examined 10 years (1997-2007) of Florida Medicaid claims data to compare health services use and costs between children with newly diagnosed AR who subsequently received AIT versus matched control sub- jects who did not receive AIT. 26 Compared with their matched counterparts, children who received AIT incurred signicantly lower median total, outpatient, and pharmacy costs during the 18 months after AIT initiation. These signicant health care sav- ings were evident within the rst 3 months of treatment initiation. The present analysis examined whether AIT-related cost benets demonstrated for children with AR extend to adults with AR diagnoses. To this effect, we examined 12 years of Florida Medicaid data as follows. 1. First, we compared health care use and costs of all targeted patients (adults and children) with newly diagnosed AR who received de novo AIT with matched control subjects with newly diagnosed AR who did not receive AIT.

Next, we conducted the same analyses described above for the adult (age > _ 18 years) and child (age <18 years) sub- groups to determine: A. whether previously reported AIT-related cost savings achieved by children with AR diagnoses (based on 10 years of data) held in this larger sample of children (based on 12 years of data); B. whether there were signicant differences in health care use and costs between adults with newly diag- nosed AR who received de novo AIT versus matched control subjects with newly diagnosed AR who did not receive AIT; and C. whether the magnitude of cost benets differed be- tween AIT-treated adults and children. METHODS Florida Medicaid dataset To expound on the ndings of our previous study in children enrolled in Florida Medicaid,26 we examined Florida Medicaid claims data for both chil- dren and adults from July 1, 1997, to June 30, 2009. Florida Medicaid provides access to health care for more than 2 million low-income children and adults annually. The Florida Medicaid Bureau of Medicaid Program Analysis pro- vides researchers with claims data that are patient deidentied and fully com- pliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule. Each patient-specic claim identies the date and type of health service provided, such as prescription drug lls (per National Drug Codes) or medical, surgical, or diagnostic procedures (Current Procedural Terminology). Each claim also includes patients' demographics (eg, sex, age, and race/ethnicity) and clinical information (primary and secondary diagnoses according to the International Classication of Disease, ninth edition [ICD-9]). Because our re- search was restricted to the use of existing and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant patient-deidentied claims data, it was ex- empt from institutional board review. Denition of terms ICD-9 codes 477.X identied the diagnosis of were by the atopic dermatitis, and 372.X for conjunctivitis. Patients with newly diagnosed AR were those who had no AR diagnoses in the year preceding their rst (' 'index' ') AR diagnosis. Patients who received de novo AIT were character- ized as those whose rst documented AIT claim followed (rather than pre- ceded) their index AR diagnosis and who received 2 or more administrations of AIT. Identication of matched samples Participants were Florida Medicaid enrollees who had a paid claim between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 2009. To identify the pool of eligible AIT-treated patients, we rst selected subjects with a diagnosis of AR. In subsequent steps, we retained only those who had newly diagnosed AR, received at least 2 administrations of de novo AIT, and had at least 18 months of continuous enrollment after AIT initiation. To identify the pool of eligible control sub- jects, we selected subjects with newly diagnosed AR who had not received AIT at any time during the study. As described in greater detail below, each eligible AIT-treated patient was matched with up to 5 control subjects. We re- quired that AIT-treated patients match to at least 1 control patient on all of the following 8 variables: demographics (age at rst AR diagnosis 66 months, sex, and race/ethnicity), comorbid illness burden (the Charlson Comorbidity Index),29 date of AIT initiation (' 'match date' and diagnoses of comorbid atopic conditions (asthma, atopic dermatitis, and conjunctivitis) during the year prior to AIT initiation (or match date). Matched control patients also were required to have at least 18 months of follow-up data from their match date. If an AIT-treated patient did not match to at least 1 control patient on all 8 matching variables, then that AIT-treated patient was excluded from fur- ther analysis. Because Florida Medicaid claims data do not provide informa- tion regarding the type of allergen or allergens to which patients had positive test results, we were not able to match on type of allergy. To ensure that any observed differences in outcomes were unattributable to differences in disease burden not associated with AR, we matched patients on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) in the year before AR diagnosis. 29 The CCI has been widely used by researchers to measure burden of disease and has been adapted for use with ICD-9-CM administrative claims databases. 30 Al- though originally designed to predict risk of 1-year mortality in hospitalized pa- tients,29 the CCI also signicantly predicts health care use and costs in primary care populations. 31,32The CCI is comprised of 19 conditions that are assigned weights according to 1-year risk of mortality. 29 The total score (range, 0-37) is calculated as the sum of theweighted items. 29 A score of 0 denotes no comorbid illness burden. 29 The developers of the CCI noted that, in most clinical studies, it will not be possible to stratify patients into more than 2 comorbidity groups. 29 They further recommended that the selection of cut points should vary depend- ing on the disease under investigation: if the disease investigated is associated with a low likelihood of mortality, a cut point of 1 or greater might be appropri- ate; if disease-related mortality is high, a cut point of 2 or greater or 3 or greater might be appropriate. 29 We used a score of 0 to 1 to characterize patients with no or mild comorbid disease burden and a score of 2 or greater for those with moderate-to-severe comorbid disease burden. Because the CCI might not sufciently assess the illness burden of IgE- mediated allergic illness, we further identied AIT-treated patients who had a diagnosis of other well-recognized atopic conditions (asthma, atopic derma- titis, and conjunctivitis) in the year before their rst AITadministration. These AIT-treated patients were matched to control subjects with similar diagnoses of atopy during a comparable period, as follows. We rst examined the AIT-treated patient sample to determine the date of each patient's index AR diagnosis and time elapsed until receiving administration of their index AIT. From the pool of matched control subjects, we established comparable periods from the dates of each control subject's index AR diagnosis. We then assessed for the presence of comorbid atopy in the year preceding this ' 'match date.' ' Excluded were control subjects who did not have at least 18 months of continuous enrollment after their match date and eligible AIT-treated patients who had no appropriate control group matches. In summary, we required that each patient in the AIT-treated group match with at least 1 patient in the control group on all 8 of the following variables: age at index AR, sex, race/ethnicity, CCI 1 year prior to rst AR diagnosis, date at AIT initiation, and comorbid atopic conditions (asthma, conjunctivitis, and atopic dermatitis) during the year prior to AIT initiation. Control patients who were matched on these variables also had to have at least 18 months of data after their match date. If an AIT-treated patient could not be matched on all 8 variables to at least 1 control patient, then that AIT-treated patient was excluded from further analysis. Overall, there were 3 matched cohorts of AIT-treated patients and control subjects: all patients, adults (age > _ 18 years) only, and children (age <18 years) only. Data analyses The Florida Medicaid Program provided data in 36 compressed text les, which we decompressed and imported for analysis by using SAS/STAT (version 7; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We compared groups on matching variables and health care use and outcomes by using pairwise comparisons J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 131, NUMBER 4HANKIN ET AL 1085within cohorts. Components of total health care use and costs included inpatient care, outpatient visits (inclusive and exclusive of AIT-related care), and prescription medication use. In general, health care use data are not normally distributed and tend to be heavily skewed to the right (ie, a few patients might have unusually high rates of health care use and costs that skew the aggregated data). To withstand violations in normal distribution, we used the generalized linear model with log link and gamma variance functions to compare mean per-patient health care use and costs in patients with newly diagnosed AR who subsequently received de novo AIT and matched control subjects who did not receive AIT. 33 The SAS/STAT GENMOD procedure with generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to t the model, with correlated response for comparisons of health care outcomes between AIT-treated patients and matched control subjects. Because comparisons of the magnitude of cost savings for AIT-treated adults versus children did not involve correlated data, we used the GENMOD procedure without GEE for these analyses. Outcomes for AIT-treated patients and matched control sub- jects were compared for all patients, adults only, and children only. General- ized linear model with GEE also compared mean 18-month per-patient AIT-related cost savings (with positive values indicating lower mean costs for AIT-treated versus control patients) for adults versus children. RESULTS Characteristics of samples Fig 1 displays the results of the sample identication proce- dures. Among all Florida Medicaid enrollees (n 57,524,231), among whom there were 3,330,245 adults and 4,193,986 chil- dren, 5.8% (436,373/7,524,231) received a diagnosis of AR; among the 307,809 enrollees with newly diagnosed AR, 2.7% (8,370) received de novo AIT. Adult Medicaid enrollees were 62% less likely than child Medicaid enrollees to receive a diagno- sis of AR (odds ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.379-0.384; P< .0001) and 1.3 times more likely to initiate de novo AIT (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.23-1.36; P< .0001). Overall, there were 5,760 AIT-treated patients and 297,178 control subjects eligible for matching; from this pool, 4,967 AIT- treated patients were matched to 19,278 control subjects (793 did not match to control subjects on all 8 of the requisite matching variables and were therefore excluded from further analysis). Among adults, 1,678 AIT-treated Eligible for matching: Had 18 months of continuous enrollment after first AIT administration All: N=5,760 Adults: 1,678 Children: 4,082 Had <18 AIT administration All: N=2,610 Adults: 720 Children: Adults: 3,224,865 Children: 3 ,862 ,993 No AR diagnosis in year preceding index (first) AR diagnosis All: N=307,809 Adults: 73,358 Children: 234,451 AR diagnosis in the year preceding index diagnosis or <1 year of data before index diagnosis All: N=128,564 Adults: 32,022 Children: 96,542 Had diagnosis All: N=707 Adults: 309 Children: 398 No All: N=307,102 Adults: 73,049 Children: 234,053 Had N=8,370 Adults: 2,398 Children: Children: hundred ninety-three AIT-treated patients (359 adults and 434 children) could not be matched on all 8 variables to at least 1 control patient and were therefore ex- cluded from further analysis. Note: The 8 matching variables were: age at index AR diagnosis ( 66 months), sex, race/ethnicity, CCI, date at AIT initiation, and 3 comorbid atopic conditions (asthma, APRIL 20131086 HANKIN AL subjects were eligible for matching, and 1,319 AIT-treated patients were matched to 4,815 control subjects (359 AIT- treated adults did not match to control subjects on all 8 of the requisite matching variables and were therefore excluded). Eli- gible children included 4,082 AIT-treated patients and 227,095 control of these 3,648 AIT-treated children were matched to 14,463 control subjects (434 did not match to control subjects on all 8 of the requisite matching variables and were therefore excluded). The majority of the 1319 adults in the AIT-treated matched sample were female (86.2%) and of nonwhite race/ethnicity (53.7%); mean age at initial AR diagnosis was 47.3 (SD, 17.3) years. In the year before their initial AR diagnoses, most (96%) of these adults experienced no or mild comorbid disease burden, and rates of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and conjunctivitis were 23%, 0%, and 5.3%, respectively. The 3648 children in the AIT-treated matched sample were predominantly male (57.3%) and of non- white race/ethnicity (74.5%); mean age at initial AR diagnosis was 7.6 (SD, 3.9) years. In the year before their initial AR diagnoses, the majority (99.8%) of these children experienced no or mild comorbid disease burden, and rates of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and conjunctivitis were 51.1%, 5.7%, and 14.0%, respectively. We conducted supplementary analyses to examine whether the demographic and comorbid illness characteristics of the 4967 matched AIT-treated adults and children differed from those of 793 AIT-treated patients for whom we found no matches and who were therefore excluded. Matched AIT-treated patients were signicantly ( P< .0001) more likely to be female and non-Hispanic white and to have less comorbid illness burden (CCI) in the year before their AR diagnosis and in the year before AIT initiation than unmatched subjects (data not shown). With re- gard to pre-existing atopy, although matched AIT-treated patients were signicantly ( P<.0001) less likely to receive a diagnosis of comorbid asthma, they were signicantly more likely to receive diagnoses of atopic dermatitis or conjunctivitis compared with AIT-treated patients who could not be matched. We returned to our primary research question to examine the overall comorbid disease burden (CCI) and specic respiratory illness burden experienced by the adult and child AIT-treated and matched control groups in the year before AIT initiation (or a comparable period for control subjects). As shown in Table I ,compared with matched control subjects, adults and children who subsequently received AIT experienced signicantly less overall comorbid disease burden in the year before AIT initia- tion. Whereas acute respiratory tract infections occurred signif- icantly more frequently among matched controls, rates of other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as sinusitis, nasal polyps, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allied condi- tions, and other respiratory system diseases, such as pleurisy (in children), were signicantly higher among AIT-treated patients.

The mean 18-month per-patient cost of AIT was $547 for the combined sample; these costs were signicantly lower for adults than children ($311 vs $632, P< .0001) because of the higher number of AITadministrations received by children. Health care use and costs: Combined sample Table II shows the 18-month mean health care use and costs for the combined (adult and child) sample. Patients with newly diag- nosed AR who initiated AIT had signicantly fewer inpatient stays and outpatient visits excluding AIT but more pharmacy lls over 18 months. These patients also incurred 38% lower total 18-month health care costs ($6,637 vs $10,644, P< .0001), as well as signicantly lower costs for outpatient, and pharmacy services (34%, 52%, and 10%, respectively).Fig 2 compares the mean per-patient total health care costs for the combined sample of AIT-treated patients and their matched control subjects at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up.

AIT-treated adults did not differ from control subjects in the number of pharmacy lls and costs, but AIT-treated children incurred signicantly lower pharmacy costs (despite a signicantly higher number of prescrip- tion lls) than their matched counterparts. Similar to ndings noted for the combined sample, signicant differences (P<.0001) in mean total health care costs among adults and chil- dren separately occurred at 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up. Magnitude of cost savings: AIT-treated adults versus children Table V compares mean 18-month AIT-related cost savings for adults and children. The mean 18-month total per-patient health care cost savings achieved by AIT-treated adults did not signi- cantly differ from that observed for children ($4,397 vs $3,965, P5.435). The mean 18-month per-patient cost savings for outpa- tient visits achieved by AIT-treated children was almost 3 times greater ($2,342 vs $811, P< .0001) than that achieved by AIT-treated adults. DISCUSSION Recent research using retrospective administrative claims data to examine the real-world outcomes of AR has consistently documented the signicant economic benets of AIT for children. In the present study we sought to extend this research to US adults with AR. Most notably, we found compelling cost benets for AIT among US adults with AR that paralleled the benets seen in children. Signicant AIT-related cost savingswere observed within 3 months of treatment initiation and persisted throughout the 18-month follow-up for the combined sample, as well as for adults and children separately. Findings demonstrated at 3 months in our study are consistent with research showing signicantly reduced allergy symptoms within 12 to 14 weeks of AIT initiation. 34-36 As a well-established, effective, and safe treatment for AR, AIT offers the potential for long-term effectiveness and preventive effects. Notwithstanding these potential benets and despite evidence of patient dissatisfaction with symptomatic drug treat- ments for AR,2,37only 2% to 9% of US patients an AR diag- nosis receive AIT, 27,37-39and a preponderance of patients who initiate AIT are likely to prematurely discontinue treat- ment.27,39-43Such underuse of AIT might result in suboptimal health outcomes among patients with AR. Barriers to AIT access, which likely contribute to its underuse, include the disinclination of primary care providers, who are usually the initial point of contact for adults and children with AR,37 to refer potential AIT candidates to allergy specialists. Lack of training in allergy/immunology during residency 44 and concerns regarding the loss of autonomy of patient care 45 have been identied as barriers to generalists' use of allergy specialist referral. On the basis of the superior outcomes seen among pa- tients with respiratory allergy treated by allergy specialists versus generalists,46-53interventions that encourage collaboration be- tween generalists and specialists could foster wider use of AIT. Several limitations of our research should be mentioned. First, despite the matching procedures used, groups might have differed in ways other than exposure to AIT that affected observed cost differences. Although we matched patients on the presence of allergy-related comorbid disease, including asthma, before AIT initiation, it is possible that patients who received AIT had more poorly controlled asthma, which might have increased costs because of more frequent use of asthma-related emergency visits and hospitalizations. However, this seems unlikely because poorly controlled asthma is a relative contraindication for AIT because of the risk of anaphylaxis. 7In addition to our primary, matched co- hort analysis, we subsequently examined whether the AIT-treated and control groups, each in aggregate, differed by overall disease and respiratory illness burden in the year preceding AIT initiation (or comparable period for controls). This supplementary analysis showed that, compared to the control group, the AIT-treated group experienced signicantly less overall comorbid disease burden, but greater respiratory illness burden, in the year preceding AIT initiation. How these differences might have affected cost out- comes is unknown, but AIT might have indirectly improved clin- ical and cost outcomes because the regimen requires regular and ongoing health care visits, which afford opportunities to address other health issues, including nonallergic respiratory conditions. In addition, although the validity of the CCI has been more exten- sively studied than other comorbidity measures 54 and was used as a measure of comorbidity in a cost study of children's asthma, 55 it has not been validated in a pediatric population. Therefore despite attempts to control for illness burden, the health status of groups might have differed and influenced use and cost outcomes. Second, the retrospective nature of this study prohibits den- itive conclusions about causality and introduces the possibility of bias. Regarding the latter, patients who elect to engage in the demands of AIT might be a more compliant group than those who do not elect to receive AIT. Given this proclivity, AIT-treated patients who receive allergy medications or recommendations for allergen avoidance might have derived greater clinical benet and incurred lower costs than their counterparts who do not elect to receive AIT. We are currently conducting follow-up research to examine these complex issues more fully. We also acknowledge that many AIT-treated patients received fewer administrations than required to achieve maximum and long-lasting clinical benet. Studies have demonstrated signicant reductions in allergy symptoms after only 12 to 14 weeks of AIT, even though the greatest benets are seen after the maintenance dose is achieved and maintained for at least 1 year. We are currently conducting additional analyses to examine the relationship between the frequency and duration of AIT and health outcomes. Third, there are limitations regarding the generalizability of ndings. Because this study involved Medicaid enrollees, nd- ings might not apply to broader patient populations. In addition, excluded unmatched cases had a greater comorbid illness burden and higher prevalence of comorbid asthma than matched cases. Therefore ndings might not generalize to populations that are comprised of more seriously ill patients with AR who initiate AIT. Fourth, although pollen seasons in southern states, such as Florida, tend to begin earlier and last longer than those in northern states, a recent study demonstrated that the ragweed pollen season has lengthened in northern states while remaining stable in southern states, most likely because of climate change. 56 Because of the longer pollen season in southern states, mean medical costs for patients with AR in this study might be higher than those for similar patients living in cooler climates; however, the length of the pollen season should not influence the magnitude of cost dif- ferences observed between AIT-treated and control patients. Fifth, claims data might include missing, imprecise, or incor- rect codes, although it is unlikely that such errors would system- atically differ across cohorts.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 4HANKIN ET AL 1089Sixth, because the follow-up period was limited to 18 months, results might underestimate the long-term clinical and economic benets associated with AIT, considering its potential to reduce the risk of asthma, 10,11,57one of the most common and costly chronic US childhood and adult diseases. 58 Finally, given the limitations of claims data, we were unable to estimate the societal burden of AR associated with lost produc- tivity and patients' out-of-pocket expenditures (eg, for over-the- counter medications) to treat AR. In light of its high prevalence and signicant effect on job and school performance, the indirect costs of AR are substantial and exceed those of other costly chronic diseases, including asthma, diabetes, and coronary heart disease.59 This study constitutes the rst demonstration of signicant cost benets associated with AIT among US adults, who experienced comparable overall AIT-related cost savings compared with those seen in children. Our research approach is consistent with the call for comparative effectiveness research that reflects real-world interventions and provides public health guidance regarding the effective care of high-cost, widely prevalent, and preventable diseases.60 Because new and likely more expensive symptomatic drug treatments for AR and asthma proliferate, it might be wise to rst benchmark the clinical and cost benets offered by AIT. On the basis of the growing evidence of the efcacy, safety, and cost benets of AIT, implementation of coordinated efforts to remedi- ate modiable barriers to AIT access, adoption, and adherence could increase appropriate use of this disease-modifying treat- ment and ultimately reduce the public health burden of AR and AR-related disease progression. We thank Drs David Lang and Richard Lockey for their valuable comments on a draft of this manuscript. Clinical implications: Comparable, statistically signicant health care cost benets were achieved by children and adults with a diagnosis of AR who initiated AIT. Benets appeared within 3 months of treatment initiation and continued through the 18-month follow-up. REFERENCES 1. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI). The allergy report.
