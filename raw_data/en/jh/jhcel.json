With a robust immune system we are much better equipped to overwhelm and repel any exposure to these potentially harmful influences. In this regard, we can all agree about the amazing immune boosting benefits of hot springs bathing. The purpose of this document is to explore the various ways that botanicals can be integrated into the hot springs bathing experience to supplement and activate optimal wellness benefits. Suggestions for botanical integration include: Medicinal Herb Garden Aroma Bathing and Showers On-sight Distillation and Infusions Educational workshops and retail experiences Spa therapy While a proper medicinal garden requires time to develop, the integration of essential oils proven to have an immune boosting effect could be immediately introduced into the hot spring environment through diffusion in public areas of the hot springs, in saunas, herbal bath preparations and in spa treatments. Those essential oils known to have immune boosting benefits would include, but are not limited to: Eucalyptus Essential Oil Tea Tree Essential Oil Cinnamon Essential Oil Breath of Australia Oil Blend EVIDENCE FOR IMMUNE BOOSTING BENEFITS OF ESSENTIAL OILS The evidence for the immune boosting benefits of botanicals is substantial. 1 Best oils for the influenza virus: Studies involving essential oils such as bergamot, eucalyptus, geranium, cinnamon, lemongrass and thyme demonstrated all of them to be extremely effective against influenza virus after only 10-30 minutes of exposure. 2 While cinnamon possessed the most potent anti-influenza activity in both liquid and vapour form, all of the studies concluded that the vapourised form of essential oils displayed the most prominent and effective antiviral and antimicrobial effects. In this regard, Eucalyptus displayed the most significant activity against influenza virus after only 10 minutes, while the other essential oils showed activity after 30 minutes. Additionally, the essential oil vapours studied displayed no measurable adverse effect on lung epithelial cells. 2 An Australian study demonstrated that vapourised tea tree oil was also very effective as an antiviral for airborne influenza virus. The study found tea tree oil was able to achieve complete virus inactivation and concluded that tea tree oil in a mist spray may also be used on a filter surface (such as a face mask or air conditioning filter) to achieve optimal antiviral activity . 3 Herbal Antibiotics: plant medicine has an important role to play in protecting against and treating 'superbugs'. As the United States Center of Disease Control has made clear , antimicrobial 4 resistance is one of the biggest global health threats facing humanity now and in the future to come. Our reliance on antibiotics and the overuse as a result has not led to a healthier population but rather to widespread antibiotic resistance and a breakdown of the human immune system. A return to a more simple immune system building approach, using herbal antibiotics and botanicals, is perhaps the most timely and responsible measure we can take in order to safeguard our health and of the generations yet to come. 5 1 Lesley Braun and Marc Cohen Herbs & Natural Supplements - An evidence based guide 2 Vimalanathan S et al.

A.Jones FOOD BOWL - MEDICINAL HERB & SPICE GARDEN + HEALING FOREST All of the following have immune boosting properties. * marks the ones with the most evidence based research supporting their benefits. Incorporating indigenous medicine with herbs native to the hot springs area is also recommended. IMMUNE BOOSTING HERBS Astragalus Astragalus zeylanicum Eucalyptus* Eucalyptus alternifolia PRODUCE FROM THE HERB & SPICE GARDEN + FOREST The produce can be used as herbal teas, healing foods, bathing infusions and in the sauna. With extraction and distillation equipment they can also be made into essential oils, tinctures and hydrosols. The herbs and spices stimulate the immune system and teach the body to combat illness more effectively. Herbal Teas - fresh and dried Immune Boosting Herbal Tea Combinations: Lemon Ginger Echinacea Turmeric Lemon Myrtle Thyme Tulsi Oregano etc E.g.

GLOBAL COLLABORATION POTENTIAL Each region of our wonderfully diverse world has its own unique terroir. This has allowed a vast variety of plants to develop, adapt and thrive with healing benefits stimulated by that environment. Knowledge of this is the basis of indigenous plant wisdom, folk medicines and the well developed traditions of Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine. Aromatherapy and the use of essential oils is one of the ways the unique benefits stimulated in plants from different regions can be passed on to benefit us wherever we are in the world. Likewise herbal teas, tinctures and the collective sharing of knowledge are other powerful ways. We are inspired by the potential for collectively coming together to create customised experiences based on the rich history and cultural knowledge of different regions and the co-promotion of these principles. At the macro level, we would be developing a global immune boosting culture that connects all of the collaborating international hot springs locations. At the micro level, this offers a fantastic opportunity to feature the unique cultural heritage and traditional healing knowledge that each property would feature while tying it to this global initiative. This can then be shared with the international community, enriching the experience of hot springs users everywhere.

Founder and Formulator Synthesis Organics Head office: Byron Bay, Australia theme@synthesisorganics.com +61 400 345 148 WHY CHOOSE SYNTHESIS ESSENTIAL OILS? The Synthesis Organics Essential Oil Collection stand out for the following reasons, all of which contribute to their unsurpassed therapeutic and energetic quality: Certified Organic - beyond food and therapeutic grade This means that no synthetic fertilisers, pesticides or additives have compromised what nature intended. Plants are grown in healthy soil and clean water and many studies have shown a higher nutrient content in organically grown produce. We often hear that other essential oils may not be organic, but they are natural. Sadly however, these days 'natural' can be compromised with chemicals used in its farming. An organic apple vs a natural apple is much cleaner to eat as the 'natural' apple is most often sprayed with chemical pesticides and grown with chemical fertilisers. We choose to eat the organic apple so as not to risk bringing those chemicals the apple has been exposed to into our bodies. Likewise, many plants used to make essential oils are exposed to pesticide sprays used on flowers and fruits and artificial fertiliser used in the soil. These chemicals compromise the integrity of the raw materials used to make essential oils, and thus the essential oils themselves. As essential oils can travel quickly into our cells, brain and blood, Synthesis essential oils are Certified Organic to ensure they are not tainted with artificial chemicals in any way. \"If you are serious about Wellness, you must choose Certified Organic.\" Professor Marc Cohen (Founding Board Member Global Wellness Summit) 100% Pure and traceable to seed - Third Party Audited This means Synthesis Organic essential oils are unadulterated with any fillers, thinners or other substitute oils and this is all third-party verified and audited, so you don't just have to take our word on it. This purity and quality is verified by independent Gas Chromatography (GC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) tests. Adulterated oils have little to no therapeutic value and can actually be harmful. Unfortunately, the adulteration of oils is more common than you would expect; According to the Lavender Growers Association, there is 100 times more of this oil exported from France each year than is actually grown there - which means most French Lavender sold must be adulterated in some way. Note: \"French export data shows that 250 tons of so-called Fine Lavender are exported annually. The statistics of the Association of Lavender Growers in Volx show that less than 20 tons are in fact distilled. Ironically, this glaring fraud is obvious to those who can read the gas chromatograms, ostensibly recorded to demonstrate purity. Generally, neither local vendor nor customer can read the chromatogram, but both associate proof of authenticity with its sheer existence. In reality, most Lavender chromatograms passed around in the marketplace prove adulteration.\" ~ Kurt Schnaubelt, PhD (2011) \"Healing Intelligence of Essential Oil: The Science of Advanced Aromatherapy\" Therapeutic quality sourced sustainably from optimal terroir The founder of Synthesis Organics is a qualified Aromatherapist and ensures only the highest quality of essential oils are selected, that are obtained from organic fields all over the earth, according to their botanical species and natural chemical composition, which ultimately determines their effectiveness in any application. For example, Rose Otto grown in the Valley of the Roses Bulgaria has the highest therapeutic components we have found and so we always source from there. This is due to unique soil and climate conditions. Energy Imbued\u00ae All of our products, including the individual essential oils, are refined and harmonised through our proprietary Energy Imbued\u00ae Process. This energetically cleanses, harmonises and optimises the function of each plant, enhancing receptivity for the end user. This difference can be demonstrated through a number of tests and measurements. Many of our global customer's comment on the difference, especially when using the oils for mental, emotional and spiritual healing, and only use Synthesis essential oils now. "}
