The core of chiropractic usually involves treatment of common lower back pain conditions through manual therapy: Spinal manipulation and manual manipulation. It is also commonly known as \"chiropractic adjustment\". The goal of most chiropractic techniques is to restore or enhance joint function while resolving joint inflammation and reducing pain. This hands-on therapy is often used to treat neck or back injuries but also relieves pain throughout the joints and muscles in the body. A chiropractor can realign and manipulate the bones of the wrist back into its proper aligned state, thus reducing tension on the surrounding ligaments, tendons, and muscles. When a bone is out of place these connective tissues can become inflamed as it tries to overcompensate for the misalignment. A wrist adjustment performed by a chiropractor can aid the body to naturally heal itself by increasing blood circulation to the injured area and help relieve tension off the nerves to ultimately reduced pain, increase the range of motion and speed recovery time.
