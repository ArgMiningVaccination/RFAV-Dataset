PDO Threads are a revolutionary new aesthetic treatment for lifting sagging skin, tightening the look of jawlines & jowls, and creating a bright, open eye. While Botox and fillers are wonderful options for relaxing expression lines and adding volume to the face, PDO Threads are the ideal option for people looking for a non-surgical facelift. PDO Threads provide an instant lift as well as stimulate collagen production for long-term benefit. With little to no downtime, treatment with PDO threads can turn back the hands of time and help you look refreshed & rejuvenated. PDO Thread Lift FAQs [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2023-08-20T15:14:57+00:00 Results are often noticeable immediately after the procedure, but the full effects become more apparent as collagen production increases over the following weeks. Optimal results can be seen within 2 to 3 months. [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2023-08-20T15:13:50+00:00 Recovery time is minimal. Some patients might experience mild swelling, bruising, or discomfort for a few days. You can resume regular daily activities shortly after the procedure, but it's recommended to avoid strenuous exercise for about two weeks. You should avoid any face treatments (facials, chemical peels etc) as well as dental work, massage, and chiropractic for 4 weeks to allow the threads to settle and integrate. [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2023-08-20T15:11:22+00:00 PDO threads are inserted into the skin using blunt cannulas. Once inserted, the small barbs on the threads create a support structure that helps lift and tighten the skin and deep fat pads of the face. Think of PDO threads as scaffolding for the deeper face structure. Over time, the threads dissolve, leaving behind improved skin texture and increased collagen production. [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2021-11-28T16:32:34+00:00 PDO threads are suitable for a wide array of people including all skin tones, textures, and age groups. They are most effective on people who have some lax skin they would like to lift and tighten and are especially effective for nasolabial lines, jowls, and jawlines. People with a lot of loose or sagging skin may not notice as dramatic of benefits as someone with mild to moderate laxity since the skin is not being removed, just lifted (It has to go somewhere!) [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2021-11-28T16:37:39+00:00 The PDO threads will begin to dissolve after about 4-6 months. However, their effects last much longer than 4-6 months in most people. This is because the threads stimulate collagen production in the area they were placed, which remains long after the threads dissolve. In many cases, the results of a PDO thread lift last up to two years. [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2021-11-28T16:35:39+00:00 Immediately after your PDO thread lift, you will notice an instant lift in the area treated. However, you will likely be swollen and could notice bruising and/or puckering. These are all to be expected! Although you will notice an immediate difference after your thread lift, it takes about 2-4 weeks for your treatment area to heal, and a total of 5 weeks for you to see the full effect of your thread lift. [Onyx Team](https://onyxintegrative.com/author/onyx-integrative/)2022-05-17T20:44:45+00:00 The cost of PDO threads in Arizona vary based on the following factors: - The clinic's location. Some areas of the state, such as Scottsdale, are generally more expensive vs. Gilbert where PDO thread lift prices are typically less expensive - Who is performing the thread lift. This factor may or may not affect the price of PDO thread lifts. Typically plastic surgeons or dermatologists will charge higher prices than naturopathic doctors or nurses, however, this is not always the case. - Treatment areas & the number of threads. The cost of your PDO thread lift will depend on how many threads are placed, and how many sections of the face are treated. The more threads and treatment areas, typically the more it will cost. We price our PDO thread lifts per area. Areas are the forehead/eyes; the midface; the lower face/jawline; the neck. Each area (which includes both the right and left sides) ranges in price from $1000 $1,200. A full face thread lift (2-3 areas) costs (on average) between $2,500 to $3,500 Browse our selection of Vitamin IV's below starting at only $125 Vitamin IVs Vitamin Booster Shot Menu Vitamin shots are a quick and easy way to get a mega-dose of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids.
