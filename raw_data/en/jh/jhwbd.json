Reviews of evidence regarding intervention s to improve vaccination covera ge in children, adolescents, and adults. Am J Prev Med 2000;18(1 Suppl.):97-140. Abstract : This paper presents the results of systematic reviews of the effectiveness, applicability, other effects, economic impact, and barriers to use of selected population-based interventions intended to improve vaccination coverage. The related systematic reviews are linked by a common conceptual approach. These reviews form the basis for recommendations by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force) regarding the use of these selected interventions. The Task Force recommendations are presented on pp. 92-96 of this issue. 2. Hawksley B, Carnwell R, Callwood I. A literature review of the pu blic health roles of health visitors and school nurses. Br J Community Nurs 2003;8(10):447-54. Abstract: This paper describes a two-stage review relating to the family-centred public health role of health visitors and the child-centred public health role of school nurses. During the first stage, literature was searched using CINAHL and Medline da tabases and two models were used to frame the literature analysis. The findings of this analysis were, however, disa ppointing. Although many policy documents advocate development of the family-centred publ ic health role of health visitors and the child-centred public health role of school nurses, there was no overwhelming evidence of reports of these approaches in health visiting and school nursing practice. The second stage of the re view comprised a content analysis of West Midlands community trusts' strategic development plans. Sevent een plans were analysed. Of these, only two were 'formal' plans, the remainder bein g fragmented documentation related to plans for the development of health visiting and school nursing services. It may be concluded from the analysis that NHS trusts are beginning to adopt ideas from the rh etoric of national policy docume nts. Additionally, public health practice initiatives form an integrated part of mo st of the trust strategic development plans that the researchers examined. HJEMMEBES\u00d8K 1. Bennett C, Macdonald G, Dennis JA, Coren E, Patterson J, Astin M, et al. Home-based support for disadvantaged adult mothers. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008 Issue 1 . Art. CD003759. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003759.pub3. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Babies born to socio-economically disadvantaged mothers are at higher risk of a range of problems in infancy. Home visiting progra ms are thought to improve outcomes, both for mothers and children, largely through advice and support. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of home visiting programmes for women who have recently gi ven birth and who are socially or economically disadvantaged. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tr ials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006); EMBASE (1980 to 2006 week 12); CINAHL (1982 to March week 4 2006 ); PsycINFO (1872 to March week 4 2006); ASSIA (1987 to March 2006); LILACS (1982 to March 2006); and Sociological Abstracts(1963 to March 2006). We searched grey literature using ZETOC (1993 to March 2006); Dissertation Abstracts International (late 1960s to 2006); and SIGLE (1980 to March 2006). We also undertook communication with published authors about ongoing or unpublishe d research. SELECTION CRITERIA: Included studies were randomised controlled trials in vestigating the efficacy of home vi siting directed at disadvantaged adult mothers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers (EC and JP or CB) independently assessed titles and abstracts identified in the search for eligibility. Data were extracted and entered into RevMan (EC, JP and CB), synthesi sed and presented in both written and graphical form (forest plots). Outcomes included in this review were established at the protocol stage by an international steering group. The review does not report on all outcomes reported in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies with 4751 participants in th is review. Data show no statistica lly significant differences for those receiving home visiting, either for maternal outcomes (maternal depression, anxiety, the stress associated with parenting, parenting skills, child abuse risk or potential or breastfeeding) or child outcomes (preventive health care visits, psychosocial heal th, language development, behaviour problems or accidental injuries. Evidence about uptake of immunisations is mixed, and the data on child maltreatment difficult to interpret. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review sugge sts that for disadvantaged adult women and their children, there is currently no evidence to support the adoption of home visiting as a means of improving maternal psychosocial health, parenting or outcomes for children. For reasons 7 Resultat discussed in the review, this does not amount to a conclusion that home visiting programmes are ineffective, but indicates a need to think carefully about the problems th at home visiting might influence, and improvements in the conduct of outcome studies in this area. HOME VISITING FOR DISADVANTAGED ADULT MOTHERS: Babies born to so cio-economically disadvantaged mothers are at higher risk of a range of problems in infancy. Home visiting refers to a wide variety of interventions, delivered in a variety of ways, within different policy contexts and target ed at different populations, with advice and support usually included . Programmes may be provided by pr ofessionals (usually nurses) or para-professionals. This review aimed to assess the e ffectiveness of home visiting programmes as a means of improving outcomes for socio-economically disa dvantaged adult mothers and their infants. Eleven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for the review, in which a total of 4751 mothers were enrolled. This review suggests that, for disadvantaged adult women and thei r children, there is currently no evidence to support the adoption of home visiting as a means of improving maternal psychosocial health, parenting or outcomes for children. For reasons disc ussed in the review, this does not amount to a conclusion that home visiting prog rammes are ineffective, but indicates a need to think carefully about the problems that home visiting might influence and impr ovements in the conduct of outcome studies in this area. 2.

Semin Perinatol 1995;19(4):263-71. Abstract: This review of eight randomized controlled trials assessed two different types of home visits during pregnancy: (1) those offering social support to high-risk women; and (2) those providing medical care to women with complications. In both categories, pregnancy outcome was not improved when women received home visits. The summary o dds ratio for preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.1). Nor did the home visits decrea se the rate of hospital admission for women with complications (mainly threatened preterm labor or toxemia); the corresponding summary odds ratio was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7 to 1.2). Nevertheless in some trials home visits had positive effects on wo men (medical knowledge, support levels, health habits, and satisfaction). The randomized controlled trials provide little evidence that programs offering home visits are effective in improving either pregnancy outcome or the use of health services. A better integration of hospital and ho me services might allow a more rational use of health services for women with complications. In addition, we need to define more precisely the content of home visits providing social support. For this, further research is required on how emotional su pport, health education, and advice influence the health of women and infants and mother -child interactions. 4. Blondel B, Mellier G.

The effectiveness of home visiting as a de livery strategy for pu blic health nursing interventions: a systematic overview. Wo rking paper series; 94-7. Hamilton, ON, Canada: McMaster University, 1994. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of public health nursing (PHN) inte rventions offered through the strategy of home visiting. RESULTS: Seventy-seven articles were quality assessed, and of these, 14 articles (11 studies, 4,434 patients) of strong or mode rate quality were included in the review. There were 3 RCTs (2,685 patients), 6 controlled cl inical trials (1,597 patients) and 2 cohort studies (152 patients). A summary of the narrative synthesis suggests the following : there were no negative effects of home visiting; there was positive effect of home visiting on physical health, mental health and development, social health, health habits, knowledge and service utilisation. Some ar ticles suggest no effect or selective effects. No 2 studies have similar interventions and outcomes. Hence the difficulty in presenting coherent results. CONCLUSIONS: There are no negative effects of home vi siting, i.e. home visits have not been shown to do 8 Resultat any harm. The studies demonstrate a positive impact of home visiting on physical health, mental health and development, social health, health habits, knowle dge and service utilisation. The effects seem to be mediated by the intensity of the intervention and the pr e-existing level of health and social status of the client. 6. Doggett C, Burrett S, Osborn DA. Home visits during pregnancy and after birth for women with an alcohol or drug problem. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2005, Issue 4. Art. No.: CD004456. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004456.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: One potential method of improving outcome for pr egnant or postpartum women with a drug or alcohol problem is with home visits. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of home visits during pregnancy and/or after birth for pregnant women with a drug or alcohol problem. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy an d Childbirth Trials Register (30 April 2004), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), ME DLINE (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1980 to week 16, 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2 004), PsycINFO (1974 to April 2004), citations from previous reviews and trials, and contacted expert informants. SELE CTION CRITERIA: Studies using random or quasi- random allocation of pregnant or postpartum women wi th a drug or alcohol problem to home visits. Trials enrolling high-risk women of whom more than 50% we re reported to use drugs or alcohol were also eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessments of trials were performed independently by all review authors. Statistical analyses were perf ormed using fixed and rand om-effects models where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies (709 women) compared home visits af ter birth with no home visits. None provided a significant antenatal componen t of home visits. The visitors included community health nurses, pediatric nurses, trained counsellors, pa raprofessional advocates, midwives and lay African- American women. Most studies had me thodological limitations, particular ly large losses to follow up. There were no significant differences in co ntinued illicit drug use (2 studies, 248 women; relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.20), continued alcohol use (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.41) failure to enrol in a drug treatment program (2 studies, 211 wo men; RR 0.45 95% CI 0.10 to 1.94). There was no significant difference in the Bayley MDI (3 studies, 199 infants; weighted mean difference 2.89, 95% CI - 1.17 to 6.95) or Psychomotor Index (WMD 3.14, 95% CI -0.03 to 6.32). Other outcomes reported by one study only included breastfeeding at six months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.23), incomplete six-month infant vaccination (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.96), non-a ccidental injury and non-voluntary foster care (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.23), failure to us e postpartum contraception (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 problems (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01), and involvement with child protective services (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of home visits for women wi th a drug or alcohol problem. Further large, high- quality trials are needed, and women's views on home visiting need to be assessed. 7. Elkan R, Kendrick D, Hewitt M, Robinson JJ, Tolley K, Blair M, et al. The effectiveness of domiciliary health visiting: a systematic re view of international studies and a selective review of the British literature. Health Technology Assessment 2000;4(13):1-339. The objectives of this review are to: - conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of domiciliary health visiting (Part I) - conduct a sele ctive review of the British health visiting literature (Part II) - provide recommendations for future research. The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. Several reviews of the existing literature support making the content, duration and intensity of home visits appropriate and sensitive to the needs of clients. It is considered that professional judgement is valid for decisions about where to target home visiting resources. Expectations of home visiting by health visitors should be realis tic. Home visiting by itself can be insufficient to bring about radical im provements in health and social outcomes. The literature suggests that non-professional home visitors can play a role, but that they require guidance , supervision and support from professionals. However, more complex difficulties may not be su itable for non-professional home visiting. The evidence suggests that home visiting interventions that are restricted to the pursuit of only a narrow range of outcomes are less effective than more broadly based interventions in which the multiple needs of individuals and families are addressed. 8. Guterman NB. Enrollment strate gies in early home visitation to prevent physical child abuse and neglect and the \"universal versus ta rgeted\" debate: a meta-analysis of Negl 1999;23(9):863-90. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Seeking to discern optimal programmatic strategies and inform the \"universal versus targeted\" debate in early home visitation services to prevent physical child abuse and neglect, a meta-analysis was conducted examining enrollment approa ches in early home visitation studies and their reported outcomes. METHOD: Quantitative meta-analyti c techniques were used to compare effect sizes from 19 controlled outcome studies across screening- based and population-based enrollment strategies. Effect sizes were calculated on protective services data and on child maltreat ment related measures of parenting. RESULTS: On protective services report data, population-based studies reported a weighted mean effect size attributable to early home visitati on of +3.72%, in comparis on to -.07% for screening- based studies. On child maltreatment related measures of parenting, population-based studies reported a weighted mean effect size (r) attrib utable to early home visitation of +.092, in comparison to +.020 for screening-based studies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that population-based enrollment 9 Resultat strategies appear favorable to screening-based ones in early home visitation programs seeking to prevent physical child abuse and neglect. It may be that psycho social risk screens serve to enroll higher proportions of families for which early home visitation services ar e less likely to leverage ch ange, and to exacerbate a mismatch between early home visitati on service aims and family needs. 9. Hodnett ED, Roberts I. Home-based social su pport for socially disadvantaged mothers. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 1999 Issue 1. Art. No.: CD000107. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000107. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies indica te that babies born to socio-economically disadvantaged mothers are at higher ri sk of injury, abuse and neglect, health problems in infancy, and are less likely to have regular well-child care. Home visitati on programs have long been advocated as a strategy for improving the health of disadvan taged children. Over the past two decades, a number of randomised trials have examined the effect of home visitation programs on a range of maternal and child health outcomes. The studies in this review evaluate prog rams which offer additional home based support for socially disadvantaged mothers and their children . OBJECTIVES: Babies born in socio-economic disadvantage are likely to be at higher risk of injury, abuse and ne glect, and to have health problems in infancy. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of programs offering additional home-based support for women who have recently given birt h and who are socially disadvantaged. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Date of last search: 26 October 1998. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of one or more post-natal ho me visits with the aim of providing additional home based support for socially disadvan taged women who had recently given birth, compared to usual care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality wa s assessed. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studie s, involving 2992 families , were included. Most of the trials had important methodologic al limitations. Seven trial report s are awaiting further assessment. There was a trend towards reduced child injury rates with additional support, although this was not statistically significant (odds ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 1.03). There appeared to be no difference for child abuse and neglect (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.57), although differential surveillance between visited and non-vi sited families is an important methodological consideration. Babies in the additi onal support groups were more li kely to have complete well-child immunizations. Based on the results of two trials, there was a trend towards reduced hospitalization, although this was not statistically significant. AU THORS' CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal home-based support programs appear to have no risk s and may have benefits for socia lly disadvantaged mothers and their children, possibly including reduced rates of child injury. Differential surveillance does not allow easy interpretation of the child abuse an d neglect findings.Synopsis pending. 10. Kendrick D, Elkan R, Hewitt M, Dewey M, Blair M, Robinson J, et al. Does home visiting improve parenting and the quality of the home environment? A systematic review and meta analysis. Arch Dis Child 2000;82(6):443-51. Abstract: AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of home visiting programmes on parenting and quality of the home environment. DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature of randomised controlled trials and quasi- experimental studies evaluating home visiting pr ogrammes involving at leas t one postnatal visit. SUBJECTS: Thirty four studies reported relevant outcomes ; 26 used participants considered to be at risk of adverse maternal or child health outcomes; two used preterm or low birth weight infants; and two used infants with failure to thrive. Only eight used particip ants not considered to be at risk of adverse child health outcomes. RESULTS: Seventeen studies reported Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) scores, 27 reported other measur es of parenting, and 10 reported both types of outcome. Twelve studies were entered into the meta analysis. This showed a significant effect of home visiting on HOME score. Similar resu lts were found after restricting the analyses to randomised controlled trials and to higher quality studies. Twenty one of the 27 studies reporting other measures of parenting found significant treatment effects favouring th e home visited group on a range of measures. CONCLUSIONS: Home visiting progra mmes were associated with an improvement in the quality of the home environment. Few studies used UK health visitors, so caution must be exercised in extrapolating the results to current UK health visiting practice. Further work is needed to evaluate whether UK health visitors can achieve similar results. Comparisons wi th similar programmes delive red by paraprofessionals or community mothers are also needed. 11. Kendrick D, Hewitt M, Dewey M, Elkan R, Blair M, Robinson J, et al. The effect of home visiting programmes on uptake of childhood immunization: a systematic revi ew and meta- analysis. JPublic Health Med 2000;22(1):90-8. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of home visiting programmes on the uptake of childh ood immunization. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out of the literature of controlled studies evaluating home visiting programmes involving at least one post-natal visit, which included tasks within the remit of Britis h health visiting and report ing outcomes relevant to British health visiting. Eleven studies were considered, nine of which used socio-economically disadvantaged families. The outcome measure was uptake of a range of childhood immunizations. RESULTS: Eleven studies reported uptake of immunizatio n. Effect sizes from nine studies were included in 10 Resultat the meta-analysis. Fixed effects models demonstrated a significant effect of home visiting for all studies and also for several subgroups of studies, but with significant heterogeneity of effect sizes. A random effects model failed to demonstrate an ef fect of home visiting. CONCLUSION S: Home visiting programmes have not been shown to be effective in increasing the up take of immunization. Other methods of increasing uptake and reducing inequalities in uptake will need to be explored. 12. Larun L, Lyngstadaas A, Macdonald G, Bennett C, Dennis JA, Coren E, Patterson J, Astin M, et al. Home-based support for disadvantaged teen age mothers. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008 Issue 1. Art. No.: CD006723. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006723.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Babies born to socio-economically disadvantaged mothers are at higher risk of injury, abuse or neglect and health problems than ba bies born to more afflue nt mothers; disadvantaged teenage mothers are at particular risk of advers e outcomes. Home-visiting programs are thought to improve outcomes for both mothers and children, largely through advice and support. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of home-visiting programme s for women who have recently given birth and who are socially or economically disadvantaged. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: CENTRAL (2006, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006); EMBASE (1980 to week 12 2006); CINAHL (1982 to March week 4 2006 ); PsycINFO (1872 to March week 4 2006); ASSIA (1987 to March 2006); LILACS (1982 to March 2006); and Sociological Abstracts (1963 to March 2006). Grey literature was also be searched using ZETOC (1993 to March 2 006); Dissertation Abstracts International (late 1960s to 2006); and SIGLE (1980 to March 2006). Communi cation with published authors about ongoing or unpublished research was also undertaken. SELECTION CRITERIA: Included studies were randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of home visiting directed at teenage mothers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Titles and abstracts identified in the search were independently assessed for eligibility by two review authors (EC and JP or CB ). Data were extracted and entered into RevMan (EC, JP and CB), synthesised and presented in both wr itten and graphical form (forest plots). Outcomes included in this review were establis hed at the protocol stage by an inte rnational steering group. The review did not report on all outcomes reported in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies with 1838 participants were included in this review. Data from single studies prov ided support for the effectiveness of home visiting on some outcomes, but the evidence overall provided only limited support for the effectiveness of home visiting as a means of im proving the range of maternal and child outcomes considered in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests there is only limited evidence that home-visiting programmes of the ki nd described in this review can im pact positively on the quality of parenting of teenage mothers or on child development outcomes for their offspring. For reasons discussed in the review, this does not amount to a conclusi on that home-visiting prog rammes are ineffective but indicates a need to think carefully about the proble ms that home visiting might influence and about improvements in the conduct and reporting of outc ome studies in this area . HOME-BASED SUPPORT FOR DISADVANTAGED TEENAGE MOTHERS: Whilst it is clear that not all teenage pregnancies are unwanted, and that parenting as a teenager can be experienced positively, teenage parenthood is more likely to be linked to adverse social and health outcomes than pa renthood in older mothers; both for mothers and their children. Home visiting refers to a wide variety of interventions delivered in a variety of ways, within different policy contexts and targeted at differ ent populations. Programmes may be provided by professionals (usually nurses) or para -professionals. This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of home- visiting programmes for improving outcomes for teen age mothers and their infants. Five studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria for the review. A total of 1838 teenage mothers were enrolled in 11 Resultat these studies. The evidence suggests there is only limited support for the effectiveness of home visiting as a means of improving maternal life co urse, parenting or psychosocial ou tcomes of teenage mothers or for improving a range of developmental and social outcomes for their children. 14. Malaysian Health Technology Assessment Unit . Home visiting in pu blic health. Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian Health Technolo gy Assessment Unit (MHTAU), 2000. Home visitation or health visiting has been widely used as an intervention strategy in health care services in many countries. It has been defined as \"... planne d activities aimed at the promotion of health and prevention of disease. It therefore contributes substantially to individual and social well-being, by focusing attention at various times on either an individual, a social group or a community\" (Cowley, 1998). Home visiting in the Family Health progra mme in Malaysia mainly involves various categories of public health nursing personnel namely public health nurses, st aff nurses, community nurses, assistant nurses and midwives rendering services in accordance with their capacities, roles and functions. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness, efficiency and cost effect iveness of home visiting. SCOPE OF ASSESSMENT: The following was the scope of the assessment: i) Confined to home visiting in health care services ii) Home visiting only by public health nurses, and not other cate gories of personnel Home visiting specifically in the areas of child health, pregnancy and postnatal care, elderly care, nutrition and mental health are considered. CONCLUSIONS: After reviewing the literatu re, it was found that home visiting has positive effects in many aspects of health care. While some studies were inconc lusive or did not support positive effects, there were no negative e ffects of home visiting reported. 15. McNaughton DB. A synthesis of qualitative home visiting re search. Public Health Nurs 2000;17(6):405-14. Abstract: Over the past decade, a body of qualitative research has been develope d which describes the home visiting practice of public health nu rses (PHNs) to maternal-child clients. This article reports a synthesis of these studies. The purpose of the synthesis was to identify common elements and differences between the research reports that would lead to theory developm ent or support of existing theories. Methods were based on Miles and Huberman 's (1994) text on qualitative data anal ysis. Results of the synthesis indicated that building and preserving relation ships with the client is the central focus of home visiting and provides a foundation for problem identification and problem so lving. Clients control access to their homes as well as the information they are willing to share with the nurse. The goals of home visiting relate to empowering mothers, supporting their independence and decision making. Similarities to Peplau's theory of Interpersonal Relations and Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB) are noted. 16. McNaughton DB. Nurse home visits to maternal -child clients: a review of intervention research. Public Health Nurs 2004;21:207-19. Abstract : Home visiting has been considered a promising strategy for addressing the multiple needs of families at risk. Research reviews are a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners who develop and support new home-vis iting interventions. This review examines 13 research studies published between the years of 1980 and 2000 that te st the effectiveness of ho me-visiting interventions using professional nurses as home visitors. Findings indicate that a wide range of client problems are addressed during home visits using a variety of nursing interventions. Missing from most of the reports is a clear theoretical link between the client problem addr essed, the nursing intervention, and target outcomes. About half of the studies were successful in achieving desired outcomes. Future rese arch should be directed by middle-range practice theory, clearly explicate the nursing intervention being tested, use power analysis to determine sample size, and report reliability and vali dity of dependent variable measures with culturally diverse samples. 17. Roberts I, Kramer MS, Suissa S. Does home visiting prevent childhood injury? A systematic review of randomised controlled trials. BMJ 1996;312(7022):29-33. Abstract: OBJECTIVE--To quantify the effectiveness of home visiting programmes in the prevention of child injury and child abuse. DESIGN--Systematic re view of 11 randomised controlled trials of home visiting programmes. Pooled odds ratios were estimated as an inverse variance weighted average of the study specific odds ratios. SETTING --Randomised trials that were avai lable by April 1995. SUBJECTS--The trials comprised 3433 participants. RE SULTS--Eight trials examined the e ffectiveness of home visiting in the prevention of childhood injury. The pooled odds ratio for the eight trials was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.92). Four studies ex amined the effect of home visiting on injury in the first year of life. The pooled odds ratio was 0.98 (0.62 to 1.53). Nine trials examined the effect of home visiting on the occurrence of suspected abuse, reported abuse, or out of home placement for child abuse. Because of the potential for bias in outcome reporting in these studies, pooled effect estimates were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS--Home visiting programmes have the po tential to reduce significantly the rates of childhood injury. The problem of differential surveillance for child abuse between intervention and control groups precludes the use of reported abuse as a valid outcome measure in controlled trials of home visiting. 18. Sharps PW, Campbell J, Baty ML, Walker KS , Bair-Merritt MH. Current evidence on perinatal home visiting intimate partner violence. Nurs 2008;37(4):480-90. 12 Resultat Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe current evidence on home visiting interventions for pregnant or postpartum women with specific intimate partner violence assessment and content. DATA SOURCES: Online bibliographic databases including PubMed, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science and a hand search of bibliographies of relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Original research and in tervention studies were included that contained (a) a well-described prenat al and/or postpartum home visitation; (b) an assessment of perinatal intimate partner violence; and (c) quantitative data describing health outcomes for the women and their infants. DATA EXTRACTION: The search yielded 128 articles, and 8 relevant articles met all of the inclusion criteria. Nonresearch, nonintervention, and international articles were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: No perinatal home visiting interventions were desi gned to address intimate partner violence. Programs that screened for intimate partner violence found high rates, and the presence of intimate partner violence limited the ability of the intervention to improve maternal and child outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal home visita tion programs likely improve preg nancy and infant outcomes. Home visiting interventions addressing in timate partner violence in nonperin atal population groups have been effective in minimizing intimate partner violence and improving outc omes. This suggests that perinatal home visiting programs adding specific intimate partner violence interventions may reduce intimate partner violence and improve maternal and infant health. Continued rigorous research is needed. 19. Shaw E, Levitt C, Wong S, Kaczorowski J, Th e McMaster University Postpartum Research Group. Systematic review of the literature on postpartum care: effectiveness of postpartum support to improve maternal parenting, mental health, quality of life , and physical health. Birth 2006;33(3):210-20. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postpartum support is recomme nded to prevent infant and maternal morbidity. This review examined the published evidence of the effectiveness of postpartum support programs to improve maternal knowledge, attitude s, and skills related to parenting, maternal mental health, maternal quality of life, and maternal physical health. METH ODS: MEDLINE, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials of interventions initiated from immediately after birth to 1 year in postnatal women. The initial lite rature search was done in 1999 and was enhanced in 2003 and 2005. Studies we re categorized based on the the above outcomes. Data were extracted in a systematic manner, and the quality of each study wa s reviewed. RESULTS: In the 1999 search, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. The 2003 and 2005 searches identified 13 additional trials for a total of 22 trials. Universal postpartum support to unselected women at low risk did not result in statistically significant improvements for any outcomes examined. Educationa l visits to a pediatrician showed statistically significant improvements in matern al-infant parenting skills in lo w-income primiparous women. In women at high risk for family dysfunction and chil d abuse, nurse home visits combined with case conferencing produced a statistically significant improvement in home environment quality using the HOME (Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment) program. Similarly, in women at high risk for either family dysfunction or postpartum depre ssion, home visitation or peer support, respectively, produced a statistically significant reduction in Edin burgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores (difference - to -0.74, p= 1.40 to 27.84, p= 0.01, respectively). Educational programs reduced repeat unplanned pregnancies (12.0% vs 28.3%, p= 0.003) and increased effective contraceptive use (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.68, p= 0.00 7). Maternal satisfaction was higher with home visitation programs. CONCLUSI ONS: No randomized controlled trial evidence was found to endorse universal provision of postpartum su pport to improve parenting, maternal mental health, maternal quality of life, or maternal physical health. There is some evidence that high-risk populations may benefit from postpartum support. 20. Sweet MA, Appelbaum MI. Is home visiting an effective strategy? A me ta-analytic review of home visiting programs for families with yo ung children. Child Dev 2004;75(5):1435-56. Abstract: Home visiting programs for families with yo ung children have been in effect for many years; however, this is the first comprehens ive meta-analytic effort to quantify the usefulness of home visits as a strategy for helping families across a range of outcomes . Sixty home visiting prog rams contributed data to analysis within 5 child and 5 parent outcome groups. St andardized effect sizes were computed for each end- of-treatment outcome measure, for each treatment versus control contrast. Weighted mean standardized effect sizes ranged from -.043 to.318; 6 of the 10 significantly differed from 0. No one program characteristic consistently affected effect sizes across outcome groups. The extent to which these findings have practical use for the field is discussed. 13 Resultat KOSTHOLD 1. Ciliska D, Miles E, O'Brien MA, Turl C, Tomasi k HH, Donovan U, et al. The effectiveness of community interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in people four years of age and older. Ontario Ministry of Health , Region of Hamilton-Wentworth, Social and Public Health Services Division, 1999. Abstract: Objectives: Increasing dietary intake of fruits and vegetables has been proposed as an effective means of reducing morbidity and mo rtality related to cardiovascular disease and cancer. The systematic review sought to answer the question: what is the effectiveness of community interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in people four years of age and older? Are there differences in outcome by target group, by preparation of the intervenor, or by site, intensity or theoretical basis of the intervention? Methods: A search was conducted of the electronic data bases from the first year of their existence to 1998. Key public health-related journals were hand-searched to the first issue of 1993 and key nutrition journals were hand-searched back to 1988. Relevant references were retrieved from bibliographies. Each article retrieved was rated for relevance and validity by two independent readers then da ta abstraction was done by two people for the studies that rated as strong or moderate. All tools used for the three phases had been pretested. Results: One hundred and eighty-nine articles were retrieved. Sixty were rated as relevant. After validity rating, one was rated 'strong', 17 'moderate' an d 42 'weak'. Four studies were targeted to parents of young children, six to school-aged children, five to adults. The outcomes of the interventions varied by intensity and clarity of the messages more than by age of target group, or site of the intervention. There is support for use of peer educators and paraprofession als with low-income mothers, although a study of direct comparison of two groups led by a professional nutritionist versus a paraprofessional has not been found. The most effective interventions gave clear messages about increasing fruit and vegetable consumption; incorporated multiple strategies that reinforced the messages; involved the family; were more intensive; were provided over a longer period of time, rather than one or two contacts; and were based on a theoretical framework. Conc lusions: People in public health positions of making decisions about nutrition interventions need to give priority to those interventions that are multi-pronged, flexible, open to input from target groups and theoreti cally based. Careful and co-operative, multi-site evaluation should be done in order to guide future programs. 2. Cockroft nP, Cade JE.

Abstract: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:To assess the effectiveness of educational, experiential, health promotion and/or psychological/family/behavioural therapy/counselling/management interventions that fo cused on fruit and/or vegetable consumption, and were designed to promote an increase in fruit and/or vegetable consumption, in pre-school children. 3. de Oliveira MI, Camacho LA, Tedstone AE. Extending breastfeedin g duration through primary care: a systematic review of prenatal and postnatal interventions. J Hum Lact 2001;17(4):326-43. Abstract: This literature review provides an overview of the effectiveness of strategies and procedures used to extend breastfeeding duration. Interventions carried out during pregnancy and/or infant care conducted in primary health care services, community settings, or hospital cl inics were included. Interventions covering only the delivery period were excluded. Interventions that were most effective in extending the duration of breastfeeding generally combined information, guidance, and support and were long term and intensive. During prenatal care, group education was the only effective strategy reported. Home visits used to identify mothers' concerns with breastfeeding, assist with problem solving, and involve family members in breastfeeding support were effective during the post natal period or both periods. Individual education sessions were also effective in these periods, as was the combination of 2 or 3 of these strategies in interventions involving both periods. Strategies that had no effect were characterized by no face-to-face interaction, practices cont radicting messages, or sma ll-scale interventions. 4. De Sa J, Lock K. Will European agricultural policy for school fruit and vegetables improve public health? A review of sc hool fruit and vegetable prog rammes. Eur J Public Health 2008;18(6):558-68. Abstract: Background: For the first time, public health, pa rticularly obesity, is bein g seen as a driver of EU agricultural policy. In 2007, European Ministers of Agriculture were asked to back new proposals for school fruit and vegetable programmes as part of agri cultural reforms. In 2008, the European Commission conducted an impact assessment to assess the potential im pact of this new proposal on health, agricultural markets, social equality and regional cohesion. Methods: A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote fruit and/or vegetable consum ption in children in sch ools, to inform the EC policy development process. Results: School schemes ar e effective at increasing both intake and knowledge. Of the 30 studies included, 70% increased fruits and ve getables (FV) intake, with none decreasing intake. 14 Resultat Twenty-three studies had follow-up periods >1 year an d provide some evidence th at FV schemes can have long-term impacts on consumption. Only one study led to both increased fruit and vegetable intake and reduction in weight. One study showed that school fr uit and vegetable schemes ca n also help to reduce inequalities in diet. Effective school programmes have used a range of approaches and been organized in ways which vary nationally depending on differences in food supply chain and education systems. Conclusions: EU agriculture policy for school fruits an d vegetables schemes should be an effect ive approach with both public health and agricultural benefits. Ai ming to increase FV intake amongst a new generation of consumers, it will support a range of EU policies including obesity and health inequalities. copyright The Author 2008.

A systematic review of professional support interventions for breastfeeding. J Clin Nurs 2008;17(9):1132-43. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this systematic review were first, to describe how breastfeeding is professionally supported during pr egnancy, at maternity hospitals and during the postnatal period. Secondly, to find out how effective interventions are in supporting breastfeeding. BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is an effective way to promote the health of infants. In many countries, the rates for breastfeeding remain lower than recommended. Many studies have examined breastfeeding promotion interventions; some of them are successful and some fail . It is important to find effective combinations of support. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Se arch of CINAHL, Medline and Cochrane Central Register databases were conducted fo r data collection. The search was limited to articles published in Finnish, Swedish and English between the year 2000 and March 2006, focusing on breastfeeding and breastfeeding support interventions. Two reviewers independently analysed 36 articles in the final analysis. RESULTS: Interventions expanding from pregnancy to th e intrapartum period and throughout the postnatal period were more effective than interventions concentrating on a shorter period. In addition, intervention packages using variou s methods of education and support from well-trained professionals are more effective than interventions concentrating on a single method. CONCLUSIONS: During pregnancy, the effective interventions were inte ractive, involving mothers in conver sation. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) as well as practical hands off -teach ing, when combined with support and encouragement, were effective approaches. Postnatally effective were home visits, telephone support and breastfeeding centres combined with peer support. Relevance to clinical practice. Professionals need breastfeeding education and support of their organisations to act as breastfeeding supporters. The BFHI -programme is effective and it would be wise to include the co re components of the programme in breastfeeding promotion interventions. Mothers be nefit from breastfeeding encourag ement and guidance that supports their self-efficacy and feelings of being capable and empo wered, and is tailored to their individual needs. 6.

School- based nutrition programs produced a mode rate increase in fruit and vegetable consumption: meta and pooling analyses from 7 studies. J Nu tr Educ Behav 2007;39:186-96. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, through study- and individual-level analyses of data from 7 studies, the effectiveness of school-based nutr ition interventions on child fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption. DESIGN: To find original studies on school-based nutrition interventions, the authors searched electronic databases from 1990 to 2002. First authors of the 13 eligible studies were contac ted to request their data. Data from 7 studies were receiv ed for inclusion in this pooled analysis. SETTING: Schools. PARTICIPANTS: 8156 children were matched from pr etest to posttest. Participants were primarily elementary school-aged (75.5%) and white (66%), and 50.4% were males. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Net FV difference and net FV relative change (%). ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed at both the study and individual levels. A fitted multivar iable fixed-effects model was used to analyze the role of potential covariates on FV intake. Statistical significance was set at alpha = .05. RESULTS: At the individual level, the net difference in FV consumption was 0.45 (95% CI 0.33-0.59) servings; th e net relative change was 19% (95% CI 0.15-0.23) servings. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: School-based nutrition interventions produced a moderate increase in FV intake among children. These results may have implications for chronic disease prevention effort s, including cardiovascul ar disease and cancer. 7.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD004676. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004676.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early malnutrition and/or micronutrient deficiencies can adversely affect physical, mental, and social aspects of child health . School feeding programs are designed to improve attendance, achievement, growth, and other health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to determine the effectiveness of school feeding programs in improving physical and psychosocial health for disadvantaged school pupils . SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched a number of databases including CENTRAL (2006 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), EMBASE (1980 to May 2006), PsycINFO (1980 to May 2006) and CINAHL (1982 to Ma y 2006). Grey literature sources we re also searched. Reference lists of included studies and key journals were handsearched and we also contacted selected experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled 15 Resultat clinical trials (CCTs), controlled be fore and after studies (CBAs), and inte rrupted time series studies (ITSs) were included. Feeding had to be done in school; the ma jority of participants had to be socio-economically disadvantaged. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed all searches and retrieved studies. Data extraction was done by one of four reviewers and reviewed by a second. Two reviewers independently rated quality. If suffi cient data were available, they were synthesized using random effects meta-analysis, adjusting for clusteri ng if needed. Analyses were performed separately for RCTs and CBAs and for higher and lower in come countries. MAIN RESU LTS: We included 18 stud ies. For weight, in the RCTs and CBAs from Lower Income Countries, experime ntal group children gained an average of 0.39 kg (95% C.I: 0.11 to 0.67) over an aver and 0.71 kg (95% C. I.: 0.48 to 0.95) over 11.3 months respectively. Results for weight were mixed in higher income countries. For height, results were mixed; height gain was greater for younger children. Atte ndance in lower income countries was higher in experimental groups than in controls; our results show an average increase of 4 to 6 days a year. Math gains were consistently higher for experimental groups in lower income countries; in CBAs, the Standardized Mean Difference was 0.66 (95% C.I. = 0.13 to 1.18). In short-term studies, small improvements in some cognitive tasks were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: School meals may have some small benefits for disadvan taged children. We reco mmend further well-designed studies on the effectiveness of school meals be un dertaken, that results should be reported according to socio-economic status, and that researchers gather robust data on both processes and carefully chosen outcomes. SCHOOL FEEDING FOR IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH OF DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLCHILDREN: Early malnutrition and/or micronut rient deficiencies can negatively affect many aspects of child health and development. School feedin g programs are designed to provide food to hungry children and to improve their physical, mental and psyc hosocial health. This is the first systematic review on the topic of school feeding. Eighteen studies were included in this review; nine were performed in higher income countries and nine in lower income countries. In the highest qu ality studies (randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from low income countr ies, children who were fed at school gained an average of 0.39 kg more than controls over 19 months; in lower quality st udies (controlled before and after trials (CBAs)), the difference in gain was 0.71 kg over 11.3 months. Children who were fe d at school attended school more frequently than those in control groups ; this finding translated to an average increase of 4 to 6 days a year per child. For educational and cognitive outcomes, ch ildren who were fed at sc hool gained more than controls on math achievement, and on some short- term cognitive tasks.Results from higher income countries were mixed, but generally positive. For heig ht, results from lower inco me countries were mixed; in RCTs, differences in gains were important only for younger children, but results from the CBAs were large and significant overall. Result s for height from high Income countries were mixed, but generally positive. School meals may have small physical and psychosocial benefits for disadvantaged pupils. We recommend that further well-designed studies on the effectiveness of school meals be undertaken, that results should be reported according to the socio-econ omic status of the children who take part in them, and that researchers gather robust data on outcomes that directly reflect effects on physical, social, and psychological health. 8. McArthur DB. Heart healthy eating behaviors of children following a a meta-analy sis. Issues The purpose of this meta-analysis was to estimate the effects of school-based interventions on heart healthy eating behaviors of four th and fifth grade students.

School-based physical activity programs for promoting physical activity and fitness in childr en and adolescents aged 6-18. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2009 Issue 1. Art. No.: CD007651. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007651. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization estimates that 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity. Chronic diseases associated with physical inactivity include cancer, diabetes and coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence of the effectiveness of school-based interventions in promoting physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents. SEARCH STRATEGY: The sear ch strategy included sear ching several databases. In addition, reference lists of included articles an d background papers were reviewed for potentially relevant studies, as well as referenc es from relevant Cochrane reviews. Primary authors of included studies were contacted as needed for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be included, the intervention had to be releva nt to public health practice, implemented, facilitated, or promoted by staff in local public health units, implemented in a school sett ing and aimed at increasing physical activity, report on outcomes for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18 years), and use a prospective design with a control group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Standardized tools were used by two independent reviewers to rate each study's methodological quality and for da ta extraction. Where discrepancies existed discussion occurred until consensus was reached. The results were summarized narratively due to wide variations in the populations, interventions eval uated and outcomes measured. MAIN RESULTS: 13,841 titles were identified and screened and 482 articles were retrieved. Multiple publications on the same project were combined and counted as one project, resulting in 395 distinct project accounts (studies). Of the 395 studies 104 were deemed relevant and of those, four we re assessed as having strong methodological quality, 22 were of moderate quality and 78 were considered we ak. In total 26 studies were included in the review. There is good evidence that school-based physical activity interventions have a positive impact on four of the nine outcome measures. Specifically positive effects were observed for duration of physical activity, television viewing, VO2 max, and bl ood cholesterol. Generally school-bas ed interventions had no effect on leisure time physical activity rates, systolic and di astolic blood pressure, body mass index, and pulse rate. At a minimum, a combination of printed educational materials and changes to the school curriculum that promote physical activity result in positive effect s. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given that there are no harmful effects and that there is some evidence of po sitive effects on lifestyle behaviours and physical health status measures, ongoing physical activity promotion in schools is recommended at this time. SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR PROMOTIN G PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FITNESS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: Current evidence su ggests that school-based physical activity interventions may be effective in the development of healthy lifestyle behaviours among children and adolescents that will then translate into reduced risk for many chronic diseases and cancers in adulthood. The evidence also suggests that the best primary strategy for improving the long-term health of children and adolescents through exercise may be creating lifestyle patterns of regular physical activity that carry over to the adult years.It is estimated that as many at 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity, and that inactivity is a key risk factor in the development of most chronic diseases and cancers.This is alarming particular ly because it is known that physic al activity patterns track from childhood into adulthood; that children are increasingly exhibiting risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, elevated blood lipids, and hypertension, conditions which are known to track into adulthood; and that atherosclerotic fatty streaks in the coronary arteries, which are indicative of coronary heart disease, have been found postmortem in children.This review included 26 studies that evaluated the impact of combinations of school-based interventi ons focused on increasing physical activity among children and adolescents. Participants were between the ages of 6 to18 living in Australia, South America, 17 Resultat Europe and North America.There is good evidence that school-based physical activity interventions are effective in increasing duration of physical activity , reducing blood cholestero l and time spent watching television and increasing VO2 max. VO2 max, known as maximal oxyg en uptake or aerobic capacity, reflects the physical fitness level of an individual and generally increases as fitness levels improve. These interventions are not effective in increasing the percentage of children and adolescents who are physically active during leisure time, or in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and pulse rate. At a minimum, a combination of printed educatio nal materials and changes to the school curriculum that promote physical activity result in posi tive effects for four of the nine outcomes. 2. Salmon J, Booth ML, Phongsavan P, Murphy N, Timperio A. Promoting physical activity participation among childr en and adolescents. Epid emiol Rev 2007;29:144-59. Abstract: With global increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents, there has never been a more urgent need for effective physical activity programs. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the evidence of the effectiveness of interventions that report physical activity outcomes in children aged 4-12 years and adolescents aged 13-19 years. A systematic search of electronic databases identified 76 interventions. Most interventions were delivered via the school setting (57 interventions), nine through the family setting, six via primar y care, and four in community- or Internet-based settings. Children's physical activity interventions that were most effective in the school setting included some focus on physical education, activity breaks, and family strategies. Interventions delivered in the family setting were not highly effective, but many were pilot studies. The use of motivationally tailored strategies and program delivery in the primary care setting showed promise among adolescents. Many studies had methodological and reporting flaws (e.g., no baseline data, poor study design, physical activity measures of unknown reliability and validity, and poor reporting of sample size, response rates, attrition/retention, compliance, year of intervention , and duration of intervention). Publications reporting the result s of evaluations of intervention studies should follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines or, for nonran domized studies, should follow the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs guidelines. Further evidence of the effectiveness of interventions promoting young pe ople's physical activity in family and community settings is needed. 3. Thomas H, Ciliska D, Micucci S, Wilson-Abra J, Dobbins M. Effectiveness of physical activity enhancement and obesity prevention programs in children and youth. City of Hamilton: Public Health and Community Services Department, 2004. Abstract: The purpose of this systematic literature re view is to provide some national policy direction related to the effectiveness of interventions for prom oting healthy weight, preventing overweight/obesity and increasing physical activity among school aged ch ildren and youth. This re view consists of several components. An overall comprehensive literature search for primary studies between January 1985 and June 2003 was carried out. The literature was divi ded into five topics: impr oving nutritional intake, reducing physical inactivity, increasing physical ac tivity, multi-faceted interv entions including improving nutrition, increasing phys ical activity and impacting the school environment, and school environmental interventions. Over 1,100 articles were retrieved. All articles were reviewed for relevance using standardized criteria. Those that were relevant (n=425) were then assessed for me thodological quality. All relevant studies are reported in the tables. Only those with strong methodological rigour are described in the text. One should exercise caution when viewing the results of the weaker studies as they have several threats to internal and external validity. Both Ra ndomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were included. The RCTs were, in general, stronger than the cohort studies. The most frequent limitations of the RCTs included potential selection bias, lack of blinding of outcome assessors, lack of sample size calculation, and inappropriate analysis in that many investigators allocated students by school and then analyzed outcomes by individual. As well, many in vestigators did not report the consistency of the intervention or the amount of the intervention received by study part icipants. Few studies provided any long term follow-up to assess whether positive impact s were sustained. The other difficulty is that when studies reported statistically significant differences in outcomes, the actual differences were small and their clinical significance was unknown. Although the theory underlying many interventions was not implicitly stated, it appeared that many were based on either social cognitive or ecological theory. A few studies were found that used the environ mental/systems based approach. Although none of these studies met the relevance criteria for this review, some examples of work in this area are included in the environmental section as illustrations of possible future work. Few st udies reported the effect of culture, socioeconomic status and individual level of risk on outcomes. In attempting to identify factors contributing to obesity/overweight in children and yo uth, several investigator s have noted the differenc es in rates based on cultural differences and on socioeco nomic status. Of these factors, socioeconomic status may be the most important. Many of the studies involved elementary school children. About one third focused on adolescents. The effectiveness of parental involvement had mixed results. One study demonstrated that teacher preparation positively impacted on the amount of physical activity students engaged in during physical education classes. However, classroom teachers led most of the interventions. The results of the review are that positive outcomes are modest at best and many results are inconsistent between studies. Based on this review of the literature, the followin g are recommendations for po licy, program delivery and research. 18 Resultat 4. van Sluijs EMF, McMinn AM, Griffin SJ. Effect iveness of interventions to promote physical activity in children and ad olescents: systematic revie w of controlled trials. BMJ 2007;335(7622):703. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in children and adolescents. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, Psychl it, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, an d Embase up to December 2006. Review methods Two independent reviewers assessed studies against the following inclusion criteria: controlled trial, comparison of inte rvention to promote physical activi ty with no intervention control condition, participants younger than 18 years, and reported statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome measure. Levels of evidence , accounting for methodological qual ity, were assessed for three types of intervention, five settings, and th ree target populations. RESULTS: The literature search identified 57 studies: 33 aimed at children and 24 at adolescents. Twenty four studies were of high methodological quality, including 13 studies in chil dren. Interventions that were found to be effective achieved increases ranging from an additional 2.6 minutes of physical ed ucation related physical activity to 283 minutes per week of overall physical activity. Among children, limi ted evidence for an effect was found for interventions targeting children from low socioeconomic populations, and environmental interventions. Strong evidence was found that school based interventions with involvement of the family or community and multicomponent interventions can incr ease physical activity in adolescents. CONCLUSION: Some evidence was found for potentially effective strategies to increase children's levels of physical activity. For adolescents, multicomponent interventions and interv entions that included both school and family or community involvement have the potential to make import ant differences to levels of physical activity and should be promoted. A lack of high quality evalua tions hampers conclusions co ncerning effectiveness, especially among children. OVERVEKT 1. De Mello ED, Luft VC, Meyer F. Childhood obes ity - Towards effectiveness. J Pediatr (Rio J) 2004;80(3):173-82. Abstract: Objective: To review therapeutic approaches to childhood obesity and also its diagnosis and prevention. Sources of data: Searches were performed of scientific papers held on the MEDLINE, Ovid, combinations of this term with \"treatment\", \"prevention\" and \"consequence\". The search returned papers including review articles, observational studies, clinical trials and consensus statem ents. Bibliographical references in these articles were also investigated if it was perceived that they were relevant. Data was collected from 1998 to 2003. Summary of the findings: While a number of different Brazilian prevalence studies were found, few gave details of the results of educationa l programs in our country. Conclusions: Childhood obesity must be prevented through prescriptive diets from birth throughout childhood. Educational programs that might be applicable to primary heal th care or schools should receive further study. 2. Kropski JA, Keckley PH, Jensen GL. School -based obesity prevention programs: an evidence-based review. Obesity (S ilver Spring) 2008;16(5):1009-18. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to examine the effectiveness of school-based programs for reducing childhood overweight or obesity. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A systematic review of the research literature published since 1990 was conducted to identify experimental or quasi-experimental school-based curricular or environmental preventive interventions, with evaluation>or=6 months after baseline, which reported outcomes in terms of a me asure of overweight. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified, including one involving a nutrition-only pr ogram, two physical activity promotion interventions and eleven studies combining nutrition and physical activity components. Most studies (n=10) offered weak (grade 2) quality evidence. One study offered strong (grade 4) evidence reducing the odds ratio for overweight in girls only, while four grade 2 studies reported significant improvements in BMI or at-risk-for overweight or overweight prevalence in boys, girls, or both. Twelve studies reported significant improvement in at least one measure of dietary intake, physical activity, and/or sedentary behavior. DISCUSSION: Our ability to draw strong conclusions as to the efficacy of school-based obesity prevention programs is limited by the small number of publishe d studies and by methodological concerns. Qualitative analysis suggests programs grounded in social learning may be more appropriate for girls, while structural and environmental interventions enabling physical acti vity may be more effectiv e for boys. High-quality evaluation protocols should be considered essential components of future programs. 3. Lissau I. Prevention of overweight in the school arena. Acta Paediatr 2007;96:12-8.

The European 19 Resultat studies were performed in Germany and in the United Kingdom. The studies, which had a significant effect on overweight were 'Dance for Healt of Georgia FitKid Project'. The studies differ greatly in regards to age group, type of and length of intervention and type and amount of actions. Furthermore, the measures used to evaluate the effect differed. It seems to be important to use several measures of obesity in order to accu rately detect a possible effect. In co nclusion, half of the studies were successful and had an effect on either overweight or obesity. Much more research is needed in order to effectively prevent paediatric obesity. 4. Shaya FT, Flores D, Gbarayor CM, Wang J. Sch ool-based obesity interventions: a literature review. J Sch Health 2008;78(4):189-96. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is an impe nding epidemic. This article is an overview of different interventions conducted in school settings so as to guide efforts for an effective management of obesity in children, thus minimizing the risk of ad ult obesity and related cardiovascular risk. METHODS: PubMed and OVID Medline databases were searched for school-based obesity interventions with anthropometric measures in children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 19 years from June 1986 to June 2006. Studies were reviewed by duration, ty pe of intervention, and defined qualitative and quantitative measures, resulting in a yield of 51 inte rvention studies. RESULTS: The interventions ranged from 4 weeks in length to as long as 8 continuing year s. In total, 15 of the intervention studies exclusively utilized physical activity programs, 16 studies ex clusively utilized educational models and behavior modification strategies, and 20 studie s utilized both. In addition, 31 stud ies utilized exclusively quantitative variables like body mass indices an d waist-to-hip ratios to measure the efficacy of the intervention programs, and another 20 studies utilized a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures that included self-reported physical activity and attitude toward physical activity and the tested knowledge of nutrition, cardiovascular health, and physical fitness. A total of 40 studies achieved positive statistically significant results between the baseline and the follo w-up quantitative measurements. CONCLUSIONS: No persistence of positive results in reducing obesity in school-age children ha s been observed. Studies employing long-term follow-up of quantitative and qualitative measurements of short-term interventions in particular are warranted. 5. Small L, Anderson D, Melnyk BM.

Stuart WP, Broome ME, Smith BA, Weaver M. An integrative review of interventions for adolescent weight loss. J Sch Nurs 2005;21(2):77-85. Abstract: The number of overweight adolescents aged 12-19 has tripled during the past 2 decades. Although health risks associated with obesity in adolescence and adulthood are well documented in the literature, little is known about the efficacy of interventions to re duce health risks of this group. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to describe the scope, domain, and effectiveness of weight loss interventions with overweight adol escents. English-language journal articles published in nursing, psychology, nutrition, medicine, and exercise physiology literature between 1980 and 2003 were retrieved. Seventeen studies using comparison or control groups and interventions directed at reductions in adolescent body mass index or body weight were id entified. Descriptive findings of those studies are reported here. Five specific limitations of these studies emerged from the analysis of the interventions: the study findings have not been validated by replication, the samples failed to include adequate representation of Latino and African American male participants, family participation in studies has been inconsistent and infrequent, there is a need for attent ion to study dropout rates (with attrit ion reported as high as 45%), and there is a need for conceptual frameworks to guide the studies. 7.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001871.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obesity preventi on is an international public he alth priority. The prevalence of obesity and overweight is increasing in child populations throughout the world, impacting on short and long-term health. Obesity prevention strategies for chil dren can change behaviour but efficacy in terms of preventing obesity remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent obesity in childhood through diet, physical activity and/or lifestyle and social support. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CI NAHL and CENTRAL were searched from 1990 to February 2005. Non-English la nguage papers were included and experts contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlle d clinical trials with minimum duration twelve weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two studies we re included; ten long-term (at least 12 months) and twelve short-term (12 weeks to 12 months). Nineteen were school/preschool-based interventions, one was a community-based intervention targeting low-income families, and two were fa mily-based interventions targeting non-obese children of obese or overweight parents.Six of the ten long-term studies combined dietary education and physical activity interventions; five resulted in no difference in overweight status 20 Resultat between groups and one resulted in improvements for girls receiving the intervention, but not boys. Two studies focused on physical activity alone. Of these, a multi-media approach appeared to be effective in preventing obesity. Two studies fo cused on nutrition education alone, but neither were effective in preventing obesity.Four of the twelve short-term studies focused on in terventions to increase physical activity levels, and two of these studies resulted in mi nor reductions in overweight status in favour of the intervention. The other eight studies combined advice on diet and physical activity, but none had a significant impact.The stud ies were heterogeneous in terms of stud y design, quality, target population, theoretical underpinning, and outcome measures, maki ng it impossible to combine study findings using statistical methods. There was an absence of co st-effectiveness data. AUTH ORS' CONCLUSIONS: The majority of studies were short-te rm. Studies that focused on combining dietary and physical activity approaches did not significantly improv e BMI, but some studies that focused on dietary or physical activity approaches showed a small but positive impact on BMI status. Nearly all studies included resulted in some improvement in diet or physical activity. Appropriaten ess of development, design, duration and intensity of interventions to prevent obesity in childhood needs to be reconsidered alongside comprehensive reporting of the intervention scope and process. INTERV ENTIONS FOR PREVENTING OBESITY IN CHILDREN: The current evidence suggests that many diet and exercise interventions to prevent obesity in children are not effective in preventing weight gain, but can be effective in promoting a healthy diet and increased physical activity levels.Being very overweight (obese) can cause health , psychological and social problems for children. Children who are obese are more likely to have weight and health problems as adults. Programmes designed to prevent obesity focus on modifying one or more of the factors considered to promote obesity.This review included 22 studies that tested a variety of intervention programmes, which involved increased physical activity and dietary changes, singly or in combination. Participants were under 18 and living in Asia, South America, Europe or North America. There is not enough evidence from trials to prove that any one particular programme can prevent obesity in children, although comprehensive strategies to address dietary and physical activity change, together with psycho-social support and environmental change may help. There was a trend for newer interventions to involve their respective communities and to include evaluations.Future research might usefully assess changes made on behalf of entire populations, such as improvemen ts in the types of foods available at schools and in the availability of safe places to run and play, and should assess heal th effects and costs over several years.The programmes in this review used different strategies to prevent obesity so direct comparisons were difficult. Also, the duration of the studies ranged from 12 weeks to three years, but most lasted less than a year SPISEFORSTYRRELSER 1. Dalle GR. School-based prevention programs for eating disorders: achievements and opportunities. Disease Management an d Health Outcomes 2003;11:579-93. Abstract: Scarce resources are dedicated to research on school-based pr evention programs for eating disorders. Despite this, however, re cent years have witnessed an abundance of publications on controlled prevention trials. We now have a cumulative body of knowledge available to guide future developments in the prevention of eating disorders. Medline and PsychInfo were searched for the years 1985-2002 to find relevant publications for this review. Nineteen universal and ten targeted school-based prevention programs were identified and then evaluated. The results obtained by the controlled trials evaluated reassure parents, teachers, and stakeholders in the healthcare sector that school-based eating disorder prevention programs do not have harmful effects on student attitudes and behaviors. Targeted prevention programs have obtained promising results in high-risk individuals. Other positive effects have been obtained using an interactive format. Universal prevention programs have unfortunately been disappointing in their ability to change unhealthy beha viors. Results can be impr oved by gaining a greater understanding of those risk factors which are most stro ngly linked to eating diso rders and most susceptible to change. A broad range of interventions is needed for further consideration. Promising results from the field of eating disorder prevention and from modern risk factor resear ch could build a new generation of universal prevention trials for eati ng disorders without the methodological limitations seen in the current literature and with real effectiveness in achieving the goal of reducing the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population. 2. Seierstad A, Langengen of teen-tot programs: co mprehensive clinical care for young parents and their childr en. Adolescence 2001;36(142):381-93. Abstract: Comprehensive clinical programs for teenage mothers and their children, also known as teen-tot programs, have been a promising inte rvention to improve outcomes of te enage childbearing and parenting. However, much remains unknown regarding the efficacy of such programs. We reviewed four published evaluations of programs that provid ed medical care, counseli ng, contraception, guidance for parenting, and assistance with staying in school. The evaluations reported moderate success in preventing repeat pregnancies, helping teen mothers continue their education, and improving teen and infant health over 6 to 18 months. However, the evaluations had limitation s that may have reduced or accentuated observed effectiveness. Teen-tot programs will continue to face the challenges of sustaining adequate long-term interventions and evaluations, and reducing the high attrition rate among program participants. It is concluded that increased support an d funding for teen-tot programs an d more complete evaluations are warranted. 2. Dennis CL, Creedy D. Psychosocial and ps depression. remains unclear, with extensive research suggesting a multi-factorial aetiolog y. However, epidemiological studie s and meta-analyses of predictive studies have consistently demonstrated the importance of psychosocial and psychological variables. While interventions based on these variables may be effective treatment strategies, theoretically they may also be used in pregnancy and the early postpartum period to prevent postpartum depression. OBJECTIVES: Primary: to assess the effect of diverse psychosocial and psychological interventions compared with usual antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum care to redu ce the risk of developing postpartum depression. Secondary: to examine (1) the effectiveness of specific types of psychosocial and psychological interventions, (2) the effectiveness of individual versus group-based interventions, (3) the effects of intervention onset and duration, and (4) whether interventions are more effective in women selected with specific risk factors. SEARCH STRATEGY: We sear ched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 27 2004), the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group trials register (October 2003), the Cochrane Cent ral Register of Controlled Trials (October 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2004), EMBASE (1980 to 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to 2004). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRIT ERIA: All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials of acceptable quality comparing a ps ychosocial or psychological intervention with usual antenatal, intrapartum, or postpartum care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both reviewers participated in the evaluation of methodological qu ality and data extraction. Additional information was sought from several trial researcher s. Results are presented using relati ve risk for categorical data and weighted mean difference for cont inuous data. MAIN RESULTS: Fift een trials, involving over 7600 women, were included. Overall, women who received a psychosocial intervention were equally likely to develop postpartum depression as those receiving standard care (relative risk (RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.02). One pr omising intervention appears to be th e provision of intensive postpartum support provided by public health nurses or midwiv es (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84). (RR 0.67, CI 0.51 with only a postnatal component a ppeared to be more beneficial (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.98) than interventions that also incorporated an antenatal component. While individually-based interventions may be more effective (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.00) than those that ar e group-based, wo men who received multiple-contact intervention were just as likely to experience po stpartum depression as those who received a single-contact intervention. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall psychosocial interventions do not reduce the numbers of women who develo p postpartum depression. However, a promising intervention is the provisio n of intensive, professionally-based postpartum support. 3. Doughty, C. Effective strategies for promoting attachment between young children and their parents. Christchurch: New Zealand Health Technology Assessment (NZHTA), 2007. Abstract: Author's objectives: This Technical Brief aimed to systematically identify and appraise international evidence on the effectiveness of spec ific interventions for prom oting attachment between young children and their pare nts. Author's conclusions: Changes reported in attachment security were generally in a direction consistent with attachment theo ry; however effect sizes were relatively modest. Less broad interventions that target sensitive maternal be haviour are among those that are the most successful both at improving insensitive parent ing and promoting better infant at tachment security. Results suggest that the most effective interventions do not always us e a large number of sessions with families, in fact fewer contacts may be more effective. There is good evidence supporting the use of behaviourally focused interventions and these types of interventions, with or without video feedback are effective regardless of the presence or absence of multiple problems in the family. Highly intensive interventions with numerous 22 Resultat sessions focusing on sensitivity, representation and support may not be as effective as less intensive approaches. Overall, evidence from primary and seco ndary research shows that a variety of types of intervention for enhancing maternal sensitivity and to a lesser extent attachment security are effective, with nearly all of the studies appraised in this review involving the use of some form of home visiting to deliver the intervention. 4.

Systematic review of the literature on postpartum care: effectiveness of interventions for smoking relapse prevention , cessation, and reduct ion in postpartum women. 2007;34(4):341-7. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many women stop smoking duri ng pregnancy and relapse again either later in the pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Smoking is harmful to mothers, and environmental tobacco smoke is harmful for children. This systematic review examined the published evidence for the effectiveness of postpartum interven tions that prevent relapse (current persons who have stopped but start smoking again), improve cessation rates (current smokers who stop smoking), and reduce smoking (number of cigarettes smoked per day) in postpartum women. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials of interventions initiated from immediately after birth to 1 year in postpartum women. The init ial literature search was done in 1999 and enhanced in 2003 and 2005. Rand omized controlled trials that examined relapse prevention, smoking cessation, or smoking reduction interventions in the postpartum period were reviewed in this report. Data were extracte d in a systematic manner, and the quality of each study was reviewed. RESULTS: Five papers were publ ished based on three trials for which data were extracted and summarized. Our review of these trials showed no stat istically significant benefits of advice materials and counseling interventions in hospital (Vancouver), pediatricians' offices (Portland), or child health centers (Stockholm) on relapse prevention, cessation rates, or smoking redu ction in the postpartum period. Although the interventions had little effect on the ma jor smoking outcomes, some positive attitudinal and knowledge changes were reported. CONCLUSION: This review found no evidence from the randomized controlled trial literature to date to support implem enting postpartum smoking cessation interventions, such as providing advice materials and counseling, insofar as they were delivered in the trials reviewed. 5.

Priest N, Roseby R, Waters E, Polnay A, Ca mpbell R, Spencer N, et al. Family and carer smoking control programmes for reducing chil dren's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Cochrane Database of Systematic Revie ws cigarette smok e (environmental tobacco smoke, or ETS) is associated with a range of adverse health outcomes for children. Parental smoking is a common source of children's exposure to ETS. Preventing exposure to cigarette smoke in infancy and childhood has significant potential to improve childr en's health worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of interventions aiming to reduce exposure of children to ETS. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addict ion Group trials register and cond ucted additional searches of two health and education databases not included in this sp ecialised register. Date of the most recent search: October 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Interventions tested using controlled trials with or without random allocation were included in this re view if the interventions addressed participants (parents and other family members, child care workers and te achers) involved with the care and education of infants and young children (aged 0-12 years). All me chanisms for reduction of childr en's environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and smoking prevention, cessation, and control programmes were included. These include smoke-free policies and legislation, health promotion, social-behavioural therapies, technology, education and clinical interventions. DATA COLLECTION AN D ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies and extracted data. Due to heterogeneity of methodologies an d outcomes, no summary measures were possible and results were sy nthesised using narrative summaries. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Four inte rventions were targeted at populations or community settings, 16 studies were conducted in the 'well ch ild' healthcare setting and 13 in th e 'ill child' healthcare setting. Two further studies conducted in paediatr ic clinics do not make clear whether the visits are to well or ill children, and another includes both well and ill child visits. Nineteen of these studies are from North America and 12 in other high income countries. Five studies are from lo w- or middle-income countries. In 17 of the 36 studies there was reduction of ETS exposure for children in both intervention and comparison groups. In only 11 of the 36 studies was there a statistically significant intervention effect. Four of these successful studies employed intensive counselling inte rventions targeted to smoking parents. We found little evidence of difference in effectiveness of interventions between the well infant, child respiratory illness and other child illness settings as contexts for parental smoking cessation interventions. One 23 Resultat successful intervention was in the school setting, ta rgeting the ETS exposure of children from smoking fathers. AUTHORS' CONCLU SIONS: While brief counselling interventions have been identified as successful ifor adults when delivered by physicians, this cannot be extrapol ated to adults as parents in child health settings. However, there is limited support fo r more intensive counselling interventions for parents in such contexts. There is no clear evidence of differences between the respiratory, non-respiratory ill child, well child and peripartum settings as contexts for reduction of children's ETS exposure. CAN INTERVENTIONS FOR PARENTS AND PEOPLE CA RING FOR CHILDREN REDUCE CHILDREN'S EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO SMOKE: Currently the evidence does not determine which interventions are most effective for decreasing parental smoking and preventing exposure to tobacco smoke in childhood. Children exposed to cigarette smoke are at greater risk of lung problems, infections and serious complications including sudden infant death syndrome. Preventing exposure to cigarette smoke in infancy and childhood might therefore significantly improve children's health worldwide. Although several interventions, including parental ed ucation and counselling programmes, ha ve been used to try to reduce children's tobacco smoke exposure, their effectiveness has not been clearly demonstrated. The review was unable to determine that one intervention reduced pa rental smoking and child ex posure more effectively than others, although four studies were identified that reported intensive counselling provided in clinical settings was effective. 7.

DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004493.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is evidence that children's decisions to smoke are influenced by family and friends. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiven ess of interventions to help family members to strengthen non-smoking attitudes and promote non- smoking by children and other family members. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched 14 electronic biblio graphic databases, includ ing the Cochrane Tobacco regist er, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We also searched unpublished material, and the reference lists of key articles. We perf ormed both free-text Internet searches and targeted searches of appropriate web sites, and we hand-searched key journals not available electronically. We also consulted authors and experts in the field. The most recent search was performed in November 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions with children (aged 5-12) or adolescent s (aged 13-18) and family members to deter the use of tobacco. The primary outcome was the effect of the intervention on the smoking status of children who reported no use of tobacco at baseline. Included tria ls had to report outcomes measured at least six months from the start of the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We reviewed all potentially relevant citations and retrieved the full text to determine whether the study was an RCT and matched our inclusion criteria. Two authors independently ex tracted study data and assessed them fo r methodological quality. The studies were too limited in number and qual ity to undertake a formal meta-analysis, and we present a narrative synthesis. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 22 RCTs of family interventions to prevent smoking. We identified six RCTs in Category 1 (minimal risk of bias on all counts); ten in Category 2 (a risk of bias in one or more areas); and six in Category 3 (risks of bias in design and execution such that reliable conclusions cannot be drawn from the study).Consi dering the sixteen Category 1 and 2 studies together: (1) four of the nine that tested a family intervention against a co ntrol group had significant positive effects, but one showed significant negative effects; (2) one of the fi ve RCTs that tested a family intervention against a school intervention had significant positive effects; (3) none of the seven that compared the incremental effects of a family plus a school programme to a sch ool programme alone had significant positive effects; (4) the one RCT that tested a family tobacco interventi on against a family non-tobacco safety intervention showed no effects; and (5) the trial that used genera l risk reduction interventions found the group which received the parent and teen interventions had less smoking than the one that received only the teen intervention, and in the trial of CD -ROMs to reduce alcohol use, both groups which received the alcohol reduction intervention had less smok ing than the control. In neither tr ial was there a tobacco intervention, but tobacco outcomes were measured.For the included trials the amount of implementer training and the fidelity of implementation are related to positive ou tcomes, but the number of sessions is not. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Some well-executed RCTs show family interventions may prevent adolescent smoking, but RCTs which were less well executed had mostly neutral or negative results. There is thus a need for well-designed and executed RCTs in this area. DOES PREVENTING CHILDREN FROM STARTING TO SMOKE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DAMAGING THEIR HEALTH BY SMOKING: Children and adolescents' likelihood of starting to smoke may be in fluenced by the behaviour of their families, and it may be possible to help family members strengthen non-smoking attitudes and promote non-smoking in children and other family members. Some high quality studies show that family interventions may help to prevent adolescent smoking, but le ss well-conducted trials had mostly neutral or negative findings. How well the programme staff are trained and how well they deliver the progra mme may be related to effectiveness, but the number of sessions in the programme does not seem to make a difference 24 Resultat TIDLIG INTERVENSJON 1.

Abstract: Author's objectives: To determine the effectiveness of pu blic health, health promotion, and primary care strategies to reduce or prevent the incidence of low birth weight in infants born to adolescents up to 19 years of age. Author's conclusions: Some home- and clinic-based inte rventions that focus on health education and support strategies directed to pregnant adolescents can have significant effects on reducing low birth weight in infants. More rigorous re search, including studies that benefit from the adolescents&apos; input, is needed to determine the appropriate philosophy underlying effective interventions, as well as to evaluate adolescent-specific interventions. 2. Hodnett ED, Fredericks S. Support during preg nancy for women at increased risk of low birthweight babies. Cochrane Database of Sy stematic CD000198. DOI: Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies consistently show a relationship between soci al disadvantage and low birthweight. Many countries have prog rams offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk for giving birth to a low birthweight infant. These programs may include advice and counseling (about nutrition, rest, stress management , alcohol and recreational drug use), tangible assistance (eg transportation to clinic appointments, help with ho usehold responsibilities), and emotional support. The programs may be delivered by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, by specially trained lay workers, or by a combination of lay and professional workers. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of programs offering a dditional social support for pregnant women who are believed to be at risk for giving birth to pret erm or low birthweight babies. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (30 September 2005). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials of additional support during at-risk pregnancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, or nurse) or specially trained lay person, compared to routine care. Additional support was defined as some form of emotional support (eg counseling, re assurance, sympathetic listening) and information or advice or both, either in home vi sits or during clinic appointments, and could include tangible assistance (eg transportation to clinic appointments, assistance with the care of other children at home). DATA COLLECTION AND ANAL YSIS: We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Double data entry was performed. We contacted study authors to request additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen trials, involving 12,658 women, were included. The tr ials were generally of good to excellent quality, although three used an allocation method likely to introduce bias. Programs offering additional social support for at-risk pregnant wome n were not associated with improvements in any perinatal outcomes, but there was a reduction in the likelihood of caesarean birth and an increased likelihood of elective termination of pregnancy. Some improvements in immediate maternal psychosocial outcomes were found in individual trials. AUTHOR S' CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women need the support of caring family members, friends, and health pr ofessionals. While programs which offer additional support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or preterm baby, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of caesarean birth. SUPPORT DURING PREGNANCY FOR WOMEN AT INCREASED RISK OF LOW BIRTHWEIGHT BABIES : Programs offering additional support during pregnancy were not effectiv e in reducing number of babies born too early and babies with low birthweights.Babies born to mothers in socially disadvantaged situations are more likely to be small and so have health prob lems. Programs providing emotional support, practical assistance, and advice have been offered in addition to usual care. Women who received additional support during pregnancy were less likely to have a caesarean birth an d some were more likely to choose to terminate the pregnancy. However, the additional su pport did not reduce the likelihood of giving birth too early or that the baby was smaller than expected. There may be benefits in terms of lower anxiety and feeling better about their care. 3. Kakad M.

Oslo: Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter fra helsetjenesten, 2006. 2006. http://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/Publikasjoner/1034.cms Abstract: Background: Norwegian author ities wish to approach small chil dren in families at risk more systematically and proactively. This summary of available research will be a part of a larger report that evaluates one of the initiatives in the Government's Action plan for ch ild and adolescent mental health. Main question: What is the effect of early intervention on the mental health of small children (aged three and under) in families at risk? Method: We searched for systematic reviews and health technology assessments of randomised controlled trials of early interventions evaluated and recommended internationally. We looked for reviews that attempted to assess the effect on mental health in small children 25 Resultat aged three years or less in families at risk. Results: We included five sy stematic reviews, but none of them evaluated mental health outcomes in small children. Based on these systematic reviews, we identified 11 relevant randomised trials, most of which report ed cognitive or behavioural outcomes. Population, intervention and outcomes varied a lot between these studies. Conclusion: This summary shows that there is currently little systematic research available on the effect of early interventions on the mental health of small children aged three years or less. Thus it is not possible to conclude what effect early interventions may have on the mental health of small children. We found some evid ence that developmental programs aimed at teenage mothers and their children can benefit the children's cognitive development. The research also indicates that educational programs for parents can improve behaviour for ch ildren with behavioural problems, but this does not include autistic children. 4. Kelsey A, Robinson M.

Health Technol Assess 2001;8(32):iii-iix. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine whether increased postnatal support could influence maternal and child health outcomes. DESIGN: This was a randomis ed controlled trial compar ing maternal and child health outcomes for women offered either of the support interventions with those for control women receiving standard services only. Outcome data were collected through questionnaires distributed 12 and 18 months postrandomisation. Process data were also collected. There was also an integral economic evaluation. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Women living in deprived enumeration districts in selected London boroughs were eligible for the trial if they gave birth between 1 January and 30 September 1999. RESULTS: The 731 participants were found to be well matched in terms of socio-economic characteristics and health and support variables (14% of the particip ants were non-English speaking). Response rates at the two follow-up points were 90% and 82%. At both points there were no differences that could not be attributed to chance on the primary outcomes of matern al depression, child injury or maternal smoking. At the first follow-up, there was reduced use of general pr actitioners by support health visitor (SHV) children, but increased use of NHS health visitors and social workers by mothers. At the second follow-up, both community group support (CGS) and SHV mothers ha d less use of midwifery services (fewer were pregnant), and SHV mothers were less worried about th eir child's health and deve lopment. Uptake of the CGS intervention was low: 19%, compared with 94 % for the SHV intervention. Satisfaction with the intervention among women in the SHV group was high . Based on the assumptions and conditions of the costing methods, the economic evaluation found no net economic cost or benefit of choosing either of the two interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of impact on the primary outcomes of either intervention. The SHV intervention was popular with women, and was associated with improvement in some of the secondary outcomes. This suggests that greater emphasis on the social support role of health visitors could improve some measures of family well-being. Possible areas for future research include a systematic review of social support and its effect on health; developing and test ing other postnatal models of support that match more closely the age of the baby and the changing patterns of mothers' needs; evaluating other strategies for mobilising 'non-professional' suppo rt; developing and testing more culturally specific support interventi ons; developing more culturally a ppropriate standardised measures of 26 Resultat health outcomes; providing longer term follow-up of social support interv entions; and exploring the role of social support on the delay in subsequent pregnancy.

Abstract: Author's objectives: To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of peer and paraprofessional one- to-one (1:1) interventions targeted towards mothers (parents) of 0 to 6 year old children in promoting positive maternal (parental) and/ or child health and developmenta l outcomes. Author's conclusions: Peer/paraprofessional 1:1 interventions can have a positive impact on child development and parent child interaction, particularly wh en the intervention is of high intensity beginning in the antenatal period and the peer/paraprofessional intervention is embedded in multifaceted interventions. The evidence is tentative for an impact on health care utilisatio n, child health status, child abuse and neglect, and maternal psychosocial health status. The long-term effect remains unknown.

Dundas, ON, Canada: Ontario Ministry of Health, Region of Hamilton-Wentworth, Social and Public Health Services Divis ion. Effective Public Health Practice Project, 1999. Abstract: Objectives: Children attending day care ce ntres have been shown to be at greater risk to acquire infections than children cared for in the family home environment. The ch allenge to health unit staff is to ensure that the day care centre providers are aware of infection prevention and control practices and that the appropriate measures are taken to protect themselves and the children attending the day care centres. The purpose of this study was to summarize evidence on the effectiveness of infe ction control interventions in day care ce ntres. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed. Retrieved articles were relevance tested, and those that passed were then assessed for quality and the data extracted and synthesized. Results: Of the 13 relevant articles captured, three were rated 'moderate' and included in this review. The remaining ten articles rated as 'weak', and were excluded. The three interventions identified and found to be effective included: 1) educational sessions with frequent reinforcement of practices, 2) immunization status monitoring and follow-up by public health nurses, and 3) exclusion and treatment policies for controlling Giardia infections. In the third intervention, a strict exclusion and treatment policy, was found to be no more effective in preventing Giardia infections than two other less stringent exclusion and treatment policies. Conclusions: Evidence was found that some public health infection prevention and control practice interventions are effective in day care centre settings. 3. Zoritch B, Roberts I, Oakley A. Day care fo r pre-school children. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2000, Issue 3. Art. No.: CD000564. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000564. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The debate about how, where and by whom young children should be looked after is one which has occupied much social policy an d media attention in recent years. Mothers undertake most of the care of young children . Internationally, out-of-home day-ca re provision ranges widely. These different levels of provision are not simply a response to different levels of dema nd for day-care, but reflect cultural and economic interests concerning the welfare of children, the need to promote mothers' participation in paid work, and the im portance of socialising children into society's values. At a time when a 27 Resultat decline in family values is held responsible for a range of social problems, the day-care debate has a special prominence. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the effects of out-of-home day-care for preschool children on educational, health and welfare outcomes for children and their families. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised controlled trials of day-care for pre-school children were identified using electronic databases, hand searches of relevant literature, and contact with authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included in the review if the intervention involved th e provision of non-parental day care for children under 5 years of age, and the evaluation design was that of a randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trial. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A total of eight trials were identified after examining 920 abstracts and 19 books. The trials were assessed for methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: Day-care increases children's IQ, and has beneficial effects on behavioural development and school achievement. Long-term follow up demonstrates increased employment, lower teenage pregnancy rates, higher socio-economic status and decreased criminal behaviour. There are positive effects on mothers' education, employment and interaction with children. Effects on fathers have not been examined. Few studies look at a range of outcomes spanning the health, education and welfare do mains. Most of the trials combined non-parental day-care with some element of parent training or education (mostly targeted at mothers); they did not disentangle the possible effects of these two interventions. The trials had other significant methodological weaknesses, pointing to the importance of improving on st udy design in this field. All the trials were carried out in the USA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Day care has beneficial effect on children's development, school success and adult life patterns. To date, a ll randomised trials have been conducted among disadvantaged populations in the USA. The extent to wh ich the results are generaliseable to other cultures and socioeconomic groups has yet to be evaluated. DAY CARE FOR PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN: Day care has beneficial effect on children's development, school success and adult li fe patterns. Howeve r, to date, all randomised trials have been conduc ted among disadvantaged populations in the USA. The extent to which the results are generaliseable to other cultures and socioeconomic groups has no t yet been established. SKADER/ULYKKER (FOREBYGGING) 1. Kendrick D, Barlow J, Hampshire A, Stewart-Brown S, Polnay L. Parenting interventions and the prevention of unintent ional injuries in childhood: systematic review and meta- analysis. Child Care Health Dev 2008;34(5):682-95. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of parenting interventions in preventing unintentional injury and increasing parental safety practices. DATA SOURCES: A range of medical and social science electronic databases were searched. Abstracts from the fi rst to seventh World conferences on injury prevention and control and the journal Injury Prevention were hand searched. REVIEW METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCT s) and controlled before and after studies, providing parenting interventions to parents of children aged 0-18 years and reporting injuries, safety equipment or safety practices were included. Studies were selected, data extracted and quality appraised independently by two reviewers. Pooled relative risks were esti mated using random effect models. RESULTS: Fifteen studies ( 11 RCTs) were included, 11 of which were home visiting programmes and two of which were paediatric prac tice-based interventions. Thirteen studies recruited families at risk of adverse child health outcomes. Interv ention arm families had a significan tly lower risk of injury (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95), as measured by self-report of medically or non- medically attended injury. Several studies found fewer home hazards, a home environment more conducive to child safety, or a greater number of safety practices in intervention arm fa milies. CONCLUSIONS: Parent ing interventions, most commonly provided within the home, us ing multi-faceted interventions appe ar to be effective in reducing unintentional child injury. Further research is required to expl ore the mechanisms by which parenting interventions reduce injury, the feat ures of interventions that are nece ssary to reduce injury, and their generalizability to different population groups. 2. NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Prev enting unintentional injuries in children and young adolescents. Eff He alth Care 1996;2(5): 1-16. Abstract: Background: Accidental injury to children and young adolescents was a major public health problem receiving little attention at national or in ternational level. The prev ention of accidents was identified as a key area in Health of the Nation, which set a target of reducing the death rate for adolescents by one third by the year 2005. This review of world literature on the subject of childhood accidents, was commissioned with a view to providing information about the most effective health promotion interventions. Findings: - A Health of the Nation targ et is to reduce by one third the death rate from unintentional injury in children aged 14 and under by the year 2005. - There is good evidence that the use of cycle helmets and child care seat re straints can reduce serious injury to children involved in road traffic accidents. - Urban road safety measures such as the provision of crossing patrollers, measures to redistribute traffic and improve the safety of individual roads can reduce the rate and severity of childhood accidents. - The use of safety devices in the home su ch as smoke detectors, chil d restraint containers and 28 Resultat thermostat control for tap water can reduce the risks of home injuries. Targeting of households at higher risk combined with home visits, education and the free distribution of devices is likely to make the most impact. - Educational programmes by themselves appear to have little effect . However, a number of community programmes which involve local participation and use a broad range of interventions have been effective at reducing childhood injuries from a wide va riety of causes. These need to be based on accurate data derived from surveillance systems. SCREENING 1. Cuijpers P, Van Straten A, Smits N, Smit F. Screening and early psychological intervention for depression in schools: Systematic re view and meta-analysis. Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 2006;15(5):300-7. Abstract: Depression in children and adolescents is considerably undertreated, and the school may be a good setting for identifying and treating depression . We conducted a meta-analy sis of studies in which students were screened for depression, and those with depressive symptoms were treated with a psychological intervention. Only randomised controlled trials were included. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies focu sed on younger children (7-14 years) and three studies were aimed at adolescents (12-19 years). In total 5803 students were screened, of whom 7.2% were included in the intervention studies (95% CI: 7.1-7.3). The 'numbers-needed-to-screen' was 31 (95% CI: 27-32), which means that 31 students had to be screened in order to generate one successfully tr eated case of depression. The effects of the psychological treatments at post-test were compared to control conditions in the 8 studies comprising 12 contrast groups, with a total of 413 students. The mean effe ct size was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35-0.76). There were not enough studies to examine whether specific psychotherapies were superior to other psychotherapies. Although the number of studies is small and thei r quality is limited, screening and early intervention at schools may be an effective strategy to reduce the burden of disease from depression in children and adolescents. More research on the (negative) effects of these interventions is needed. 2. Davis A, Bamford J, Wilson I, Ramkalawan T, Forshaw M, Wright S.

Law J, Boyle J, Harris F, Harkness A, Nye C. Screening for speech and language delay: A systematic review of the literature. Health Technol Assess (Rockv) 1998;2(9):vii-179. Abstract: Background: This report concerns the identification and treatment of children with primary speech and language dela ys, that is delays which cannot be attribut ed to other conditions such as hearing loss or other more general developm ental disabilities. Such delays are important because they cause concern to parents, because they are commonly associated with behavioural and other difficulties in the pre-school period and because they constitute a risk factor for subsequent poor school performance, and for a wide range of personal and social difficulties fo r the individuals concerned. It is unclear, given the current state of knowledge, whether such delays repres ent varying levels of a single condition or a number of different conditions with diverse aetiologies. Curr ently the identification and treatment of speech and language delays fall within the remit of the health services in the early years of life and most health trusts have in place informal procedures for identifying such delays. The educational services and those responsible for providing nursery and child-care servic es also have a considerable role to play in the process of identification and management of these children. This review aims to provide the information needed to help decide whether universal screening for speech and language delays should be implemented within the NHS. Objectives: Four domains (prevalence, natural history, intervention and screening) were identified as being key to a review of screening issues, with the following objectives being stated: to undertake a systematic review of research into the value of screening and intervention for speech and language delays in children up to the age of 7 years; to identify priority areas in need of further investigation; to provide evidence-based direction for the future provision of services. Methods: The review was carried out using structured guidelines for systematic reviews. These are described in detail in the full report. Results: Prevalence: The number of potential cases of primary speech and language delay is high, with a median figure of 5.95% reported for delays in either speech or language. There has been little attempt to tie this evidence into prediction of subsequent case status, and there is little published evidence to support the perception that either the total number of children with la nguage delay declines in real terms across the age range, or that prevalence has been rising over recent years. Natural history: The natural history data indicate that a substantial proportion of children identified on the basis of expressive delay alone are likely to have difficulties which resolve spontaneously in the pre-school period. However, the data do not, at this stage, make it possible to predict at the time of identification, which of the children with expressive delay are likely to have persistent problems. A poorer prognosis has been consistently identified for children with expressive/receptive delays. The picture for older children is clouded by the lack of evidence from samples that have received no additional educational or therapeutic support. Nonetheless it is clear from follow-up studies of treated samples that children identified as having language difficulties in the first year of primary school ar e likely to have difficulties which persist through to secondary school. Intervention: Results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental designs reveal positive and statistically significant effects of interven tion relative to untreated controls in all areas of speech and language skills. Comparab le results for direct (clinician-a dministered) and indirect treatment were observed in the case of expressive language. In contrast, direct intervention was more effective in the case of speech, whereas indirect intervention was more effective in the case of receptive language. Data from the single-subject experimental designs were synthesised and provide confirmatory evidence for the positive effects of intervention. The data in particular provide evidence for the generalisation of treatment effects. However, the data reviewed do not provide information about long-term outcomes of intervention, nor of the likelihood of intervention reducing prevalence in a given population. Similarly, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effects of subject variab les such as socio-economic status or age upon the relative value of interventions. Screening: The screening evidence indicates that, although a considerable number of assessments have been shown to perform ad equately in terms of their productivity, few studies compare the performance of two or more screening tests when applied to one population, nor do they compare single screening measures across different populations. It is difficult, therefore, to make judgements about the relative value of different procedures. In general, specificity is higher than sensitivity, suggesting that it is easier to determine who is not a case than to establish who is. Parent-focused measures appear to be as useful as specific tests of child be haviour. Interpretation is further complicated by the considerable variation in the cut-offs adopted on the range of reference 'gold-standard' measures, suggesting that there remains considerable disagreement as to what proportion of the population should be considered cases. There have been no explicit attempts to benchmark the target population in terms of prevalence estimates, the prediction of case status or the impact of the intervention. Conclusions: It is clear that early speech and language delay should be a cause for concern to those involved with child health surveillance because of the problems for the individual child, because it may in dicate other co- morbid conditions such as hearing loss, de velopmental and behavioural difficultie s, and because of the implications it may have for literacy and socialisation in school. The fact that there is not sufficient evidence to merit the introduction of universal screening does not imply that speech and language delay should not be identified, for example, by less formal methods. Implications for policy: The review suggests that more attention might be shown to the role of parents in identifying ch ildren with speech and lang uage delay. Primary-care workers (health visitors, general practitioners, school nurses and nursery staff) should be involved in eliciting parental concerns and in making approp riate observations of children's communication behaviours. This would require formal training in delayed speech and langua ge development and risk factors pertaining to it. Appropriate information would also have to be made available to parents to allow them to play an active role in judging need. Given the reported value of indirect approaches to intervention there is a case for widening the range of professionals able to promote good interactive practice in parents 30 Resultat of young children. Speech and language therapists as a pr ofessional group are in a good position to play an active role in disseminating this information and coor dinating such services. Children who do not respond to such primary prevention could then be given access to speech and language therapy services and appropriately structured nursery input. Recommendations for research: There are many gaps in the literature, and the review identified a number of research priorities. The impact of speech and language delay needs to be examined, both as an explanatory and a response variable across time in prospective cohort studies. RCTs need to be designed to exam ine the medium- and long-ter m effects of well described models of intervention. These should include an appropriate range of outcome measures including, where possible, economic analysis. There is a need for the development of a screening measure that combines data on risk factors with parental report and professional observation, and for the examination of its value in different sections of the population. The predictive ability of different models of early identification and intervention needs to be examined . Further details of conclusions and recommendations are given in the full report. 7.

National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment. Current practice, accuracy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the school entry hearing screen. Health Technol Assess (Rockv) 2007;11(32):1-168, iii-iv. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To describe and analyse in detail current practice of school entry hearing screening (SES) in the UK. DATA SOURCES: Main elec tronic databases were se arched up to May 2005. REVIEW METHODS: A national postal questionnaire survey was addressed to all leads for SES in the UK, considering current practice in terms of implementa tion, protocols, target population and performance data. Primary data from cohort studies in one area of London were examined. A systematic review of alternative SES tests, test performance and impact on outcomes was carried out. Finally, a review of published studies on costs, plus economic modelling of current and alternative programmes was prepared. RESULTS: The survey suggested that SES is used in mo st of England, Wales and Scotland; just over 10% of respondents have abandoned the screen; others are awaiting national guidance. Coverage of SES is variable, but is often over 90% for children in state schools. Referral rates are variable, with a median of about 8%. The test used for the screen is the pu re tone sweep test but with wide variation in implementation, with differing frequencies, pass crit eria and retest protocols; written examples of protocols were often poor and ambigu ous. There is no national approach to data collection, audit and quality assurance, and there are variable approaches at local level. The screen is performed in less than ideal test conditions and resources are often limited, which has an impact on the quality of the screen. The primary cohort studies show that th e prevalence of permanent childhood hearing loss continues to increase through infancy. Of the 3.47 in 1000 children with a permanent hearin g loss at school screen age, 1.89 in 1000 required identification after the newborn screen. Newb orn hearing screening is likely to reduce significantly the yield of SES for permanent bilateral and unilateral hearing impairments; yield had fallen from about 1.11 in 1000 before newb orn screening to about 0.34 in 1 000 for cohorts that had had newborn screening, of which only 0.07 in 1000 were unilateral impairment s. Just under 20% of permanent moderate or greater bilateral, mild bilateral and unilateral impairments, known to services as 6-year-olds or older, remained to be identified around the time of school entry. No good-quality published comparative trials of alternative screens or tests for SES were iden tified and studies concerned with the relative accuracy of alternative tests are difficult to compare and o ften flawed by differing re ferral criteria and case definitions; with full pure tone audiometry as the refe rence test, the pure tone sweep test appears to have high sensitivity and high specificity for minimal, mild and greater hearing im pairments, better than alternative tests for which evidence was identified. There is insufficient evidence regarding possible harm of the screen. There were no published studies identified that examined the possible effects of SES on longer term outcomes. No good-quality published ec onomic evaluations of SES were identified and a universal SES based on pure tone sweep tests was associ ated with higher costs and slightly higher quality- adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with no screen and other screen alternatives; the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio for such a screen is around 2500 pounds per QALY gained; the range of expected costs, QALYs and net benefits was broad, indicating a considerable degree of uncertainty. Targeted screening could be more cost-effective than universal school entry screening; however, the lack of primary data and the wide limits for variables in the modelling mean th at any conclusions must be considered indicative and exploratory only. A national screening programme fo r permanent hearing impairment at school entry meets all but three of the criteria for a screening programme, but at least six criteria are not met for screening for temporary hearing impa irment. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of good-quality evidence in this area remains a serious problem. Services should improve quality and audit screen performance for identification of previously unknown permanent he aring impairment, pending evidence-based policy decisions based on the research recommendations. Further research is needed into a number of important areas including the evaluation of an agreed national protocol for services delive ring SES to make future studies and audits of screen perf ormance more directly comparable. 9. Nelson H, Nygren P, McInerny Y. Scr eening for family and intimate partner violence. Systematic Evidence Review; 28. Rockville, MD, USA: Agency for Healthcare 31 Resultat Research and Quality, 2004 Abstract: Context: Family and intimate pa rtner violence occurs commonly in the U.S. and causes important health problems. Although the clinicia n's role in identification and interv ention is considered a professional and legal responsibility, the effectiveness of these efforts is unclear. Objective: To examine evidence on the performance of screening procedures and interventions in the primary care setting in reducing harm from family and intimate partner vi olence for children, women, an d elderly adults. Data Sources: MEDLINE\u00ae, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Health & Psychosocial Instruments, ERIC, AARP Ageline, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, reference lists of systematic reviews, and experts. Study Selection: Included studies had English-language abstracts, were applicable to U.S. clinical practice, described abuse and neglect in women, children, or elderly adults, were conducted in or linked to primary care, obstetrics/gynecology, or emergency department settings, and included a clinician in the process of assessment or interven tion. Data Extraction: We extracted selected information about study design, patient samples and settings, methods of a ssessment or intervention, and clinic al endpointsand applied a set of criteria to evaluate study quality. Data Synthesis: No studies directly addressed the effectiveness of screening in a healthcare setting in reducing harm, or described the adverse effects of screening and interventions. All instruments design ed to screen for child abuse and neglect were directed to parents, particularly pregnant women. These had fairly high se nsitivity but low specificity. Several brief instruments designed to identify women with intimate partner viol ence compared well to longer previously validated instruments. We found few studies of screening for elder abuse and neglect. A randomized controlled trial with 15-years follow-up indicated th at nurse home visits during pregna ncy and for 2-years postpartum for low-income women improved abuse and neglect outcomes for children . Studies of interventions for children of other ages, women who are not pregnant, and elderly adults are lacking. Conclusions: Screening and interventions for child abuse are directed to pare nts during prenatal and postpartum periods. Several brief screening instruments have been tested for wo men, but interventions are lacking. Few instruments and no interventions were identified for elderly adults. 10. Nelson HD, Nygren P, Walker M, Panoscha R. Screening for speech and language delay in preschool children: systematic evidence review for the US Prev entive Services Task Force - Screening. Pediatrics PEDIATRICS (ISSN Numbers: Print, 0031-4005; Online, 1098-4275). Published in the public domain by the American Academy of Pediatrics.Speech and language development is a useful indicator of a child's overall development and cognitive ability and is related to school success. Identification of children at risk for developmental delay or related problems may lead to intervention services and family assistance at a young age, when the chances for improvement are best. However, optimal methods for screening for speech and language delay have not been identified, and screening is practiced inconsistently in primary care. PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the strengths and limits of evidence about the effectiveness of screening and interventions for speech and language delay in preschool- aged children to determine the balance of benefits and adverse effects of routine screening in primary care for the development of guidelines by the US Preventive Services Task Force. The target population includes all children up to 5 years old wi thout previously known conditions associated with speech and language delay, such as hearing and neurologic impairments. METHODS: Studies were identified from Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (1966 to November 19, 2004), systematic reviews, reference lists, and experts. The evidence review included only English-language, published articles that are available through libraries. Only randomized, controlled trials were considered for examining the effectiveness of interventions. Outcome measures were considered if they were obtained at any time or age after screening and/or intervention as long as the initial assessment occurred while the child was 5 years old. Outcomes included speech and language measures and other functional and health outcomes such as social behavior. A total of 745 full-text articles met our eligibility criteria and we re reviewed. Data were extracted from each included study, summarized descriptively, and rated for quality by using criteria specific to different study designs developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. RESULTS: The use of risk factors for selective screening has not been evaluated, and a list of specific risk factors to guide primary care physicians has not been developed or tested. Sixteen studies about potential risk factors for speech and language delay in children enrolled heterogeneou s populations, had dissimilar inclusion and exclusion criteria, and measured different risk factors and outcomes. The most cons istently reported risk factors included a family history of speech and langua ge delay, male gender, and perinatal factors. Other risk factors reported less consistently included educational levels of the mother and father, childhood illnesses, birth order, and family size. The performance characteristics of evaluation techniques that take 10 minutes to administer were described in 24 studies relevant to screening. Studies that were ra ted good to fair quality reported wide ranges of sensitivity and specificity when compared with reference standards (sensitivity: 17-100%; specificity: 45- 100%). Most of the evaluation s, however, were not designed for screening purposes, the instruments measured different domains, and the study populations and settings were often outside of primary care. No \"gold standard\" has been developed and tested for screening, reference standards varied across studies, few studies compared the performance of 2 screening techniques in 1 population, and comparisons of a single screening technique across different populations are lacking. Fourteen good- and fair-quality randomized, controlled trials of interventions reported significantly improved speech and language outcomes compared with control groups. Improvement was demonstrated in several do mains including articulation, phonology, expressive language, rece ptive language, lexical acquisition, and syntax among children in all age groups studied and across multiple therapeutic settings. Improvement in other functional outcomes such as 32 Resultat socialization skills, self-esteem, and improved play themes were demonstrated in some, but not all, of the 4 studies that measured th em. In general, studies of interventions were small and heterogeneous, may be subject to plateau effects, and reported short-term outcomes based on various instrument s and measures. As a result, long-term outcomes are not known, interventions could not be compared directly, and generalizability is questionable. CONCLUSIONS: Use of risk factors to guide selective screening is not supported by studies. Severa l aspects of screening have been inadequately studied to determine optimal methods, including which instrument to use, the age at which to screen, and which interval is most useful. Trials of interventions demonstrate improvement in some outcome measures, but conclusions and generalizability are limited. Data are not available addressing other key issues including the effectiveness of screening in primary care settings, role of enhanced surveillance by primary care physicians before referral for diagnostic evaluation, non-speech and language and long-term benefits of interventions, and adverse effects of screening and interventions. 11.

Screening ch ildren for family violence: a review of the evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Ann Fam Med 2004;2(2):161-9. Abstract: BACKGROUND: We wanted to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening children in primary health care settings for abuse and neglect resulting from family violence by examining the evidence on the performance of screening instruments and the effectiveness of interventions. METHODS: We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and reference lists. English language abstracts with original data about family violence against children focusing on screening and interventions initiated or based in health care se ttings were included. We extracted selected information about study design , patient populations and settings, methods of assessment or intervention, and outc ome measures, and applied a set of cr iteria to evaluate study quality. RESULTS: All instruments designed to screen for child abuse and neglect were directed to parents, particularly pregnant women. These instruments had fairly high sensitivity but low specificity when administered in high-risk study populations and have not been widely tested in other populations. Randomized controlled trials of frequent nurse home visitation programs beginning during pregnancy that address behavioral and psychologica l factors indicated improved abuse measures and outcomes. No studies were identified about interventions in older children or harms associated with screening and intervention. CONCLUSIONS: No trials of the effectiveness of screen ing in a health care sett ing have been published. Clinician referrals to nurse home visitation during pregnancy and in early childhood may reduce abuse in selected populations. There are no studies ab out harms of screening and interventions. 13. Powell C, Wedner S, Hatt SR. Vision screening for correctable visual acuity deficits in school-age children and adoles cents. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 4. Art. No.: CD005023. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005023.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although the benefits of vision screening seem intuitive the value of such programmes in junior and senior sch ools has been questioned. In addition to this, there exists a lack of clarity regarding the optimum age for screening and frequency at which to carry out screening. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of vision screening programmes carried out in schools in reducing the prevalence of undetected, correctable visual acuity deficits due to refractive error in school-age children. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tria ls (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register, in The Cochrane Library (2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2006). No language or date restrictions were placed on these searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised controlled trials, in cluding randomised cluste r controlled trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors indepe ndently assessed study abstracts identified by the electronic searches. No trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: As no trials were identified, no formal analysis was perfor med. A narrative synthesis of other retrieved studies was undertaken in order to explain current practice. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At present there are no robust trials available that allow the benefits of school vision screening to be measured. The disadvantage of attending school with a visual acuity deficit also needs to be quantified. The impact of a screening programme will depend on the geograph ical and socio-economic setting in which it is conducted. There is, therefore, clearly a need for well-planned randomised controlled trials to be undertaken in various settings so that the potential benefits and harms of visi on screening can be measured. SCREENING SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS FOR REDU CED VISION CAUSED BY THE NEED FOR GLASSES: Worldwide, the leading cause of reduced vision in children is an unidentified need for them to wear glasses. The reduced vision that results from abnormal focusing (refractive error) can cause the children to screw up their eyes and complain of headaches. Reduced vision may affect academic performance, choice of occupation and socio-econom ic status in adult life. Genetic and environmental factors are known to affect the development of refracti ve error; it is also more common in certain racial groups. Short sightedness has become the commonest eye condition. The need to correct refractive error is determined by its effect on vision. Normal vision can usually be restor ed by wearing corrective glasses or contact lenses. However, there is some evidence that correction may cause an error to persist where it 33 Resultat might otherwise have resolved or reduced naturally. Vision screening is used widely but is concentrated in developed countries; in developing countries it may serve the purpose of providing access to health care. The value of screening after school entry has been queried. Programmes vary with regard to testing personnel, set threshold for failure, frequency and setting. The disability caused by a vision deficit has not been quantified and the optimum age and number of occasions for screening have not been established. The aim of this review was to find studies that ev aluated the effectiveness of school vision screening programmes in first identifying childr en with reduced vision. No eligible randomised studies were found. There is a clear need for reliable evidence to measure the effectiveness of vision screening. A narrative synthesis of other retrieved st udies was undertaken in order to explain current practice. 14. Seierstad A.

A systematic review and discussion of the evidence. Arch Dis Child 2007;92(5):416-22. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Population monitoring has been introduced in UK primary schools in an effort to track the growing obesity epidemic. It has been argued that parents should be informed of their child's results, but is there evidence that moving from monitoring to screening would be effective? We describe what is known about the effectiveness of monitoring and screening for overweight and obesity in primary school children and highlight areas where evidence is lacking and research should be prioritised. DESIGN: Systematic review with discussion of evidence gaps and future research. DATA SOURCES: Published and unpublished studies (any language) fr om electronic databases (inception to July 2005), clinical experts, Primary Care Trusts and Strategic He alth Authorities, and reference li sts of retrieved studies. REVIEW METHODS: We included any study that evaluated me asures of overweight and obesity as part of a population-level assessment and excluded studies whose primary outcome measure was prevalence. RESULTS: There were no trials assessing the effectiveness of monitoring or screening for overweight and obesity. Studies focussed on the diagnostic accuracy of measurements. Information on the attitudes of children, parents and health professionals to mo nitoring was extremely sparse. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found a lack of data on the potential impact of population monitoring or screening for obesity and more research is indicate d. Identification of effective weight reduction strategies for children and clarification of the role of preventative measures are priorities. It is difficult to see how screening to identify individual children can be justifie d without effective interventions. UNGDOMSHELSE 1. Black DR, Tobler NS, Sciacca JP. Peer helping/ involvement: an effica cious way to meet the challenge of reducing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use among youth? J Sch Health 1998;68(3):87-93. Abstract: Peer-led drug prevention programs for middle school youth are reviewed as to whether or not they are a vital resource in an overall effort to minimize the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD). The paper focuses on the following: a) results of a 120-study meta-analysis of school-based drug prevention programs and positive program features; b) considerations for falsely concluding that peer programs are ineffective; c) features of two model or stellar programs that compared interactive (peer 34 Resultat leadership) to teacher/researcher-led (non-interactive) programs that followed National Peer Helpers Association (NPHA) Programmatic Standards; and d) suggestions for designing and implementing high- quality, peer-led programs. The authors conclude that interactive peer interventions for middle school students are statistically superior to non-interactive didactic, lecture programs led by teachers/researchers. Programs implemented according to NPHA Progra mmatic Standards may elim inate Type II (false negative) and III (\"implementation failure\" or ineffectively designed and implemented program) errors. Opportunities for prudent application of well-design ed peer programs appropriately implemented and evaluated must remain a salient priority. 2. DiCenso A, Guyatt G, Willan A, Griffith L. Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomised contro lled trials. BMJ 2002;324:1426- 30. Abstract: Objective: To review the effectiveness of primary prevention strategies aimed at delaying sexual intercourse, improving use of birth control, and reducing incidence of unintended pregnancy in adolescents. Data sources: 12 electronic bibliographic databases, 10 key journals, citations of relevant articles, and contact with authors. Study selection: 26 trials de scribed in 22 published and unpublished reports that randomised adolescents to an intervention or a control group (alternate intervention or nothing). Data extraction: Two independent reviewers assessed methodological quality and abstracted data. Data synthesis: The interventions did not delay initiation of sexual intercourse in young women (pooled odds ratio 1.12; 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.30) or young men (0.99; 0.84 to 1.16); did not improve use of birth control by young women at every intercourse (0.95; 0.69 to 1.30) or at last intercourse (1.05; 0.50 to 2.19) or by young men at every intercourse (0.90; 0.70 to 1.16) or at last intercourse (1.25; 0.99 to 1.59); and did not reduce pregnancy rates in young women (1.04; 0.78 to 1.40). Four abstinence programmes and one school based sex education programme were associated with an increase in number of pregnancies among partners of young male part icipants (1.54; 1.03 to 2.29). There were significantly fewer pregnancies in young women who received a multifaceted programme (0.41; 0.20 to 0.83), though baseline differences in this study favoured the intervention. Conclusions: Primary prevention strategies evaluated to date do not delay the initiation of sexual intercourse, improve use of birth control among young men and women, or reduce the number of pregnancies in young women. 3. Franklin C, Grant D, Corcoran J, O'Dell MP, Bultman L. Effectiveness of prevention programs for adolescent pregnancy: a meta-analysis. J Marriage Fam 1997;59(3):551-67. Using meta-analysis, the authors analyzed 32 outcome studies on the primary prevention of adolescent pregnancy and examined several moderator variables in relationship to the findings. Three outcome variables - sexual activity, contraceptive use and preg nancy rates or childbirths - were analyzed as three separate and independent me ta-analyses. Results indicate that the pregnancy prevention programs that the authors examined have no effect on the sexual activi ty of adolescents. They found sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of pregnancy prevention programs for increasing use of contraceptives. A smaller but significant amount of evidence supports program effectiveness in reducing pregnancy rates. 4. Hviding K.

School-based programs to reduce sexual risk behaviors: a review of effe ctiveness. Public Health Rep 1994;109:339-60. 35 Resultat Abstract: This review was undertaken in recognition of the mounting public health and social problems associated with adolescent sexual behavior and th e importance of basing school-affiliated programs designed to reduce sexual risk-tak ing behavior on sound research. The authors were commissioned by the Division of Adolescent and School Health within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Public Health Service, to review carefully the research on these programs and to assess their impact on behavior. The authors identified 23 studies of school-based programs that were published in professional journals and measured program impact on behavior. They then summarized the results of those studies, identifying the distinguishing characteristics of effective programs, and citing important research questions to be addressed in the future. Not all sex and AIDS educat ion programs had significant effects on adolescent sexual risk-taking behavior, but spec ific programs did delay the initia tion of intercourse, reduce the frequency of intercourse, reduce the number of sexual partners, or increase the use of condoms or other contraceptives. These effective programs have the potential to reduce exposure to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease, in cluding HIV infection. These programs should be replicated widely in U.S. schools. Additional research is needed to improve the effectiveness of programs and to clarify the most important characteristics of effective programs. 6. La Torre G, Chiaradia G, Ricciardi G. School -based smoking preventi on in children and adolescents: Review of the scient ific literature. J Public Health 2005;13(6):285-90. Abstract: The aim of this study was to review all sy stematic reviews and meta-analyses of school-based interventions to prevent children and adolescents starting smoking. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Database and Tobacco Review group registers, Psyclnfo, and the ERIC database. The keywords used for the search were: school-based, smoking prevention, children, adolescents, meta- analysis, systematic review. We foun d seven specifically relevant meta-analyses. They give evidence of a decreased prevalence of smoking among students exposed to social influence programmes compared to students in control groups. The mean difference between groups exposed to the programmes and those not exposed (at the school or classroom level) ranges fr om 5% to 60%, with a duration of 1-4 years. In conclusion, in order to achieve a higher level of e ffectiveness it is widely recognized that smoking prevention programmes should have the following co mponents: sustained application, booster sessions over several years; reinforcement in the community; involvement of parents and the mass media; programming smoking prevention ac tivities within a more comprehensive school health promotion programme. 7. Muller-Riemenschneider F, Bock elbrink A, Reinhold T, Rasch A, Willich effectiveness of behavioural interv entions to prevent sm oking among children and youth. Tob Control 2008;17:301-12. Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of recent behavioural interventions in the prevention of cigarette use among children and youth and to compare the effectiveness of different school- based, community-based and multisec torial intervention strategies. Methods: A structured search of databases and a manual search of reference lists was conducted. Randomised cont rolled trials published in English or German between August 2001 and August 2 006 targeting youths up to 18 years of age were assessed independently by two researchers according to predefined inclusion criteria and with regard to methodological quality. Data abst raction was performed and crossche cked by two researchers. Where appropriate, pooled effect estimates were calculated and tested in sensitivity analyses. Results: Of 3555 articles, 35 studies met the inclus ion criteria. The follow-up duration ranged from 12 months to 120 months. Although the overall effectiveness of prevention programs showed considerable heterogeneity, the majority of studies reported some positive long-ter m effects for behavioural sm oking prevention programs. There was evidence that community-based and multisectorial interventions were effective in reducing smoking rates; in contrast, the evid ence for school-based programs al one was inconclusive. Regardless of the type of intervention, the reductions observed in smoking rates were only modest. Conclusions: The present work identified moderate evidence for the effectiveness of behavioural interventions to prevent smoking. Although evidence for the effectiveness of school-based interventions was inconclusive, evidence for the effectiveness of community- based and multisectorial interventi ons was somewhat stronger. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of specific intervention components and the cost-effectiveness of interventions analysed in avgj\u00f8re ene HTA-rapporten inkluder te enkeltstudier som ikke var relevante i bruk i st\u00f8rre skala. 9. NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Pr eventing and reducing the adverse effects of unintended teenage pregnancie s. Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), 1997; Eff Health Care 3(1). Abstract: Author's objectives: This report summarises the research evidence on approaches to preventing and alleviating the direct negative health and social effects of teenage pregnancy. Author's conclusions: Teenage pregnancy is associated with increased risk of poor social, economic and health outcomes for both mother and child. A factor strongly associated with deferring pregnancy is a good general education. The health and development of teenage mothers and th eir children has been shown to benefit from programmes promoting access to ante natal care, targeted support by health visitors, social workers or &apos;lay mothers&apos; and provision of social support, educational opport unities and pre-school education. School-based sex education can be effective in reducing teenage pregnancy especially when linked to access to contraceptive services. The most reli able evidence shows that it does not increase sexual activity or pregnancy rates. Contraceptives when used properly are highly cost effective and can result in significant savings. Increasing the availability of contra ceptive clinic services for young people is associated with reduced pregnancy rates. Contraceptive services should be based on an assessment of local needs and ensure accessibility and confidentiality. 10. Oakley A, Fullerton D, Holland J, Arnold S, Fr ance-Dawson M, Kelley P, et al. Sexual health education interventions for young people: a me thodological review. BMJ 1995;310:158-62. Abstract : Objectives: To locate reports of sexual health education interventions for young people, assess the methodological quality of evaluations, identify the subgroup with a methodologically sound design, and assess the evidence with re spect to the effectiveness of different approaches to promoting young people's sexual health. Design: Survey of reports in English by means of electronic databases and hand searches for relevant studies conducted in the developed world since 1982. Papers were reviewed for eight methodological qualitie s. The evidence on effectiveness generated by studies meeting four core criteria was assessed. Judgments on effectiveness by reviewers and authors were compared. Papers: 270 papers reporting sexual health interventions. Main outcome measure: The method ological quality of evaluations. Results: 73 reports of evaluation s of sexual health interventions examining the effectiveness of these interventions in changing knowledge, attitudes, or behavi oural outcomes were identified, of which 65 were separate outcome evaluations. Of these studies, 45 (69%) lacked random control groups, 44 (68%) failed to present preintervention and 38 (59%) post intervention data, and 26 (40%) omitted to discuss the relevance of loss of data caused by drop outs. Only 12 (18%) of the 65 outcome evaluations were judged to be methodologically sound. Academ ic reviewers were more likely than authors to judge studies as unclear because of design faults. Only two of the sound evaluations recorded interventions which were effective in showing an impact on young people's sexual behaviour. Conclusions: The design of evaluations in sexual health intervention needs to be improved so that reliable evidence of the effectiveness of different approaches to promoting yo ung people's sexual health may be generated. 11.

The effectiveness of school-based sex education programs in the promotion of abstinent behavior: a meta-analysis. Health Educ Res 2002;17(4):471-81. Abstract: This review presents the findings from controlled school-based sex education interventions published in the last 15 years in the US. The effects of the interventions in promoting abstinent behavior reported in 12 controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results of the analysis indicated a very small overall effect of the interventions in abstinent behavior. Moderator analysis could only be pursued partially because of limited information in primary research stud ies. Parental participation in the program, age of the participants, virg in-status of the sample, grade level, percentage of females, scope of the implementation and year of publication of the study were associated with variations in effect sizes for abstinent behavior in univariate test s. However, only parental participation and percentage of females were significant in the weighted least-squares regression analysis. The richness of a meta-analytic approach appears limited by the quality of the primary research. Unfortunately, most of the research does not employ designs to provide conclusive evidence of program e ffects. Suggestions to address this limitation are provided. 13. Skara S, Sussman S. A review of 25 long-te rm adolescent tobacco and other drug use prevention program evaluations. Prev Med 2003;37(5):451-74. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although the initial effectiveness of psychosocial strategies programming in preventing smoking and other drug abuse among adolescents has been well established through literature reviews and meta-analyses, much less evidence exists for the long-term follow-up success of these interventions. The primary goal of this paper, therefore, is to summarize the effectiveness of published program evaluation studies that have followed adoles cents across the transitional period between junior high and high school for a period of at least 2 years. METHODS: Studies for inclus ion in this review were accessed primarily through a computerized search of Medline, Healthstar, and PsychINFO databases. Intervention studies that met five core criteria were retained for review. Two authors independently abstracted data on study characteristics, methodol ogy, and program outcomes. RESULTS: Search results yielded 25 studies suitable for examination. The majo rity of these studies reported significant program effects for long-term smoking, alco hol, and marijuana outcomes, while indicating a fairly consistent magnitude of program effects. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides long-term empirical evidence of the effectiveness of social influences programs in preventing or reducing substance use for up to 15 years after completion of programming . However, this conclusion is still somewhat tenuous given the lack of significant program effects reported in several studies and the great variab ility that existed in the level of internal and external validity across all studies. 14.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Decisions to smoke are ma de within a broad social context. Community interventions use co-ordinated, widespread, multi-co mponent programmes to try and influence behaviour. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of community interventions in preventing the uptake of smoking in young people. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Toba cco Addiction group specialised register, Medline and other health, psychology and public policy electr onic databases were searched, the bibliographies of identified studies were checked and contact was made wi th content area specialists. Searches were updated in September 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and non randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of multi-component community interventions compared to no intervention or to single component or school-based programmes only. Re ported outcomes had to include smoking behaviour in young people under the age of 25 years. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Information relating to the characteristics and the content of community interv entions, participants, outcomes and methods of the study was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Studies were combined using qualitative 38 Resultat narrative synthesis. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in the review, 46 studies did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. All studies used a co ntrolled trial design, with six using random allocation of schools or communities. Of thirteen studies which compared community interventions to no intervention controls, two, which were part of card iovascular disease preventi on programmes, reported lower smoking prevalence. Of three studies comp aring community interventions to school-based programmes only, one found differences in reported smoking prevalence. One study reported a lower rate of increase in prevalence in a community receiv ing a multi-component intervention compared to a community exposed to a mass media campaign alone. One study reported a significant difference in smoking prevalence between a group receiving a media, school and homework intervention compared to a group receiving the media componen t only. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Th ere is some limited support for the effectiveness of community interventions in helping prevent the uptake of smoking in young people. SOME EVIDENCE THAT COORDINATED, MU LTI-COMPONENT COMMUNITY PROGRAMS CAN LOWER SMOKING RATES IN YOUNG PEOPLE: The decisi on to start (or continue) smoking is made within a broad social context, affected by many factors. Community interventions use coordinated, widespread, multi-component programs to try and in fluence people's behaviou r. Community members are often involved in determining and/or implementing programs. These include age restrictions on tobacco purchase, programs for prevention of disease (like heart disease), mass media and school programs. The review of trials found some evidence that coordi nated multi-component prog rams can reduce smoking among young people, and do so more effectively than single strategies alone. 15. Strunk JA. The effect of sch ool-based health clinics on t eenage pregnancy and parenting outcomes: an integrated literature review. J Sch Nurs 2008;24:13-20. Abstract: Teenage pregnancy outcomes have become an increasing concern in the United States. Education and support of pregnant teens are critical factors that may de termine good or poor pregnancy outcomes. Poor outcomes may include low birth weight, developmental delays, and poor academic performance. Although the number of teenagers experiencing pregnancy and parenting has declined in the U.S., school- based health clinics can be used to provide support and guidance designed to avoid the negative outcomes associated with teenage pregnancy and parenting. By having school-based health clinics, nurse practitioners and school nurses can provide much needed services to pregnant and parenting teens. These services should include educat ional support, counseling, and community resources. Th is inquiry provides a metasynthesis of the literature and will review, examine, and summarize the literature relating to the effect of school-based clinics on teenage pregnancy and parenting outcomes. 16. Tingle LR, DeSimone M, Covington B. A meta -evaluation of school-based smoking prevention programs. J Sch Health 2003;73(2):64-7. Abstract: Eleven school-based smoking prevention programs were subjected to a meta-evaluation. Criteria for the meta-evaluation included: 1) adequacy of the research design, 2) evidence of reliability, 3) evidence of validity, 4) appropriate statistical analyses and interpretations, 5) reporting of effect sizes or practical significance, 6) accounting for attrition, and 7) tracking of fidelity to the program. A three-point rating scale was used ranging from 0-2. Criteria with the best ratings were research design and statistical analysis. The lowest ratings occurred for reliability and validity. Th e remainder of the criteria ranged between 1 and 2 with minor factors accounting for the difference in ratings. Recommendations include increasing the number of evaluations that included tests of reliability and validity and calculated effect size estimates. 17. West SL, O'Neal KK. Project D.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We provide an updated meta-analysis on the effe ctiveness of Project D.A.R.E. in preventing alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use among school-aged youths. METHODS: We used meta- analytic techniques to create an overall effect size for D.A.R.E. outcome evaluations reported in scientific journals. RESULTS: The overall weighted effect size for the included D.A.R.E. studies was extremely small (correlation coefficient = 0.011; Cohen = = 0.73, NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports previous findings indicating that D.A.R.E. is ineffective. 18. White D, Pitts M. Educating young people ab out drugs: a systemat ic review. Addiction 1998;93(10):1475-87. Abstract: AIMS: To assess the effectiveness of interventions directed at the prevention or reduction of use of illicit substances by young people or those directed at reducing harm caused by continuing use. DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted. Reports were identified through electronic and hand searching and contact with known workers in the area. Studies were included if they reported evaluations of interventions targeting illicit drug use and provided sufficient detail of the intervention and design of the evaluation to allow judgements to be made of their methodological soundness. Meta-analyses were conducted combining the data of the methodologically sound studie s. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS TARGETED BY INTERVENTIONS: Evaluations of interventions were included if their targeted audience included young people aged between 8 and 25 years. Identified evalua tions were delivered in a range of settings including: schools and colleges; community settings; the fa mily; medical/therapeuti c settings; mass media. MEASUREMENTS: Data extracted from each report in cluded details of design, content and theoretical orientation of intervention, setting of the intervention, target audience, methods, population size, subject 39 Resultat refusal rates, rates of attrition, outcome measures, length of follow-up and findings, including statistical power. FINDINGS: The majority of studies identified were evaluations of interventions introduced in schools and targeting alcohol, tobacco and marijuana simultaneously. These studies were methodologically stronger than interventions target ing other drugs and implemented outs ide schools. Meta-analyses showed that the impact of evaluated interventions was sma ll with dissipation of pr ogramme gains over time. Interventions targeting hard to reach groups have not been evaluated adequately. CONCLUSIONS: Effort needs to be directed towards the development of improved evaluative solutions to the problems posed by these groups. There is still insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of the range of approaches to drugs education; more methodologically sound evaluations are required. There is also a need to target interventions to reflect the specific needs and experiences of recipients. SKOLEHELSETJENESTEN 1. Adi Y, Killoran A, Janmohamed K, Stewart-Bro wn S.

Sy stematic review of the school entry medical examination. Arch Dis Ch ild 1998;78(4):301-11. Abstract: AIMS: To summarise and critically evaluate research conducted in the UK between 1962 and 1996, on the effectiveness and efficiency of the sc hool entry medical (SEM) ex amination. METHODS: An electronic search of a large number of databases, in co njunction with a search of reference lists, and sources in the grey literature produced a total of 64 studies. RESULTS: Only one overview and 16 primary studies met the review's broad inclusion criteria. The results showed significant differences in the identification and referral of new and ongoing prob lems not only between the routine and selective SEM but also within the two types of SEM examination. There were also large differences in the numbers of children selected for SEM examination. No study included in the review defined either the methods or the criteria used to identify children as screen positive. No study provided follow up of children after referral to estimate the positive predictive value or yield of the screening, or follow up of the whole cohort to identify false negative cases. CONCLUSION: Data on the effectiveness and efficiency of both the routine and selective SEM examination in accurately identifying children with new or ongoing health problems are not available at the present time. The studies reviewed here demonstrate the fragility of the evidence on which the school entry medical is based, and call into question the ethical basis of this programme. 4. Berti LC, Zylbert S, Rolnitzky L. Comparison of health status of children using a school- based health center for comprehensive care . J Pediatr Health Care 2001;15(5):244-50. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare health problems and medi cal coverage of homeless and housed children who used a school-based health center (SBHC) for comprehensive care. METHODS: Medical charts of homeless children (n = 76) and housed children (n = 232) seen for comprehensive care at an SBHC in New York City during the 1998-99 school year were systematically reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Controlled for ethnicity an d medical coverage, home less children were 2.5 times as likely (P <.001) to have health problems and 3 times as likely (P <.001) to have severe health problems as housed children. The most common health problems identified in the homeless population were asthma (33%), vision (13%), mental health (9%), and acute problems (8%). Lack of medical co verage was evident in 58% of homeless children, compared with 15% of housed children (P <.001). CO NCLUSION: Study findings identify homeless children as being at increased risk for health problems and lack of medi cal coverage. These findings support use of an SBHC for comprehensive care by underserved segments of the population and a need for increased vigilance on the part of health care providers caring for homeless children. 5. Cardon G, Balague F. Low back pain prevention's effects in schoolchildren: what is the evidence? Eur Spine J 2004;13:663-79. 40 Resultat Abstract: Given the high prevalence rates of back pain, as early as in childhood, there has been a call for early preventive interventions. To determine which interventions are used to prevent back problems in schoolchildren, as well as what the evidence is for their utility, the literature was searched to locate all investigations that used subjects under the age of 18 and not seeking treatment. Included investigations were specifically designed as an in tervention for low back pain (LBP) pr evention. Additionally, a literature search was performed for modifiable risk factors for LBP in schoolchildren. The literature-update search was performed within the scope of the \"COST Action B13\" of the European Commission, approved for the development of European guidelines for the management of LBP. It was concluded that intervention studies in schoolchildren focusing on back-pain pr evention are promising but too limited to formulate evidence-based guidelines. On the other hand, since the literature shows that back-pain reports about schoolchildren are mainly associated with psychosocial factors, the scope for LBP prevention in schoolchildren may be limited. Howe ver, schoolchildren are receptive to back-care-related knowledge and postural habits, which may play a preventive role for ba ck pain in adulthood. Further studies with a follow- up into adulthood are needed to evaluate the long-term effect of early interventions and the possible detrimental effect of spinal loading at young age. 6. Cuijpers P. Effective ingredie nts of school-based drug prevention programs. Addict Behav 2002;27(6):1009-23. Abstract: Drug prevention in schools is a top priority in most Western countrie s and several well-designed studies have shown that prevention programs have the potential of re ducing drug use in adolescents. However, most prevention programs are not effective and there are no general criteria available for deciding which program is effective an d which is not. In this systematic review of the literature, the current scientific knowledge about which char acteristics determine the effectiveness of drug prevention programs is examined. Three types of studies are reviewed: meta-analyses (3 studies were included), studies examining mediating variables of in terventions (6 studies), and studie s directly comparing prevention programs with or without specific characteristics (4 studies on boos ters, 12 on peer-versus adult-led programs, and 5 on adding community interventions to school programs). Seven evidence-based quality criteria were formulated: the effects of a program should have been proven; interactive delivery methods are superior; the \"social influence model\" is the best we have; focus on norms, commitment not to use, and intentions not to use; adding community interventions increases effects; the use of peer leaders is better; and adding life skills to prog rams may strengthen effects. 7. Dobbins M, DeCorby K, Manske S, Goldblatt E. Effective prevention. Prev Med 2008;46(4):289-97. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Research evidence addressing effectiveness of tobacco use prevention interventions has accumulated since the 1970s. Systematic reviews 1985-2006 were considered, building on previous syntheses and spanning tobacco contro l and prevention efforts to date. Practitioners' experience was drawn upon to supplement research evidence. METHODS: A systematic, comprehensive approach was used to synthesize published literature evaluating the effectiveness of school-based tobacco use prevention interventions. Systematic reviews conducted on all populations published in English, peer- reviewed journals were included. Reviews were screened for relevance and assessed for methodological quality using pre-tested, standardized tools. The best available evidence was extracted and integrated with experiential evidence from individual interview and focus group results from practitioners involved in tobacco use prevention programming. RESULTS: Considerable consensus among the three evidence sources indicates that school-based tobacco use prevention interventions are effective in reducing smoking prevalence, reducing smoking initia tion and intended smoking intentio ns in the short term. There is adequate evidence from over three decades of rese arch and years of experience to recommend ongoing implementation of school-based tobacco use prevention interventions. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence that school-based tobacco use prevention programs are largely effective for most tobacco use related outcomes, at least in the short term. 8.

Effectivene ss of school social work from a risk and resilience perspective. Soc Work Educ 2001;23(1):9-31. Abstract: School social workers use a variety of interventions in prevention, treatment, and environmental change, directed at the mental health needs of children . Social work is at the periphery of schools' mission, and as such, has high standards of a ccountability. To demonstrate the valu e of social work in schools, we must have evidence of whether school social work practice is effective. This article identifies and reviews 21 controlled outcome studies of school social work practi ce. School social workers can use these studies as the basis for designing effective interventions in mental health prevention and treatment efforts in schools, including efforts targeted at improving the overall climate of the schools. The review incorporates a risk and resilience perspective to link the demonstrated effe cts of interventions to the wider body of literature on children's development, especial ly in regard to mental health. 41 Resultat 10.

Prev Sci 2003;4(1):1-14. Abstract: The series of seminal meta-analytic studie s of school-based substanc e use prevention program studies conducted by the late Nancy S. Tobler an d colleagues concluded that programs with content focused on social influences' knowle dge, drug refusal skills , and generic competency skills and that use participatory or interactive teaching strategies were more effective than programs focused on knowledge and attitudes and favoring traditio nal didactic instruction. The present study compared current school practice against evidence-based standards for \"effective content\" and \"effective de livery,\" derived from the Tobler findings. Respondents were the lead staff who taught substance use prevention in the 1998-1999 school year in a national sample of public and priv ate schools that included middle school grades (N = 1,795). Results indicate that most providers (62.25%) taught effectiv e content, but few used effective delivery (17.44%), and fewe r still used both effective content and delivery (14.23%). Those who taught an evidence-based program (e.g., Life Skills Training, Project ALERT), however, were more likely to implement both effective content and delivery, as we re those teachers who were recently trained in substance use prevention and were comfortable using interactive teaching methods. The findings indicate that the transfer to practice of research knowledge about school-based substance use prevention programming has been limited. 11.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of school-based interventions in preventing or reducing drug use. METHODS: The search stra tegy was conducted acco rding to the Cochrane Collaboration method, and applied to MEDLINE, EM BASE, ERIC, PSYCHINFO, Cochrane Library, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Re gister. RCTs and CCTs evaluating school-based interventions designed to prevent substance use were reviewed. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Quality was assessed. Inte rventions were classified as skills , affective, and knowledge focused. RESULTS: 29 RCTs were included; 28 were conducted in the USA; mo st were focused on 6th-7th grade students. Compared with usual curricula, skills-based interventions significantly reduce marijuana use (RR=0.82; 0.85), and peer pressure resistance (RR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.24, 3. 42) and drug knowledge. Compared with usual curricula, affective interv entions improve decision-making skills and drug knowledge, and knowledge-focused programs improve drug knowledge. Skills-based interventions are better than affective ones in improved self-efficacy. No differences are evident for skills vs. knowledge- focused programs on drug knowledg e. Affective interventions improve decision-making skills and drug knowledge to a higher degree than knowledge-focu sed programs. CONCLUSION: Skills-based programs help to deter drug use. Well designed, long-term randomised trials, and evaluation of intervention components are required. 12. Faggiano F, Vigna-Taglianti FD, Versino E, Zambon A, Borraccino prevention for illicit drug s' use. Cochrane Database Syst Rev Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease. Primary interventions should be aimed to reduce first use, or prev ent the transition from experimental use to addiction. School is the appropriate setting for preventive interventions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of school- based interventions in improving kn owledge, developing skills, prom oting change, and preventing or reducing drug use versus usual curricular activities or a different school-based intervention . SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE Library, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group Register, up dated to February 2004, were searched. Bibliography of papers was checked and personal contacts were made to identify other releva nt studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs, CCTs or Controlled Prospective Studies (CPS) ev aluating school-based interventions designed to prevent substance use. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were selected and extracted independently by two reviewers. Quality was assessed with the CDAG checklist.Interventions were classified as skills, affective, knowledge-focused an d other characteristics were also studied (teaching, follow-up implementation, context activation). MAIN RESULTS: 32 studies (29 RCTs and 3 CPSs) were included. 28 were conducted in the USA; most were focused on 6th-7th grade students, and based on post- test assessment. RCTs: (1 ) Knowledge vs usual curricula: Knowle dge drug CI: 0.42, 1.39).(2) Skills vs usual curricula: interventions increase drug knowledge (WMD=2.60; (3) Skills vs knowledge: No differences are evident.(4) Skills vs affective: Skills-based interventions are only better than affe ctive ones in self-efficacy (WMD=1.90; CI95%: 0.25, 3.55). (5) Affective vs usual curricula : Affective interventions improve dr ug knowledge (SMD=1.88; CI95%: 1.27, 2.50) and decision making 0.79, 1.9). (6) Resu lts from CPSs: ificant results emerge from CPSs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Skills based programs appear to be effective in deterring early-stage drug use. 42 Resultat The replication of results with well designed, long te rm randomised trials, and the evaluation of single components of intervention (peer, pa rents, booster sessions) are the priorities for research. All new studies should control for cluster effect. 13. Fernandez S, Nebot M, Jane M. [The evaluation of effectiveness of scholastic programs in the prevention of consumption of tobacco, alcohol and cannabis: what do meta-analyses tell us?]. Rev Esp Salud Publica 2002;76(3):175-87. Abstract: Consumption of tobacco, alcohol and illegal dr ugs is a major public heal th problem in developed countries. The aim of the study is to describe the impact and associated characteristics of preventive programs addressed at those problems in the school setting. Meta-analysis focusing on evaluations of programs focusing on smoking, alco hol and/or cannabis at the school se tting are reviewed. The search was done at Cochrane Library and Me dline databases of articles publ ished between 1993 and 1999, and including as keywords programs, ed ucation, drugs prevention, preven tion, smoking, alcohol, school, adolescence, teenagers, young people, evaluation, health education, effectiveness, review, meta-analysis. We found 5 meta-analysis of programs summarizing the effect of preventive programs, most of them dealing with legal and illegal drugs. However, most of the interventions reporting changes in behavior measured only smoking. More effective interventions addressed social influences , used active methodology and were implemented by teachers or peers. The importance of booster sessions, the quality of implementation and thorough evaluation is stressed. Overall, meta-analysis of evaluated programs shows a small effect, although the population impact may be relevant. Some limitations point to new areas of interest for fu ture research. 14. Fletcher A, Bonell C, Hargreaves J. School effe cts on young people's drug use: a systematic review of intervention and observational st udies. J Adolesc Health 2008;42:209-20. Abstract: PURPOSE: This systematic review examined the hypothesis that school institutional factors influence young people's use of drugs. We aimed to (1) identify the effect of school-level changes on drug use and (2) explore the possible mechanisms by which school-level influences on individual drug use might occur. METHODS: Systematic review. Experimental/quasi-experimental studies of \"whole-school\" drug prevention interventions and longitudinal observatio nal studies on the association between school-level and individual-level school-related exposures and drug use were included. Experimental studies were included because they are the most reliable available source of evidence about causation. Observational studies of school-level and individual-level school-related exposures were included with the aim of providing evidence about a wider range of possible school-level effects and how school-level influences might be mediated by individual-level factors. RESU LTS: Experimental studies suggested that changes to the school social environment that increase student participation, improve relationships and promote a positive school ethos may be associated with redu ced drug use. School-level and individual-level observational studies consistently reported that di sengagement and poor teac her-student relationships were associated with drug use and other risky health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of school effects on young people's dr ug use. Interventions that promote a positive school ethos and reduce student disaffection may be an effective complement to drug prevention interventions addressing individual knowledge, skills, and pe er norms. Such approaches should now be piloted in a wider range of settings. Further research is also needed to expl ore mechanisms by which sc hools may influence young people's drug use. 15. Gates S, McCambridge J, Smith LA, Foxcroft D. Interventions for preven tion of drug use by young people delivered in non-school settings . Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Art. No.: CD005030. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005030.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Interventions intended to prevent or reduce use of drugs by young people may be delivered in schools or in other settings. This review aims to summarise the current literature about the effectiveness of interventions deli vered in non schools settings. OBJECTIVES: (1) - To summarise the current evidence about the effectiveness of interventi ons delivered in non-school settings intended to prevent or reduce drug use by young people under 25; (2) - To investigate whether interventions' effects are modified by the type and setting of the intervention, an d the age of young people targeted; (3) - To identify areas where more research is needed. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Librar y We searched also reference lists of review articles and retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials that evaluated an intervention targeting drug use by young people under 25 years of age, delivered in a non-school setting, compared with no intervention or another intervention, that reported substantive outcomes relevant to the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Result s were tabulated, as studies were considered too dissimilar to combine using meta -analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Seventee n studies, 9 cluster randomised studies, with 253 clusters, 8 individu ally randomised studies with 1230 participants, evaluating four types of intervention: motivational interviewing or brief intervention, education or skills training, family interventions and multi-component community inte rventions. Many studies had methodological drawbacks, especially high levels of loss to follow-up. There were too fe w studies for firm conclusions. One study of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on cannabis use. Three 43 Resultat family interventions (Focus on Families, Iowa St rengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years), each evaluated in only one study, suggested that they may be beneficial in preventing cannabis use. The studies of multi component community interventions did not find any strong effects on drug use outcomes, and the two studies of education and skills training did not find any differences between the intervention and control groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence of effectiveness of the included interv entions. Motivational interviewing and some family interventions may have some benefit. Cost-effectivene ss has not yet been addressed in any studies, and further research is needed to determine whether any of these interventions can be recommended. INTERVENTIONS DELIVERED TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN NON-SCHOOL SETTINGS FOR THE PREVENTION OF DRUG USE: Drug use is widespread among young people in cluding those still at school.Taking drugs is not a medical problem in itself but can af fect physical andmental health and social functioning. People may become dependent on drugs, and use of low risk illicit drugs can escalate into use of higher risk drugs. In schools, programs have been introduced to prevent or reduce drug use among young people. Non-school settings for interventions include youth clubs, primary care centres, colleges, wi th families and in the community. Srategies can target entire populations or be directed at specific groups, often those at high risk. The review authors identified 17 controlled studies, 9 cluster randomised studies with 253 clusters and 8 individually randomised studies wi th 1230 participants. All but two of the studies were conducted in the USA. The other studies were in the UK and China. Fo llow-up periods varied from at completion of the intervention to six years. The studies were too few an d each intervention too di fferent to draw any firm conclusions on whether non-school based intervention s prevent or reduce drug use by young people.The interventions with suggested benefits need further evaluation before it can be firmly established that they are effective. One of two studies of motivational interviewing suggested that this intervention was beneficial on self-reported cannabis use. Three family interventi ons (Focus on Families, Io wa Strengthening Families Program and Preparing for the Drug-Free Years) were evaluated, in two separate studies, and may have been beneficial in preventing self-reported cannabis use. The latter two programs were compared to the school-based Life Skills Training pr ogram. All of the eight studies of fa mily interventions included contact with parents, in family groups or in separate sessions for parents and their children. Multicomponent community interventions did not have an y strong effects on drug use. There were five studies, four of which added the community component to a school drug education program. Education and skills training was not effective in two studies. Many of the studies lacked blinding and had high numb ers of participants lost to follow up. No study reported cost outcomes. 16. Gottfredson DC, Wilson DB. Characteristics of effective school-based substance abuse prevention. Prev Sci 2003;4(1):27-38. Abstract: This study summarizes, usin g meta-analytic techniques, results from 94 studies of school-based prevention activities that examined alcohol or other drug use outcomes. It set out to determine what features of school-based substance abuse prevention programs are related to variability in the size of program effects, It asked (1) Which populations (e.g., high risk vs. gene ral population) should be targeted for prevention services? (2) What is the best age or developmental stage for prevention programming? (3) Does program duration matter? and (4) Does the role of the person delivering the service (e.g., teacher, law enforcement officer, peer) matter? The results suggest that targeting middle school aged children and designing programs that can be delivered primarily by peer leaders will increase the effectiveness of school- based substance use prevention programs. The results also imply that such programs need not be lengthy. The evidence related to the targeting issue is sparse, bu t suggests that, at least for programs teaching social competency skills, targeting higher risk youths may yield stronger effects than targeting the general population. Suggestions for fu ture research are offered. 17. Hahn R, Fuqua-Whitley D, Wethington H, Lo wy J, Liberman A, Crosby A, et al. The effectiveness of universal school-based pr ograms for the prevention of violent and aggressive behavior: a report on recommend ations of the Task Force on Community Preventive Services. MMWR Recomm Rep 2007;56(RR-7):1-12. Abstract: Universal school-based programs to reduce or prevent violent behavior are delivered to all children in classrooms in a grade or in a school. Similarly, programs targ eted to schools in high-risk areas (defined by low socioeconomic status or high crime rate s) are delivered to all chil dren in a grade or school in those high-risk areas. During 2004-2006, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Task Force) conducted a systematic review of published scientific evidence concerning the effectiveness of these programs. The results of this review provide strong evidence that universal school-based programs decrease rates of violence and a ggressive behavior amon g school-aged children. Program effects were demonstrated at all grade levels. An independent me ta-analysis of school-based programs confirmed and supplemented these findings. On the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness, the Task Force recommends the use of universal school-based programs to prevent or reduce violent behavior. 18. Joronen K, Rankin SH, Astedt-Kurki P. Sc hool-based drama interventions in health promotion for children and system atic review. J Adv Nurs 2008;63(2):116-31. Abstract: AIM: The paper is a report of a review of the literature on the effects of school-based drama interventions in health promotion for school-age d children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: Drama, theatre and role-playing methods are commonly used in health promotion programmes, but evidence of 44 Resultat their effectiveness is limited. The educational drama approach and social cognitive theory is share the assumption that learning is based on self-reflection and interaction between environment and person. However, educational drama also emphasizes learning through the dialectics between actual and fictional contexts. DATA SOURCES: A search was carried out using 10 databases and hand searching for the period January 1990 to October 2006. METHODS: A Cochrane systematic review was conducted. RESULTS: Nine studies met the criteria for inclusion. Their topics in cluded health behaviour (five studies), mental health (two) and social health (two). Actor-performed drama or theatre play followed by group activities was the intervention in five studies, and classroom drama in four studies. Fou r of the studies were randomized controlled trials and five were non-randomized controlled studies. Four reports gave the theory on which the intervention was based, and in eight studies at le ast some positive effects or changes were reported, mostly concerning knowledge and a ttitudes related to health behaviou r. The diversity of designs and instruments limited comparisons. CONCLUSION: There is a need for well-designed and theory-based studies that address drama interventions in health prom otion for children and families. The challenge is to find or develop a theory, which combines educational, drama and health theories with valid and reliable measurements to examine the effects of the intervention. 19. Mukoma W, Flisher AJ. Evaluations of health pr omoting schools: a revie w of nine studies. Health 2004;19:357-68. Abstract: The concept of 'health promoting schools' has been embraced internationally as an effective way of promoting the health of children, adolescents, and the wider school co mmunity. It is only recently that attempts have been made to evalua te health promoting schools. This paper reviews evaluations of health promoting schools and draws useful evaluation method ology lessons. The review is confined to school- based interventions that are founded explicitly on the concept of the he alth promoting school and employ the concept beyond one school domain. We included nine evaluations in this review. Seven of these were published in the peer reviewed scientific literatu re. Two were unpublished reports. One study was a randomized controlled trial, while a quasi-experimental research design with comparison schools was used in three studies. With three exceptions, combinations of quantitative and qualitative data were collected. There was evidence that the health promoting school has some influence on various domains of health for the school community. It is also possible to integr ate health promotion into the school curriculum and policies successfully. However, the evaluation of health promoting schools is complex. We discuss some of the methodological challenges of evaluating health promoting schools and make suggestions for improving future evaluations. 20. Murray NG, Low BJ, Hollis C, Cross AW, Davis SM. Coordinated school health programs and academic achievement: a systematic review of the literature. J Sch Health 2007;77(9):589-600. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few evaluations of school he alth programs measure academic outcomes. K-12 education needs evidence for academic achievement to implement school programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature to examine evidence that school health programs aligned with the Coordinated School Health Program (CSHP) model improve academic success. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of health researchers searched the literature related to academic achievement and elements of the CSHP model (health services, coun seling/social services, nutrition services, health promotion for staff, parent/family/community invo lvement, healthy school environment, physical education, and health education) to identify scientific ally rigorous studies of in terventions. Study designs were classified according to the analytic framework provided in the Guide developed by the Community Preventive Services Task Force. RESULTS: The strongest evidence from scientifically rigorous evaluations exists for a positive effect on some academic outcomes from school health progra ms for asthmatic children that incorporate health education and parental involvement. Strong evidence also exists for a lack of negative effects of physical education programs on ac ademic outcomes. Limited evidence from scientifically rigorous evaluations support the effect of nutrition se rvices, health services, and mental health programs, but no such evidence is found in the literature to su pport the effect of staff health promotion programs or school environment interventions on academic ou tcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Scientifically rigorous evaluation of school health programs is challengin g to conduct due to issues related to sample size, recruitment, random assignment to condition, implemen tation fidelity, costs, and adequate follow-up time. However, school health programs hold promise for improving academic outcomes for children. 21. Park-Higgerson HK, Perumean-Chaney SE, Ba rtolucci AA, Grimley DM, Singh KP. The evaluation of school-based violence preventi programs: Youth violen ce and related aggressi ve behaviors have become serious public health issues with physical, economic, social, and psychological impacts and consequences. This study identified and evaluated the characteristics of successful school-based violence prevention programs. METHODS: Twenty-six randomized controlled trial (RCT), school-based studies that were designed to reduce externalizing, aggressive, and violent behavior between the 1st and 11th grades were analyzed for assessing the effects of 5 program characteristics by comparing results of interv ention groups to control groups (no intervention) after using a meta-analysis. Electr onic databases and bibliographies were systematically searched, and a standardized mean difference was used for analysis. RESULTS: There 45 Resultat was no significant difference between interventions, although programs that used non-theory-based interventions, focused on at-risk an d older children, and employed inte rvention specialists had slightly stronger effects in reducing aggression and violence . Interventions using a single approach had a mild positive effect on decreasing aggressi ve and violent behavior (effect size =-0.15, 95% CI =-0.29 to -0.02, p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Unlike previous individual st udy findings, this meta-analysis did not find any differential effects for 4 of the 5 pr ogram characteristics. In addition , the significant effect noted was contrary to expectation, exemplifying the complexity of identifying effective program strategies. This study adds to the current literature by assessing the program characteristics of RCT studies in an effort to determine what factors may affect school-b ased violence prevention program success. 22. Rundall TG, Bruvold WH. A meta-analysis of school-based smoking use prevention programs. Health Educ Q 1988;15(3):317-34. Abstract: Tobacco and alcohol use among adolescents continue at historically high rates, and school-based interventions designed to deter students from smoking and drinking are increasingly being implemented. This study reports a meta-analysis of 47 smoking an d 29 alcohol school-based intervention programs published after 1970. Results indica te that, in general, smoking and alcohol interventions have equally modest effects on immediate behavioral outcomes. Smoking interventions, however, have been more successful than alcohol interventions at altering studen ts' long term behavior. All of the alcohol programs and all but one of the smoking programs reviewed successfully increased knowledge regarding the risks of these behaviors. Attitude change appears to be more difficult to achieve. Twenty-nine of 33 smoking studies and only 19 of 31 alcohol studies su ccessfully changed students' attitudes. Finally, the data indicate that for immediate smoking outcomes and long-term alcohol outc omes innovative interventions relying upon social reinforcement, social norms, and developmental beha vioral models are more e ffective than traditional \"awareness\" programs designed to inform adolescents about the health risks associated with tobacco and alcohol use. The implications of these findings for fu ture of school-based heal th promotion programs are discussed. 23. Spence SH, Shortt AL. Research review: can we justify the widespread dissemination of universal, school-based interventions for the pr evention of depression among children and adolescents? J Child Psychol Psychiatry 2007;48:526-42. This review examines the evidence concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of universal, school-based interventions designed to prevent the development of depression in children and adolescents. It evaluates the outcomes of research in relation to standards of evidence specified by the Society for Prevention Research (Flay et al., 2005). The limited evidence available brings into doubt the efficacy and effectiveness of current universal, school-based approaches to the prevention of depression, suggesting that the widespread dissemination of such interventions would be premature. Relatively brief programs, that focus specifically on enhancing individual skills and ch aracteristics of the individual in the absence of environmental change, may be insufficient to produce lasting effects in the prevention of depression among children and adolescents. 24. Steele EJ, Dawson AP, Hiller JE. School-based interventions for spinal pain: a systematic review. Spine 2006;31(2):226-33. Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To establish the effectiveness of school-based spinal health interventions in term s of: 1) improving knowledge about th e spine/spinal care; 2) changing spinal care behaviors; and 3) decreasing the pr evalence of spinal pain . SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal pain is a significant problem in childr en and adolescents that ha s been addressed through school-based spinal health interventions. No systematic review has been carried out on this topic to date. METHODS: A systematic literature review sought st udies that evaluated school-based spinal health interventions. Using clearly define d study inclusion criteria, 11 data bases were searched from their inception to March 2004. To identi fy further literature, three relevant journals were hand searched, reference lists were checked, and authors of included papers were contacted. Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of identified papers and extracted data regarding intervention and study characteristics, statistical analyses performed, and study results. Data were examined using a narrative synthesis of results, and the outcomes of interest were cons idered individually (knowledge, behaviors, pain prevalence). RESULTS: Twelve papers were included in this review; all papers received a \"weak\" quality rating. Results of these studies indicate that school-based spinal health interventions may be effective in increasing spinal care knowledge and decreasing the prevalence of spinal pain. However, overall the evidence is inconclusive regarding spinal care behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The poor quality of the reviewed studies limits the conclusions that can be made regarding the effectiveness of school-based spinal health interventions. 25. Stickler GB. Are yearly physical examinatio ns in adolescents necessary? J Am Board Fam Med 2000;13(3):172-7. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recommendations regarding the frequency of routine physical examinations for adolescents have varied from one examination every 2 to 3 years to yearly evaluations. Because none of these recommendations was based on studies regardin g the usefulness of such examinations, it was pertinent to review the results of pu blished studies. METHODS: All series of routine school and preathletic 46 Resultat examinations of adolescents published in the English literature from 1943 to 1995 were reviewed. Only reviews of examinations by physicians with or wi thout supervised health professionals were included. RESULTS: Findings included weight, blood pressure, visual acuity, innocent heart murmurs, scoliosis, referral for further testing, and serious abnormalities unknown before examination. A total of 20,047 examinations by 12 different groups of investigators was abstracted. Only 2 adolescents had major, previously unknown findings: 1 boy was blind in one eye and the other had mitral insufficiency. Elevated blood pressures were found in 0.1% to 1.6% of adolescents. Minor findings included acne, caries, myopia, and minor orthopedic problems , but they did not prevent participation in school or sports. CONCLUSIONS: Yearly physical examinations in adolescents are not cost-effective and have practically no value in finding important pathologic conditions. This conclusion would not apply to sexually active teenagers. The value of an examination for health education or detection of mental problems has never been tested in this population. For entrance to school an d camps or for sports participation, the review of a questionnaire and screening examinations by allied health providers should be the method of choice unless future studies justify repeated yearly examination of adolescents. 26. Thomas R. School-based programmes for prev enting smoking. Cochrane Database CD001293. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001293.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Smoking rates in adolescents ar e rising. Helping young people to avoid starting smoking is a widely endorsed goal of public health, but there is uncertainty about how to do this. Schools provide a route for communicating wi th a large proportion of young pe ople, and school-based programmes for smoking prevention have been widely developed and evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To review all randomised controlled trials of behavioural interventi ons in schools to prevent children (aged 5 to12) and adolescents (aged 13 to18) starting smoking. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Controlled Trials and Tobacco Review group registers, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psyclnfo, ERIC, CINAHL, Health Star, Dissertation Abstracts and studies identified in th e bibliographies of articles. Individual MEDLINE searches were made for 133 authors who had undertaken randomised controlled trials in this area. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: those in which individual students, classes, schools, or school districts were randomised to the intervention or cont rol groups and followed for at least six months. Types of participants: Children (aged 5 to12) or adolescents (aged 13 to18 ) in school settings. Types of interventions: Classroom programmes or curricula, including those with associated family and community interventions, intended to deter use of tobacco. We included programmes or curricula that provided information, those that used social influences approa ches, those that taught gene ric social competence, and those that included interventions beyond the school into the community. We included programmes with a drug or alcohol focus if outcomes for tobacco use were reported. Types of outcome measures: Prevalence of non-smoking at follow-up among those not smoking at baseline. We did not requir e biochemical validation of self-reported tobacco use for study inclusio n. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed whether identified citations were randomised contro lled trials. We assessed th e quality of design and execution, and abstracted outcome data. Because of the marked heterogeneity of design and outcomes, we did not perform a meta-analysis. We synthesised the data using narrative systematic review. We grouped studies by intervention method (information; social competence; social influences; combined social influences/social competence and multi-modal programme s). Within each category, we placed them into three groups according to validity using quality criter ia for reported study design. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 76 randomised controlled trials identified, we classified 16 as category one (most valid). There were no category one studies of information giving alone. There were fifteen category one studies of social influences interventions. Of these, eight showed some positive effect of intervention on smoking prevalence, and seven failed to detect an effect on smoking prevalence. The largest and most rigorous study, the Hutchinson Smoking Prevention Project, found no long-term effect of an intensive 8-year programme on smoking behaviour. There was a lack of high quality evidence about the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social competence approaches. There was limited evidence about the effectiveness of multi-modal appr oaches including community initia tives. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no rigorous test of the effects of information giving about smoking. There are well-conducted randomised controlled trials to test the effects of social influences interventions: in half of the group of best quality studies those in the interv ention group smoke less than those in the control, but many studies showed no effect of the intervention. There is a lack of high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of combinations of social influences and social comp etence interventions, and of multi-modal programmes that include community interventions. 27. Wainwright P, Thomas J, Jones M. Health pr omotion and the role of the school nurse: a systematic review. J Adv Nurs 2000;32(5):1083-91. Abstract: This paper describes findings from a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of school nurses in promoting the health of school chil dren. The paper gives a brief account of the background to the study and the search strategy adopted. Some ke y findings are presented and discussed. The brief for the review was to seek evidence of effectiveness in the practice of school nurses. The results of the review were disappointing, in that little re search of acceptable quality was found and little could be said about effectiveness. The result is therefore a more diffuse re view that gives a summary of descriptive research and current views and opinions, although it does also pres ent some pointers for future research. The study was funded by Health Promotion. 47 Resultat 28. Wiefferink CH, Peters determinan ts: possible for school health interventions. Prev Sci 2006;7(2):127-49. Abstract: Characterizing school health promotion is its category-by-category approach, in which each separate health-related behavior is addressed independently. Such an approach creates a risk that extra- curricular activities become overloaded, and that teaching staff are distracted by continuous innovations. Within the health promotion sector there are thus increasing calls for an integrative approach to health- related behaviors. However, a meaningful integrative appr oach to different lifestyles will be possible only if there is some clustering of individual health-relat ed behaviors and if health-related behaviors have a minimum number of determinants in common. This systematic review aims to identify to what extent the four health-related behaviors smoking, alcohol abuse, safe sex and healthy nutrition cluster; and how their determinants are associated. Potentially modifiable determinants that offer clues for an integrative approach of school health-promotion programs are identified. Besides, the direction in which health educators should look for a more effici ent instructional desi gn is indicated. 29. Wiehe Ebel BE , Rivara FP. A systemat ic review of school- based smoking prevention trials with long-term follow-up. J Adolesc 2005;36(3):162-9. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several syst of school-based smoking prevention trials have shown short-term decreases in smoking prevalence but have not examined long-term follow-up evaluation. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of rigorously evaluated interventions for school-based smoking prevention with long-term follow-up data. METHODS: We searched online bibliographic databases and reference lists from review articles and selected st udies. We included all school-based, randomized, controlled trials of smoking prevention with follow-up evaluation to age 18 or 12th grade and at least 1 year after intervention en ded, and that had smoking prevalence as a primary outcome. The primary outcome was current smoking prevalence (defined as at least 1 cigarette in the past month). RESULTS: The abstracts or full-text articles of 177 relevant studies were examined, of which 8 met the selection criteria. The 8 articles included studies di ffering in intervention inte nsity, presence of booster sessions, follow-up periods, and attrition rates. Onl y one study showed decreased smoking prevalence in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have evaluated the long-term impact of school-based smoking prevention programs rigorous ly. Among the 8 programs that have follow-up data to age 18 or 12th grade, we found little to no evidence of long-term effectiveness. 30. Wilson SJ, Lipsey MW. School-based interventi ons for aggressive and disruptive behavior: update of a meta-analysis. Am J Pr ev Med 2007;33(2 Suppl):S130-S143. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Research about the effectiveness of school-based psychosocial prevention programs for reducing aggressive an d disruptive behavior was synthesize d using meta-analysis. This work updated previous work by the auth ors and further investigated which program and student characteristics were associated with the most positive outcomes. METHODS: Two hundred forty-nine experimental and quasi-experimental studies of school-based programs with outcomes representing aggressive and/or disruptive behavior were obtained. Effect sizes and study characteristic s were coded from these studies and analyzed. RESULTS: Positive overall intervention effects were found on aggressive and disr uptive behavior and other relevant outcomes. The most common and mo st effective approaches were universal programs and targeted programs for selected/indicated children. The mean effect sizes for these types of programs represent a decrease in aggressive/disruptive behavior that is likely to be of practical significance to schools. Multicomponent comprehensive programs did not show significant effects and those for special schools or classrooms were marginal. Different treatm ent modalities (e.g., behavioral, cognitive, social skills) produced largely similar effects. Effects were larger for better-impleme nted programs and those involving students at higher risk for aggressive behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Schools seeking prevention programs may choose from a range of effective programs with some confid ence that whatever they pick will be effective. Without the researcher involvement that characterizes the great majority of programs in this meta-analysis, schools might be well-advised to give prio rity to those that will be easiest to implement well in their settings. FOREBYGGE MISHANDLING 1. Coles L. Prevention of physical child abuse: concept, evidence and practice. Community Pract 2008;81(6):18-22. Abstract: Given a lack of standardised procedures for preventing child abuse, what can be done in terms of thinking and action about the preventi on of physical child abuse in health visiting and community practice? This paper reflects on knowledge gained while undertaking case series research into non-accidental head injury (NAHI), qualitative research with health visitors and mothers an d fathers into the feasibility of 48 Resultat preventing NAHI, and work as a team member of the Welsh Child Protection Systematic Review Group. Prevention is an abstract term, wi th dimensions of an ethical nature , and requires prompt and timely action. To identify when preventive action is required, an understanding is needed of where there is risk, and what benefit or outcome may follo w interventions. However, the knowledge in this field is limited, which means that it is wise to be cautious in claiming effectiveness of prevention activity. Nonetheless, if prevention is not seen to be practised, the developm ent of skills and the means to evaluate interventions will not become embedded in the routine care of famili es with small children, and physical child abuse will not be prevented. 2. Davis MK, Gidycz CA. Child sexual abuse a meta-analytic evaluation of the effectiveness of school-based child abuse prevention programs. Literature searches identified 27 studies meet ing inclusion criteria for use in this meta-analysis. The average effect size for all programs studied was 1.07, indicating that children who participated in prevention programs performed 1.07 SD higher than control group children on the outcome measures used in the studies. Analysis of moderator variables reveal ed significant effects for age, number of sessions, participant involvement, type of ou tcome measure, and use of behavioral skills training. Most important, programs presented over 4 or more sessions that allowed children to be come physically involved produced the highest effect sizes. Although most often used only with younger children, findings suggest that active, long-term programs may be more e ffective for children of all ages. 3.

MMWR Recomm Rep 2003;52(RR-14):1-9. Abstract: Early childhood home visita tion programs are those in which parents and children are visited in their home during the child's first 2 years of life by trained personnel who provide some combination of the following: information, support, or training regarding child health, development, and care. Home visitation has been used for a wide range of objectives, including improvement of the home environment, family development, and prevention of child behavior problems. The Task Force on Community Preventive Services (the Task Force) conducted a systematic review of scientific ev idence concerning the effectiveness of early childhood home visitation for preventing several forms of viol ence: violence by the visited child against self or others; violence against the child (i.e., maltreatment [abuse or ne glect]); other violence by the visited parent; and intimate partner violence. On the basis of strong evidence of effectiveness, the Task Force recommends early childhood home visitation for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the e ffectiveness of early childhood home visitation in preventing violence by visited children, violence by visited parents (other than child abuse and neglect), or intimate partner violence in visite d families. (Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.) No studies of home visitation evaluated suicide as an outcome. This report provides additional inform ation regarding the findings, briefly describes how the reviews were conducted, and provides information that can help in applying the recommended intervention locally. 4. MacLeod J, Nelson G. Programs for the promot ion of family wellness and the prevention of child maltreatment: a meta-analytic review. Child Abuse Negl 2000;24(9):1127-49. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to determine the effectiveness of programs in promoting family wellness and preventing child malt reatment and to identify factor s that moderate program success. METHOD: Meta-analysis, employing a 3-step model testing procedure, was used to review 56 programs designed to promote family wellness and prevent ch ild maltreatment. RESULTS: The effect sizes for proactive interventions were larger at follow-up than at post-assessment, while the effect sizes for reactive interventions were higher at post-a ssessment than follow-up. The lowest effect sizes for home visitation programs on child maltreatment were for programs with 12 or fewer visits and less than a 6-month duration. Intensive family preserva tion programs with high levels of participant involvement, an empowerment/strengths-based approach , and a component of social support had higher effect sizes than programs without those elements. Also, both home visitation and intensive family preservation interventions achieved higher effect sizes with part icipants of mixed socioeco nomic status (SES) than participants with low SES. CONCLUSIONS: The total me an weighted effect size was .41, indicating that outcomes for the intervention group exceed 66% of those in control/comparison groups. The findings from this review demonstrated that ch ild maltreatment can be prevented and that family wellness can be promoted. 5. MacMillan HL, Canadian Task Fo rce on Preventive Health Ca re. Preventive health care, 2000 update: prevention of child malt reatment. CMAJ 2000;163(11):1451-8. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To update the 1993 report from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (now the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care) by reviewing the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing child maltreatment desc ribed in the scientific literature over the past 6 years. OPTIONS: Screening: a variety of techniques including assessment of risk indicators. Prevention: programs including home visitation; comprehensive health care programs; parent education 49 Resultat and support, combined services and programs aimed specifically at preventing sexual abuse. OUTCOMES: Occurrence of one or more of the subcategories of physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect and emotional abuse in childhood. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, ERIC and several other databases were searched, experts were consulted, and published recommendations were reviewed. Original research articles and overviews that examined screening for or prevention of child maltreatment were included in the update. No meta-analysis was performed because the range of manoeuvres precluded co mparability. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Because of the high false-positive rates of screenin g tests for child maltreatment and the potential for mislabelling people as potential child abusers, the possible harms associated with these screening manoeuvres outweigh the benefits. Two randomized controlled trials showed a reduction in the incidence of childhood maltreatment or outcomes rela ted to physical abuse and neglect among first-time disadvantaged mothers and their infa nts who received a program of home visitation by nurses in the perinatal period extending through infancy. It is expected that a reduction in incidence of child maltreatment and other outcomes will lead to su bstantial government savings. Evidence remains inconclusive on the effectiveness of a comprehensive health care program, a parent education and support program, or a combination of servic es in preventing child maltreatment. Education programs designed to teach children prevention strategies to avoid sexual abuse show increased knowledge and skills but not necessarily reduced abuse. VALUES: The systematic re view and critical appraisal of the evidence were conducted according to the evidence-based methodology of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is further evidence of fair quality to exclude screening procedures aimed at identifying individuals at risk of experiencing or committ ing child maltreatment (grade D recommendation). There is good evidence to contin ue recommending a program of home visitation for disadvantaged families during the perinatal period extending through infancy to prevent child abuse and neglect (grade A recommendation). The target group fo r this program is first-time mothers with one or more of the following characteristics: age less than 19 years, single parent status and low socioeconomic status. The strongest evidence is for an intensive program of home visitation delivered by nurses beginning prenatally and extending until the child's second birthday. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a comprehensive health care program (grade C recommendation), a parent education and support program (grade C recommendation) or a co mbination of home-based services (grade C recommendation) as a strategy for preventing child maltreatment, but these interventions may be recommended for other reasons. There is insufficient evidence to recommend education programs for the prevention of sexual abuse (grade C recommendation); whether such programs reduce the incidence of sexual abuse has not been established. VALIDATION: The members of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care reviewed the findings of this analysis through an iterative process. The task force sent the final review and recommendations to selected external expert review ers, and their feedback was incorporated. SPONSORS: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care is funded through a partnership between the Provincial and Territorial Ministries of Health and Health Canada. 6. MacMillan HL, MacMillan JH, Offord DR, Griffi th L, MacMillan A. Primary prevention of child physical abuse and neglect: a crit ical review. J Child Psychol Psychiatry 1994;35(5):835-56. Abstract: This paper (Part I) and its companion paper (Part II) provide an overview of the primary prevention of child maltreatment. Part I reviews the effectiveness of interventions aimed at the primary prevention of child physical abuse and neglect. Pr ospective controlled trials published between January 1979 and May 1993 were systematically identified. The quality of each study was determined using criteria which assessed methodological rigor. Interventions ai med at the prevention of physical abuse and neglect were classified into six main categories within the broad group of perinatal and early childhood programs. While many of these programs did not show a reduction in physical abuse or neglect, there is evidence that extended home visitation can prevent physical abuse and neglect among disadvantaged families. 7. Mytton JA, DiGuiseppi C, Gough D, Taylor RS, Logan S. School-based secondary prevention programmes for preventing violenc e. Cochrane Database of Sy stematic CD004606. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004606.pub2. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early aggressive behaviour is a risk factor for later violence and criminal behaviour. Despite over 20 years of violence prevention interventions being delivered in the school setting, questions remain regarding the effectiveness of different interventions for children exhibiting aggressive behaviour. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of school based violence prevention programmes for children identified as aggressive or at risk of being aggressive. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Injuries Group specialised regi ster, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ot her specialised databases and reference lists of articles. We also contacted auth ors and organisations to identify any further studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included trials meeting the following criteria; 1) part icipants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups; 2) outcom e data were collected concurrently; 3) participants comprised children in mandatory education identified as exhibiting, or at risk of, aggressive behaviour; 4) interventions designed to reduce aggression, violence, bullying, conf lict or anger; 5) school based interventions; 6) outcomes included aggressive be haviour, school and agency responses to acts of aggression, or violent injuries. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were collected on design, participants, interventions, outcomes and indicators of study quality. Results of any intervention to no intervention were compared immediately post-interve ntion and at 12 months using meta-analysis where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Of 56 trials identified, none reported data on violent injuries. Aggressive 50 Resultat behaviour was significantly reduce d in intervention groups compar ed to no intervention groups immediately post intervention in 34 trials with da ta, (Standardised Mean Diffe rence (SMD) = -0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.26). This effect was maintained in the seven studies reporting 12 month follow-up (SMD = -0.40, (95% CI -0.73 to -0.06)). Sc hool or agency disciplinary actions in response to aggressive behaviour were reduced in intervention groups for nine trials with data, SMD = -0.48; 95% CI - 1.16 to 0.19, although this difference may have been due to chance and was no t maintained, based on two studies reporting follow-up to two to four months (SMD = 0.03; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.47). Subgroup analyses suggested that interventions designed to improve relati onship or social skills may be more effective than interventions designed to teach skills of non-response to provocative situations , but that benefits were similar when delivered to children in primary versus secondary school, and to groups of mixed sex versus boys alone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSI ONS: School-based secondary pr evention programmes to reduce aggressive behaviour appear to produce improvements in behaviour greater than would have been expected by chance. Benefits can be achieved in both primar y and secondary school age groups and in both mixed sex groups and boys-only groups. Fu rther research is required to establish whether such programmes reduce the incidence of violent injuries or if the bene fits identified can be maintained beyond 12 months. ARE SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMMES AIMED AT CH ILDREN WHO ARE CONSIDERED AT RISK OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR, EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING VI OLENCE?: Violence is recognised as a major global public health problem, thus there has been much attention placed on interventions aimed at preventing aggressive and violent behaviour. As aggressive behaviour in childhood is considered to be a risk factor for violence and criminal behaviour in adulthood, violence prevention strategies targeted at children and adolescents, such as school-based programmes, are considered to be promising interventions.Some school-based prev ention programmes target all childr en attending a school or class, whilst others confine the intervention to those children who have already been identified as exhibiting, or threatening, behaviour considered to be aggressive, such an approach is known as 'secondary prevention'. A wide variety of school-based violence prevention programmes have been implemented over the last 20 years, yet we are still without a full understanding of their effectiveness.The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of school-based secondary prevention programmes to prevent violence (that is those interventions targeted at children identified as aggressive or at risk of being aggressive) .The authors examined all trials investigating the effectiveness of secondary violence prevention programmes targeted at children in mandatory education compared to no intervention or a placebo intervention.The authors found 56 studies; the ov erall findings show that school-based secondary prevention programmes aimed at redu cing aggressive behaviour do appe ar to produce improvements in behaviour. The improvements can be achieved in bo th primary and secondary school age groups and in both mixed sex groups and boy-only groups.Further research is needed to investigate if the apparent beneficial programmes effects can be realised outside the experimental setting and in settings other than schools. None of the studies collected data on violent in jury, so we can not be certain of the extent to which an improvement in behaviour translates to an actual in jury reduction. In addition, more research is needed to determine if the beneficial effects can be maintained over time, and if the benefits can be justified against the costs of implementing such programmes. 8.

Abstract: about medication mana gement in primary and secondary schools; to place this knowledge in its drug use and organizational contexts; and to provide a foundation for studying the problem and developing policy- and practice-level interventions aimed at alleviating it. To offer recommendations for practitioners, policy makers, and health professions educators aimed at improving the situation. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE database (1966-1998); International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database (1977-1998); complete Medscape fu ll-text search; contents of the Journal of School Nursing and the Journal of Sc hool Health (1966-present) . STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed 95% of all articles, books, and reports identified using the search terms elementary school, middle school, junior high school, high sc hool, primary school, secondary school , school nurse, school health, and schoolchildren. DATA EXTRACTION: The literature on this topic includes background material describing the nature of the problem and its political and or ganizational context and implying its significance; summaries of regulations, guidel ines, and recommendations regardin g medication management in the schools; and empirical studies. Few articles address pharmacist involvement in medication management in schools. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although approaches to this important problem vary widely, a set of core medication management guidelines is identifiable. Formal research is sp arse, but it shows that medication use is widespread in schools and carries significant therapeutic and safety consequences. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists and school nurses must cross professional bo rders if they wish to play a role in solving this important drug therapy problem. Pharmacists can provide therapeutic and contextual perspectives on the problem, while school nurses can impl ement solutions within the schools. 9. Rispens J, Aleman A, Goudena PP. Prevention of child sexual abuse victimization: a meta- analysis of school programs. Chil d Abuse Negl 1997;21(10):975-87. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to provide data about the effects of child sexual abuse prevention programs. A more specific aim was to estimate the contribution of potential moderator variables such as age, program dura tion, or sample size to effect si ze. METHOD: A meta-analytic approach was used to calculate post-test and follow-up effect size s of 16 evaluation studies of school programs aimed 51 Resultat at the prevention of child sexual abuse victimization. Tests of categorical models were used in the analysis of moderator variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine their association with effect sizes. RESULTS: Significant and considerable mean post-intervention (d = .71) and follow-up (d = .62) effect sizes were found, indicating that victimizat ion prevention programs are successful in teaching children sexual abuse concepts and self-protection ski lls. Intervention characteristics such as duration and content of the program, and child characteristics such as age and SES were important moderators of effect size. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings corroborate and refine the positive conclusions of traditional narrative reviews. Programs that focus on skill training, allo wing sufficient time for children to integrate self- protection skills into their cognitive repertoire, are to be preferred. Future evaluation research should focus on transfer of training. 10. Zwi K, Woolfenden S, Wheeler DM, O'Brien T, Tait P, Williams KJ.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Child sexual abuse is a signif icant problem that requires an effective means of prevention. OBJECTIVES: To assess: if school-based programmes are effective in improving knowledge about sexual abuse and self-protective behaviours; whether participation resu lts in an increase in disclosure of sexual abuse and/or produces any ha rm; knowledge retention and the effect of programme type or setting. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic sear ches of Cochrane Centra Sociolog ical Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts and other databases using MESH headings and text words specific for child sexual assault and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in August 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs or quasi-RCTs of school- based interventions to prevent child sexual abuse compared with another intervention or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Meta-analyses and sensitivity analysis, using two imputed intraclass correlation coefficients (I CC) (0.1, 0.2), were used for four outcomes: protective behaviours, questionnaire-based knowledge, vignette-based knowledge and disclosure of abuse. Meta-analysis was not possible for retention of knowledge, likelihood of ha rm, or effect of programme type and setting. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen trials measuring knowledge and behaviour change as a result of school-based child sexual abuse intervention programmes were included. Ov er half the studies in each initial meta-analysis contained unit of analysis errors. For behaviour chan ge, two studies had data su itable for meta-analysis; results favoured intervention (OR 6.76, 95% CI 1.44, 31.84) with moderate heterogeneity (I2=56.0%) and did not change significantly when ad justments using intraclass coefficien ts were made. Ni ne studies were included in a meta-analysis evaluating questionnair e-based knowledge. An increase in knowledge was found (SMD 0.59; 0.44, 0. 74, heterogeneity (I2=66.4%). When adjusted for an ICC of 0.1 and 0.2 the results were SMD 0.6 (0.45, 0.75) and 0.57 (0.44, 0.71) respectively. Heterogeneity decreased with increasing ICC. A meta-analysis of four studies evaluating vignette-based knowledge favoured intervention (SMD 0.37 (0.18, 0.55)) with lo w heterogeneity (I2=0.0%) and no significant change when ICC adjustments were made. Meta-analysis of between-group differences of reported disclosures did not show a statistically significant difference. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Studies ev aluated in this review report significant improvements in knowledge measures and protective behaviours. Re sults might have differed had the true ICCs from studies been available or cluster-adjusted results been available. Several studies reported harms, suggesting a need to monitor the impa ct of similar intervention s. Retention of knowledge should be measured beyond 3-12 months. Further investigation of th e best forms of presentation and optimal age of programme deli very is required. SCHOOL-BAS ED PROGRAMMES FOR PREVENTING CHILD SEX ABUSE MAY IMPROVE KNOWLEDGE AN D SELF-PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOURS BUT ALSO INCREASE ANXIETY; FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED : Childhood sexual abuse is a serious problem for school aged children worldwide. There is no consistent definition of sexual abuse. Some studies restrict sexual abuse to instances of sexual body contact with the child, while others define sexual abuse as any sexual behaviour in a child's presence. Whatever its fo rm, childhood sexual abuse can have a very negative impact on a child. The United Nation s' Convention on the Rights of the Child states that \"children have the right to be protected from being hurt and mistreated, physically or mentally\" and the international community needs to investigate ways this can be done effectively. One widespread method used is to teach school aged children, using school-based progra ms, about child sexual abuse and how to protect themselves from it. It is important to know if this appr oach works, for how long it works and if it causes any unintended harm to children and adolescents. This is the purpose of this systematic review.While this review found improvements in knowledge and protective behaviours among children who had received school-based programs, these results should be interpreted with caution. The reasons for a need for caution is that there were problems with the way that many of the original studies were analysed, children's knowledge was tested only a short time period after the program, the studies were conducted in North America and therefore may not apply to other countries and cultures, and several studies reported harms, such as increased anxiety in children. Potential harms need to be closely monitored in future studies and existing school based programs. It is difficult to know if the changes in children's knowledge and protective behaviours seen in the studies will result in prevention of child sexu al abuse. As such, school-based programs should, at best, be seen as part of a community approach to the prevention of child sexual abuse. 52 Resultat SELVMORDSFOREBYGGING 1. Guo B, Harstall C.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the treatment of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents. METHOD: After discussing the principles of treatment, we review the literature regarding adequate assessment, hospital-based services and their alternatives, and follow-up. RESULTS: Treatment modalities (including psychotherapy) and preventive strategies (including school-based interventions, gatekeeper and primary practitioner training, and treatment of psychiatric disorders) are considered in the light of existing evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of youth at risk for suicide should include attention to well-established risk fact ors, but prediction of risk remain s difficult. Treatment of suicidal children and adolescents should be evidence-based and may include psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. Effective methods of prevention are emerging, but more research is needed. SOSIAL ULIKHET 1. Gepkens A, Gunning-Schepers LJ. Interven tions to health differences: a review of the international litera ture. Eur J Public Health 1996;6(3):218-26. Abstract: The objective of this study was to review information on evaluated interventions to reduce socioeconomic health differences (SEHD) and analyse studies to identify possible conditions for success. The analysed interventions were from published and unpublished sources. They were evaluated in terms of socioeconomic health outcomes. Ninety-eight publications on actual interventions to reduce SEHD and 31 so-called 'grey literature' interventions were identified. Many of the interventions described are reported to be effective. Many of the local experimental interventions, however, were not formally evaluated. Structural measures appear to be effective most often, but cannot be taken to affect all determinants. Interventions often Involve health education. This, however, only appe ars to be successful if providing information is combined with personal support or structural measures. Many very creative interventions to reduce SEHD have been reported. Several appear to be effective, but all address only a small aspect of health inequalities. 53 Resultat Regrettably the lack of standardized measures and a common methodology hamper our ability to integrate and compare the results. However, all the studies show that there is room for improvement in our existing health policies to reach everyone in our population to the same degree of effectiveness. 2.
