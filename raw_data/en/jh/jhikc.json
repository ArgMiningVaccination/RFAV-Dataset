possible temperature effect on vaccine No change in ACIP recommendation for LAIV LAIV Preference, 2014 -2015 When immediately available, LAIV should be used for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions If LAIV is not immediately available, IIV should be used Vaccination should not be delayed to procure LAIV MMWR 2014;63:691 -7 Approved only for persons 18 through 64 years of age Afluria Administered by PharmaJet Device Randomized trial of PharmaJet vs. standard IM injection Immunogenicity and safety -no difference in titer or seroprotection rates -more local reactions with PharmaJet -no difference in systemic AEs Pertussis Vaccine and Healthcare Personnel Tdap Vaccines Both vaccines approved by FDA for only 1 dose Tdap vaccine is effective but protection begins to wane within 3 years (75% to 35% in 3 years) Both companies are studying Tdap revaccination A second dose of Tdap is safe and immunogenic Pertussis Vaccine and HCPs Pertussis transmission occurs in healthcare settings HCP are at risk of pertussis exposure Current Tdap coverage among HCP is 31% (2012) No current evidence that additional doses of Tdap would help reduce exposures or transmission in healthcare setting Pertussis Vaccine and HCPs At this time the pertussis Work Group does not propose a change to the current Tdap recommendation for HCP Focus on current Tdap program -improve adult Tdap coverage, including HCP -vaccinate pregnant women to protect infants General Recommendations on Immunization Major sections -Timing and spacing (intervals, ages, etc) -Contraindications and precautions -Vaccine administration -Storage and handling -Altered immunocompetence -Special situations (pregnancy, breastfeeding, allergy, vaccination outside the U.S. -Vaccination records and IISs -Vaccination programs General Recommendations on Immunization Major sections -Timing and spacing (intervals, ages, etc) -Contraindications and precautions -Vaccine administration -Storage and handling -Altered immunocompetence -Special situations (pregnancy, breastfeeding, allergy, vaccination outside the U.S. -Vaccination records and IISs -Vaccination programs Approved at October 2014 meeting General Recommendations on Immunization Scheduled to vote on the entire document at the February 2015 meeting Estimated publication in 2016 (?)
