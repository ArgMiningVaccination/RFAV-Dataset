A silicone gel sheet is a soft, flexible, self-adhesive dressing that is applied over scars. It contains silicone. Silicone can help to improve the colour, height and texture of a scar. Silicone can also relieve itching and discomfort caused by a scar. How does it work? It is not clear exactly how Silicone works on a scar. Some research suggests that the silicone creates a protective barrier over the scar which allows it to mature while helping to prevent production of excess scar tissue. The silicone layer also assists with hydration of the scar. Where can I get silicone gel sheets? There are different brands of silicone gel sheet available. Your therapist will assess which one is most suitable for your scar and demonstrate how to use it by providing you with a small sample. We request that your GP provide an ongoing supply. You will be given a letter to give to your GP requesting this. How do I use a silicone gel sheet? - Ensure that the affected area is clean and dry. - Wipe off any excess cream if you have been using cream to massage. - Remove the protective backing on the sheet and place the sticky side on your skin. Build up your skin tolerance. Wear the sheet for 4 hours daily for two days. Then increase to time advised by your therapist. - Wash the gel sheet daily using lukewarm soapy water, rinse well and dry by patting it with a non-fluffy towel. - Wear the same piece of silicone until it starts to deteriorate, then replace it with a new piece. - Cica-care (a clear, thick, gel sheet ) will last for 4 weeks. - Mepiform (a thin, beige coloured dressing) will last for 1-2 weeks. - Keep gel sheets in a clean, plastic tub when not using it. Store gel sheets in a cool, dry place. Precautions - Do not use the gel sheet on open wounds. If you develop a wound in your scar, remove the gel sheet and keep it safe until the wound is healed. - Don't forget to wash the gel sheet. A build up of dirt or bacteria may irritate the scar. - Do not throw the gel sheet away if you develop any irritation or redness in response to using it. Remove the sheet, wash and dry your skin. Leave the sheet off until the symptoms resolve, then try it again, building up the skin tolerance slowly How long should I continue to use a silicone gel sheet on my scar? 90 days is the recommended initial treatment period. However, you may be advised to continue to use it for longer than this by your therapist depending on the appearance and age of the scar.
