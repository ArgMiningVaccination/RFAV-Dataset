It is injected monthly into belly fat. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) \u2014 A class of medicines used to shrink an enlarged prostate. These drugs prevent testosterone from converting to a more powerful stimulant of prostate cells, dihydrotestosterone.

It's performed using tissue obtained either from a biopsy or a prostatectomy. Gleason grade group \u2014 The Gleason system is used to assess how likely it is that a prostate tumor will grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. The system was recently simplified and grades are now summarized on a scale of 1 to 5 (least to most aggressive). Gleason 3+3 is grade group 1, Gleason 3+4 is grade group 2, Gleason 4+3 is grade group 3, Gleason 4+4 is grade group 4, and Gleason 4+5 or higher is grade group 5. Gleason system (grade and score) \u2014 Used to assess the cancer's aggressiveness. Samples of prostate cancer cells are examined under a microscope and graded on a scale of 1 to 5, according to how much the cell arrangement differs from that of normal prostate cells. Grades are given to the two most common arrangements found in the sample. These grades are then added for an overall score.

Also known ADT-resistant prostate castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or androgen-independent prostate cancer. Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer \u2014 Also called ADT-sensitive cancer. A prostate cancer that can be controlled by reducing the body's testosterone levels.

Lupron (leuprolide) \u2014 A synthetic testosterone-reducing hormone that's injected into muscle on a schedule ranging from once a month to every three, four or six months. (See Eligard for an alternative version injected under the skin.) Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist \u2014 A class of drugs used in hormone therapy to shut down production of testosterone by the testicles. This treatment is sometimes called medical castration because these drugs lower testosterone levels as effectively as surgical removal of the testes. Lymph nodes \u2014 Also called lymph glands. These small, bean-shaped structures play a key role in the immune system by filtering bacteria, foreign particles or cancer cells from the circulation. They are often the site of tumor metastases. Lymphatic system \u2014 The network of tissues and organs - including the bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes - that produces, stores and carries the white blood cells that fight infection and disease. Lymphedema \u2014 Swelling in arms or legs often resulting from removal or damage to lymph nodes in cancer treatment. Lynparza (olaparib) and Rubraca (rucaparib) \u2014 Drugs called PARP inhibitors that target cancer cells and prevent them from repairing themselves, allowing them to die.

Nubeqa (darolutamide) \u2014 An antiandrogen drug approved by the FDA in 2019 that has fewer neurological side effects than other antiandrogens because it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier. Like Erleada, Nubeqa is nonmetastatic, ADT-resistant prostate cancer.

Orgovyx works in a manner similar to Firmagon to quickly reduce testosterone to very low levels. Osteoblastic \u2014 This term refers to bone cell production, which can become abnormal when prostate cancer metastasizes to bones. The tumor signals the bone to make extra bone cells, which results in the formation of thickened, inflexible bone. Osteopenia \u2014 A condition in which the bones have lost calcium and other minerals. Bone density is reduced but not yet as low as in osteoporosis. Osteoporosis \u2014 A condition in which the bones are brittle from loss of mass and minerals. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) increases the risk for osteoporosis.

Pluvicto is administered intravenously. Prednisone \u2014 A corticosteroid that can reduce inflammatory responses. Prednisone is often given with chemotherapy or the antiandrogen drug Zytiga. Primary tumor \u2014 In prostate cancer, any tumor within the prostate gland. Prognosis \u2014 A judgment about the likely course of a disease and the probable outcome of treating it. Prolaris \u2014 A test from Myriad Genetics that indicates how aggressive a cancer is likely to be. It's performed using tissue obtained from either a biopsy or a prostatectomy. Prostate \u2014 A walnut-shaped gland that produces fluid for semen. Located between the base of the penis and the rectum. Prostatectomy \u2014 Surgical removal of the prostate and adjacent seminal vesicles.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) \u2014 A protein produced by both normal and malignant cells in the prostate gland. Elevated levels in the bloodstream can indicate prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The PSA blood test is used to help detect prostate cancer, estimate the extent of cancer and monitor treatment results. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) \u2014 These proteins grow on the surface of prostate cancer cells and can be a biomarker of prostate cancer. PSMA proteins can be used as targets for radioactive isotopes, which can identify cancer cells on a PET scan or potentially destroy them. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) \u2014 An enzyme produced by the prostate gland. Changes in bloodstream levels of PAP may indicate tumor progression or recurrence. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) \u2014 Precancerous changes in prostate gland cells; they look abnormal under a microscope but are not cancerous. About half of all men have PIN by age 50. Provenge (sipuleucel-T) \u2014 One of two FDA-approved immunotherapies for prostate cancer. A type of cancer vaccine, Provenge employs certain white blood cells taken from the patient and specially treated to kill the cancer cells. PSA density (PSAD) \u2014 This measurement is determined by dividing a patient's PSA by the volume of his prostate. It's considered a more accurate indicator of cancer than PSA alone. PSA nadir \u2014 The lowest point to which a patient's PSA drops following potentially curative treatment. This concept is especially important in the context of radiation therapy, as its effects on PSA may take months or years to fully show. Also used during intermittent hormone therapy. PSMA scan \u2014 A highly advanced imaging technique that can detect the presence of PSMA, a protein on the surface of prostate cancer cells. This scan can pick up very small tumors that other tests might miss. [back to top](#TOP) Radiation oncologist \u2014 A doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation therapy.

Stage and staging \u2014 A cancer's stage usually uses numbers and sometimes letters to describe the tumor's size and to what extent the disease has spread beyond the initial site. Staging refers to the tests and examinations done to determine the stage. These may include biopsies; lab tests; surgical procedures; and imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, PET scans and ultrasounds.

It's also necessary for prostate cancer cells to grow. Testosterone flare \u2014 A brief rise in testosterone levels following the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with drugs such as Lupron or Eligard (but not with Firmagon or Orgovyx).
