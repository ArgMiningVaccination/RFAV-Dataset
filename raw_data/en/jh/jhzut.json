Acupuncture usually involves the insertion of thin sterile needles into discrete and specific points on the body in order to cause a therapeutic effect. Acupuncture points are stimulated using very fine needles, almost as thin as a hair, and for that reason it's non-painful. 95% of patients are comfortable with acupuncture therapy. Acupuncture has been shown to induce the following positive effects: - Pain Relief - Promotion of tissue healing processes - Regulation of gastrointestinal motility - Anti-inflammatory effects - Hormone and reproductive regulation - Antifebrile effects Many times, acupuncture is combined with herbal medicine because the use of herbs enhances the effectiveness of the acupuncture. Herbal medicine is available for a variety of conditions such as behavioral, pain management, GI issues, liver and kidney conditions, as well as cancer support. Interested in acupuncture and TCVM? Call or text 801-901-6836 to schedule an appointment with Dr. Bresnahan, our certified acupuncturist, to find out how acupuncture and TCVM can help your pet.

Regular blood work will monitor their liver and kidneys for any changes in functionality, as well as monitoring their thyroid, and checking for diabetes.

Surgery Anytime your pet needs to have surgery, it can be an nerve-wracking experience knowing your pet is going under anesthesia. We want to make sure all of your questions have been answered. When your pet is scheduled to have surgery with us, you might be wondering all that entails. Below is a step-by-step process of when your pet stays with us while they have surgery. - Your Pet will need to be fasted - no food or water the morning of surgery and no food after dinner the night before. - You will drop your pet off between 8:00-8:30 am. There will be a couple of [forms](/online-forms-2/)for you to sign when you get here - you can fill out one of the [forms](/online-forms-2/)beforehand by clicking [here](#). - After your pet is dropped off, the doctor who will be doing your pet's surgery will do a pre-surgical physical exam, and if they find any concerns on the exam, they will contact you. - A blood sample will then be collected, and blood work will be done to check their CBC, liver, kidney, and blood glucose levels. If the doctor finds any concerns about their blood work, they will contact you. - If everything is found to be normal with your pet's exam and blood work, we will proceed with surgery. They will be given medications to help relax them and prepare them for sedation. Once they are relaxed, we will place an IV catheter in their leg and administer the anesthesia. An endotracheal tube will be placed, and they will be maintained on gas anesthetics for the surgery. Your pet will also receive IV fluids during surgery to help with blood pressure and to keep them hydrated after fasting. - While your pet is being operated on, they are being closely monitored by a surgical assistant and with high-end monitoring equipment. - Once surgery is done, a surgery assistant will use a therapy laser on the incision site to help reduce inflammation and speed up healing time. The surgery assistant also stays with your pet until they wake up from anesthesia. - When your pet is out of surgery, we will call you and let you know how everything went and when they will be ready to go home. If you have any questions about the surgery or the process, please don't hesitate to reach out and ask us. You can call or text with any questions you have at [ (801) 901-6836](tel: (801) 901-6836).
