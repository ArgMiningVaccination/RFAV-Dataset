All staff and AAP employees, including part-time and temporary employees, are provided 88 hours (equal to 11 full-time working days) of COVID-19 Vaccination PTO, which is only to be used if an employee cannot work, either on campus or remotely, during their scheduled work hours because of the following reasons: - Vaccination Appointments: Up to 4 hours of COVID-19 Vaccination PTO per injection appointment, including primary vaccination dose(s) and booster(s), for the following individuals: - Employee's appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. - Employee's minor child's appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccination (for the purposes of this policy, a \"minor child\" means a child under the age of 18 years who lives with an employee and for whom the employee permanently assumes and discharges parental responsibility, or a foster child under the age of 18 years). - Vaccination Recovery: Up to 16 hours of COVID-19 Vaccination PTO per vaccination appointment, available to be taken within the 2 days following a vaccination appointment, for the following individuals: - Employee's own short-term side effects after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. - Employee's minor child's short-term side effects after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Employees may request to use COVID-19 Vaccination PTO by completing a time off request in [GMS](https://gms.georgetown.edu/) through the COVID-19 Vaccination PTO time off plan. Please give your manager as much advance notice as possible when requesting leave. Please reference this [job aid](https://georgetown.box.com/s/g9y4t757gz8fg878kxpnxnob3yoff3ml) for how to request this time in GMS if you have any questions. COVID-19 Vaccination PTO is an expansion of our existing [COVID-19 PTO](https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/s3zg9h1yom8i3c9etz54irxecr2zp1zp) category and [COVID-19 PTO Donation Bank](https://georgetown.app.box.com/s/oy1rmnta32bzz683frgemz4j2xw60nky), which employees have previously been able to use for vaccination appointments and recovery. As of today, employees should now use the [COVID-19 Vaccination PTO](https://georgetown.box.com/s/t6apdo4dbjbe808yjru6dlrbel7i249y) category for all PTO requests connected to vaccination appointments or recovery. Employees may continue to use their COVID-19 PTO for other COVID-19-related purposes (e.g., COVID-19 illness, testing, or care for a family member with COVID-19 or additional vaccination-related needs). Employees who exhaust both their COVID-19 Vaccination PTO and COVID-19 PTO leave balance can immediately access the COVID-19 PTO Donation Bank for vaccination-related purposes. You can find all [COVID-19-related workplace policies on the HR website](https://hr.georgetown.edu/covid/). As Dr. Mishori shared in her [November 10 message](https://www.georgetown.edu/news/updates-on-covid-19-testing-booster-shot-clinics-and-spring-vaccination-deadline/), we strongly encourage all employees to get a COVID-19 booster shot as soon as they are eligible. When you get your booster shot, please [upload documentation](https://uis.georgetown.edu/coronavirus-instructions-for-uploading-your-vaccination-documentation/) of this dose via the GU360 mobile app or [GU360 website](https://gu360.georgetown.edu/s/). If you have any questions, please contact the University's Care Navigator team at [covidcarenavigator@georgetown.edu](mailto:covidcarenavigator@georgetown.edu). As a reminder, you can find numerous other resources at the [GUCares website](https://benefits.georgetown.edu/gucares/).
