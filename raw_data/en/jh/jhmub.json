Association, Inc. ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY STAFF Rebecca Gebhart, Interim Agency Director James Nguyen, Administrative Services Officer Connie Soriano, Administrative Specialist IIFY 2013/14 Measure A Executive Summary ABOUT THE MEASURE A OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE One of the provisions of Measure A required the establishment of a Citizen Oversight Committee. The Committee's role is to annually review Measure A expenditures for each fiscal year and report to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) on whether such expenditures conform to the purposes set forth in the Measure. The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the board of supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" The Oversight Committee spent several months reviewing allocation reports, convening and deliberating concerns, communicating concerns to providers, highlighting provider accomplishments, and reviewing and editing the Measure A report. As part of this process, the Committee used the report forms returned by most Measure A fund recipients, along with information from several provider presentations, to review all funding allocations. OVERALL CONCLUSION The Oversight Committee found that Alameda Health System (AHS) and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in compliance with the strictures of Measure A. The Oversight Committee did have concerns for a small number of allocations. These concerns are noted in this Executive Summary and in the individual report summaries for the relevant providers. History of the Measure Measure A, the Essential Health Care Services Initiative , was passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004. In June 2014, 76% of voters passed Measure AA, which extended the initiative through 2034. Both measures authorize the County of Alameda to raise its sales tax by one-half cent to provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County . A AA 3Measure A generated $126,761,410 in FY 13/14. Highlights Even in light of recent and ongoing federal health care reform, according to American Community Survey data for 2014, an estimated 182,223 people, or 11.8% of County residents, are uninsured. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to essential health services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee and the Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) to improve the accountability of Measure A recipients by implementing a Results-Based Accountability framework to help providers report measurable performance data that describes the effort, quality, and impact of their programs and services.DISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDS 25% 75%Of the $126,761,410 that Measure A generated in FY 13/14, AHS received 75% and the remainder of the funds were distributed by the Board to many health care providers to provide essential health care services. 14%40% 15%14%17%Behavioral Services Acute Ambulatory Services Primary Care24% 18% 33% 24%Hospital, Tertiary Care, Other the Board of Supervisors Measure A Funding Approved by Allocati on of Measure A Funds toAlameda Health $95.1 million*Note: Board allocations are made in advance of a given fiscal year. Therefore, the amount generated by Measure A for that year does not equal the amount allocated by the Board. 4Highlights (continued) Large Numbers Served Measure A enabled a large number of providers to continue existing programs and maintain the service levels offered by these programs. For example, AHS saw more than 100,000 patients in its emergency departments systemwide and conducted more than 320,000 outpatient visits, while the Public Health Prevention Initiative served more than 100,000 Measure A clients. Similarly, the community-based primary care health centers affiliated with the Alameda Health Consortium provided comprehensive care for more than 39,000 Measure A clients, who made a total of 111,686 visits. Increased Access to Care Measure A funds increased access to health care services both through new/expanded facilities and through the provision of a greater number and variety of services. At AHS alone, orthopedic visits to Highland Hospital increased 81% over the baseline year FY 10/11, while cardiology visits increased 47%. Highland also expanded lactation services to seven days per week, established a new Sunday high risk newborn clinic, opened a Same Day Clinic (SDC) for patients with serious but non-life-threatening conditions, and doubled enrollment in the Complex Care Program from 214 to 427 patients. Among the Wellness Centers, Newark Wellness expanded specialty care services to include psychiatry, mammography, early oral preventive pediatric care services, and prenatal centering program; Hayward Wellness relocated to Southland Mall to accommodate 36 new exam rooms covering over 23,000 square feet; and Eastmont Wellness expanded specialty care services to 16 exam rooms and 6,600 square feet. Improved Outcomes Most providers presented clear, quantified information that showed increases in the number of clients served, increases in desired outcomes, or decreases in harmful behavior as a result of Measure A-funded services. For example, children participating in the Alameda County Dental Health WIC \"Dental Days\" had 42% fewer restorative dental treatment needs compared to children who did not benefit from the program, while San Leandro Hospital showed significant reductions in patients leaving without being seen (-77%), emergency department (ED) arrival-to- discharge times (-32%), operating room (OR) turnover times (-75%), and ED arrival-to-provider times (-61%).Children participating in the Alameda County Dental Health WIC \"Dental Days\" had 42% fewer restorative dental treatment needs compared to children who did not benefit from the program. 42% Ambulatory Services 5$21.7 millionClient surveys revealed more qualitative outcomes also. At Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE), 88% of clients surveyed reported that they felt safer and more equipped to make their own decisions. Research data for the Mind Body Awareness program revealed significant decreases (19.6%) in perceived stress, increases (23.7%) in healthy self-regulation, and increases in self-esteem (14.1%) from pre- to post-testing among youth participants in the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center. Service Stabilization Compared to the preceding year, FY 13/14 saw a decline of only 2% in both the number of clients served and number of services delivered by the Behavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Community. Given County General Fund reductions of 10% and a cost of living increase of 2.4% for that period, Measure A support was very effective in stabilizing services. Hospitalization Reduction As a result of immediate crisis intervention offered by Mental Health Services at the Juvenile Justice Center, only two clients were hospitalized in FY 13/14. In addition, thanks in part to Measure A funding, Preventive Care Pathways clients experienced a reduction in emergency room visits to AHS and outside emergency rooms. Geographic Reach Measure A funds increased access to health care services both geographically and through the provision of a greater number and variety of services. For example, Eden Youth and Family Center serves a community of high need in South Hayward, and has developed a long- term strategic plan to help area youth and families. The program works collaboratively with its network of partnerships, which increases the effectiveness of all the organizations. Matching Funds The recipients of the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board received a total of $33.6 million in allocations. This same group of providers obtained $21.7 million in matching funds from public and private sources. These matching funds represent a $.63 match for every $1 in Measure A funds. AHS alone obtained $104 million in matching funds on its $95.2 million Measure A allocation, thus obtaining better than a 1:1 return.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$34.8 million The recipients of the 25% of Measure A funds allocated by the Board obtained $21,746,090 in matching funds from public and private sources. 6Flexible Response Measure A gives the County flexibility to address unmet needs and unanticipated costs. Specifically, the $150,000 each member of the Board receives as a discretionary allocation gives the supervisors the flexibility to respond to unanticipated needs in their districts. Over the period of this report, there were 16 contracts for services for youth, children, seniors, and the general population from the allocations. During this period, the Committee noted an increased focus on healthy living, wellness, and prevention initiatives. Award-Winning Service AHS programs and staff received numerous awards and accolades. As just some examples: Fairmont Hospital received a 4-Star quality rating from the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), while Alameda Hospital received a Gold Plus Award from the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association for excellence in the treatment of heart disease, heart failure, and stroke. Highland Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Technicians earned elite designation as a Registered Cardiovascular Invasive Specialist (RCIS) from Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI). John George Psychiatric Hospital (JGPH) Director of Nursing, Judy Linn, was honored with the Annual Leadership Award from the American Psychiatric Nurses Association, while the Occupational Therapy Department at JGPH was honored with the Outstanding Collaboration & Support Award from the Alameda County Network of Mental Health Clients. Concerns In developing this report, the Oversight Committee identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2013) and in the foreseeable future. While Measure A tax revenues have gradually increased each year since their lowest levels in 2010, economic indicators reveal that the annual rate of change from the prior year started to decrease in 2012. In addition, per capita sales tax has declined and continues to trend downward, which will impact the revenues raised by the measure. Furthermore, many families living in disadvantaged communities have not benefited from the improved job and housing markets during the economic recovery over the past few years and continue to need access to the essential health care services that Measure A provides.The Board discretionary allocations enabled the supervisors to respond to unanticipated needs in their districts and focus on healthy living, wellness, and prevention initiatives.. 7At the same time, the Committee is paying close attention to the recent and ongoing state and federal health care reform initiatives, which have resulted in the expansion of health coverage to more than 200,000 previously uninsured County residents after 2014. While this accomplishment represented a boost to health access for many children, adults, and families, more than 33,000 individuals in Alameda County continue to remain uninsured. Moreover, funding cuts from the previous five years, Medi-Cal rate reductions, and potential state and federal funding cuts have deteriorated the County's safety net, decreased the ability of health providers to offer services to the Medi-Cal and uninsured populations, and challenged health care expansion efforts. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventative care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream in developing creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care service delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. The Committee notes that this should be an area of ongoing focus as Committee member selections are made moving forward. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns. NOTE: The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. General Funding Concerns The Committee recommends that HCSA create a process for Measure A recipients to verify that they are using Measure A funds to provide their described programs to the populations listed in the measure. This process can include HCSA staff providing training to Measure A recipients on how to effectively collect demographic data to report on the diverse populations of indigent, uninsured, and low income clients they serve by race, ethnicity, geography, and language. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. 8Reporting and Review Concerns As part of its role in providing fiscal oversight, the Committee recognizes a need for providers and HCSA to work together to evaluate the long-term impact of Measure A investments in Alameda County. The Oversight Committee believes that the interpretation of the statute must be revised to expand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to all grantees. The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinance limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the Committee does not have the capacity to review HCSA's process of controls and review of how the money is spent\u2014via audit or other method. The Committee recommends that the Board authorize HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in all its programs. This includes identifying an additional resource to ensure that Measure A contracts are included in the initiative. Although reporting continues to improve, the Committee expresses the ongoing concern that its review is impacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether funding is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example: - Multiple provider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. For example, Behavioral Health Care Services at Juvenile Justice Center makes assertions of \"increased coping skills\" and \"a great benefit\" from court-ordered evaluations without quantifying these statements. The Mind Body Awareness Project was unable to collect data during this period due to organizational transitions, which made it difficult for the Committee to determine program effectiveness. - For some reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" For example, the information presented by providers such as Service Opportunities for Seniors and the Teleosis Institute does not track whether the population served falls within the requirements of Measure A. - In other reports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. For example, while the Committee recognizes the value of the California Product Stewardship Council drug disposal program, it is unclear whether these activities and their target populations fall within the wording of Measure A. 9In light of some of these reporting concerns, the Committee recommends that trainings reinforce proper and accurate completion of demographic information and adherence to Measure A services. Additionally, the Committee recommends that HCSA continue to work with recipients to improve the use of results-based performance measures and ensure that the population and services supported with Measure A comply with the ordinance. The Committee recommends that the recipient reporting form include a question about service delivery in multiple languages, as language barriers can potentially impede access to services for members of the Measure A target population. Alameda Health System In describing its program accomplishments, AHS often does not provide measurable objectives, making it difficult to get a sense of progress from the prior year. The Committee notes that this feedback has been offered for several years to AHS/Alameda County Medical Center. UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland The Committee notes that UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland does not list measurable objectives, a concern that has been raised in the last several years. ED encounters can vary due to the severity of flu seasons and other unexpected health trends. Therefore, it is understandable that total ED encounters may change from year to year. However, measurable objectives should still be set and performance measured. This also applies to the Center for Child Protection (CCP) and school clinics. Also, two-thirds of the hospital's $2.5 million allocation helps offset undercompensated costs of ED visits from patients with Medi-Cal. However, the hospital administration states that it is \"not reasonable nor possible to tie the Measure A funding to a specific number of patient encounters. \" The Committee asserts that this can and should be done to ensure accountability for use of public tax dollars. San Leandro Hospital The provider report states that the hospital folded Measure A funding into their general operating budget: \" As described in previous presentations and reports, we don't specifically allocate these funds to individual programs; rather, all of our operations are combined and we endeavor to track the profitability for each of our programs. \" The Committee asks the provider to show an awareness of the purpose of this public money and to address its requirements in the specific manner defined in the measure. 10Indigent Health Stabilization Healthy Communities The provider report indicates that logistical and other problems interfered with completion of tasks funded by Measure A. There is no indication of when these tasks will be completed. West Oakland Health Council No report was submitted. Therefore, there is no evidence of any compliance. The Oversight Committee cannot assume that the funds were used in compliance with Measure A. Until this situation is resolved, the Oversight Committee recommends that this organization should not receive any further Measure A funding. Primary Care Community-Based Organizations Healthy Communities In addition to the eight clinics that are members of the Alameda Health Consortium, a ninth provider, Healthy Communities (not a member of the consortium) received an allocation of $163,114. No information was provided regarding the use of Measure A funds by Healthy Communities, and no additional report was submitted. City of San Leandro From the information provided, it is not clear whether the City of San Leandro prioritized and/or ended up serving underserved populations. 11Alameda County Board of SupervisorsDISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDSHOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT Alameda Health System Board of Trustees25% 75%Measure A tax revenue is used to provide emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low income, and uninsured adults, children and families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. Each year, the Alameda Health System (AHS) receives 75% of Measure A funds, which is allocated by their Board of Trustees to provide primary and specialty care, preventative, and mental health services to patients served at AHS's multiple facilities, including Highland Hospital, John George Psychiatric Hospital, Fairmont Hospital, San Leandro Hospital, and Alameda Hospital. The remaining 25% of the Measure A funds received is allocated by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) to provide critical medical services offered by community-based health care providers, emergency care, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to address the many health needs of communities throughout the County. In FY 13/14, Measure A generated $126,761,410 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows: Alameda Health System (75%): budget totaled $2,622,397,815. The HCSA approved budget totaled $664,880,978, or 25.4% of the total County budget. Measure A revenues not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 4.6% of the HCSA budget. The following sections in the report provide more detail on how AHS and the Board spent Measure A funds in FY 13/14, which includes revenue generated in the reporting year as well as unspent funds earned in previous years. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 12BACKGROUND Alameda Health System (AHS) is a patient- and family-centered system of care that promotes wellness, eliminates disparities, and optimizes the health of its diverse communities.

Banteay Srei seeks to provide the resources that support women's healthy development through self- empowerment and self-determination. Banteay Srei believes in providing young women at risk of or currently impacted by sexual exploitation with holistic services. Banteay Srei's youth development/after-school programs provide young Southeast Asian and Asian American women with the safe spaces that promote sex-positive education, community-building activities, leadership development, and peer and intergenerational support. The culturally relevant programs foster cultural pride, a stronger support system, and self-determination. Banteay Srei also serves as a gateway to health. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY With the support of Measure A funds, Banteay Srei has achieved the following during FY 13/14: Conducted 39 weekly peer health educational workshops for 28 Southeast Asian young women to promote leadership development, establish peer support networks, and enhance family support. Led three community workshops to engage the larger community/ neighborhood in developing positive alternatives for young women and young people at risk. Provided 43 leadership trainings for five Southeast Asian youth leaders. The youth leaders conducted the 39 peer health workshops mentioned above. Delivered 10 presentations/trainings on topics of CSEC health screening, awareness of CSEC patterns or recruitment, and recommendations of supporting at-risk or sexually exploited young women. Banteay Srei has presented to over 400 local community members and both local and national service providers and health advocates.Allocation: $25,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $25,000 Individuals served by Measure A: 33 (Total individuals served: 33) Populations served: Low Income Children, Seniors Services provided: Public Health, Mental Health Service area: OaklandAsian Health Services (Bantreay Srei) www.asianhealthservices.or g Measure A Helps A committed participant of Banteay Srei became sexually exploited after meeting a man she first encountered on social media. She was able to get herself out of the situation and back home safely. She declined mental health services from a therapist and instead sought out Banteay Srei for peer and intergenerational group support, where she felt safe and gained knowledge of women's health and empowerment. Through Banteay Srei, the young woman accessed Asian Health Services Youth Program's Teen Clinic for reproductive health. With the support of Banteay Srei, the woman graduated high school and started community college. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 23 Supported 15 young Southeast Asian women to access academic support, housing, mental/medical health, and career development services. These efforts helped lead to the following outcomes: All 33 young women served by the program reported that: - They have built their self-confidence, learned more about caring for their bodies, are proud of their culture, and believe they can make a difference. - Banteay Srei has provided them with tools to make healthy decisions, build healthy relationships, and speak up more about issues that impact them. - They are aware of where to go to access medical and mental health services. In addition, all 33 signed up for FPACT/Minor Consent. 13 young women accessed services with Asian Health Services' Teen Clinic and/or with mental health services partners. Four were re-enrolled in school or a GED program. Four have graduated high school and are college tracked. Six young women found jobs.Highlights All Banteay Srei participants reported improvement in a wide variety of areas related to self-esteem and self- confidence . Banteay Srei used Measure A funds to support their annual Claws for a Cause Fundraiser, which raised $3,600 . 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 24BACKGROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who are developing or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. Community-based organizations (CBOs) provide mental health and substance use disorder services under contract with BHCS to meet the diverse cultural and language needs of County resident populations. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY The BHCS-contracted CBOs used Measure A funds to provide a broad array of mental health and substance use disorder services, ranging from outreach to intensive programs, in multiple geographic areas across the county. Measure A funds have helped mitigate budget cuts and the lack of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), which would have resulted in program cuts. Measure A funds have also helped offset the impact of reductions in funding, thereby contributing to system stability. The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in alcohol and other drug (AOD) programs, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other non-service-related operational expenses. These additional funds contributed to significant client-level outcomes, such as service continuity, outreach effectiveness, and client engagement in treatment objectives that would be put at risk by cutbacks in provider service capacity.

CERI works to improve the social, economic, and psychological health of refugees and their families affected by war, torture, or other forms of extreme trauma. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY With its Measure A funding, CERI offered four to six groups per week to youth of various ages. The groups provided social and emotional support and introduced the youth to a variety of activities to enhance self- esteem and improve family and social relationships. CERI also provided tutoring, case management, nonviolent communication mentoring, and sponsorship of fun activities in the community. Specifically, CERI used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Community-wide events with outreach to at least 50 individuals (target: 8 events; actual: 10 monthly potlucks plus a community event with over 100 attending) Support groups, including life skills classes, art, and other nontraditional mental health prevention activities (target: 4 ongoing groups serving 5-12 children and youth at each group; actual: 3 ongoing groups serving 5-10 participants at each group, plus 3 short- term groups) Consultation and/or training for community-based organizations (CBOs) (target: 2 trainings; actual 2 trainings) Early intervention for individuals and families including short-term, low-intensity interventions (target: 40 hours to at least 4 individuals; actual: no youth enrolled in the early intervention program; 8 individuals did receive 50 hours of one-on-one interventions)Allocation: $76,500 | Expended/Encumbered: $76,500 Individuals served by Measure A: 24 (Total individuals served: 48) Populations served: Low Income, Uninsured Children, Families Service provided: Mental Health Service area: Oakland, Union CityCenter for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants cerieastbay.org Measure A Helps A homeless young woman who was involved in a violent domestic relationship was shot last year.

The Center focuses its programs on five specific result areas: Children are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy. Children succeed academically. Environments are safe, supportive, and stable. Families are supported and supportive. Systems are integrated and care is coordinated and equitable. Co-coordinated by CHSC and the Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) Agency, the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative strives to strengthen and expand school-based behavioral health practice, finance, evaluation, and policy in Alameda County. In partnership with school districts and service providers, the Initiative works to deliver a continuum of school-based behavioral health supports to students in schools throughout Alameda County. CHSC and BHCS used their Measure A allocation to enhance two core programs of the Alameda County School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative: the Our Kids Our Families Program, and the School District Consultation program. The Our Kids Our Families program, provided at 29 school sites in the Hayward and Oakland Unified School Districts, is a school-based behavioral health program that fosters social-emotional wellness in an educational environment so that children and families feel connected, safe, and supported in school. The Our Kids Our Families program supports prevention efforts at the school sites, as well as early intervention and treatment services for any student and their family that needs it.

The student planned to join the military, which would require him to return to and graduate from his comprehensive high school. The student and consultant discussed the behavior he would need to show to return to the school. Together they determined what triggered his anger and set up a plan for either avoiding these triggers or addressing his anger if he is triggered. The student was able to use the plan effectively and return to the comprehensive high school. He is expecting to graduate and then begin his military career. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 27 The School District Consultation program places behavioral health consultants (BHCs) in school districts to provide and enhance preventive social-emotional supports and mental health services for students and their families. The BHCs conducted the following activities: - Assessed the social-emotional service needs and infrastructure of a school district or set of schools and developed a service plan - Coordinated the work of all partner agencies who deliver behavioral health services in schools and districts - Provided and/or coordinated clinical case management, group, and individual counseling to students - Provided workshops, parenting groups, and mental health and other appropriate consultation to parents/caregivers; linked parents/ caregivers with needed resources in the school and community; supported school and school district efforts to engage and support families in meaningful and positive ways - Provided crisis assessment and intervention for students, supported schools in effective crisis response, and supported school districts in developing crisis response protocols - Provided clinical supervision to interns and/or actively participated in intern recruitment and placement - Conducted planning to develop service referral and coordination systems - Provided behavioral health consultation to district/school staff to strengthen connections between students and adults - Conducted psycho-education for administrators, teachers, school staff, parents, students, and community partners - Participated in district- or school-wide efforts to create a positive climate, prevent conflicts and violence, and enhance the community setting for all members - Developed or coordinated leadership and other opportunities for children/youth that allow them to participate meaningfully in their school - Expanded partnerships with County, city, and/or community-based organizations to fill service gaps - Worked to become more integrated into the school district's operational systemsHighlights Parent surveys reported a high level of satisfaction. Parents saw improvements in their children's ability to handle school and daily life, resolve problems, and interact positively with peers and adults . Parents also reported having a support network to assist them in dealing with their child's behavioral problems. The majority of parents reported that the parent/family engagement events were useful and informative, addressed their needs, and increased their knowledge and parenting skills. Middle school students who had received behavioral health services reported that those services were extremely helpful in improving their ability to handle daily life, get along better with friends and family members, and succeed in school . A district-specific assessment of the six CFE domains found that Hayward students demonstrated significant improvement in each of the six domains of the CFE when comparing intake to discharge, while Oakland students demonstrated significant improvement in five of the six domains. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 28MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY The School-Based Behavioral Health Initiative used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following objectives through the District Behavioral Health Consultation program.

Measure A funding helped San Leandro Hospital achieve a projected $6.3 million in additional net revenue due to increased patient volume. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 50BACKGROUND St. Rose Hospital (SRH) is a safety-net, independent hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low income, underinsured populations in Central and Southern Alameda County. These services include the following: Critical access. SRH serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, SRH serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low income residents that do not have adequate transportation to the Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists programs. The Hospitalists assume care of indigent and uninsured patients who are admitted to SRH. This alleviates the financial impact of the private physicians who request compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. SRH operates the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN services in the community, because many OB practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room (ER), often with no history of prenatal care. Cardiac care. SRH is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility to provide elective cardiac and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) services in central Alameda County. There has been a 3% increase in procedures for Medi-Cal beneficiaries in fiscal year 2014 over 2013. SRH routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY SRH used its Measure A allocation to help achieve the following objectives: Provide emergency care for uninsured patients. The SRH ER experienced 35,163 visits in FY 13/14, including 73%, or 25,549 visits, from uninsured and underinsured patients. Provide financial support to hospital-based physician groups to take Allocation: $2,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $2,000,000 40,805 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: CountywideSt. Rose Hospital strosehospital.org Measure A Helps A 42-year-old female with abdominal pain sought treatment at the SRH ER. A CT scan revealed acute appendicitis. The patient underwent a successful emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. This patient was uninsured. After receiving her bill from the hospital, she was devastated, worried that she and her husband might lose their home. She asked the hospital if there was a program that could help them with the bill. SRH made the decision to waive the hospital bill due to the family's circumstances. Measure A made it possible for the hospital to help with the family's bill and their financial hardship. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 51ER calls and provide services to uninsured patients. SRH inpatient volumes, including nursery service utilization, included 45.5% Medi- Cal patients and 6.2% uninsured patients. Provide referral services for follow-up/after care for uninsured patients. Assist in supporting SRH inpatient services to uninsured and underinsured patients. Hospital-based physicians provided over 12,093 patient encounters for uninsured patients for the year. Employ a financial counselor to assist in identifying uninsured patients who may qualify for other funding sources such as Medi-Cal or HealthPAC. In FY 13/14 the ER financial counselor assisted 1,809 uninsured patients, an increase of 7.2% over the preceding year. Matching Funds SRH leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $1,000,000 in matching funds from the intergovernmental transfer program through the private hospital supplemental payment program. This represents a $1 match for every $2 in Measure A funds.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$2,000,000 $1,000,000 2013-2014 A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 52BACKGROUND UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland (CHO) works to protect and advance the health and well-being of children through clinical care, teaching, and research. At CHO, Measure A funding supported three programs/activities: The pediatric Emergency Department (ED), specifically to provide adequate staffing for the large volume of children seen at the ED The Center for Child Protection (CCP) School-based clinics Emergency Department CHO provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHO's ED sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHO for emergency services since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. In the 2013-2014 year, to CHO's ED was the highest volume ED in the San Francisco Bay Area. CHO's ED is one of two designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Centers in Northern California and the only one in the Bay Area. Children's Trauma Center has 24-hour in-house staff including pediatric specialists in emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anesthesiology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, diagnostic imaging, and critical care. For many children, the ED also functions as the gateway to a regular medical home, specialty care, or other community programs sponsored by CHO or other organizations. Approximately 70% of patients seen in the CHO ED receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in Allocation: $3,000,000 | Expended/Encumbered: 39,592 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Children Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health Service area: CountywideUCSF Benioff Children' s Hospital Oakland childrenshospitaloakland.org Measure A Helps Nadia, 9, was brought to the CHO ED from her school, where she had been attacked by a mentally ill person wielding a claw hammer. Medical and CCP staff completed a forensic evaluation and psychosocial crisis assessment, as well as a medical evaluation and treatment. The CCP clinical social worker provided crisis support to parents. When Nadia was discharged from the hospital, CCP arranged for outpatient psychotherapy and followed up with her in the outpatient clinic. When Nadia was returning to school, CCP staff conducted advocacy for an interdistrict transfer, and Nadia's mother was able to transition both Nadia and three younger children to a new school. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 53California. Without the CHO ED, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHO ED. Center for Child Protection CHO and Alameda County recognize that they share a responsibility to provide immediate and comprehensive care for this population of children, yet there are many challenges to maintaining this responsibility. CCP serves more than 1,000 clients per year. CCP is a comprehensive child abuse program within CHO. CCP is the only provider in Alameda County that has the capacity to offer many of its services. Because many CCP services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important because if CCP needed to charge insurance for these services, there would be a record of services provided, and many families would not step forward to divulge such sensitive information. CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute forensic examinations for children under 14 years old when the alleged sexual abuse occurred within 72 hours. Non-acute forensic examinations for children under age 18 and second opinion medical consults are performed in the CCP outpatient clinic through appointment only. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the ED and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Comprehensive evidenced-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families who have been exposed to childhood trauma, including child abuse and/ or witness to violence. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP . School-Based Clinics CHO runs two school-based health centers: one at Castlemont High School and one at McClymonds High School. The school health centers provide a safe and convenient place for students to receive integrated, comprehensive medical and mental health services. The Youth Uprising/ Castlemont Health Clinic sees students from Castlemont High School as well as members of the community ages 11-24. The Chappell Hayes Health Clinic sees students from McClymonds High School as well as members of the community ages 11-21. The Castlemont site is now the highest-volume school-connected mental health site in Alameda County. The sites' School-Based Mental Health Program has become a national model for the integration of medical and mental health care, and it has been cited for success at addressing underlying social stressors related to mental health. The program has Matching Funds CHO leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain $1,000,000 in matching funds through an Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) using supplemental funds from the California Department of Health Care Services.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$3,000,000 $1,000,000 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 54developed a training and consultation program for school professionals and mental health providers who work with schools, and it has contracts to conduct trainings throughout Alameda County and California. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY CHO used its Measure A allocation to achieve the following: Emergency Department In FY 13/14, there were a total of 44,508 unique patients to the ED. 665 of these visits were trauma cases where the child faced an immediate life-threatening situation. The total average time children spend at the ED has shrunk to 3.1 hours. This figure compares with 4.1 hours for CHO's peer group according to studies conducted by McKesson. Measure A funding has also helped the ED to upgrade its space to be more kid-friendly and to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, such as new monitors and imaging equipment. The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication has gone from 90 minutes to 30 minutes, which is among the top in the nation. Over 400 children seen in the ED were referred to and seen at CHO's asthma clinic for follow-up care and asthma education. Center for Child Protection In FY 13/14, the CCP served more than 1,000 children. The CCP conducted 104 forensic evidentiary examinations, 55 outpatient medical consultations, and 57 inpatient medical consultations, and provided clinical and psychotherapy services to 556 children. School-Based Clinics In FY 13/14, the two clinics run by CHO had a total of 2,458 encounters and saw 823 children/adolescents. CONCERNS The Committee notes that CHO does not list measurable objectives, which has been raised in the last several years. ED encounters can vary due to the severity of flu seasons and other unexpected health trends. Therefore, it is understandable that total ED encounters may change from year to year. However, measurable objectives should still be set and performance measured. This also applies to the CCP and school clinics. Also, two-thirds of the hospital's $2.5 million allocation helps offset undercompensated costs of ED visits from patients with Medi-Cal. However, the hospital administration states that it is \"not reasonable nor possible to tie the Measure A funding to a specific number of patient encounters. \" The Committee asserts that this can and should be done to ensure accountability for use of public tax dollars.The average time for providing sickle cell patients with proper pain medication has gone from 90 minutes to 30 minutes , which is among the top in the nation. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 55FUNDS ALLOCATED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS GROUP 3: PRIMARY CARE Alameda County Dental Health ................................................................................................................... 57 Center for Elder's Independence ................................................................................................................ 59 Center for Healthy Schools and Communities (School Health Centers) ...................................................... 60 Fire Station Health Portals ........................................................................................................................... 62 Fremont Aging and Family Services ............................................................................................................. 63 Health Enrollment for Children ................................................................................................................... 66 Health Insurance Eligibility and Enrollment ................................................................................................ 67 Health Services for Day Laborers: Community Initiatives (Day Labor Center) ............................................. 68 Health Services for Day Laborers: Multicultural Institute ............................................................................ 70 Health Services for Day Laborers: Street Level Health Project .................................................................... 72 Increase Hospice Utilization ........................................................................................................................ 74 Indigent Health Stabilization ....................................................................................................................... 76 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Direct Service Planning and Administration ............................. 80 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Mind Body Awareness .............................................................. 82 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Niroga Institute ......................................................................... 84 Medical Costs for Juvenile Justice Center: Victims of Crime ....................................................................... 85 Preventive Care Pathways ........................................................................................................................... 86 Primary Care Community-Based Organizations ........................................................................................... 87 Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, Inc. ........................................................................................................... 89 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 56BACKGROUND The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process that respects the diversity of the community and works to provide for present and future generations. A program of the Public Health Department, the WIC Oral Health Collaborative program provides an accessible early entry point for oral health assessment and preventive dental services for high risk families and children ages 0-5 years at WIC, as well as continuity and referral for regular follow-up dental care in the community. The services provided at WIC include dental history interviews to identify risk factors and oral home care practices, brushing the child's teeth and applying fluoride, assessing the child's mouth, and setting goals for home care behaviors. For children who need follow-up care beyond the services provided at the WIC site, the outreach/case manager collaborates with the family to assess insurance coverage, obtain a dental appointment with a provider, and assist with making the initial dental appointment. For families lacking insurance coverage, the case manager arranges insurance assistance through the Healthy Smiles Dental Treatment program. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funding helped the WIC Oral Health Collaborative program achieve the following measurable results: Enroll at least 400 infants and toddlers into the Healthy Kids Healthy Teeth (HKHT) program of preventive dental services and access to early dental care Provide 914 children with oral assessments and fluoride varnish applications Provide 1,371 parents and caregivers dietary and dental health education, anticipatory guidance, and assistance in accessing dental careAllocation: $151,213 | Expended/Encumbered: $151,213 Individuals 4,833 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Outpatient, Public Health Service area: Alameda, Castro Valley, Fremont, Hayward, Newark, Oakland, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union CityAlameda County Dental Health www.acphd.org/dental-administration.aspx Matching Funds The WIC Oral Health Program leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain an addition $205,594 in matching federal funds from the Maternal, Paternal, Child & Adolescent Health Program (MCPAH) and Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP).Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$151,213$205,594 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 57 Ensure that 78% of children/families receive care through Medi-Cal Increase the parent/caregiver's oral health knowledge and preventive oral health behaviors through the provision of at least six English and Spanish dental health education sessions per month Ensure that a minimum of 150 families and children be assisted in getting access to dental providers who are willing and able to provide early care and become a dental home Ensure that at least 75% of children enrolled in HKHT visit a dentist at least once during the year to begin accessing supplemental fluoride varnish and additional oral health family education services Expand operation of WIC \"Dental Days\" to a fourth site (Fremont) in addition to Hayward, Eastmont, and TelegraphHighlights An analysis of health outcomes for children participating in the WIC \"Dental Days\" shows that they have 42% fewer restorative dental treatment needs compared to children who did not benefit from the program. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 58BACKGROUND The Center for Elders' Independence (CEI) provides high quality, affordable, integrated health care services to the elderly, which promote autonomy, quality of life, and the ability of individuals to live in their communities. CEI also supports and educates family caregivers of frail senior participants so they can help keep seniors healthy and safe. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY CEI used its Measure A allocation to increase access to medical services for seniors by efficiently assessing and enrolling seniors into the PACE plan. PACE is considered the gold standard of care for frail older adults with multiple, chronic, and complex health care needs\u2014a truly integrated, comprehensive, coordinated, interdisciplinary team-based approach. Specifically, CEI hired and trained an assessment nurse (RN) who worked with Alameda Alliance to develop a risk assessment tool and referral process. This effort resulted in the following: The RN assessed 123 seniors. 13 non-PACE eligible referrals were made. 70 applications were submitted to the CA Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). 66 applicants were certified eligible by DHCS and enrolled in PACE. CEI completed care plans for all new enrollees within 60 days of enrollment. With this funding, CEI has also been able to streamline assessment procedures to be more efficient going forward, and be better prepared for increased referrals when the CCI/Cal MediConnect launches.Allocation: $51,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $51,000 Individuals served 123 (Total individuals served: 699) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income Adults, Seniors Services provided: Public Health Service area: Alameda, Albany, Ashland, Berkeley, Castro Valley, Cherryland, Emeryville, Hayward, Oakland, San Leandro, San LorenzoCenter for Elder' s Independence cei.elders.org Measure A Helps Mr. G. began to develop multiple health problems that forced him to retire and seek medical help. CEI assessed and enrolled Mr. G., who feels he has found the ideal health care situation for his medical needs, with a team of professionals and aides who work together to help him with every other aspect of his life. And he's met a community of friends with whom he can socialize and share his memories at the PACE center. In addition, Measure A-funded presentations like the one Mr. G. attended let seniors, caregivers, and other community service providers/physicians know about PACE and lead to many CEI enrollments. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 59BACKGROUND The Center for Healthy Schools and Communities works to foster the academic success, health, and well-being of Alameda County youth by building universal access to high quality supports and opportunities in schools and neighborhoods. A key component of the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities, the school health centers (SHCs) play a vital role in creating universal access to health services by providing a continuum of age-appropriate and integrated health and wellness services for youth in a safe, youth-friendly environment at or near schools. The SHCs provide services in the following areas: Comprehensive school health services in a safe, accessible environment on or near the school campus during convenient hours Referrals to necessary health and wellness services First aid, medical, and health education services Behavioral health services Dental health services Nonclinical services such as youth development and school climate services SHC services are accessible. SHCs are open during school hours and often after school as well. SHC services are available at no cost to clients, regardless of their insurance status, thus filling a gap for students who are uninsured or underinsured. Of those clients with data recorded, 28% did not have a primary care medical home, and 33% did not have a regular dental provider. The SHCs offered a variety of outreach activities over the school year, such as parent workshops, speakers, and other after-school events for the community.Allocation: $1,887,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $1,887,000 13,017 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Income, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abus Service area: CountywideCenter for Healthy Schools and Communities (School Health Centers) achealthyschools.org/school-health-centers.html Measure A Helps A 13-year-old patient was overweight and had high cholesterol, specifically high triglycerides. He was motivated through appointments with the SHC Nurse Practitioner and the RD at Preventative Medicine to make many lifestyle changes. These included increasing his exercise at school during recess, after school, and on weekends with his family. He stopped buying chips and saved that money for other things, drank more water, ate more slowly, and talked more to family during meals instead of automatically getting seconds. His cholesterol is now normal, with a significant decrease in the triglycerides from 200 to 75. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 60MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds supported 15 of the 25 SHCs. The SHCs achieved the following measurable outcomes in the target service areas: Alameda County SHCs continue to expand, now providing programs at one elementary school, seven middle schools, 14 high schools, and one community college. SHCs have improved academic outcomes. Without an SHC onsite, many students might have been sent home, rather than having their health issues addressed onsite and being sent back to class. Clients return for multiple visits to the SHCs, demonstrating the value of integrated and youth-friendly services. Physical health services were provided during 43% of all SHC visits. Individual and group behavioral health services were provided during 28% of all visits to 2,655 clients. Sexual/reproductive health services were provided during 32% of all visits. According to clinic data, 46% of female clients reported that they \"always\" used contraception at baseline, compared to 55% at follow-up. At the six SHC sites providing dental services in FY 13/14, 21% of all visits (766 clients) had a dental service provided. These services included screening exams and cleanings, case management, and restorative treatment. Measure A funds also allowed the SHCs to offer nonbillable services such as youth development. SHC provided leadership development and mentoring through peer health education programs and youth advisory boards, as well as a variety of programming including sports, tutoring, dance, arts, media, and gardening during lunch or after school. This year, Measure A funds were also used to support a specific equity- focused SHC project: the Latino Men and Boys (LMB) program. This program provides youth development for males of color in five Oakland schools with SHCs. The program collaborates with school administrators, counselors, and the SHC to identify Latino youth that are at risk of dropping out and provides them with intensive mentoring, academic tutoring, and health-related supplemental programs that improve educational outcomes and physical and emotional wellness. In 2014, LMB program participants had over 250 visits at SHCs. Matching Funds The SHCs leveraged their Measure A allocation to obtain $9,917,459 in matching funds from local, state, federal, and private sources.Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$1,887,000$9,917,459 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 61BACKGROUND Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) works to provide fully integrated health care services through a comprehensive network of public and private partnerships that ensure optimal health and well-being and respect the diversity of all residents. The objective of the Firehouse Clinic is to provide a new access point for comprehensive primary and preventative care to communities in critical need of health care services. In addition, the Firehouse Clinic will provide insurance enrollment assistance, connection to a medical home, and emergency department and hospital discharge follow-up. The clinic model in South Hayward, the first site, will reduce wait times for patients seen at community clinics by guaranteeing primary care appointments within 72 hours and providing extended hours. During the first two years of operation, over 5,000 new patients are projected to be seen at the Hayward site, the majority of whom will consist of low income, uninsured, and indigent residents. The intention is to provide services to populations that historically may have been excluded from mainstream health care. The Firehouse Clinic will accept public insurance, such as Medi-Cal, Medi-Care, and County-sponsored insurance coverage; some forms of private insurance; or a flat-fee payment for particular services. Ability to pay is not a factor in receipt of care. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Rollout of the first clinic site in Hayward is anticipated in spring 2015. Thus, no clients have been served at the clinic at this time. Measure A funding for this initiative has been approved by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors for rollover until buildout of the Firehouse Clinic is complete and clinical operations can begin. During FY 14/15 and FY 15/16, Measure A funding will be expended towards this effort: $1.2 million in capital funding to the City of Hayward for construction of the building and $970,000 for the provision of clinical services.

The AFS Health Promoter Program improves both the physical and mental health of older adults by increasing access to health services, supporting healthy behavior changes, monitoring medications, and providing health education classes. The program offers these services at home and at community congregate sites to older adults in Southern Alameda County, with a focus on low income, Afghan refugee women over the age of 50 years. Within the Health Promoter Program, Afghan Health Promoters develop relationships with Afghan seniors, provide emotional support, offer health education, and coordinate referrals for health and social services. The Health Promoter Program is made up of four program areas: Happy, Healthy Me (HHM). HHM is a chronic condition self- management program that helps elders identify healthy goals through problem-solving and goal-setting. The program assesses 12 areas related to successful self-management behavior and utilizes problem- solving techniques, motivational interviewing, and goal-setting techniques to help the elder establish obtainable goals.

In 2013, the Health Insurance Enrollment Assistance department began a partnership with the Oakland Unified School District. The goal was to offer health insurance assistance in a familiar setting to families served by the district, who otherwise would not follow through with applying for or renewing their county benefits. The school district gave the department space to come in weekly to support families. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Thanks in part to Measure A funding, the program provided benefit program application assistance to 2,167 Alameda County residents.Allocation: $300,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $300,000 Individuals individuals served: 2,167 ) Populations served: Indigent, Low Incomes, Uninsured Adults, Children, Families Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: CountywideHealth Enrollment for Children achealthcare.org/about/project-updates/childrens-health-insurance-enrollm Matching Funds The Health Insurance Enrollment Assistance department leveraged its Measure A allocation of obtain $150,000 in matching funds from Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA).Measure A AllocationMatching Funds$300,000 $150,000 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 66BACKGROUND The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) works to provide fully integrated health care services through a comprehensive network of public and private partnerships that ensures optimal health and well-being and respects the diversity of all residents. A specific program of HCSA focused on maximizing client access to health services funded by Medi-Cal, through the elimination of system errors created during the Healthy Families Transition and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The MEDS error elimination services increase access to care for low income Medi-Cal clients. When the MEDS system blocks a MEDS case, clients seeking nonemergency care are often denied access to care or service providers are not reimbursed for the care they provide. Staff corrected errors that were generated by the MEDS system and updated information that to ensure correct benefits were applied to the case. These efforts give clients access to affordable, high quality health care provided in the County. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY In 2013, a total of 277,510 clients received Medi-Cal Benefits in Alameda County. Data discrepancies cause eligible clients to have an inactive status appear on their record, causing interruptions of care. Measure A funding allowed a team of eligibility workers to dedicate themselves to resolving these types of data/system conflicts, resulting in Medi-Cal records that are active and ensuring continued access to medical care. In FY 12/13, a total of 20,368 discrepant records were corrected by this team.Allocation: $200,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $200,000 Individuals individuals served: 277,510 ) Populations served: Low Income Adults, Children, Families, Seniors Services provided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Public Health, Mental Health, Substance Abuse Service area: CountywideHealth Insurance Eligibility and Enrollment Measure A Helps The Ramos-Dominguez family household includes five members with distinct statuses and eligibility. Mrs. Ramos is from El Salvador and has legal presence in the United States as a T-VISA holder. Mrs. Ramos has two children from a previous marriage, who are undocumented. Mrs. Ramos is now married to Mr. Dominguez, who is also from El Salvador and also undocumented. Together they have a child born in the United States. With the help a Health Insurance Technician, the family was able to map out everyone's eligibility. On the end, everyone was covered, through a combination of Covered California, Kaiser Child Health Program, the County's HealthPAC program, and Medi-Cal. Measure A Helps Individuals discontinued from SSI/ SSP due to the annual COLA are placed in Craig v. Bonta aid codes 1E aged, 2E blind, and 6E disabled. These individuals remain as \"Exception Eligibles\" until an SSA eligibility worker completes an eligibility determination. One example: Ms. Smith, a 33-year-old Berkeley resident, suffers from multiple health issues including lupus. She has frequent medical appointments and pharmaceutical needs. Ms. Smith contacted the MEDS EE team in desperate need of assistance. Her eligibility status showed as inactive, and she was unsuccessful in getting assistance from Social Security. The team member resolved the issue, and Ms. Smith was granted access to her doctor and medications. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 67BACKGROUND The Health Service for Day Laborers Community Initiatives/Day Labor Center (DLC) program works to enable low income, unemployed, and underemployed individuals, including at-risk youth, re-entry clients, and migrant workers, reach self-sufficiency through employment and community integration programs.

The Street Level community center is an entry point to the health care and social service system for those most often overlooked and neglected, namely the uninsured, underinsured, and recently arrived. Street Level develops trusting relationships with isolated immigrants, offers them a place to build a healthy and vibrant community, and empowers them to advocate for the well-being of themselves and their families. Street Level Health Project provides a safe space for people from 33 different countries that speak 34 different languages to receive vital services, information, and referrals. On an average program day participants see a doctor, access mental health services, get vaccinated, receive free medication, eat a hot meal, receive a bag of free healthy food, and enroll in health care coverage, all within the same day and space. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds allowed Street Level to develop and implement a new patient screening questionnaire, which involved research and planning, testing out the questionnaire, gathering feedback from community members and health workers, making revisions, and training volunteers. The questionnaire has allowed Street Level to both improve the quality of clinical care and make significantly more tailored referrals to mental health services, recovery resources, gynecology/reproductive services, STI testing, and health care coverage.

The Alameda Health Consortium is guided by the following principles: All people have the right to accessible and affordable high quality health care that prevents illness, promotes wellness, and is sensitive to the unique needs of particular communities and cultures. The barriers that prevent people from seeking care must be eliminated. Individuals and families must be empowered to participate in their own health care. Low income and underserved people play an important role in the formation of health policy at the local, state, and national level. Building consensus and coalitions around important health issues leads to innovative solutions. Providing quality health care improves the well-being of our communities. Racial and ethnic health disparities must be eliminated in order to have healthy communities. The Consortium's outpatient services are provided at community health center locations throughout Alameda County and are not hospital-based. Over 20 different languages are spoken across the health centers.

School of Imagination serves over 300 children each week. Its program has contributed to improving the lives of the children it serves by providing children with autism and developmental delays and disabilities with the most effective, research-based therapeutic techniques. Children on the autism spectrum often have skills that develop unevenly due to the lack of development in some of the areas of their brain. Using the cutting-edge Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)\u2014a highly effective treatment methodology for children with autism\u2014clinicians and educators can clearly define the level of development in a functional way is extremely helpful in planning treatment that is most effective. Treatment can occur within the classroom, in the therapy room, or at home, which allows for much greater progress in a shorter period of time due to the consistency and clarity of treatment protocols. The ESDM also has a strong parent training component. This methodology allows School of Imagination the opportunity to provide a multidisciplinary approach (educators and clinicians) that is consistent across disciplines and in the home. Children are making progress across all areas of development (cognitive, language, motor skills, and self-care) due to the implementation of this therapy protocol and methodology, which improves their prognosis for catching up to their same-age peers by the time that they are in kindergarten and no longer needing special education services, which cost school districts millions of dollars each year. Allocation: $50,000 | Expended/Encumbered: $50,000 Individuals served by Measure A: 253 (Total individuals served: 325) Populations served: Low Income, Uninsured Children Services provided: Public Health Service area: Alameda, Castro Valley, Fremont, Livermore, PleasantonSchool of Imagination schoolofimagination.org Measure A Helps Letter from the parents of IDP toddler Brandon: When we came to speech therapy, Brandon was demonstrating significant receptive and expressive language delay, testing in the lower 10th percentile. Brandon has been universally described as exceptionally strong willed (aka stubborn), and we thought it was unlikely that he would take to a speech therapy class. Ms. Leslie took the time to learn Brandon's likes and dislikes and catered to his pace and personality. In the past six months, Brandon's speech and behavior have improved exponentially, with another breakthrough session just this past week. Ms. Leslie's tremendous dedication, patience, and love towards Brandon has deeply impacted his life and our family. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 120MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY Measure A funds provided training to School of Imagination's clinical and educational team on the ESDM treatment methodology for children with autism. The teachers and clinicians who received this training implemented protocols in the classrooms and therapy sessions, specifically in the Infant Development Program (IDP) and individual therapy sessions. Both the therapy and infant development programs are provided to children ages 2-3 years old with developmental delays and autism. The earlier that these children receive help, the greater their chance is to develop age-appropriate skills. This training immediately impacted over 250 children who attend School of Imagination's program by providing them with the most effective treatment methodologies. This training allowed the treatment team to impact the families in the community by continuing to disseminate the ESDM to all children and families that need help. Parent training has also commenced, which allows families to work directly with providers using the ESDM model. The consistency between parents and providers is greatly enhanced and has yielded even greater improvements in the development of the children. All of School of Imagination's 29 teachers and 13 therapists completed the training and passed the assessment measures established by the UC Davis MIND Institute.Highlights The results of the ESDM training have been fantastic. Children are making faster progress and parents know what to do to best help their child due to the new training methodology. 2013-2014 MEASURE A CITIZEN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT 121BACKGROUND The Alameda County Public Health Department works in partnership with the community to ensure the optimal health and well-being of all people through a dynamic and responsive process that respects the diversity of the community and provides for present and future generations.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY The Teleosis Institute used its Measure A funding to develop new take- back sites, to coordinate the effort throughout the County, and to support the development of the Safe Medication Disposal Ordinance. Measure A funding helped the program achieve the following: Increase access to public health and/or substance abuse services to seniors, adults, families, at-risk youths, and/or other residents by assessing existing program results.
