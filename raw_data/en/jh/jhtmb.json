If we refer back to them, we can find juice cures for almost all health issues. Wondering how they work? Let's have a look. The treatment of diseases through an exclusive diet of fruits and vegetables is known as raw juice therapy. It is also called juice fasting or [juice cure](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/juice-cure) . During the therapy, the eliminative and cleansing capacity of organs (lungs, kidneys, liver and skin) increases. As a result of this, all the accumulated metabolic waste and toxins are eliminated from the body. [Raw juice therapy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/raw-juice-therapy) is considered by many as the most effective way to rejuvenate and detoxify the body and restore health. The raw [juice therapy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/juice-therapy) allows your digestive system to rest because digesting raw juice doesn't put much pressure on the digestive system. This translates into a better and quicker absorption of nutrients by the body. The process is very simple because all you need to do is blend different fruits and vegetables and consume them to manage the symptoms of an ailment. To get the maximum benefit from fruits and vegetables, use a '900 watt' slow electric juicer to blend them. Make sure you consume the juice immediately to ensure no loss of nutrients because fruits and vegetables may become stale after you peel their outer skin and lose some of their nutritive value. Juice therapy can be used as the only diet if you want better and quicker results. But in that case, you need to take juice every three hours to maintain your health. If you do not find this comfortable, the therapy can be carried along with your normal diet. You must have also noticed that when you get sick and consult a doctor, the doctor advises you to have fresh fruits, juice and vegetables. The reason behind this is the same as explained above. But if you take a juice that's not advised during the kind of sickness you have, your condition can get worse. Every juice is not good for every disease and problem. But overall, raw juices are beneficial and have rejuvenating and revitalising effect on all functions of the body.
