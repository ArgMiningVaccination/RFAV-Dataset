I was thinking, ''What would happen if I add 10 drops into the water bowl of my cat, Jerry.'' Everyday I put some into his water bowl and kept doing this until I realised my bottle was nearly empty. I had not yet ordered a new bottle. The next morning I gave Jerry fresh water and he took one sip and then backed away from the bowl. His facial expression told me, \"Where's the good water? I'm not going to drink this stuff!\" OK, this was about my cat but I guess it could be a dog as well. Q: Any other fun facts on Dr Patrick Flanagan?
