You will need to keep them on the phone until you complete the necessary information on the report. - - CSUMB Exposure Tracing consists of interviewing the positive case, documenting the campus locations where the case has been during their infectious period, and collecting the names of individuals who meet the definition of a close contact.CSUMB follows the California Department of Public Health's [isolation and close contact guidelines.](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Isolation-and-Quarantine-for-COVID-19-Contact-Tracing.aspx)CDPH defines close contact as someone sharing the same indoor airspace, e.g., home, clinic waiting room, airplane etc., for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example, three individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes) during an infected person's (laboratory-confirmed or a [clinical diagnosis](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/)) infectious period.Exposure locations are captured during the exposure tracing interview and are listed on the [Campus Locations Exposed to COVID-19](https://csumb.edu/health/coronavirus-information/covid-19-data/). Anyone at that location can take extra precautions and follow the close contact guidelines. Actions that initiate Exposure Tracing - If an individual is tested at an off campus testing site and their test result is positive, they are to submit the [COVID-19 Positive Reporting Form](https://csumb.tfaforms.net/30). - If an individual, regardless of presently being on or off campus, is exposed to someone who is COVID-19 positive, they are to submit their own [COVID-19 Positive Reporting Form](https://csumb.tfaforms.net/30). - If an individual is waiting for the results of a PCR from an off campus location, they are to submit the [COVID-19 Positive Reporting Form](https://csumb.tfaforms.net/30). - Anyone can submit the [COVID-19 Positive Reporting Form](https://csumb.tfaforms.net/30)for someone who is too ill to self-submit or have disclosed to you that they are positive and they have not already submitted a report. Either inform the student or employee to submit a COVID-19 Reporting form or tell them you will do it for them. You will need to keep them on the phone until you complete the necessary information on the report. When a COVID-19 Positive Reporting form is submitted, an Exposure Tracing Analyst, and Human Resources or Corporation Human Resources will contact the positive student and/or employee. The Exposure Tracing Analyst will also contact the confirmed on campus close contacts.
