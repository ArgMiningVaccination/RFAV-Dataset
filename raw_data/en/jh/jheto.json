Over the course of eight weeks, participants learn the rudiments of practicing mindfulness, or being aware of themselves and the world around them. They learn techniques such as focused breathing, meditation and yoga, and with that, begin to find they have more control over the stress that affects their health, whether it comes from work or illness. Mindfulness, says Jeff Brantley, who developed and leads the class, is a way of being more aware of thoughts, feelings and physical sensations. \"It's noticing these without absorbing into them, without latching onto them,\" he explains. \"It's a way to be present, to be fully aware in the moment.\" The use of mindfulness in reducing stress is not new, Brantley says. Duke's class is modeled on successful programs at other academic medical centers, including one started at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn's research has shown that patients can learn mind-body techniques to reduce their reaction to stress and by reducing stress, better cope with pain and other illness impacted by stress. The use of the mind in dealing with the body's ills is well-accepted in the general public, though perhaps in different terms; the phrase \"mind over matter\" conjures images of mind and body as opponents, with will power winning over the physical. Brantley teaches a method more akin to \"mind with matter\" or \"mind in matter.\" The structure of the class is simple. Twenty-some participants in the class meet once a week for a two-and-a-half-hour session at the Center for Living. They show up in comfortable clothes, some with pillows or pads to support backs or bodies as they position themselves in chairs or on the floor. Most sessions begin with participants sitting in chairs pulled into a circle at the front of the dimly lit auditorium. Brantley begins with housekeeping, handing out sheets that explain the theme for that week's class, the in-class practice to be experienced and the \"homework\" for the week. One Saturday during the eight-week course will be spent in silent mindfulness practice with the group. The first week, homework - to which each participant agreed to commit an hour daily - includes practicing mindful breathing in different situations, practicing a body scan each day and eating one meal mindfully. Intention and commitment reign as two of the keys to the class. Brantley advises participants not to expect a blissful experience - or any other type. Instead, he encourages a sense of curiosity. \"See what you discover, approaching the moment without judging yourself or what you experience,\" he says. On the night of the first class, Brantley passes a batch of raisins around the circle, instructing each person to take a couple. One woman wrinkles her nose and whispers to a friend beside her, \"Ugh. I hate raisins.\" The instruction comes. Brantley wants the class to imagine they've never seen one of these objects before, never tasted one. He wants the class to discover that raisin very slowly, feel its texture, taste it, explore it. And eat it as slowly as possible, noticing each sensation as it comes. \"I never knew I could concentrate so much on a raisin,\" one person comments afterward. \"I hadn't been conscious of its structure and I was surprised at some of the thoughts I had while doing this.\" It's an opening exercise that initiates participants to the richness of moments they frequently let pass. And it begins showing them how they can focus attention without becoming trapped in a piece of experience. As the class progresses, from breathing and stretching exercises to 20-minute sessions of silent meditation, participants practice becoming aware of the sensations in the body and how to \"let go\" of them. As they realize muscles are tensed and tight, they relax. They identify pain, and instead of fighting it, recognize its presence, and it lessens. They become aware of emotions, and instead of berating themselves, accept the emotions, and the stress eases. Heart patient Jim Lea signed up for the first class Brantley offered last fall. He says the course made a big difference in his life, both in dealing with pain and reducing stress. \"I've always been a pretty rampant Type A, which I'm sure has contributed to the reason why I've had seven grafts and 15 angioplasties,\" said the Burlington man. Nearly three years ago, he began having recurrent heart problems and suffered great anxiety associated with the problems. While he had dabbled with meditation as a way to deal with stress, he hadn't made much headway. \"I'd read a book, but never had success before mainly because I thought it was something you did instead of a matter of being aware of what was around you. Just finding out that meditating is not difficult, that it's as easy as breathing. I thought it was something you worked at.\" He says he's gotten an appreciation for the calming effect of mindfulness, an effect he can summon when irritation starts to bubble up in his daily life. He can dispel his anger at the clumsy gas station attendant or in traffic, overcome anxiety and pain that accompanies angina. For another man, his need for help living with crippling back pain brought him to the class. He had some difficulty in some exercises - sitting for long periods is difficult and being on the floor wasn't always comfortable. But from the first class, he embraced the program and was pleased with the results. \"I had been fighting the pain for so long, or trying to ignore it or mask it. Suddenly, just being aware without trying to do anything, to just recognize it and let it be, makes a huge difference. I'm not fighting my body, I'm accepting it. The pain's there, but it's not absorbing me completely.\" The class isn't just for patients. The program also attracts people coping with the daily stresses of work and family life. Brantley has been involved in a program with similar elements for hospice workers to study the effects of mindfulness on caregiving and self-care. He hopes to bring the benefits of mindfulness to Duke employees as well. Employees may not be experiencing their own physical illness, but the stress of working with patients and in high-pressure situations creates problems for the caregivers. Brantley tries to include as many employees in the course as possible, at a discount as the balance of paying participants allows. Duke participants have included doctors, Center for Living staff, members of pastoral care and others. Dr. Steve Bredehoeft, who directs the blood service, entered the course for both professional and personal reasons. He co-directs a course in medical practice and health systems for med students, and wanted to better understand the role of integrative medicine in clinical practice. He also wanted to benefit from learning about mindfulness and its use in [stress] reduction. \"I came away greatly impressed with the skills that were taught as a means of addressing any number of kinds of stress,\" said Bredehoeft, who continues to practice mindfulness regularly, nearly six months after taking the course. \"There were those whose stress was primarily from the workplace, under great job pressures and they found the skills to be directly applicable to coping with those job stressors. For others, they were experiencing some kind of chronic disabling pain or other disability, and the techniques, based on their descriptions, made these situations far more tolerable and gave them a greater sense of control over their lives.\" Gaining control may have been the most beneficial skill Karen Gray took from the class. A cardiologist's right arm in the office at the Center for Living, she's under daily pressure to help keep things running smoothly, as well as handle her personal life which includes a husband and teen-aged son, a mother-in-law with a life-threatening illness, and her own health problems. After taking the first mindfulness-based stress reduction course offered, she encouraged her spouse to sign up for the next one. They no longer practice together, she says, but they use the techniques they learned. \"We remind each other ... to breathe, to be mindful. Sometimes when going into a stressful situation, we discuss it mindfully beforehand. It has helped tremendously. Sometimes we just say, 'Let's just breathe and take this a minute at a time and deal with it.'\" [News "}
