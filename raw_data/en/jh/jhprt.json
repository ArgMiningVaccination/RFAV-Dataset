Acute bacterial sinusitis should be diagnosed in a child who has an acute upper respiratory tract infection with persistent illness (ie, nasal discharge or daytime cough or both) lasting more than 10 days; worsening cough, worsening or new nasaldischarge, or daytime cough or fever after initial improvement; or severe onset offever and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days. 2. The clinician should prescribe antibiotics for acute bacterial sinusitis in children with severe onset or worsening course. Children with persistent illness should be eitherprescribed antibiotic therapy or offered additional observation for 3 days. Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: 1. Understand the mechanisms that lead to bacterial sinusitis.2. Be able to distinguish the child who has bacterial sinusitis from the one who has only a viral upper respiratory infection or allergic congestion. 3. Be aware of the usefulness of nasal cultures, sinus, aspirate cultures, and ndings on imaging in diagnosing bacterial sinusitis. 4. Know the current treatment of bacterial sinusitis, taking into consideration changes in the characteristics of infecting organisms. The viral upper respiratory tract infect ion (URI) is the most common illness for which children present to the primary care p ediatrician. Approximately 5% to 10% of viral URIs are complicated by acute bacterial s inusitis. Sinusitis results in more than $5.8 billion in health care expenditures i n the United States annually, of which $1.8 billion is spent on children younger than 13 years. (1) The diagnosis and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis present unique challenges to the primary care physician inthe acute care setting. Anatomy and Pathogenesis The ethmoid and maxillary sinuses develop in the third month of gestation and, althoughsmall, are present at birth. The frontal sinuses develop from an anterior ethmoidal air celland are pneumatized by age 5 or 6 years. The sphenoid sinus starts to become aerated at age5 years and expands in size into the second or third decade of life. The out flow tract of the maxillary sinus is located at the most superior portion of the me- dial wall of the sinus (Fig 1). This unfortunate positioning makes gravitational drainage dif-cult. The clearance of secretions of the sinus is thus dependent on the mucociliary elevator of the mucosa. The maxillary sinus empties via the ostium into the middle meatus of the nasal cavity at a location known as the osteomeatal complex. Themaxillary sinus ostia are small, tubular structures with a diam-eter of only 2.5 mm and a length of 6 mm. The anterior eth-moid and frontal sinuses also empty into the osteomeatal complex in the middle meatus. The posterior ethmoid air cells and the sphenoid sinus drain into the superior meatus. A key concept in understanding the pathogenesis of acute bacterial sinusitis is that the mucosa of the nose upper respiratory tract infection *Associate Professor, Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.

Any process that affects the nasal mucosa alsomay affect the sinus mucosa. Unlike the nasal mucosa, which is heavily colonized with bacteria, the paranasal si- nuses normally are sterile. The pathogenesis of sinusitis involves 3 key factors: ob- struction of the sinus ostia, dysfunction of the ciliary appa-ratus, and thickening of sinus secretions. The narrowdiameter of the sinus ostia allows for easy obstruction.The factors that predispose the ostia to obstruction maybe divided into those that result in mucosal swelling and those that result in a direct mechanical effect (Table 1). Viral URI is the most common cause of ostial obstruc- tion in children and frequently precedes the development of sinusitis. Obstruction of the ostia results in a transientincrease in pressure in the sinus cavity. As oxygen is de-pleted, the pressure in the sinus becomes negative relativeto the atmosphere. This negative pressure allows for theintroduction of bacteria from the nose and nasopharynx into the sinus. When the ostia are obstructed, mucous pro- duction by the mucosa continues, resulting in the accumu-lation of fluid in the sinus cavity and the multiplication of bacteria and the initiation of an in flammatory reaction. In addition to ostial obstruction, dysfunction of the mucociliary apparatus also contributes to the developmentof sinusitis. During a viral URI, progressive loss of ciliatedcells may be observed in the respiratory mucosa. Lastly, the quality and character of sinus secretions play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute bac-terial sinusitis. Cilia can beat only in a liquid media, anddiseases such as cystic brosis result in very thick, viscous secretions that diminish ciliary clearance of fluid and de- bris from the sinus. Infection of the sinus results in thick-ening of secretions, compounding this process. The result of a viral URI is that all 3 of these factors are present: ostial obstruction, ciliary dysfunction, and thick-ening of sinus secretions. The viral URI is the most com-mon predisposing factor to the development of bacterialsinusitis in childhood and accounts for approximately80% of cases. Allergic in flammation underlies the remain- ing 20% of cases of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. Microbiology Sinus Aspiration Studies Knowledge of the microbiology of acute sinusitis hasbeen derived from studies of sinus aspiration. The dif - culty in obtaining any sample for culture is that the si-nuses are a closed space accessible only through a highlycontaminated mucous membrane. Maxillary sinus aspira-tion in children is a time-consuming procedure that shouldbe performed only by a skilled pediatric otolaryngologist. In this procedure, the nasal mucosa is anesthetized and dis- infected with a solution of 10% cocaine. A trocar is passed Figure 1. Coronal (A) and sagittal (B and C) sections of the nose and paranasal sinuses.infectious diseases acute bacterial sinusitis 430 Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on July 28, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from just below the inferior nasal turbinate across the lateral na- sal wall. Aspirated material is sent for Gram stain and quan- titative aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture. The recovery of bacteria in a density of 104Cfu/mL or more is considered signi cant growth. A Gram stain nding of at least one organism per high-power eld correlates with the isolation of bacteria from nasal secretions in a density of10 5Cfu/mL. Several sinus aspiration studies performed in the 1980s in children with 10 to 30 days of sinus symptoms have provided insight into the microbiology of acute bacterial sinusitis. (2,3) In most episodes of sinusitis. S pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated organism, accountingfor 40% of isolates, with Hi nfluenza andM catarrhalis each accounting for approximately 20% of cases. Lesscommonly isolated organisms include group A streptococ- spp. Anaerobic bacteria are not isolated commonly in patients with acute sinusitis. Because of the invasive nature of sinus aspiration, there has been interest in obtaining specimens for culturefrom a more accessible site that re flects the microbiology of the sinus. Nasopharyngeal swabs have been studiedbut unfortunately correlate poorly with sinus aspirate cul- tures. (2) Endoscopically obtained samples of secretions from the middle meatus near the osteomeatal complexalso have been studied. In children, these specimens havepoor correlation with sinus aspirates, likely because of thenarrow caliber of the nasal passages and the potential for contamination with nasal flora. (4) No sinus puncture studies have been performed since 1984 in children who have acute sinusitis, and yet the mi- crobiology of the nasopharyngeal flora of children has un- dergone important changes in the past decade. Becausethe pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM) and acutebacterial sinusitis is similar, it is possible to use data de-rived from studies of tympanocentesis performed in chil- dren who have AOM as a surrogate for sinusitis. The middle ear cavity is, in fact, a paranasal sinus. Since the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7), there has been a signi cant shift in the pathogens responsible for AOM. In a ruralKentucky clinic, Block et al performed tympanocentesisand culture of middle ear fluid on 381 children ages 7 to 24 months who had AOM in the period before and after the introduction of PCV-7. (5) The proportion of cases of AOM caused by S pneumoniae had decreased sig- nicantly from 56% to 41%, whereas that caused by H in- fluenzae had increased from 38% to 57%. The rate of isolation of M catarrhalis remained constant at approxi- mately 10%. Studies performed introduction ofthe 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine have sug-gested an even greater decrease in the proportion of AOM cases due to S pneumoniae . (6) In addition to the increase in the rate of isolation of H influenzae in children with AOM, there has been a shift in the susceptibility patterns of this organism. The mech- anism by which isolates of Hi nfluenzae are resistant to penicillins such as amoxicillin is by the production ofb-lactamases. Historically, approximately 20% to 30% of isolates of Hi nfluenzae causing sinusitis and AOM in children have produced b-lactamase. Recently, mid- dle ear and nasopharyngeal cultures taken from childrenin Rochester, New York, have demonstrated beta-lactamase rates as high as 50%. (7) This increase in therate of resistance has important implications for antibioticselection because empirical choices will need to includeab-lactamase stable drug. There has been recent controversy in the medical liter- ature over the role of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) in acute sinusitis. Some authorshave stated that this pathogen should be considered an im-portant cause of acute bacterial s inusitis. (8) However, these studies have serious methodologic flaws. (9) Most were performed by obtaining cultures from the middle meatusvia an endoscope. The middle meatus in healthy childrenis colonized with Sa u r e u s as frequently as 65% of the time. Those authors who performed direct sinus aspirate did notverify decontamination of the puncture site. The isolationTable 1.

It is notable also that in the original sinus aspirate studi es performed in children, Sa u r e u s was not isolated in any of the 50 children enrolled in thestudy. It is doubtful then that this agent is a signi cant path- ogen in acute bacterial sinusitis. However, Sa u r e u s plays an important role in some of the complications of sinusitis. Clinical Presentation Viral URI A major task for the clinician who is evaluating a child withrespiratory symptoms is to distinguish those who have un-complicated viral URI from those who have acute bacterialsinusitis. This distinction allows for the identi cation of children who will bene t from an antimicrobial drug. The clinical course of a viral URI is depicted in Figure 2 and usually begins with a sore or scratchy throat. Children are more likely to have fever with a URI than adults, andwhen fever occurs, it presents early in the illness and re-solves within 1 to 2 days. Fever may be accompanied byconstitutional symptoms, such as headache and myalgia. Symptoms of nasal obstruction and discharge predom- inate during a URI and follow a predictable pattern. Thenasal discharge starts as clear and watery, becomes thicker and mucoid, and then is colored and opaque (purulent) for several days. This pattern then reverses, with the nasaldischarge becoming watery again or simply drying. Coughand hoarseness also may be prominent in viral URIs. Mostuncomplicated URIs last 5 to 10 days, and resolution ofsymptoms occurs without antimicrobial therapy. Althoughnot all children have complete resolution by day 10, thesymptoms usually have peaked in intensity on days 3 to 5 of illness and are improving.Acute Bacterial Sinusitis The presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis conforms to 1 of 3 predictable patterns (Table 2). The rst and most common presentation in children is that of persistent respi-ratory symptoms. These patients have nasal congestion ornasal discharge, with or without cough, for more than 10but fewer than 30 days without improvement. The key indistinguishing this presentation from an uncomplicated URI is the lack of improvement of their respiratory symp- toms after 10 days. Although patients with uncomplicatedviral URI may have residual respiratory symptoms at 10days, almost always these symptoms are improving. The rhinorrhea may be of any color or character: clear and watery, mucoid, or purulent (thick, colored, and opa-que). The cough may be wet or dry in character. Whencough is a symptom of acute bacterial sinusitis, it must be present during the day but often is reported to be worse at night. Face pain and headache are rare, although pain-less morning eye swelling occurs on occasion. Parents ofpreschool children often will report malodorous breath.The child who has this presentation usually appears onlymildly ill, and fever, if it is present, is low grade. The second presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis is that of the onset of severe illness. These patients present with temperatures of at least 38.5\u00b0C accompanied by a particular type of nasal discharge, a purulent nasal dis-charge, for a period of 3 to 4 days. Older children andadults may experience focal face pain, tooth pain, fever,and purulent nasal discharge. The presence of fever forlonger than 48 hours distinguishes this presentation fromthat of an uncomplicated viral URI. The third presentation is one of biphasic or worsening symptoms. In the Scandinavian literature, this is referredto as \"double sickening. \"These patients have initial symptoms of an uncomplicated viral URI that begins Figure 2. Schematic representation of an uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection.Table 2. Clinical Presentation and Criteria for the Diagnosis of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis Persistent symptoms Nasal discharge/congestion and/or cough for 10 days without improvement Severe symptoms Temperature 38.5oC with purulent rhinorrhea for at least 3 days Worsening symptoms Worsening of nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, cough, and fever after a 3- to 4-day period of improved symptomsinfectious diseases acute bacterial sinusitis 432 Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on July 28, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from to improve. Then after several days there is a substantial worsening of symptoms with exacerbation of cough or nasal discharge or congestion. A new fever may be pres-ent, or fever may recur if it was present at the onset. The physical ndings in children who have sinusitis may demonstrate mucopurulent material on the nasalmucosa or in posterior nasal mucosa it-self be erythematous or and pale, and the oro-pharynx may be injected. Malodorous breath may be present with sinusitis in the absence of a nasal foreign body or dental disease. Examination of the tympanicmembranes may reveal evidence of concomitant AOMor otitis media with effusion. Swelling and discolorationof the eyelids are observed sometimes, and occasionallyfacial tenderness over the maxillary or frontal sinuses ispresent. Overall, the physical examination is of limiteduse in making a speci c diagnosis because none of these physical ndings distinguishes a viral URI from acute bacterial sinusitis. Diagnosis Clinical Criteria The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is almost always aclinical one. Strict application o f the clinical criteria (Table 2) that de ne persistent, severe, and worsening symptoms will distinguish those children with s inusitis from those with viral URI and thus identify a cohort of patients most likely tobenet from an antimicrobial agent. The use of these clinical criteria results in a diagnosis o f acute bacterial sinusitis in 6% to 7% of children presenting i n a primary care setting with upper respiratory tract symptoms. (10) Imaging Although various imaging modalities have been used toassess the paranasal sinuses, imaging is not necessary toconrm the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute bacterial si- nusitis. Abnormal ndings on imaging studies include complete sinus opaci cation, mucosal thickening of at least 4 mm, or an air- fluid level. The continuity of the na- sal mucosa with the sinus mucosa limits the usefulness ofimaging in the diagnosis of sinusitis. It has been demon-strated that both adults and children have signi cant ab- normalities on imaging studies that are performed duringan uncomplicated URI. A classic study by Gwaltney et al reported on an expe- rience in adults who had uncomplicated colds. (11)Computed tomographic scans performed within 48 to96 hours of the onset of symptoms demonstrated abnor-malities of the sinuses in more than 80% of patients. Inchildren with viral URI, more than half will have abnor-mal sinuses on plain radiograph. (12) Accordingly, noimaging study is able to distinguish the infl ammation of the sinus mucosa caused by viruses from that due to bacteria. Although imaging studies are not recommended rou- tinely in the diagnosis of sinusitis, a negative radiographeffectively eliminates the diagnosis. Computed tomogra-phy and magnetic resonance imaging of the sinuses maybe useful when complications of sinusitis are suspected.In this situation, fluid collections that may require surgi- cal drainage may be identi ed. Sinus Aspiration A skilled pediatric otolaryngologist may perform maxil-lary sinus aspiration in an outpatient setting. Indicationsfor this procedure include sinusitis unresponsive to mul-tiple courses of antibiotics, orbital or intracranial compli-cations, severe facial pain, and suspected sinusitis in animmunocompromised host in whom unusual pathogens such as fungi may be present. Complications Complications of sinusitis may be divided into those in- volving the orbit, the central nervous system, or the bone(Table 3). The frontal and ethmoid sinuses are the mostcommon sinuses from which complications arise. Thedelicate and thin walls of the ethmoid sinuses, called lamina papyracea , allow for spread of infection into the orbit. Or- bital complications are the most common and include sub- periosteal abscess, orbital cellu litis, and orbital abscess. Signs of orbital infection include eyelid swelling, proptosis, and impairment of extraocular muscle movement. This compli-cation may result from spread of infection through the Table 3. Major Complications Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 433 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on July 28, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from natural dehiscences between the bones that comprise the medial wall of the orbit (which is also the lateral wall of the ethmoid sinus) or from the development of a subperios-teal abscess of the ethmoid bone. The frontal sinuses share venous drainage with intracra- nial structures, allowing for infection to develop within thebrain and surrounding structures. Intracranial infectionmay present with headache, seizures, focal neurologicsigns, or meningeal signs and can include subdural and epi- dural empyema and brain abscess. Parenteral antibiotics are necessary for treatment, and surgery is indicated whena drainable fluid collection is present. The bony complica- tion of acute frontal sinusitis is Pott puffy tumor, which isa subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone. Treatment Controlled Trials The necessity of treating sinusitis with antibiotics hasbeen controversial. There have been several randomizedtrials of placebo vs antimicrobial therapy in the treatmentof sinusitis in children that have produced con flicting re- sults. Lack of ef cacy in 2 of these studies may be ex- plained by underdosing of antibiotics and lack of cleardenition of the population of patients included in the studies. (13,14) Two other trials have found consistentbene t to antibiotic treatment when strict clinical criteria are used to select patients with sinusitis. (10,15) In the most recent trial, high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate was compared with placebo. (10) This study included 58children ages 1 to 10 years who met stringent criteria for si- nusitis based on persistent, worsening, or severe symptoms. A standardized symptom score was used to evaluate treat-ment effect. Of those childre n who received antibiotic, 64% were cured or improved vs 32% in the placebo arm.In addition, treatment failure was noted in 68% of those re-ceiving placebo vs 14% in the antibiotic arm of the study(P<.01). This study demonstrates that antibiotic treatment is bene cial when children in an of ce setting are diagnosed as having sinusitis using stringent clinical criteria. Antimicrobial Recommendations The antibiotics used to treat acute bacterial sinusitis inchildren are listed in Tables 4 and 5. High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (90 mg/kg/d) should be considered as a rst-line agent for the treatment of si- nusitis because it has the most comprehensive in vitroactivity against sinus pathogens. Because the proportionof cases caused by Hi nfluenzae is likely increasing and the rate of b-lactamase production by this organism is also in- creasing, the addition of clavulanic acid to amoxicillinprovides an advantage over amoxicillin alone. Using 90mg/kg/d of the amoxicillin component provides better coverage for penicillin nonsusceptible S pneumoniae.A l - though gastrointestinal adverse events are more common with amoxicillin-clavulanat e than placebo, most are mild and self-limited. Amoxicilli n alone is an acceptable sec- ond-line agent but should be used at a high dose (90mg/kg/) in those children at risk for resistant pneumococci,for example, those younger than 2 years, attending childcare, or having recently ( <30 days) received antibiotics. The choice of a second-line agent for treating sinus- itis in children is such ascefpodoxime, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir, are alterna-tive antibiotics that may be used to treat sinusitis in chil-dren, although they are less active against S pneumoniae than amoxicillin-clavulanate. As discussed, th e microbiology of respiratory tract infections in children is dynamic andhas demonstrated signi cant shifts since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. If Sp n e u m o n i a e , particularly penicillin-nonsusceptible strains, continues todecrease in prevalence, the cephalosporins may be moreeffective in the treatment of sinusitis.Table 4.

Despite the increased complexity and expense of this reg-imen, it is an alternative to the use of parenteral antimi-crobial agents in these children. Levo is also an ef- fective agent for children in whom amoxicillin-clavulanatetherapy fails or in the severely (type 1 hypersensitivity) pen- icillin allergic patient. It is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication, however. The rateof musculoskeletal adverse events, such as tendinopathy,arthritis, or arthralgia, is slightly higher in patients receiv-ing levo floxacin than other antibiotics. However, the drug usually is well tolerated in children, and the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics has issued a policy statement onthe use of fluoroquinolones in children. It was concluded that their use may be justi ed where there is no safe and effective alternative. (16) Patients with evidence of systemic toxic effects, compli- cations of sinusitis, or an inability to take antibiotics orallyshould be hospitalized for parenteral therapy. For uncom-plicated sinusitis, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime should be usedas single agents. If complications are suspected, the ceph-alosporin should be combined with vancomycin until the results of culture and susceptibilities are known. Response to therapy is prompt in children who have si- nusitis and are adherent to therapy with an appropriate an- timicrobial agent. Fever, if present at onset, resolves, anda rapid decrease in cough and nasal symptoms occurswithin 48 hours. If symptoms are not improved within this time frame, then clinical reevaluation is warranted. If the diagnosis is unchanged, a second-line antimicrobial shouldbe prescribed. Alternatively, sinus aspiration may be con-sidered for precise identi cation of the causative organism. The appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy has not been studied systematically. For patients who havea rapid response to the initiation of antimicrobial, 10 daysof therapy usually is adequate. For those who respond at a slower rate, treating until the patient is symptom free plus an additional 7 days is reasonable. Adjunctive Therapies Adjunctive therapies, such as antihistamines and decon-gestants, have not been found consistently to providebene t in children with sinusitis and may be associated with toxic effects. Intranasal corticosteroids have toomodest a bene t to be recommended routinely. Recurrent Sinusitis Some children experience frequent recurrences of sinussymptoms. The most common cause of such symptomsis recurrent viral URI, especially in those children at-tending child care. Other conditions, such as allergic rhinitis, exposure to tobacco smoke, gastroesophageal reflux, anatomical abnormalities, cystic brosis, an immunode ciency disorder, or ciliary dyskinesia, may predispose patients to recurrent symptoms. The evalua-tion of a child with recurrent sinusitis should includeTable 22.5 mg 250-125 250 8500-125 4:1 500 8 or 875 b16:1 1000-2000 12 aMaximum daily dose of amoxicillin is 4 g. bFood and Drug Administration approved for children and adults 16 years and older.infectious diseases acute bacterial sinusitis Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 435 at Health Sciences Library, Stony Brook University on July 28, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from consultation with an allergist, measurement of serum quantitative immunoglobulins and CH 50, a test for cystic and a biopsy of nasal mucosa to assess ciliary structure and function. If sinusitis does not respond to medical therapy, surgical intervention may be indicated. Chronic sinusitis in children is less common in adults and occurs often in children who have the above predis-posing conditions. Children with chronic sinusitis havemore of an in flammatory disease, although bacteria may cause acute exacerbations. References 1.Anand VK.

Pediatrics . 2011;128(4):e1034 -e1045Summary On the basis of strong research evidence, the pathogenesis of sinusitis involves 3 key factors: sinus ostia obstruction, ciliary dysfunction, and thickeningof sinus secretions. On the basis of studies of the microbiology of otitis media, H influenzae is playing an increasingly important role in the etiology of sinusitis, exceeding that of S pneumoniae in some areas, and b-lactamase production by H influenzae is increasing in respiratory isolates in the United States. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the presentation of acute bacterial sinusitis conforms to 1 of 3 predicable patterns; persistent, severe, andworsening symptoms. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the diagnosis of sinusitis should be made by applyingstrict clinical criteria. This approach will selectchildren with upper respiratory infection symptomswho are most likely to benet from an antibiotic. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, imaging is not indicated routinely in the diagnosis ofsinusitis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging provides useful information when complications of sinusitis are suspected. On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be considered as a rst-line agent for the treatment of sinusitis.
