Wayne Gorsek CEO & Founder Our passion for premium supplements comes directly from our founder Wayne Gorsek, who first became interested in supplemental nutrition products when his grandparents' health began to sharply decline. \"Both grandparents that adopted and raised me developed major health issues related to aging in their 70's. I found thousands of studies in medical journals indicating healthy foods, vitamins, minerals and herbs that would benefit them. I found they did help improve their mood, energy, immunity and joint function but only when given at levels far higher than typical multivitamins. Plus, many of the best nutrients were missing entirely like Coenzyme Q10!\" With Nature's Lab's state-of-the-art facility, experienced team of scientists and conscientious leadership you can feel good about the care and quality that goes into each and every capsule.
