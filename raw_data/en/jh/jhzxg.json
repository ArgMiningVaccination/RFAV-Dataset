(5 mins) Today we are going to be talking about the importance of emotional and spiritual health in recovery. We will begin with emotional health. Workingon your emotional health is important for several reasons. Negative emo-tions, such as anger and depression, are often triggers for drug use andother behaviors that risk your health. Negative emotions serve as barriersto making healthy choices. They interfere with memory, concentration, andproblem solving. Today we will try to get beneath the anger and depressionand think about these emotions in the context of unresolved grief.Show Slide 11.1Visual As shown in the slide, anger and depression are often experienced in response to fear or loss. When fear or loss feel overwhelming, we tend tocreate a protective layer of emotions around us, such as anger and depres-sion, that we feel we can cope with more easily. Then, if these emotions gettoo difficult to cope with, we create yet another layer of protection. Thismay include using drugs or engaging in reckless behavior, such as needlesharing and unsafe sex. The purpose of each layer is to protect us fromexperiencing the previous layer. In the process, we often completely losesight of the original experience of loss or overwhelming fear. However, it isstill there, festering, beneath all the protective layers we've created. It's likehaving a wound that is infected. Unless you treat the infection, the woundwill never truly heal no matter how many bandages you put on it.Individuals in recovery need to be willing to take on the difficult task ofidentifying and treating their emotional wounds. This is likely to be difficultat first, but if you don't do it, you will find it extremely difficult to remainabstinent and lead a healthy life. Let's begin by talking about grief. When we think about grief we usually think about grieving over the death of a loved one, but grief is actually a normal human response to loss of anykind. QUIZ ITEM 251Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.2Visual 252Emotional and Spiritual Healing Grieving is an unavoidable part of living for all of us. No one is immune. We grieve when we lose people and pets who are important to us, we also grieve when we lose things that are important to us (even giving up drugs isa loss that many long-time drug users grieve), and we grieve if we are diag-nosed with a potentially debilitating illness that can threaten our lives,impair our functioning, or end a cherished lifestyle. Counselor provides instruction on stages of grief. (10 mins) According to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, who wrote several books on grief\u2014grief is a process\u2014that means that people go through various stages when they arefaced with a loss. You may not go through all the stages she describes, andyou may not go through them exactly in the order she specifies; however, hav-ing an understanding of the different stages of grief and being able to identifywhere you are in the process can be extremely helpful in moving you forward. Show Slide 11.4VisualVisual Verbal/ DidacticShow Slide 11.3 This slide shows the six stages of grieving described by Elizabeth Kubler- Ross. They are denial; anger; bargaining; depression; acceptance; and hope. QUIZ ITEM We'll go over them one at a time, and then discuss how they may relate to your recovery. STAGE 1. Denial This is the stage when the person thinks, \"No, this just cannot be true.\" We've probably all said this when faced with terrible news. Denying some- thing is true is a common way of initially dealing with a painful situation.At first, one may feel totally unable to accept the bad news. In this stage ofdenial we might isolate ourselves in an attempt to defend against the realityof the situation. Although denial is a normal stage of grief, if we remain in this stage too long we will be unable to make necessary and important decisions. STAGE 2. Anger The next stage is anger. This is the stage in which the person acknowledges the reality of the situation, but is filled with rage at the loss and thinks,\"This isn't fair; why did this have to happen to me?\" When a loved one dies, we may be angry at whatever took our loved one's life, angry atGod, even angry at the loved one for leaving us. Although feeling angry isnormal, we may displace our anger. This means taking anger out on otherpeople or things. It may feel as if everything and everyone is irritating usand so we lash out and are completely unaware that this is a manifestationof our grief. Although displaced anger may serve to distance us from thepain and reality of the loss, it can create problems in personal relationships,especially if the people around us do not understand that we are grieving. Itcan even lead to legal problems if we physically act out our anger on peopleor property. STAGE 3. Bargaining The next stage is bargaining. This is a stage that people sometimes go through when they are facing the loss of their own life or the life of a lovedone. They think \"There must be something I can do to change this.\" We may try to make bargains with God by promising to do something diffi- cult (often something that we are unlikely to be able to do), in exchange forremoving the threat of loss. For example, we might pray, \"God, if you takethis pain away, I promise to never even think about using drugs again.\"When feeling powerless, bargaining may provide us with the illusion that weare actually doing something to help, but as with the previous stage, if weremain in this stage too long, it can prevent us from coping realistically withthe situation and taking appropriate action. 253Emotional and Spiritual HealingSTAGE 4. Depression The next stage is depression. In this stage, the reality of the loss has really \"sunk in.\" Denial, anger, and bargaining give way to despair, and we think\"I cannot handle this pain and I'm helpless to do anything about it.\"We may attempt to withdraw from the world and to \"shut down our circuits\" in an attempt to defend ourselves against the pain of the loss. Although pro-found sadness in response to loss is normal, it is important not to get stuckin this stage. As you all know, depression can quickly lead to drug use andother unhealthy behavior. STAGE 5. Acceptance The next stage is acceptance. This is the stage where we move beyond defending ourselves from the pain of the loss with denial, anger, and depres-sion, and begin to accept reality. We may think \"I have experienced a painful loss, but I can get through it.\" When we are in the earlier stages of grieving, it seems that acceptance is an unattainable goal.However, it is important to keep in mind that acceptance is neither unat-tainable nor is it the ultimate goal. Acceptance is not the end of the process,but rather a necessary step that will move you beyond grief to the next stagewhich is hope. STAGE 6. Hope We have reached the final stage\u2014hope\u2014when we reflect upon the loss in search of personal meaning. In this stage we may think \"I am ready to learn from this important life experience.\" As we will discuss later, finding personal meaning in a loss involves being willing to identify and faceyour fears. Before we talk about fear, let's consider how the six stages of grieving can be applied to addiction and recovery. Questions for group discussion: Counselor leads discussion about grief by asking the following questions: (5 mins) 1.Addiction entails forming a very powerful bond with your drug of choice. Have any of you met individuals who experienced a deep sense of losswhen they gave up their drug of choice? 2.Did any of you go through these stages when you began addiction treat- ment? 254Emotional and Spiritual Healing3.When you are grieving other kinds of losses, does your addiction keep you stuck in any one stage of grief? (For example, does it keep you in thedenial stage?) Let's talk now about what keeps us stuck in any one stage and how to move beyond the stages of grief to hope. Counselor leads discussion on fears. (10 mins) We talked about the first four stages of grief as providing temporary protec- tion from the reality of whatever loss you have experienced. In fact, whatyou are really trying to protect yourselves from is not only the experience ofloss, but your fears associated with this loss. Some of your fears may be jus-tified; however, many fears that people have may not accurately reflect reali-ty. QUIZ ITEM You've probably all heard the saying: \"You have nothing to fear but fear itself.\" What this means is fear is our worst enemy because it can cause more harm than anything else. Let's consider how fear canimpede you from finding meaning in your loss and moving beyond grief tohope. Let's use as an example getting tested for HIV. Some people refuse to be tested because of their fear, however, by not getting tested their fears canbecome reality. Similarly, if someone tests positive for HIV and is consumedwith fear about what lies ahead, he or she will probably make poor decisionsthat result in those fears being realized. 255Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.5Visual As shown on the slide, some common fears associated with testing positive for HIV include: Fear of death\u2014this may include fear of the unknown, fear that one's life had no meaning Fear of suffering\u2014this may include fear of pain, medical procedures, loss of physical, mental, social functioning. Fear of harm to loved ones\u2014this may include fear of emotional and finan- cial hardship for family and friends, transmission of HIV to others. Fear of loss of lifestyle\u2014this is not the same as fear of death. It can include fear of having to give up old routines, habits, style of coping. As the next slide suggests, it is important to realize that if you are in this situation you can expend a lot of energy trying to defend yourselves againstyour own fears, putting on layers of armor to protect you from harm, whenin fact your fears may not accurately reflect reality. QUIZ ITEM Counselor asks group members if there are any additional fears thatthey have, and writes these on the board. As this slide shows, the reality is that focusing on defending yourself from your fears may actually... prevent you from taking steps to protect your health QUIZ ITEM prevent you from moving beyond grief to hope. 256Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.6Visual If you become stuck in one of the earlier stages of grief, you may... be less likely to protect yourself and others from further harm be less likely to follow medical advice, including not taking medication as prescribed be less likely to be abstinent from illicit drugs. So, what is the result of all this? The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By responding to your fears, you can actually turn your fears into reality. Let's see how this could happen. We'll continue to use the example of test-ing positive for HIV. Remember our friend Pat from previous groups? Let'suse Pat again to demonstrate self-fulfilling prophecy. As the slide shows, Pat's fear about HIV is its potential impact on mental, physical, and social functioning. To defend against this fear, Pat begins acocaine run and stops taking his HIV medications as prescribed. As we havediscussed in previous groups, cocaine use itself can hasten HIV disease pro-gression, and can contribute substantially to mental, physical, and socialimpairment. So Pat's response to fear (use of cocaine) caused Pat's fears tobecome a reality. Pat's HIV disease quickly progressed to AIDS, and Patalso experienced severe impairment due to physical, neurological, and psy-chological damage caused by chronic drug use. This is an example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. QUIZ ITEM Rather than understanding this, Pat is likely to say \"See I told you I was right\u2014look what has happened to mebecause of HIV.\" In fact, Pat may not have experienced these negativeevents if were not for the fact that Pat dealt with fear by using cocaine andby not following medical advice. 257Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.7Visual So what do you do if you can't defend yourself from your fears? Simply put, you have to have the courage to face your fears in order toreduce the power that these fears have over you and your life. Counselor instructs group on facing fear and reclaiming control. (10 mins) Facing your fears allows you to take control\u2014when you do this you take the power out of the fear so that it no longer rules you. Let's go over the waysPat could have faced his fears about HIV listed on an earlier slide. Althoughwe are continuing with the example of testing positive for HIV, rememberthese steps demonstrate how to face any fear that may underlie anger anddepression and that may ultimately lead to drug use and other high riskbehavior. Fear is an expression of loss of control. When you face your fearsyou can identify where you have control and where you do not. As a result,your fears are reduced and you no longer need the associated negative emo-tions and behaviors to protect you from the fear. Let's see how this can workwith Pat 1.If Pat feared Death as a result of testing positive for HIV, he would need to face the fact of his death\u2014not because he is infected with HIV, butbecause he is a human being; therefore his death, like that of all crea-tures on earth, is inevitable. Most of us don't want to contemplate theinevitable physical death of our bodies. It takes courage, but the alterna-tive is fear and withdrawal which blocks energy needed for living lifefully. One way to reduce the fear of death is to take control of thoseaspects of your death that you can control: 258Emotional and Spiritual Healing Verbal/ Didactic Show Slide 11.8Visual a.Have a living will that will inform people if you do not wish to be kept alive by any artificial means. If you don't have an attorney, you canobtain a Living Will in many stationery stores. b.Make your wishes known about the disposal of your physical remains. Do you wish to be buried or cremated? c.Identify someone you can trust to make choices for you if you can no longer make them for yourself and discuss your wishes with this per-son. d.If fear is an automatic response to thoughts of death, replace the fear with an automatic relaxation response. Do the following exercise daily: Counselor reads the following autogenic relaxation script: Sit quietly and with your eyes closed begin to think about whatever it is that you fear. Begin slowly. The moment you become aware of feel-ing fearful, rate your fear on a scale from 0 to 10 (not at all toextremely), and then do one of the relaxation exercises we have dis-cussed in previous groups. For example, tighten and then relax eachmajor muscle group while continuing to think about what you fear.Then re-rate your fear. Were you able to reduce it? With practice,you will be able to think about what you fear for longer periods oftime before you experience the fear, and eventually your body willrespond to that thought, with a sense of peace and relaxation, ratherthan with fear. When this happens you will no longer need the nega-tive emotions and behaviors to protect you from experiencing yourfear. e.Here's another example. If Pat fears death because he worries that his life has had no meaning, he could remind himself that meaning isfound in the present moment. Looking to the future for happiness orliving in the past is a set-up for disappointment. Ultimately, none ofus have any assurance of anything beyond this present moment.There really is no future or past\u2014just a continuous progression ofnow moments. We all need to make the most of each moment. 2.If Pat fears Suffering, he could reduce this fear by becoming more knowledgeable about HIV. QUIZ ITEM He should talk to his health care provider and counselor and read about HIV. He should also askabout the probability of pain and/or disability due to HIV; ask how painis controlled; ask about medical procedures. His fears are probably worsethan reality. He should find out what steps he can take right now to helpslow disease progression, and act on it. This includes abstaining fromdrugs and following medical regimens. When you become knowledgeableabout what you fear, you reduce its power over you. 259Emotional and Spiritual HealingExperiential/ Exercise3.If Pat fears that he will cause Harm to Loved Ones, he should take steps now to reduce harm: For example, he should have an up-to-date will and make provisions for the care of loved ones Talk to his loved ones about his fears and their fears Join a support group with his loved one Engage in harm reduction strategies to reduce risk of HIV transmis- sion to others and further harm to himself. Again, this step applies toany fear. When we identify what we do have control over and takeaction, we again reduce the power of fear in our lives. 4.If he fears Loss of his current lifestyle, he should identify what is most important to him about his lifestyle\u2014what does he truly value\u2014heshould investigate alternative ways to meet his needs. For example, ifhe fears loss of sexual intimacy, he could learn how to eroticize safer sex-ual practices. Do you notice that every step requires putting your fear in perspective, find- ing out what you do have control over and what you do not, and takingappropriate action? If Pat does face his fear, he will be less likely to becomedepressed and use drugs and more likely to be abstinent, follow medical rec-ommendations, and live a healthy lifestyle. Each of these actions will helphim to prevent his fears from becoming a reality. Let's see how you canapply this to your own lives. Letting go of fear (15 mins) Counselor provides instruction for the exercise, as follows: In your Client Workbook you will find a worksheet entitled \"Letting go of fear.\" The purpose of this exercise is to help you identify and heal any lossesthat may contribute to your drug use and addictive lifestyle so that you canmove forward in your recovery. The Worksheet asks you to identify yourmost recent loss and write it in the space provided. Select a loss that seemsto have the greatest affect on your drug use and one that you have yet tocompletely accept. Then consider what stage of grieving you are in currentlywith regard to that loss. Then identify any fears associated with the lossyou are currently grieving. Next, identify emotions and behaviors associatedwith this fear. Finally, select one of the fears you listed and describe justone specific step you can take during the coming week that will help you letgo of this fear. Then make a commitment to take this step on a particularday or days during the coming week. 260Emotional and Spiritual HealingClearly this is an ongoing process and needs to be done thoughtfully. Today, we'll take just 10-15 minutes to get you started. I encourage you to contin-ue outside of group identifying specific steps to let go of each of your fears. Counselor directs group members to the appropriate page in their Workbook, (Counselor provides a handout to those group members who did not bring their Workbook), and instructs group members to begin.Counselors walk around the room to offer assistance as needed.Counselor calls time after 10-15 minutes and encourages groupmembers to complete the exercise at home as follows: Again, I strongly encourage all of you to continue working on this process outside of group. You might even want to involve a loved one so that youcan work together on letting go of fear. Commit yourself to getting startedright now. You can reclaim control. You can free yourself from the power your fears have over you. If you do, you can begin to live every moment of your life to its fullest potential. When we get back from break, we'll be lightening things up a bit and talking about how to diffuse fear with humor. (10 mins) Counselor reviews material covered before the break. (5 mins) Before the break we talked about grief, which is a normal human response to loss of any kind QUIZ ITEM and the 6 stages of grief\u2014denial, anger, bar- gaining, depression, acceptance, and hope. QUIZ ITEM If you get stuck in the first four stages, you cannot move beyond grief to hope. We talked abouthow fear can keep you stuck in early stages of grief and how it can preventyou from engaging in behavior that can protect your physical, emotional, andsocial well-being. Fear can prevent you from taking steps to maintain yourhealth. QUIZ ITEM In addition, even though fears do not always accurately reflect reality QUIZ ITEM , they can lead to behaviors that are unsafe (such as drug use) that can actually cause those fears to become a reality. This isan example of a self-fulfilling prophecy QUIZ ITEM , and explains the saying \"you have nothing to fear but fear itself\"\u2014 fear can actually be your worstenemy. Identifying and facing your fears will help you move beyond grief to 261Emotional and Spiritual Healing ReviewBreakhope. This takes courage, and entails identifying what you do, and do not, have control over, and then taking appropriate action. Once you have identi-fied what you can control and have taken appropriate action, you are leftwith what cannot be controlled. This is when you simply need to let go. You may have heard the saying, \"Let go and let God.\" You can replace the word \"God\" in this saying with whatever concept is meaningful to you. What you need to do is to \"turn over\" or \"surrender\"what you cannot control to your higher power, however you interpret that tobe meaningful in your life. Remember from our group on the 12-steps that\"higher power\" can mean different things to different people. The primarygoal is to let go of what you cannot possibly control. As shown in the slide,imagine putting what you cannot control in a balloon and then letting it go,allowing it to drift away. If you can do this, you are more likely to attainserenity. This returns us to the last stage of grief\u2014 Hope. Let's talk about that now. Counselor leads discussion on spiritual growth. (5 mins) Mind, body, and spirit are closely interwoven, with each influencing the oth- ers. Some people believe that you cannot have healing on the level of thebody without healing on the level of the mind and spirit. The word \"spiritu-al\" is often confused with religious. However, spirituality is not confined toreligion or to one set of beliefs, or doctrines. Spirituality is an essential partof who and what we are and what we value. It is therefore profoundly per-sonal, and means something different for every person. Some people experi-ence their spirituality by believing in a power greater than themselves. Forsome people, spirituality means feeling a connection with all things in cre-ation. Some people believe that their spirit is the very core of their beingand that their body is a shell or temporary home for their spirit. 262Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.9Visual Verbal/ DiscussionAs the slide shows, whatever spirituality means to you, getting in touch with and strengthening your own spirit can provide a fertile place in which hope can be planted and can grow and flourish. So, what do spirituality and hope have to do with recovery?Addiction has been called a sickness of the soul. Addicted individuals often feel an existential void in their lives that they have tried unsuccessfully tofill with drugs. Upon entering treatment they realize that the void stillneeds to be filled. Those who are successful in their recovery often reportthat they have filled this void by strengthening their spirit. In fact, there isevidence from research that strong spiritual and/or religious beliefs and opti-mism are not only associated with recovery from addiction, but also withbetter physical and psychological health. So how do you begin if you want to grow spiritually? 263Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.10Visual Show Slide 11.11Visual When you are spiritually starved, you need to begin feeding your spirit. As shown in the slide, there are several steps you can take to promote your spiritual health. These include engaging in daily prayer, meditation,imagery, and ritual. QUIZ ITEM Counselor presents information on the slide, as follows: 1.Prayer. Prayer is any act of communion with God or a higher power. Prayer can take many forms\u2014from recitation of formal litany to animpromptu and brief communication, spoken or unspoken. The content ofa prayer may also vary, depending upon the needs of the individual who ispraying, and may be a fervent request or the expression of devotion. 2. Meditation. Meditation is the focusing of attention. Like prayer, medi- tation can take different forms. Some people meditate on a single wordor mantra, some chant, some silently become aware of their breathing, orfocus on an object, and some simply focus on the present moment.Meditation can be done while seated or lying down, or while engaged inan activity that is repetitive and that limits distractions. By focusingattention, the meditator becomes relaxed, centered, and is able to tap aninner source of wisdom. 3. Imagery. Imagery or visualization is the process of forming a mental image (visual and/or verbal). Through imagery you can give your innerwisdom a voice and persona. You can then use this inner spiritual guideto help direct you along the path of spiritual growth. 4. Ritual. Aritual is a religious or solemn ceremony repeated faithfully and regularly. Rituals have been used in every culture throughout theages to inter-connect mind, body, and spirit. Identify a ritual that is par-ticularly meaningful to you that is used in your own religion, or create aritual that you can perform at home, such as lighting a candle or burningincense, hitting a gong, arranging flowers. As you perform this ritual, letit symbolize your spiritual healing, and take a moment to reflect on this. Choose a special place in your home to set up a meditation or prayer area. You may also want to set aside certain times of the dayfor spiritual healing, such as morning upon awakening and eveningbefore retiring. The next slide summarizes what we have covered so far and shows what our friend Pat could have done to cope more effectively with his fears about HIV: 264Emotional and Spiritual HealingDidactic/ DiscussionWe refer frequently to the Serenity Prayer in this program. Can you see how it applies to what Pat could have done to cope with testing positive forHIV? Counselor reads the serenity prayer to the group, as follows: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Now Pat has the Wisdom to know the difference between what can and can- not be changed about HIV. Pat has found the Serenity to accept what can- not be changed, by \"letting go and letting God.\" Pat has also found theCourage to change what can be changed by taking action. Now our friend Pat is able to work effectively on physical, emotional, and spiritual healing.By strengthening his spirit, Pat's behavior can be motivated by love insteadof by fear and this will help him stay on the road to recovery which leads toimproved physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Counselor presents material on humor and healing. (5 mins) We began this group by focusing on loss and fear, and considered how addic- tive behavior is motivated by fear. We also talked about spiritual growthand said that growing spiritually can help you make decisions that are moti-vated by love rather than by fear. When your behavior is motivated by fearyou are likely to engage in behaviors that will place your health and welfare 265Emotional and Spiritual Healing Show Slide 11.12Visual Experiential/ Team Game(or the health and welfare of others) at risk. When your behavior is motivat- ed by love, you are likely to want to do everything in your power to protectyour health and welfare (and the health and welfare of others). Let's turnnow to laughter. Laughter too can promote physical, emotional, and spiritu-al health along your journey of recovery. We recommend that you make alist of movies, comedians, books, and cartoons that make you laugh. If youhave access to the internet you also have access to sites that give you a jokea day and other humorous materials. Humor can also be a healthy way totemporarily defend against fear. You can reduce the power of fear by learn-ing to laugh at yourself and your fears. So, watch, read, or listen to some-thing you find funny every day to bring laughter into your daily life. Counselor refers group members to the \"amusing epitaphs\" handout in their Client Workbooks and distributes copies of the \"epitaphs\" handout tothose members who do not have their Workbooks. In keeping with the theme of this group, we are going to have some fun with a fear we probably all have in common. In your Client Workbook you willfind a list of epitaphs found on tombstones in graveyards across the countryand around the world. Let's go around the room, and take it in turn to read one of the epitaphs. I'll start. Counselor distributes the \"Epitaph\" handout to those who do not have their Workbooks and begins by reading aloud the first epitaph on the handout. Counselor then asks each group member in turn to read one of theremaining epitaphs aloud to the group until all are read. Counselorencourages group members to have fun with the epitaphs. Let's play our game now. TEAM GAME: \"Remember me by what I valued\" (Total time 20 mins - Part I, 5 mins; Part II, 10 mins; Part III, 5 mins) Aim: To identify what you value To get to know others by what they value To encourage group sharing, humor, and social interaction 266Emotional and Spiritual HealingMaterials: \"Remember me by what I valued\" team game worksheet (cut into Parts I and II) Pencil/pensHats or containers (one for each team)Timer Prizes (e.g., bubbles, balloons, \"spiritual\" stickers) Counselor distributes the top half (Part I) of the worksheet and reads instructions for Part I as follows: Part I. (total 5 mins) Instructions: 1.There are three parts to today's game. 2.The purpose of the first part is to help you reflect on what you value in your life. 3.I want you to pretend that your house is on fire. 4.You have time to save the three things in the house that are most important to you. All your loved ones and pets are safe so you don't have to worry about saving them. 5.You will have 3 minutes to write down on the piece of paper the name of these three things that you want to save. Don't put your name on thepaper. When you have finished, fold the paper in half and then halfagain, and don't let anyone see what you wrote. Then wait for furtherinstruction. I will then explain Part II of the game. 6.Okay, begin now: Write the 3 things you would want to save from your burning house. Counselor starts the timer. At the end of 3 minutes, Counselor calls time, instructs group member to fold their paper in half and then half again.Counselor then reads instructions for Part II, as follows: Part II. (total 10 minutes) Instructions: 1.I am going to divide the group into teams and I will provide each team with its own container and a Worksheet. 2.Team members will then place their folded pieces of paper in their own team's container. 267Emotional and Spiritual Healing3.One member of each team will then select a piece of paper from the con- tainer of one of the other teams, such that each team will have the foldedpaper belonging to one of the other teams. 4.Each team will then be asked to pretend that the person who wrote the items on that piece of paper actually went into the burning house to getthese three things and was presumed to have perished. All that could befound when the fire went out was this folded piece of paper (our pretend\"victims\" will be relieved to hear that they actually survived the fire andthat they also saved their three items). 5.It is the team's task to work together to write an epitaph for the pre- sumed \"victim\" of the fire based on what he or she identified as the threemost important things to be saved from the burning house. 6.Points will be awarded for the most creative and amusing epitaph and for including some reference to each of the three items in the epitaph. Ascompensation for being selected from the hat to be the presumed \"victim\"and subject of the epitaph, a bonus point will be awarded to that person.Another bonus point will be awarded for team participation if the teammembers work well together and everyone makes some contribution. 7.You will have 10 minutes to write the epitaph and then we'll take 5 min- utes to read the epitaphs and select a winner. Each member of the win-ning team will get a prize. Have fun with it. Remember humor can behealing on many levels. Counselor divides the group into small teams (3-4 people per team) and distributes Part II of the worksheet and a container to each team.Counselor instructs the teams to place their folded pieces of paper fromPart I in their own container. Counselor then instructs one member ofTeam#1 to reach into the container of one of the other teams and select one folded piece of paper.

I'll be dim- ming the lights and playing an audiotape. I'd like you to get comfortable inyour chair, uncross your legs, and sit quietly with your eyes closed and justfollow along with the tape. Remember that learning to relax is a skill thattakes practice, so if you feel restless at first, just remind yourself that this isa 10 minute gift of quiet time that you give to yourself and to the othermembers of the group. As we've discussed in this group, this and similartechniques can be extremely useful to you if you incorporate them into yourdaily life. Learning to relax and to be at peace can reduce the power thatfear has in your life, and help move you beyond grief to hope. With practice,it can help put you in touch with your inner guide\u2014that source of wisdomthat is within each of you that can guide you towards better physical, emo-tional, and spiritual health. Counselor dims the lights, says \"quiet please,\" and begins the tape. END SESSION 270Emotional and Spiritual Healing Stress Management "}
