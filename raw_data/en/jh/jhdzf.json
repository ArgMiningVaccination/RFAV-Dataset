Add to this that toxic agents are becoming all too common in the modern world, and it is all the more important to detox regularly. Here are just a few of the causes of increased toxicity in our bodies: Air Pollution On average, the human body breathes 2 gallons of air per minute; the quality of this air affects our health. Unfortunately, increasingly in urban areas, the air around us is laden with pollutants. Due to a growing population and growing industrialization, high levels of ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide are found in today's air. Studies have shown that, on average, air pollution can take 1 to 2 years off an individual's lifespan. Food As the world population has grown, the demand for food has also risen. To try and meet this demand, many farming operations have turned to greater use of pesticides, chemicals, antibiotics, and GMO's (genetically modified organisms). When ingested, over time these toxins can build up in our bodies, affecting our health and quality of life. Chronic Stress Chronic stress is defined as a state of prolonged tension from internal or external stressors. In the modern world, many individuals know this state of chronic stress all too well. Whether the cause is family tension, problems with work, or relationship issues, the effects are the same. Fatigue, back pain, heachache, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, suppressed immune system, and many more. The good news is that toxicity can be safely removed from the body through deep cleansing, as is done in programs like Panchakarma. When this happens, many symptoms of ill health decrease or reverse entirely and our natural state of health is restored. If you are new to the Ayurvedic practice of panchakarma, you may be wondering what exactly it is, how it can help you, and more importantly, when you should do it. Ayurveda is the science of longevity; it is all about helping you live a longer, more satisfying life. Panchakarma is an integral part of Ayurveda, which can help you live a longer, happier existence. Panchakarma is a holistic mind-body healing practice of detoxifying the body while strengthening the immune system and restoring your body's pH balance. It also provides an overall sense of calm and wellbeing while promoting rejuvenation in the body. "}
