You've heard it before but it bears repeating: nothing in life is more precious than your health. If you take care of your body not only do you prevent disease and illness and prolong your life, but you also vastly improve the quality of your life. You increase your daily energy, creativity, attention span and mental focus, allowing you to achieve more in the pursuit of whatever matters to you, such as family, career, athletics and hobbies. Your emotions are also elevated, so your self-esteem and outlook on life end up where they've always belonged: very positive. And you're not just considered attractive to others for your fit body and glowing appearance, but indeed magnetic because of the confidence, energy, upbeat attitude and overall life you exude. My dietary program is proven to help you achieve all of these benefits. Through my health clinic, The Optimal Wellness Center, and through my website, Mercola.com\u2014now the world's most visited natural health website with many tens of thousands of pages of useful free health information\u2014this program has helped many thousands of people improve and recover from chronic disease and other illnesses, optimize their weight, and increase their physical, mental and emotional performance. The program, and all the recipes you'll find in this book that follow the program, is based on this one essential principle: the type and quality of the food you eat has a profound influence on your health. It only takes common sense to understand that what you put into your body several times a day, every day, will have far more impact on your well-being than anything else you do. Yet over two-thirds of Americans are now overweight, with one-third at the even more dangerous level of clinical obesity, and countries such as Australia, Canada, and Britain are experiencing similar epidemic levels. Consequentially, we're also experiencing widespread levels of chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer that are directly associated with obesity and other diet-related causes. The fact that the type and quality of food you eat has a profound influence on your health may therefore sound like common sense, but something is misdirecting the majority of us far away from such common sense. This misdirection, and the failure of those who are aware of it to do anything about it, is costing many people their lives. In your hands, though, you hold a real solution. No matter where you are starting from today\u2014perhaps you have a weight problem, diabetes, high cholesterol, or some other health condition, or perhaps you are reasonably healthy\u2014the recipes in this book, and the insight of the dietary program and metabolic typing that surround them, will help you achieve your health goals. You can optimize your weight, improve or even eliminate your health challenges, prevent new ones, and achieve all the benefits mentioned at the start of this chapter if you commit yourself to it. And therein lies the key\u2014commitment. Like anything else of true worth in this life, achieving real health through this book is ultimately your decision. The information and recipes for healthy living are all provided for you 1DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter here, but only you can choose to first commit yourself to the program. This deserves your careful consideration, as it is not uncommon to hear people \"wish\" that they were healthier, had more energy, or could permanently lose weight, but in the next breath complain that taking the real steps toward doing so is \"too costly\" or \"too time-consuming.\" Some of these people will then slump into their couches to watch TV for hours everyday, or they'll waste thousands of dollars per year on junk food, soft drinks, and other non-food stuff that merely satisfies an immediate urge. How is it that spending so much time and resources on these pursuits and products is more important than devoting them to health? It's really a matter of getting priorities straight, of remembering that you've just got this one life to live. To drive the point home, try this one question test: Of these five things, which would you least want to have destroyed or eliminated: 1) Your car 2) Your TV 3) Your house 4) Your job 5) Your body If you answered number 5, then you'll realize that a central priority in your life should be dedicated to ensuring that your body isn't destroyed or eliminated prematurely. (And if you answered anything besides number 5, turn immediately to the \"Overcoming Emotional Barriers\" chapter of this book.) While the recipes in this book have been created to be as quick and easy as possible, you should still recognize that they are not as quick and easy as unwrapping a Snicker's bar, nor are they as cheap. While you'll find that the dietary plan, lifestyle habits, and emotional tools covered in this book will make succeeding on this diet far simpler than you're anticipating right now, it still is not as simple as grabbing a Big Mac at McDonald's drive-up window. But the results in all aspects of your life will be infinitely more rewarding. It all starts with your choosing. You can choose to keep wishing you were thinner, healthier, and younger looking but not take the steps to actually improve your health. Or you can choose to make achieving optimal health a true priority in your life, and dedicate yourself to achieving it through the proven advice, recipes, and resources this book offers. Read on if your health and life are worth that effort. 2 INTRODUCTION D R . M E R C O L A' S T O T A L H E A L T H P R O G R A M P A R T O N E 1: The Six Mercola Essentials Congratulations! You've taken a crucial step on your journey to optimal health and weight by choosing to commit yourself to it. You may not recognize it so much now, but in just a few weeks, and then again in a few months, and then for the rest of your life, when you are living the wonderful health benefits this book will provide, you'll look back fondly on this decision as one of the major turning points of your life. So let's start with the \"Mercola Essentials,\" which are the basis of my dietary program, every recipe in this book, and your healthy life: 1) No matter what your health challenge is, you should eliminate or at least significantly reduce the sugars and grains, particularly the processed forms, in your diet, as you'll find out in the next chapter. 2) Despite what some of the fad diets out there have insisted, you need carbohydrates, protein, and fat in your diet. None of these are evil as some \"experts\" have made them out to be. The key is, first, understanding and choosing only the healthy type of each of these, which you will learn in Chapter 3 and 4, and second, consuming the right amount of carbo- hydrates, protein, and fat for your personal metabolic type, which you'll learn in Chapter 5. 3) You have a unique biochemistry, or metabolic type, and certain types of \"nutritious\" food are healthier for your metabolic type, while other types of \"nutritious\" food are actually less so. You must know your metabolic type if you truly want to optimize your health and fitness; Chapter 5 of this book provides you the means to do so, including the crucial concept of \"listening to your body\" and fine-tuning your diet accordingly. Part Two then provides further guidance on how to alter the recipes, and guide your eating toward your metabolic type. 4) Your emotional and mental well-being is directly tied to your physical health and your dietary success. Negative emotions such as cravings and addictions, low self-esteem, and past traumas will impact your ability to overcome disease and overweight/obesity issues, but there are solutions provided in Chapter 6 that will help you overcome these emotional obstacles. 5) You will not need to consume a shopping bag full of supplements because the healthy recipes and foods recommended in this book will typically provide you with most of the nutrients you will need. The only exceptions are: A) the few supplements that nearly 7DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter everyone needs such as fish oil with omega-3, as detailed for you in Chapter 7, and B) specific supplementation for those with special health challenges. 6) Making certain other lifestyle choices are essential to your health success. This includes drinking plenty of pure water, getting proper sleep, exercising, and learning how to bypass the influences of institutions fostering the overweight and chronic disease epidemics for their own profit and power. You'll learn about all these in Chapter 7, as well. As you are reading this book, there are two important points to keep in mind. First, it is crucial that you avoid becoming overwhelmed with all of the useful information or attempt to bite off more than you can chew. Some people, when they encounter all the dietary and lifestyle changes they should make toward optimal health and weight, become discouraged because they believe they have to make them all happen at one time. Others become over-motivated and try to make them all happen at one time. Both frequently lead to failure. The key with all the insight offered in this book\u2014and adopting positive changes in any aspect of your life\u2014is to implement it in manageable bites. That means establishing a plan for yourself over time, and implementing the changes in phases into your life. Chapter 8, \"Pulling It All Together,\" will help you in this regard by providing a simple approach and key reminders you can use to prioritize and build your \"manageable bites\" plan. Second, you will notice that the recipes in the cookbook include a wide range of foods. While many of these foods can generally be found in your local grocery or health food store, the cookbook includes specific brands of food items recommended for their superior health value. A key point to remember is food quality is dramatically different depending on the source. For example, one source of salmon, such as the Vital Choice brand that we offer through Mercola.com, is from the pure waters of the Alaskan wilderness. We have had the salmon laboratory tested and it is certifiably free of any harmful toxins. Meanwhile, though, the vast majority of salmon found in supermarkets is contaminated with either mercury or PCB's and is quite unhealthy for you. Choosing quality foods and health products can make all the difference in the world to your health and well-being. Because this quality is essential, on my website and in my twice-weekly newsletters I have always made it a point to research and recommend what I have found to be the highest quality food and health products. In this book, I provide you the same detailed insight on the right types of foods. With most of the foods I recommend, such as vegetables or nuts, you'll be able to find them in virtually any grocery or health food store. With others, particularly the right types of fish, beef and other meat, you are not likely to find these in a typical grocery store. I encourage you to first check your local health food store for these specific foods with my recommended guidelines. Locally owned health food stores are a national treasure well deserving of your business, and they are usually eager to listen to your input on the goods they should carry. However, if you can't find them elsewhere, or if time is an issue for you, you can easily access the \"Recommended Products\" section on Mercola.com to learn how to obtain these products. 8 THE SIX MERCOLA ESSENTIALS 2: The Dangers of Grains and Sugars If you made no other adjustments to your diet but eliminating or vastly reducing grains and sugars it is likely your health would rapidly improve and within days you'd start losing weight. Within weeks you'd have a very noticeable improvement in both areas. Within months, in addition to the dramatic health and weight improvement, you'd also be experiencing a tremendous increase in your energy, mental acuity, and positive focus. Continue with the program beyond that and you will significantly extend the amount of time you spend on this planet. No matter what your health condition or metabolic type, you are strongly advised to eliminate or restrict your grain and sugar intake, particularly processed grains and sugars. Eliminating grains is especially necessary for those who are Protein Metabolic Types. Carbohydrate and Mixed Types can get by with consuming a limited amount of grains. In all cases, any grains you do consume should be whole grains (95% of the grains consumed in the U.S. are processed, which strips them of what limited nutritional value they do have). Those with celiac disease and gluten-sensitivities have an obvious additional need to avoid grains, particularly gluten which is found in wheat, spelt, rye, barley, and oats. For those with diabetes and other signs of elevated insulin such as obesity, high blood pressure or high cholesterol, it is crucial to eliminate grains and sugars. Avoiding grains and sugars has been popularized by the recent low-carbohydrate dieting rage. Although low-carb dieting is effective for weight loss, the low-carb approach misses the fact that you need carbohydrates in your diet, to varying levels depending on your metabolic type. Every recipe in this book has been created around the principle that grains and sugars should be eliminated or severely restrict- ed, and the processed forms of both in particular. There are good carbohydrates that should compose most of your carbohydrate intake, and they are found mostly in high fiber vegetables that grow above the ground. Your body prefers these complex carbohydrates because they slow the release of simple carbohy- drates like glucose and decrease your insulin levels. Insulin is the fat-building hormone in the body; therefore, increases in insulin cause weight gain. On the other hand, there are \"troublesome\" carbohy- drates that you need to reduce or eliminate from your diet, and they are found in grains, sugars and sugary foods, as well as starchy vegetables like potatoes. These carbohydrates will increase your insulin levels and tend to promote weight gain and illness. With that important point in mind, let's take a look at some basic human physiology so you can begin to understand why grains and sugars should be avoided. You are What They Ate For over five hundred generations, humans have existed primarily on a diet of wild animals and vegetation. It was only with the advent of agriculture a mere 6,000 years ago\u2014an extraordi- 9DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM narily small period in evolutionary time\u2014that humans began ingesting large amounts of sugar and starch in the form of grains and potatoes in their diets. Indeed, nearly all of our genes were set before the advent of agriculture; so, in biological terms, our bodies are still those of hunter-gatherers. While the shift to agriculture produced other indisputable gains for man, societies where the transition from a primarily meat/vegetation diet to one high in grains show a reduced lifespan and stature, increases in infant mortality and infectious disease, and higher nutritional deficiencies. Keep in mind that these ancient societies used entirely unrefined and organic grains. Today over 90% of grains are highly processed, making the negative consequences of grains far worse. The physiology of contemporary humans has not changed much from our distant ancestors, and our bodies have never adapted to the excessive amount of carbohydrates from grains and sweets in our present-day diet. In fact, in a nation whose diet is still largely based on the severely misguided USDA Food Pyramid, which recommends an atrocious 6-11 servings of breads, cereals, rice and pasta per day, this surplus of insulin-spiking carbohydrates is the main reason for the overweight epidemic and the scourge of related chronic diseases like diabetes. It is primarily your body's response to the overindulgence of grain and sugars, not your intake of fat, which makes you fat. Consuming sugar also impairs your white blood cell function and thereby decreases your body's immune system, making you more vulnerable to disease. Your body has a limited capacity to store carbohydrates, but it can easily convert those excess carbohy- drates, via insulin, into body fat, which means the more excess carbohydrates, the more body fat. When a government recommends that its population consume 6-11 servings of grains per day, plus four servings of fruit (which is high in simple sugars), an overweight epidemic is the logical and inevitable result. The fact is that any meal or snack high in carbohydrates from grains or sweets generates a rapid rise in blood glucose. To adjust for this rise, your pancreas secretes the hormone insulin into the bloodstream, which lowers your blood sugar. Insulin is essentially a storage hormone, devel- oped over millions of years to help you store the excess calories from carbohydrates in the form of fat in the case of famine. Throughout most of our biological history, and certainly in many areas of the world today, there were frequent periods of mass starvation caused by droughts and other natural occurrences that depleted the availability of vegetation (containing the complex carbohy- drates that are the carbs you should eat) and therefore the game animals that relied on this vege- tation. The body gradually developed defenses against this starvation so it could convert any excess carbohydrates to fat so it could use its fat stores for energy over time. You are, in other words, walking around in a body well designed to pull you through potential starvation. The problem is, we live in a time and a place with the extreme opposite situation\u2014we don't experience times of famine and instead we have an overabundance of grains, starches and sweets, and food companies are marketing them endlessly to us. To make matters even worse, high insulin levels also lower two other important hormones\u2014 glucagon and growth hormone\u2014that are responsible for burning fat and sugar and promoting muscle development. In other words, insulin produced from consuming excess carbohydrates found in grains and sugars promotes fat, and then wards off your body's ability to lose that fat and build muscle! Additionally, insulin also causes hunger, and it's usually a hunger for sweets. As blood sugar 10 THE DANGERS OF GRAINS AND SUGARS increases following a carbohydrate meal, insulin is secreted to lower the blood sugar. The lowered blood sugar results in hunger, often only a couple of hours or less after the meal. If ignored long enough, the hunger turns into feeling ravenous, shaky, moody and ready to \"crash\" as a result of hypoglycemia or low blood sugars. In order to raise your blood sugars, your body will naturally crave high sugar foods like sweets or grains, which leads to a vicious roller coaster ride of high and low blood sugars. You progressively convert to a sugar and grain addict and this causes you to become increasingly fatter, fatigued, depressed and sick. But now back to the good news. You have this book, and it provides you with a practical solution. By eating according to your unique and specific biochemistry, you'll find the craving for these unhealthy but tempting foods disappears. If there are any emotional barriers you encounter when making the transition, you'll learn in Chapter 6 about a powerful psychological technique that is profoundly impressive in overcoming psychological resistance. Furthermore, you will have all the healthy recipes to put your insight into action for every day of the year. Beware the Unfamiliar Grain, Corn Most people can easily name the common grains such as rice, wheat, oats, barley, and rye, but forget that corn also belongs in that category, as they perceive corn to be a vegetable. Corn is a grain, and it has all the negative health impacts of a grain. According to recent research, the demise of certain Native American Tribes in earlier centuries can be mainly attributed to corn. Their eating patterns shifted away from the primarily meat and vegetation diet of a hunter-gatherer society to a homogenous diet based almost entirely on corn with the arrival of the Spanish. The research shows that the bones of the Native Americans during and after this transition show much higher evidence of anemia, dental cavities, osteoarthritis, infections and other health issues than those who lived prior to this transition. Corn is relatively high in sugar, which is one of the main reasons it's America's number one crop, consuming over 80 million acres of U.S. land and sneaking its way into an endless array of food (and other) products. In its unprocessed or \"whole\" state, corn offers negligible health benefits at best; sweet corn, for instance, contains vitamin C. However, you are far better off avoiding the corn's negative health impacts on your health and obtaining higher quantities of vitamin C and many other antioxidants from real vegetables such as broccoli and asparagus. You are best served by avoiding corn in its processed state. Food with labels containing corn derivatives such as corn syrup, fructose, high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, cornmeal, cornstarch, dextrose, monosodium glutamate, xanthan gum, and maltodextrin, have no place in your grocery cart. Corn sweeteners are actually now the most widely produced of all sweeteners, accounting for 55% of sweeteners on the market. This is primarily high fructose corn syrup, which is the domi- nant ingredient in soft drinks, fruit drinks, cookies, candies and other popular grocery store items. Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup increased from zero in 1966 to a whopping 62.6 pounds per person in 2001, and is a key culprit in the diabetes and overweight epidemic. There is one more \"hiding place\" for corn that you must be aware of: in your beef. Most of the beef you'll find in grocery stores, and virtually all the beef used in fast food and other restaurants, is from cattle that were force-fed diets high in corn. 11DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM There are two more factors you should know about corn. First, corn is only second to soybeans as the most genetically modified (GMO) crop in the U.S. GMOs, which were first introduced in 1995, are a potential disaster waiting to happen, as no studies have been done with humans to show what happens when genetically modified foods are consumed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has assumed that these modified foods are equivalent to the original foods, and therefore, does not require any studies to have them approved. This is despite the fact that: 1) this technology has never before existed in the history of the world, and 2) the United State's track record on genetically engineered safety is terrible. Second, as you can read in detail in Doug Kaufmann and Dr. David Holland's book, Infectious Diabetes, corn is one of the foods highest in mycotoxins (wheat and several other grains are high as well), which are toxins from fungus that can lead to cancer, heart disease, diabetes and a wide host of other serious diseases. Nevertheless, there is hope! One of the most profoundly important changes you can make immediately in your diet is to switch to consuming healthy meat. Atop this list is choosing nutritious and safe alternatives to corn-fed beef, such as grass-fed beef or grass-fed bison, which are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 and used in some of the recipes in this book. Sugar, The Nemesis To Optimal Health Most people are addicted to sugar, and along with grain addiction, the over-consumption of added sugars\u2014whether they are high-fructose corn syrup, fructose, glucose, dextrose, or the sucrose from sugarcane and sugar beets\u2014is one of the major health problems facing our nation today. For just a partial idea of the ill health effects of excess sugar consumption, consider that sugar has been cited as a contributing factor to: Overweight and obesity Immune system suppression, inviting infection and disease Premature aging Cancer of the breast, ovaries, prostate, and rectum Decreased absorption of calcium and magnesium Diabetes Fatigue Decreased energy and reduced ability to build muscle Heart disease Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis Osteoporosis Yeast infections Depression Dental decay and gum disease Sugars are simple carbohydrates processed by the body in the same manner as grains. That 12 THE DANGERS OF GRAINS AND SUGARS is, any excess sugars in the body are converted by insulin into fat\u2014and just like grains, we're consuming an enormous surfeit of sugar. In the past two decades in the U.S., sugar consumption has increased by over 30%. In fact, the average per-person sugar intake is now 175 pounds per year! That's 300,000 calories per year, or 800 calories per day, from sugar! This is asking for serious health trouble even by the ill-advised USDA standards, which states that the average American, who should be consuming about 2,000 calories per day, can eat up to 10 teaspoons of added sugars per day. The average American is consuming well over 3000 calories per day, including over 20 teaspoons of added sugars. The majority of these added sugars are coming from soft drinks, which the average American drinks an estimated 56 gallons of each year. That's an average of 600 cans of soda pop per year each! Just one can of this soda has about 10 teaspoons of sugar and 150 calories, along with 30 to 55 mg of caffeine. Soda also contains harmful additives including phosphoric acid, which can interfere with the body's ability to use calcium, leading to osteoporosis or softening of the teeth and bones. Phosphoric acid also neutralizes the hydrochloric acid in your stomach, which can interfere with digestion, making it difficult to absorb nutrients. Eliminating soft drinks from the American diet\u2014a distant but noble dream\u2014would alone vastly reduce the rate of obesity and add years to our average lifespan. Moreover, there are high-sugar culprits disguised as \"healthy\" by food contain anywhere from 1% to 40% of fruit juice but which all contain loads of sugar, usually high-fructose corn syrup. But even the sugars in 100% real fruit juice can quickly add up: real fruit juice, whether store-bought or freshly squeezed, has about eight full teaspoons of sugar per eight-ounce glass. This sugar is typically a fruit sugar called fructose, which is every bit as dangerous as the regular table sugar sucrose since it will also cause a major increase in insulin levels. This doesn't mean that you should avoid fruit, just fruit juice. When the fruit is intact and whole, its fiber will moderate the release of fructose and secondarily insulin into your bloodstream. However, if you are overweight, have high blood pressure or high blood sugar levels, you would be wise to avoid most fruits and just stick with vegetable carbohydrates until you have these prob- lems under control. This is especially true if you are a Protein Metabolic Type. Carbohydrate types are generally better designed to handle the carbohydrates in fruits, especially citrus fruits. On a different note, sugar substitutes such as saccharin (Sweet-N-Low), sucralose (Splenda) and aspartame (Equal and Nutrasweet) should be avoided. Their negative health effects can easily exceed the sugars they are replacing. Some scientists, for instance, believe aspartame might cause altered brain function and behavior changes. The FDA has also been inundated with consumer complaints about aspartame, including fibromyalgia symptoms, multiple sclerosis symptoms, dizziness, headaches, and menstrual problems. You can use the search engine on my site for fur- ther details on aspartame and its brand names like Nutrasweet. You should also avoid the latest sugar substitute rage, sucralose. First of all, few human studies have been published on the safety of sucralose. Second, in animal research studies, sucralose was shown to cause a decrease in the size of thymus glands, to cause liver and kidney enlargement, reduce growth rate, decrease red blood cell count, and decrease placenta and fetal body weights\u2014 and this is only a partial list. Sucralose also has the potential to contaminate your body with 13DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter pesticides, heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, and more, as it has been found to contain small amounts of these dangerous substances. Finally, if you are trying to lower your weight, there is no clear evidence that sucralose\u2014or any artificial sweetener\u2014is even useful in weight reduction. In fact, there is evidence that these substances may actually stimulate your appetite. For many people, sugar is an authentic addiction, akin to cigarette dependency. And it is affecting their health as severely as cigarettes would, if not more so. The real solution is not to keep hunting for ways to \"safely\" maintain the addiction, such as artificial sweeteners, which are kind of like the equivalent of \"Light\" and \"Ultra Light\" cigarettes\u2014that is, equally as devastating to your body. The solution is to overcome the addiction. Fortunately, you'll find that by adopting this dietary plan, including eating the foods meant for your metabolic type and utilizing the tools to overcome emotional barriers described later in this book, you won't have to \"fight\" the craving, because it will naturally disappear. This has been the case for thousands before you, and if you stick to the principles in this book, it will be the case with you. 14 THE DANGERS OF GRAINS AND SUGARS 3: Plant-Based Foods: Mercola's Guide to the Healthiest Mark Twain, when warned about the potential known health effects of smoking in his day, replied, \"Quitting smoking may indeed add ten years to my life, but then that's ten years without a cigarette.\" This is the same excuse that many people use for not abandoning baked goods, breakfast cereals, popcorn, fried foods, sweets, soft drinks and other deadly foods: \"Well I know it's bad for me and it's probably shortening my life, but it tastes so good and so it's making the life I am living so much better.\" What Twain might not have known about cigarettes, and what the average person may not be aware of with eating junk food, is that it is not only likely to cause disease and shorten their life, but it is decreasing their quality of life by decreasing their energy, mental focus, and happiness. That is, for that brief \"hit\" of, say, Coca-Cola, toasted bagels, or French fries\u2014just as with the brief hit of nicotine\u2014they are giving up both their quality of life right now and the length of their life later. If you often feel more tired than you should, or experience \"brain fogginess\" where it's hard to focus, or you often feel down if not downright depressed, eating unhealthy food could be a primary culprit. Are those states really worth a bag of potato chips or pretzels? Some of you may have an underlying fear that by converting to the truly healthy diet offered here, you will never again experience great-tasting food and it will instead be like chewing on tree bark. However, you'll quickly discover once you start trying the recipes in this book that they are delicious as well as nutritious. In fact, by eating according to your metabolic type, you will feel so much better that you will want to continue to eat the natural foods that your body is designed for. Nevertheless, if you still do experience cravings for unhealthy foods like sugar or grains after you begin selecting foods according to your metabolic type, you will have the emotional tools in Chapter 6 to overcome these barriers. Eat Your Veggies! There is no food group that is denser with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and flavonoids than the vegetable group. This is particularly true for the vegetables that grow above the ground. Vegetables provide the good carbohydrates you need, and much more. Those who are Protein Metabolic Types should ideally get most of their carbs from vegetables, with virtually none from grain or sugar-added foods. Those who are Carb Types should also ideally get most of their carbs from vegetables\u2014and they need more carbs in total, but can do well getting about 15% of their carbs from healthy, whole grains if they choose. Mixed Types, as the name implies, fall in the middle of these two. The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly after eating the food is broken down into glucose. Generally foods that are high in fiber tend to be low on the glycemic index, as fiber slows 15DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM the breakdown of sugars into the bloodstream. Because most vegetables are high in fiber, low on the glycemic index, and are packed with nutritional value, vegetables are an ideal way to meet your daily carbohydrate requirements. Vegetables contain the majority of the micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, fiber and phyto- chemicals) your body needs. However, there are essential macronutrients vegetables cannot provide sufficient quantities of, including protein with all eight essential amino acids found only in animal products, and certain fats such as omega-3 with EHA and DPA fatty acids. Vegetables also contain a host of essential nutrients that are not found or replicated in any other type of food, and certainly not in any pill or supplement. They contain phytochemicals, for instance, which are used by the body to repair and build healthy cells, organs and tissues, thereby increasing your immunity to disease and illness. They are also rich in fiber, which aids in digestion and also creates a feeling of being full. Advocates of high grain-consumption, such as the USDA, often cite grain's fiber content when pushing the \"need for grains,\" ignoring all its harmful effects. Vegetables are a far healthier choice than grains to obtain your fiber. In short, vegetables provide tremendous health benefits. Vegetables' health benefits include, but are by no means limited to: Helping you to prevent disease Aiding you in healing existing disease Optimizing your weight Preventing wrinkles and restoring your youthfulness Increasing your energy, mental clarity and focus by leaps and bounds Improving your emotional health, including helping to fight depression Helping you live longer What's more, vegetables can really taste incredible. My patients frequently tell me that soon after they stopped eating junk food, they stopped craving sugar and looked forward to eating vegetables and healthy protein. If you commit yourself to the dietary program according to your metabolic type as described in the \"Pulling it All Together\" section of this book, it's likely you'll have the same experience as many of my patients\u2014that sugar tastes \"sickeningly\" sweet and that you've grown to love the taste of nature's bounty. There are some important guidelines to consider in your vegetable selection, as not all vegetables are created equal: 1) Vegetables rich in color generally indicate that they are higher in vital nutrients than their pale counterparts. For example, dark green romaine lettuce, spinach or kale is much higher in nutrients than nearly white iceberg lettuce, which has virtually no nutritional value. Red onions are much higher in flavonoids and antioxidants than white or yellow onions. The same is true for red grapes versus green grapes, and red, yellow and purple bell peppers are higher in nutrients than green peppers and well worth the additional cost. There are some exceptions to this rule such as cauliflower, which is white but which is still a nutrient-dense vegetable. 16 PLANT-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST 2) For purposes of your health, pretend that potatoes are not a vegetable but a grain. That is because they are high in simple carbs and they act upon your body similar to grains and sugars, promoting weight gain and disease. This is true whether they are baked, mashed, boiled, or fried. Fried potatoes such as French fries are double trouble and you should avoid them like the plague. French fries are high in dangerous trans-fats, which are fats damaged by the heating process that contain a molecular conformation that causes heart disease and cancer. In addition, fried potatoes contain the carcinogenic substance acrylamide. Moreover, a Super Size French fry at McDonalds is 540 calories, 68 grams of carbohydrate, and 26 grams of fat\u2014enough carbs and fat for an entire day! You would have to run at a fast pace for over an hour straight just to break even. In summary, I would not feed French fries to a starving dog much less a human. 3) Limit your consumption of other root vegetables, such as beets and carrots, as they are higher in carbohydrates than above-ground vegetables. If you do eat them, eat them raw as cooking increases their glycemic index. 4) Organic produce is usually much higher in nutrients and you'll also find organic produce tastes better. Plus, organic farmers don't use chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides, all of which can harm your health. If you can't buy organic produce, don't let that stop you from buying produce at all, of course\u2014just make sure you remove some of the chemicals by soaking them for 10 minutes in a sink with water, vinegar and hydrogen peroxide, or in a vegetable wash found at most health food stores. 5) Focus on eating your vegetables raw. Some people find raw vegetables difficult to digest and will have to incorporate them slowly and in small amounts. The reason for eating raw veggies is there are valuable and highly perishable micronutrients that are damaged when you heat them. Recipes for raw foods, vegetable juicing, salads and cooked vegetable dishes have been provided in this book to make eating vegetables easy for you. Juicing Your Veggies Juicing continues to grow in popularity in the U.S. because it is a convenient and delicious way to consume raw vegetables. This book provides you tasty and nutritious juicing combinations, but you should also experiment to find out which vegetables you prefer with other vegetables. When it comes to juicing, though, the one tool that matters most is your equipment. If you are new to juicing you should first consider purchasing an inexpensive juicer or even a used juicer at a garage sale or on eBay. This will allow you to confirm that juicing is something you want to continue with. When you are certain you want to commit to juicing for the long-term, though, you'll want a higher quality machine. I compiled an extensive juicer comparison table evaluating the major brands and types of juicers. To see this table, go to Mercola.com and type in \"juicing\" in the search engine. Hands-down, the best juicer on the market in terms of value, durability, performance, and ease-of-use is the Omega 8002 Juicer. Beyond juicing, it is also designed for 17DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM mincing, chopping, and more, and while comparable juicers cost $800-$2,000, the Omega 8002 Juicer is a tremendous value at $260. I personally have used the Omega 8002 Juicer since 2000 and I love it. Limit the Legumes Legumes such as lentils and navy, pinto, kidney, and black-eyed peas have significantly high levels of carbohydrates that can increase insulin levels. Therefore, those who are overweight, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or diabetes should avoid or significantly restrict their legume intake. If you do not have insulin challenges, then legumes, in moderation, can be a nutritious food source as they are rich in both fiber and minerals. Legumes are also high in vegetable protein, but you should be aware that their protein is incomplete, as it does not contain all eight of the essential amino acids your body needs. Animal protein such as fish, meat, eggs, and dairy is the only source of complete protein and therefore vegetarians should consume some animal protein like dairy, non-toxic fish, or eggs to prevent protein deficiency. It is especially important for Protein Metabolic Types to consume adequate protein, as I have seen in my clinical practice Protein Types who developed serious illnesses from their vegetarian diets. Soy Untrue! Soybeans are another legume, but deserve their own special mention because of the extreme misperceptions of their supposed health value. There are a large number of companies seeking to profit from the alleged health benefits of soy, such as soy milk, powders, cheese, breakfast bars, cereals and nuts. The truth of the matter is that these products largely do more harm than good. \"But what about the link between soy and the low rates of breast, colon and prostate cancer among Asian people, whose diets tend to be high in soy?\" you may ask. Consider that Asians eat a diet that includes significantly higher quantities of vegetables and much lower quantities of processed foods, and a much better balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fat ratios. Asians as a whole are consuming a far healthier diet overall, which provides relative protection from the harmful effects of soy. It should also be noted that Asians eat a significant portion of soy in the recommended fermented form such as natto, amakaze, miso and tempeh, which nullifies the negative effects of soy. While an entire book will be available in spring 2004 on how soy harms your health, The Whole Soy Story by Dr. Kaayla Daniel, here are some essentials you should know: Soybeans are high in natural toxins, also known as \"antinutrients.\" This includes a large quantity of inhibitors that deter the enzymes needed for protein digestion. Further, these enzyme inhibitors are not entirely disabled during ordinary cooking. The result is extensive gastric distress and chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake, which can result in pancreat- ic impairment and cancer. Soybeans contain hemaglutinin, which causes red blood cells to clump together. Soybeans 18 PLANT-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST also have growth depressant substances. And while these substances are reduced in processing, they are not completely eliminated. Soy contains goitrogens, which frequently lead to depressed thyroid function. Most soybeans are genetically modified, and they contain one of the highest levels of pesticide contamination of all foods. Soybeans are very high in phytates, which prevent the absorption of minerals including calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc, all of which are co-factors for optimal biochemistry in the body. Eating meat reduces the mineral-blocking effects of these phytates, and so it is helpful if you do eat soy to also eat meat. Finally, in an effort to remove the antinutrients from soy, soybeans are taken through a series of chemical processes including acid washing in aluminum tanks. This leaches high levels of aluminum, a toxic heavy metal, into the final soy products. Many soy foods also have toxic levels of manganese. Soy formula has up to 80 times higher manganese than is found in human breast milk. There are additional concerns about soy if you are pregnant or intend to be, as nearly 20% of all infants are now fed soy formula. Visit the very popular and always-expanding article entitled \"Why Soy Can Damage Your Health\" on Mercola.com, which will link you to over twenty-five dif- ferent articles and their corresponding studies on the risks of soy, which far outweigh any benefits. Be Only Moderately Fruit-ful Fruits, while high in vitamins and antioxidants, are also higher in sugar content than vegetables. If you are trying to lose weight, or have high blood pressure or diabetes, it is wise to omit fruits from your diet or restrict yourself to eating a small handful of berries a day. This is especially true if you are a Protein Type with the above conditions as most fruit is not beneficial for Protein Types. One exception of this is coconut, which provides the high fat content Protein Types need. Carb Types tend to do much better with fruits, especially citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits, and can consume a moderate amount. In selecting fruit, berries such as blueberries, raspberries, lingonberries, bilberries, cranber- ries and black currants should be amongst your top choices because they have, relative to other fruits, a lower quantity of sugar while providing high vitamin C, dietary fiber, folic acid, and phytochemicals. They provide excellent protection against heart disease and cancer. They also can help prevent and treat vision problems. Amongst the best of all berries are blueberries. They are quite low in sugar compared to other fruits yet pack some of the most powerful antioxidant properties of all fruits and vegetables. In addition to preventing heart disease, cancer, and other diseases, they've been shown to slow the aging process, especially in the brain. (For an exceptional source of organic blueberries that taste 19DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter incredible and that you can get delivered to you year-round, check out the \"Recommended Ingredients and Products Locator\" in the Appendix.) On a final note, be especially careful about consuming hybrid fruits. Hybrids are foods altered by humans to \"improve\" upon them, and they therefore can't grow in nature. In the case of fruits, \"improve\" usually has meant, among other factors, increasing their sugar content so they taste even sweeter. Fruits that don't contain seeds (but naturally should) are, for example, hybrids. That means you should steer clear of seedless oranges, seedless watermelon, seedless grapes, and other produce labels that boast of being \"seedless.\" It almost always indicates they have even higher sugar content, which can impair your health. The High-Standing Coconut Coconut, the \"fruit\" of the palm tree, is an exceptionally nutritious food that offers many benefits including helping you fight and prevent disease, and helping you lose weight and keep it off. Coconut meat is a particularly smart choice for Protein Types, as it is high in protein. Islanders have long been prized coconuts for their preventive and curative powers over disease and illness, and this is primarily because they are rich in lauric acid, a proven antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal agent. Coconuts are high in saturated fat that, contrary to popular belief, is a necessary fat for opti- mal nutrition. There are three different types of saturated fats, and coconuts contain the healthiest type with medium-chain fatty acids that will actually help you lose weight while increasing health! The medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) abundant in coconuts are digested more easily and utilized differently by the body than other fats. Whereas other fats are stored in the body's cells, the MCFA in coconut oil is sent directly to the liver where it is immediately converted into ener- gy. So when you eat coconuts and coconut oil your body uses it immediately to make energy rather than store it as body fat. Because this quick and easy absorption puts less strain on the pancreas, liver and digestive system, the oil in coconuts \"heat up\" your metabolic system. Since the coconut oil actually speeds up metabolism, your body will burn more calories in a day\u2014this will contribute to weight loss, and you'll have more energy. Meanwhile, studies have shown the opposite for excessive omega-6 unsaturated fats such as canola, safflower, sunflower, corn, and vegetable oils: they can contribute to hypothyroidism and lower your metabolic rate. Coconuts are high in protein and low in carbs. They are also good sources of folic acid, all B vitamins, and minerals including calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Be Sane with Nuts Eating moderate amounts of nuts has been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. What is more, nuts are a good source of protein. With their high protein and fat content, they are helpful at curbing hunger, which is why they are the cuisine of choice on airlines. But go easy on the nuts, as\u2014except for walnuts\u2014they are high in omega-6 fats that can unbalance your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, which can have profound negative health consequences (you can visit my site for more information on this vitally important topic.) The 20 PLANT-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST high fat content of nuts is also, in my experience, an easy fuel for weight gain, so those with weight issues may want to avoid them. Walnuts, similar to flaxseeds, are relatively high in omega-3, an essential nutrient that most Americans are sorely lacking in their diet but that has a profound impact on keeping cholesterol levels in check, preventing heart disease and cancer, aiding in depression, and more. The best type of omega-3 fats, EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), are found in the oils in fish and are crucial to optimal health. DHA and EPA, for instance, are pivotal to preventing depression, schizophrenia, memory loss, and Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, the omega-3 in walnuts contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fat that helps prevent abnormal heart rhythms and has been shown to cut the risk of sudden cardiac death among people who have already suffered a heart attack. Furthermore, walnuts contain ellagic acid, an antimutagen, anticarcinogen, and cancer inhibitor. Other types of nuts like almonds and pecans, while high in omega-6, can still be good if used in moderation, as they also have heart disease- and cancer-preventing properties. Protein Types in particular can benefit from eating a few small handfuls a week, either within recipes or as a snack. Again, though, if you are trying to lose weight, rigidly restrict your consumption of fattening nuts\u2014at most, sprinkle them on salads or in recipes for enhancement. As for the ever-popular peanut (actually a legume, but nutritionally much closer to nuts), it is associated with reducing the risk of heart disease and is high in protein. But you must use be careful not to consume excessive amounts of peanuts, as they are loaded with omega-6 fats. Moreover, peanut crops can be contaminated with a carcinogenic mold toxin called aflatoxin, and they have the highest pesticide residues of any crop. If you want the health benefits of peanuts without the high level of risk, look for the \"Arrowhead Mills\" brand of organic peanut butter in stores. The peanuts they use are grown in New Mexico, where aflatoxin has not been reported as a problem due to the dry conditions, and their organic peanut butter is free of pesticides. Additionally, when you open the jar, you can pour off the oil that has settled on top of the peanut butter rather than stirring it in, which will lower the omega-6 content and further improve the vitally important omega-3:6 ratio. Selective Seeds As with nuts, seeds can offer myriad health benefits, but if you are overweight you should limit your seed consumption as they can contribute to weight gain. One prominent exception to the weight issue is flaxseed, which has been shown to promote weight loss, decrease cholesterol levels, and aid in digestion. Flaxseed can also lower the risk of heart attack and stroke by helping to keep the arteries free of plaque and cholesterol. Flaxseeds, which can be found in most health food stores, are exceptionally high in omega-3 with ALA, which enhances your immune system and protects against a variety of diseases. Please remember, however, that you still need the omega-3 with DHA and EPA, found only in fish oils. Flaxseeds can be ground in a coffee grinder or other types of grinders and used in a variety of recipes. Be cautious, though, about consuming flaxseed oil, as it is relatively unstable oil that most people don't seem to tolerate well. 21DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM Sesame, pumpkin and squash seeds are fair choices for snacking, but should be used in limited amounts as they are relatively high in omega-6 fats and will alter the omega-3:6 ratio. Additionally, those with weight issues should consume only very low amounts at best. Sesame seeds are high in protein, B vitamins, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorous and zinc. Sesame seeds, containing a variety of amino acids, are especially good for heart health and improving endurance. Tahini, a popular spread made from sesame seeds and used in several recipes in this book, can be found in most health food stores. Pumpkin and squash seeds are high in iron, phosphorous, fiber, and protein. They also contain high amounts of zinc that may offer some protection against the development of prostate cancer. You are far better off choosing the raw variety of pumpkin and squash seeds, as roasting seeds damages their delicate essential fatty acids. Fats that are damaged end up as the building blocks for hardening of your arteries. The Slickest Oils Besides grains and sugars, there is no category of food that the public has received more dangerous half-truths about than edible oils. An imperative piece of advice for you to follow is to limit the omega-6 fats and trans-fats in your diet. Trans-fats are primarily formed when vegetable oils are \"hydrogenated\" or \"partially hydrogenated,\" which means that the oil was heated as such high temperatures that it changed the structure of the molecule so that it is more stable at room temperature (at the expense of being harmful to the body.) So look for those words when you read ingredient labels and avoid those products. Unfortunately, trans-fats are found in most packaged processed foods, such as baked goods, cereals, cookies, crackers, soup mixes, frozen foods and fried foods like French fries, tortilla chips and doughnuts. Trans-fats lead to clogged arteries, heart disease, and because they lower the \"good\" cholesterol, they indirectly lead to high cholesterol. Fortunately, the danger of trans-fats is starting to receive widespread publicity, and in the near future it seems likely trans-fats will be widely recognized as a leading food toxin to shun in the mainstream mind. It's not soon enough, but the FDA has mandated that trans-fat content must be listed on all nutrition labels by 2006. A major health hazard of corn, safflower and the other unsaturated oils once pushed as \"heart healthy\" is that they are very high in omega-6 fatty acids. For quite some time, the American public was convinced that unsaturated oils were the darlings of a healthy diet, while oils high in saturated fats were the enemy of health. The \"evil\" saturated fats include: coconut oil, butter, and red meat. The history of this drastically incorrect perception is fascinating, and points directly to how government and the food industry can, largely in the quest for profit and power, harm the public health. This history, as well as extensive insight on why saturated fats are actually essential to your health, is covered well in the book Know Your Fats: The Complete Primer for Understanding the Nutrition of Fats, Oils and Cholesterol, by Mary Enig, Ph.D., the nation's leading expert on fats and oils. According to Enig, back in the early 1950s, and based only on very partial and inconclusive research, several government and other influential health organizations proposed that the conven- tional diet that included saturated fats from products like butter, meat and coconut oil was 22 PLANT-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST dangerous to the heart. Even at that time, though, many studies contradicted this assumption, and other nations whose diets had a saturated fat intake higher than Americans were not experiencing near the same rate of heart disease\u2014but this information was largely ignored. The food manufac- turers of margarine and corn, safflower, sunflower, and other monounsaturated oils took advantage of the misperception, equating saturated fat with pure evil while promoting their products as essential health foods. Wesson, for instance, promoted its cooking oil as good \"for your heart's sake.\" And as often happens with the onslaught of corporate marketing plus an inefficient government pushed by the special interests, myth became reality and the general public embraced the unsaturated and hydrogenated fats while shunning detrimental saturated fats. Of course, this turn towards the omega-6 oils and hydrogenated fats has contributed to the skyrocketing cases of heart disease and cancer, the number one and two killers in the U.S. respectively, and the overweight epidemic. Subsequently, I strongly encourage you to reduce or eliminate your intake of nearly all vegetable oils, including corn, safflower, sunflower, canola, sesame and soybean oil, and related products such as margarine and vegetable shortening. You most certainly want to avoid cooking with these oils, as they are damaged by heat and turn into trans-fat; the only oil that is not damaged by cooking at higher temperatures that I am aware of is coconut oil. In addition to the trans-fat issue, these vegetable oils may suppress your immune system; in fact, vegetable oils are emulsified with water and injected in patients who have had organ transplants specifically to suppress their immune system. They can also cause oxidative damage, interfere with normal thyroid function, and further disrupt most people's already skewed omega-6 to omega-3 ratios. Instead, the two best oils are coconut oil and extra-virgin olive oil. Olive oil is a monoun- saturated fat and contains major benefits because of its vitamin E and A, chlorophyll, magnesium, squalene and a host of other cardio-protective nutrients. Unlike other oils, olive oil possesses these health benefits because it is unrefined and unheated. Olive oil has also been shown to reduce the risk of some cancers and rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, olive oil is an omega-9 fatty acid and therefore it does not overload the body with omega-6 fats. However, a drawback to olive oil is that it is more susceptible to oxidative damage than coconut oil when cooked since it is a monounsat- urated fat. The best bet with olive oil is to use it on salads, and use coconut oil for your cooking. Coconut oil is abundantly nutritious and useful. It is a saturated fat that is better for cooking because it is stable at high temperatures. Coconut oil can also help you prevent and fight many diseases and illnesses. And, despite being a saturated fat, it can actually contribute to weight loss. Please refer to \"The High-Standing Coconut\" section earlier in this chapter, as all the benefits of eating coconut apply to coconut oil, as well. Coconut oil is particularly recommended for those with diabetes. It helps regulate blood sugar, thus lessening the effects of the disease, and it also raises metabolic rate causing the body to burn up more calories and thus promoting weight loss. Since 1980, researchers have also demon- strated the benefits of coconut oil with Crohn's Disease and IBS, acting as an anti-inflammatory in the digestive tract. Its antimicrobial properties also promote intestinal health by killing trouble- some microorganisms that may cause chronic inflammation. What is more, applying coconut oil topically is exceptional for keeping your skin young and healthy as it protects against destructive free-radical formation in the skin cells. I have even had 23DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM patients rub it on the bottom of their feet to eliminate hard dry skin there. Coconut oil can help to keep the skin from developing liver spots and other blemishes caused by aging and over expo- sure to sunlight, and it also helps to prevent sagging and wrinkling by keeping connective tissues strong and supple. In some cases it restores damaged or diseased skin. There is really only one catch with coconut oil\u2014you have to be very careful of the brand and type you choose. From brand to brand there is a very wide variance in quality due to factors such as the types of coconuts used, the manufacturing process employed to make the oil, and more, which will have a major impact on its healthiness and effectiveness. Your coconut oil should meet all of these standards: Certified organic, USDA standards No refining No chemicals added No bleaching No deodorization No hydrogenation Non-GMO From traditional palms only\u2014no hybrid varieties From fresh coconuts, not the dried \"copra\" used in most coconut oils Low-level heated only so it does not damage nutrients If you can't find high-quality virgin coconut oils meeting these standards in your local health food stores, check out Mercola.com, as I have extensively researched this subject and I have found an excellent brand meeting all of the standards above that can be shipped directly to you. Finally, it is worth repeating that the excellent health benefits of coconut oil can also be achieved through eating fresh raw coconuts, as covered earlier. Bent on Fermented Foods Traditionally fermented foods\u2014a category that can include both plant- and animal-based foods, which is why this section bridges this chapter and the next\u2014are a must in any healthy diet. Food fermentation is an ancient preparation and preservation technique produced through the break- down of carbohydrates and proteins by microorganisms such as bacteria, yeasts and molds, and it makes foods taste delicious. Even more importantly, fermented foods are beneficial to overall health because they are probiotics, meaning they promote the growth of friendly intestinal bacte- ria, therefore aiding digestion and supporting immune function. This includes an increase in B vitamins (even vitamin B12), omega-3 fatty acids, digestive enzymes, lactase and lactic acid, and other immune chemicals that fight off harmful bacteria and even cancer cells. Fermented foods are so important, in fact, that they are a standard part of my dietary prescription to my patients. It is important, though, to understand and beware the big difference between healthy fermented foods versus the commercially processed \"imposter\" versions. Fermentation is an incon- sistent process\u2014almost more of an art than a science\u2014so commercial food processors developed 24 PLANT-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST techniques to help standardize more consistent yields. Technically, anything that is allowed to sit at room temperature in a salt solution to allow healthy bacteria to culture is fermented, but that's where the similarity ends, as each type of fermented food has unique requirements and production methods. Refrigeration, high-heat pasteurization and vinegar's acidic pH all slow or halt the fer- mentation and enzymatic processes. \"If you leave a jar of pickles that is still fermenting at room temperature on the kitchen counter,\" explains Richard Henschel of Pickle Packers International, \"they will continue to ferment and produce carbon-dioxide, possibly blowing off the lid or exploding the jar\u2014\" which is why, of course, all \"shelf-stable\" pickles are pasteurized. It is probably not surprising that our culture has traded many of the benefits of these healthy foods for the convenience of mass-produced pickles and other cultured foods. Some olives, such as most canned California-style black olives, for instance, are not generally fermented, but are simply treated with lye to remove the bitterness, packed in salt and canned. Olive producers can now hold olives in salt-free brines by using an acidic solution of lactic acid, acetic acid, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, a long way off from the old time natural lactic-acid fermenting method of salt alone. Some pickles, meanwhile, are simply packed in salt, vinegar and pasteurized. Most yogurts are so laden with sugar that they are little more than puddings. Unfortunately, these modern techniques effectively kill off all the lactic acid-producing bacteria and short-circuit their important and traditional contribution to intestinal and overall health. You can still find some healthy traditional varieties of \"lacto-fermented\" (meaning the lactic acid producing abilities are intact) foods, however. The stronger-flavored, traditional Greek olives you are most likely to find on olive bars are not lye-treated and are still alive with active cultures. Generally so are the barrel-fresh pickles made in local delis every few days. But to be sure you are getting the great health benefits of these active, fermentation cultures, you should commit to routinely making lacto-fermented foods on your own. Olives, sauerkraut, miso, and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche are just some of the fermented recipes and ingredients you can find and easily make in Part Two of this book. If you are seeking a highly convenient way to get the full health value of lacto-fermented foods, you should also consider a top-quality fermented food \"kit.\" While these are quite popular in other parts of the world where the exceptional nutritional value of traditional fermented foods are well understood, they are still difficult to find in North America. But I have found a premier- quality \"Kefir Starter\" kit and \"Culture Starter\" kit that you can read more about in the \"Recommended Ingredients and Product Locator\" in the Appendix and conveniently order through the \"Recommended Products\" section of Mercola.com. Kefir, as you will read more about in the Dairy section of the next chapter, is one of the healthiest and delicious forms of lacto-fer- mented foods when made properly. Its taste and texture can best be compared to a more drinkable form of yogurt, and the Kefir Starter product makes creating it almost ridiculously simple. The \"Culture Starter\" product, meanwhile, is a very easy way to make cultured vegetables and even sour cream (i.e., traditionally fermented foods, not the unhealthy \"imposter\" versions on almost all grocery store shelves). Most fermented food kits like these are very economical; one box of the Kefir Starter kit, for instance, can make over 40 gallons of healthy kefir! 25DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter 4: Animal-Based Foods: Mercola's Guide to the Healthiest Worth the Eat Everyone\u2014all metabolic types\u2014need good protein. Carb Types need some, Mixed Types need more, and Protein Types need considerably more, as you'll learn in Chapter 5. The best source of protein is meat. Does this mean vegetarians shouldn't be vegetarians? No, but if you are a vegetar- ian, be sure to get include protein from dairy, eggs and fish, as only animal proteins provide all the essential amino acids and micronutrients your body requires to function at its highest level. In order to fight and avoid disease, increase energy, and live longer, choosing the right type of meat is critical. It is all too easy to opt for the extreme convenience of heading to your local grocery store for their super-value-priced beef, chicken, or turkey, but this convenience is one of the most severe health mistakes you can make; it is much like building a house from sticks\u2014sure they are cheap and easy to find, but you'll pay for it many, many times over in the end. Perhaps more than any other type of food group, it is crucial to investigate how the meat you eat was raised. Let's start with the most popular meat, the beef you'll find in most grocery stores and served in almost all restaurants. The cattle slaughtered for this beef are, hands down, the unhealthiest creatures on earth. Their natural, biological diet is grass, but in order to raise more of them in a confined space, fatten them up to levels far higher than is natural, and get them to market much quicker, they are fed an unnatural diet of corn and other grains. Cows have a difficult time digest- ing grains as their physiology is designed for grass, and many would get sick and quickly die due to an overgrowth of deadly bacteria in their stomach that results from the grain they were never designed to eat. The factory farms therefore administer substantial amounts of antibiotics to pre- vent this. Long-term, high-dose antibiotic use in cattle (and in people who eat the antibiotic-laden meat) contributes to the formation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or \"superbugs,\" which is a frightening problem indeed. There is still more: the giant agribusiness corporations like to get the cattle to market even quicker than this artificial grain diet enables, because it means even more profit, and so these cattle are also fed steroids. Furthermore, the grains they are fed are laced with pesticides and herbicides, and are genetically modified. What this all means is, with every juicy bite of a typical hamburger or steak, you are also eating an artificial concoction of vaccines, steroids, pesticides, herbicides, and GMO grains. Even worse, cattle's unhealthy grain diet, high in omega- 6, strips beef of much of its nutritional value, including depleting the omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) that you require to fight cancer and many other diseases. Fortunately, there are a variety of healthy and delicious red meats available, such as bison and grass-fed beef, but before delving into those, let's address a couple of myths. As mentioned previously, the saturated fat associated with red meat is not \"evil.\" As top 27DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM researchers, including Linus Pauling, Russell Smith, George Mann, John Yudkin, Abram Hoffer and Mary Enig have pointed out, your body actually requires moderate levels of saturated fat to protect the arteries, process calcium, stimulate the immune system, and add structural stability to the cell and intestinal walls. Dr. Enig, author of Know Your Fats: The Complete Primer for Understanding the Nutrition of Fats, Oils and Cholesterol, cites study after study supporting the contention that saturated fats are not harmful but, instead, it is most vegetable oils that are. One of the contributors to the misconception that red meat is unhealthy was a study published in 1970 that reported that processed red meat, such as cold cuts, and charred red meat was harmful to health. But then, any sort of processed meat or meat that is black and crusty is not healthy, especially when it is raised in an unhealthy manner described above. To put the myths of saturated fat and red meat to rest once and for all, consider this: populations that eat a diet rich in fresh, natural red meat show far lower levels of high cholesterol and cancer, among other diseases. For much more information, including sources of the research, just type in \"saturated fats\" on the search engine of Mercola.com. In terms of the red meats you can eat with confidence, grass-fed bison takes first prize as an outstanding health value plus what most people agree is an incredible taste. Meanwhile, bison is high in protein while containing fewer calories than an equivalent amount of skinless chicken or turkey. Bison is increasing in popularity here in the U.S. for obvious reasons, and so you may also be able to find it in finer grocery stores or health food stores, or you can find a great source for bison on Mercola.com. Ostrich is an increasingly popular red meat that runs a close second in terms of taste and nutritional value, as it is also high in protein but has fewer calories than chicken and turkey. Although the big bird is a red meat, it tastes just like chicken and you can use it in place of beef or dark chicken meat in any recipe. (Note: In the Bible, in Leviticus 11, ostrich is mentioned as one on a long list of animals that should not be consumed. While it does not explain why, and suggested explanations from cler- gy vary widely, it may refer to the fact that the wild ostrich's diet was unknown. Blackwing ostrich\u2014the brand of ostrich I recommend\u2014are fed on a diet primarily of the very healthy alfalfa, and free-range farmed in conditions far cleaner and healthier than the chicken, turkey and other meat commonly found in grocery stores. From a clinical perspective, I can highly recommend their ostrich as a very healthy meat. However, I personally believe the Bible is God's inherent word, including the Old Testament, so I choose to avoid eating ostrich and instead choose the equally healthy and delicious bison, and wanted to make sure others who may be concerned by this were aware, too.) Another great source of wholesome protein is grass-fed beef. Because it is raised on the cattle's proper diet of grass, it is leaner than grain-fed beef. While the flavor is different than the fatty grain-fed beef many are used to, many of my patients come to prefer the taste of this lean grass-fed beef. With beef labeled as \"grass-fed,\" though, you have to be careful as the cattle may only be \"finished\" on a diet of grass but fed grains for a majority of their lives. Make sure the grass-fed beef you choose is labeled as 100% grass-fed, and antibiotic-free. As a final point, lamb meat, though higher in fat than the meats previously listed, is also a healthy red meat option. With lamb and all other meats, you should ideally choose a grass-fed variety free of antibiotics, steroids, 28 ANIMAL-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST and other chemicals. I personally buy my lamb from the discount chain Costco because it is raised in Australia on green pastures of grass. Meanwhile, the conventional white meats like chicken are not much better than the typical red meats found in grocery stores. Most store-bought chickens are raised in conditions where they can barely move throughout their entire lives. These inhumane conditions are not only heartrend- ing, but also very unhealthy as they result in diseased chickens that are then given large doses of antibiotics. The birds are also raised on growth hormones to get them to market faster, and injected with moisturizing agents to make them taste \"juicy.\" Furthermore, the chickens' diet consists of grains that are genetically modified and high in pesticides and herbicides. The best white meats are free-range and certified organic chicken and turkey that contain no antibiotics, hormones or other chemicals. Turkey of this type can still be exceedingly expen- sive as it is more difficult to find, but free-range organic chicken is becoming quite popular and more affordable. Wild game, such as venison, elk, rabbit, pheasant and quail, is another class of healthy meat to consider. Obviously, because they are wild, they are raised on their natural diets and have no artificial anything added. One drawback, though, is that there have been several cases of Mad Cow Disease reported in several types of wild game animals, particularly elk, but statistically your chances are still minute in encountering this problem. The other drawback is that many Americans are not accustomed to the \"wild\" taste of wild game. If you love the taste of \"typical\" beef and chicken, your best bets are the grass-fed bison and free-ranged chicken described above, which you'll find taste even better. Something Fishy Going On Fifty years ago, fish was probably the healthiest meat you could eat, as it is an exceptional protein source with the omega 3 fats DHA and EPA. Sadly in the last 50 years, the oceans and lakes have become polluted with hundreds of millions of tons of mercury primarily from burning coal for electricity. The mercury then bio-accumulates in the fish and makes eating fish a game of Russian roulette. Therefore, my best advice in descending order is: 1) Avoid eating any fish unless you know it has been laboratory-tested and proven to be free from mercury and other toxins 2) If you do eat fish that you are not sure has been laboratory-tested and proven to be free of toxins, at least choose from among the following six safest fish: Wild Pacific Salmon Tilapia Croaker Sardines Haddock Summer Flounder 29DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM 3) Eat fish sustainably harvested from the wild (such as the toxin-free Vital Choice salmon I discuss below), not \"farm-raised.\" Because it is economical to fish farmers, farm-raised fish are fed grains like corn\u2014obviously not their natural diet, as you don't see many fish swim- ming through Iowa's cornfields. These grains do not form the beneficial fatty acids DHA and EPA that are such an important reason to eat clean fish. Furthermore, farm-raised fish may also be exposed to tremendously high pesticide levels resulting from the run-off of nearby agricultural crops that are often heavily sprayed. For the past 15 years, nutrition experts including myself, scientists, health organizations and the FDA have issued particular warnings against consumption of the larger fish like tuna, bass, halibut, swordfish, and marlin, which are higher on the food chain and therefore show the highest concentrations of mercury. In addition, many health experts, myself included, are now warning against any type of fish, as nearly all have toxic levels of mercury. In my own clinic, for example, we find many patients have high levels of mercury in their system, and we advise them to stop eating all fish except for those proven via laboratory testing to be safe. When they follow this advice I see a considerable reduction of their mercury levels on their laboratory analysis. There are other major causes of mercury toxicity, such as silver dental fillings and vaccines, but the primary cause is now fish. It is very likely that an enormous number of Americans\u2014and those from any country where fish is a routine meal\u2014have dangerous levels of mercury in their system. The problem is, it's tasteless in fish, and does not \"show itself\" until it wreaks outright havoc on people's health. Mercury is easily absorbed and stubbornly retained by the body, and can result in damage to your brain and kidneys. Trace amounts of mercury in the system have been linked to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism and several other neurological disorders. Fish consumption is particularly hazardous to pregnant women and children as the mercury can cause birth defects and harm the sensitive physiology of children. Time for the good news! There are still some sources of fish that are safe from mercury and other toxins. Through independent laboratory testing, my team and I discovered one such source of wild Alaskan salmon, which you can find out more about and order through Mercola.com. Increasingly, I suspect health food stores will also be searching for and offering fish proven to be safe from mercury and other toxins, so you can also check with them. Again, your best bet is to ensure the fish has been lab-tested and shown safe, and your second best option is to at least stick to one of the six fish on the list above. Finally, though it's not a delicious meal option like mercury-free salmon, a convenient way to obtain the omega-3 with DHA and EPA fatty acids that your body needs is with a safe, purified fish oil, which I discuss thoroughly in Chapter 7. The Great Egg Surprise Eggs are one of the most nutritious foods on the planet, especially when consumed in their raw state. Some of you are now either recalling images of Sylvester Stallone in Rocky, or simply grimacing at the thought. But read on to understand why raw eggs are so healthy, and much safer than you might think. 30 ANIMAL-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST Eggs, while being one of the best sources of good protein and fat, are also one of the foods that many people are allergic to. However, uncooked eggs have significantly lower allergic responses. This is because heating the egg protein actually changes its structural composition, and this distortion can easily lead to an egg allergy. The typical concern about eating raw eggs is a fear of salmonella. But the risk of contracting salmonella from raw eggs is actually incredibly low. A recent study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually, only 2.3 million of them are contaminated with salmonella. The translation is that only one in every 30,000 eggs is contaminated, which means that you are more likely to die in an airplane crash than contracting salmonella from raw eggs. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions on how to purchase the healthiest eggs possible. Foremost, remember that healthy eggs come from healthy chickens, and unhealthy eggs from unhealthy chickens. Whether you eat your eggs raw or cooked, try to buy free-range organ- ically fed, omega-3 enhanced eggs, which may be available in supermarkets, health food stores, or from local chicken farmers. Keep in mind that it is the conditions of commercial hens that are fed unclean diets and raised in small cramped cages where disease can easily spread. This makes the average supermarket eggs more likely to be infected with salmonella than eggs produced under healthy conditions. The following are additional steps to select healthy eggs: 3 Steps To Ensure Your Eggs Are Safe 1) If you are getting your eggs fresh and un-refrigerated it is best to keep them on the counter at room temperature. (This will not work however if the eggs have already been refrigerated.) It is interesting to note that people do not refrigerate eggs in most other coun- tries. One of the main reasons for keeping eggs at room temperature is that refrigeration causes slight damage to the egg protein. 2) If there is a crack in the shell, don't eat it. You can easily check for this by immersing the egg in a pan of cool, salted water. If the egg emits a tiny stream of bubbles, don't consume it, as the shell is porous. 3) Crack the egg open. A healthy egg has no foul odor, the egg white is gel-like (not watery), and a healthy egg yolk is convex and firm (not runny or bursts easily). If the egg does not have these characteristics, throw it away. It is important to note that in the rare event that you do contract salmonella poisoning, you may feel sick and have loose stools, but this infection is easily treated by using high-quality probiotics that have plenty of good bacteria (discussed in detail in Chapter 7). You can take a one tablespoon of probiotics every 30 minutes until you start to feel better, and most people improve within a few hours. Another concern is that raw egg whites contain a glycoprotein called avidin that is very effective at blocking biotin, one of the B vitamins, leading to a possible biotin deficiency. The 31DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM click here to subscribe to the free mercola.com newsletter solution to this is to consume eggs in their whole form (both egg yolks and whites) as the egg yolks contain high amounts of biotin to counteract avidin. I've discovered a number of ways to make eating raw eggs enjoyable. You can mix them into any vegetable juice recipes you create. When you whip them up like a meringue, most people do not object to the texture, especially if there is a flavor added. You'll also find that by mixing flavorings like butterscotch or vanilla extracts with the eggs, and then adding raw milk or cream, you can create a delicious eggnog, and then you'll actually enjoy and eagerly anticipate the treat. Really! I have this eggnog for breakfast every day and I love it. The Dairy Truth The milk that is sold in grocery stores is not good for you, despite the onslaught of the National Dairy Council's \"Got Milk?\" marketing campaign with all their cute celebrity milk mustaches. That's because milk is literally processed to death by with pasteurization, which heats it at such high temperatures that it destroys microorganisms, good bacteria, live enzymes, vitamins and the delicate three-dimensional structure of the milk proteins. Conventional milk is also a problem because it comes from cows fed the unnatural diets of grain and is frequently injected with antibi- otics and growth hormones to increase their milk production. Pasteurization is a case of throwing out many babies with the bath water. This method of heating milk was first employed in the 1920s to kill germs leading to tuberculosis and other diseases linked to unclean production methods prevalent at the time. Unfortunately, milk pasteur- ization has many negative side effects: Kills beneficial enzymes including phosphatase, which allows the body to absorb calcium from the milk Destroys colloidal minerals, which are essential to absorb nutrients the milk would otherwise provide Precipitates minerals that cannot be absorbed by the body, contributing to osteoporosis Precipitates sugars that cannot be digested and fats that are toxic Destroys beneficial bacteria and lactic acids that help to protect your body against disease Diminishes the cortisone-like factor in the milk that would otherwise help combat allergies Destroys vitamins B12 and B6 in the milk Promotes other pathogens in the milk Contributes to allergies, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, tooth decay, colic, disorders of the female reproductive system, and weakened immune systems Milk pasteurization is a product of a bygone era, when controls were not in place for ensuring clean conditions for the cows, but the improved sanitation practices of the modern dairy industry have made pasteurization unnecessary. The alternative is raw, organic, grass-fed milk. This is milk straight from the udders of grass-fed cows raised on their natural diets with no hormones. Raw milk is rich in glycol-sphin- golipids (fats that aid in digestion) and conjugated linolenic acid (CLA), another type of fat that 32 ANIMAL-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST protects against cancer. Because it comes from grass-fed cows, it is rich in omega-3, and far richer than store-bought milk in the vitamins like A and D. Additionally, if infants are weaned from breast milk to raw cow (or goat's) milk, and they avoid fruit juice, most grains and sugars, there is a strong likelihood that they will avoid dental cavities. Raw milk is, however, still illegal in many U.S. states. Why? Because pasteurization became mandatory law when cows were raised in unclean conditions. More so, it's because the National Dairy Council has a very powerful lobbying arm in Washington, D.C. and, because the powerful corporations they represent are entirely built around pasteurization, and they don't want raw milk to become legal again\u2014if the truth gets out too far, after all, so goes their profits. Fortunately, organizations like the Weston A. Price Foundation with their \"Campaign for Real Milk\" have been helping to promote the legalization of raw milk. As of this writing raw milk sales through cowshare programs are allowed in Alaska, Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. All other states currently prohibit the sale of raw milk. The catch is, with the noteworthy exception of California, where it can be sold legally in stores, in most of these states you have to either find a small farmer who sells it, or join a cowshare program. With cowshare programs, you become part owner of a cow and, on a routine basis, visit a specified location to pick up your share of raw milk. I'm a member of one such cowshare program in the Chicago area, and if you live in the Chicago area you can find out more by typing \"raw milk\" in the Mercola.com search engine. If you live in any other area, the best way to begin your search for raw milk and raw milk products is to visit the \"Campaign for Real Milk\" website at RealMilk.com. They list raw milk contacts in every state and also provide further exceptional insights on the issues and benefits of raw milk. Other beneficial dairy products are unpasteurized butter, kefir, yogurt, and cheese from grass-fed cows. The beneficial bacterial found in yogurt and kefir is excellent for enhancing the digestive and immune system, but since yogurt and kefir found in most grocery stores has the same problems as pasteurized milk, it is best to make your own yogurt or kefir from raw milk. Even though it is an ancient health food, many people today may not be familiar with kefir\u2014 but they should be. Traditionally lacto-fermented foods are an essential part of any diet as noted in the previous chapter (also see the recipes in \"Raw, Sprouted and Fermented Foods\" in Chapter 12), and kefir is among the most exceptional of such fermented foods. Meaning \"feel good\" in Turkish, kefir is a cultured, enzyme-rich food filled with friendly microorganisms that will help balance your \"inner ecosystem\" and dramatically improve your immune system. Kefir's tart, refreshing flavor is similar to a drinking-style yogurt, but in addition to the gut-friendly probiotics found in yogurt, kefir contains highly beneficial yeast. When used regularly, the naturally occurring bacteria and yeast in kefir combine symbiotically to replenish the intestinal flora and provide you major protection against illness. Furthermore, those who have a dairy allergy or intolerance may be able to tolerate kefir as the fermentation process breaks down the lactose sugars in the milk and makes it much easier to digest. 33DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM Among its many restorative powers, kefir will: Provide supplemental nourishment for pregnant and nursing women Contribute to a healthy immune system and help fortify patients suffering from AIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, herpes, and cancer Promote a tranquilizing effect on the nervous system and benefit many who suffer from sleep disorders, depression, and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) Help relieve all intestinal disorders, promote bowel movement, reduce flatulence, and create a healthier digestive system... kefir is an absolute must after the use of antibiotics to restore balance to the digestive tract Curb unhealthy food cravings by making the body more nourished and balanced While you can find prepared kefir in some grocery stores, it bears repeating that you should use great caution with these brands. They are usually prepared with pasteurized milk and possibly other health-defeating processes and additional ingredients. Instead, I strongly urge you to use a \"kefir kit\" to quickly and easily make your own healthy kefir. I suspect such kits will be increasingly easy to find as word of this tremendous fermented health food spreads, but right now there is one kefir kit I highly recommend\u2014the \"Kefir Starter\" by Body Ecology. You simply mix one packet of their starter to milk (again I recommend raw milk) or the juice of a young coconut and it's ready to go! You can find out more about this Kefir Starter and order through the \"Recommended Products\" section of Mercola.com, or ask your local health food store if they carry it. And so finally, what about the dairy product so beloved in Western culture\u2014cheese? Well, cheese made from conventional milk has all the problems with contamination that milk does, so if you eat cheese it is important to at least eat organic grass-fed cheese. Best of all, though, is raw milk cheese from organic grass-fed cows. The good news is that raw milk cheese is regulated dif- ferently than raw milk and is therefore relatively easier to find in health food stores. I strongly encourage you to check out the \"Recommended Products\" section of Mercola.com, though, as after much searching I have found an exceptional farm source for raw milk and organic grass-fed cheeses that will ship directly to you. They offer a wide choice of cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella, feta, brick and many more), and not only are they healthy, but they taste absolutely incredible! 34 ANIMAL-BASED FOODS: MERCOLA'S GUIDE TO THE HEALTHIEST 5: The Dietary Key: Eat According to Your Metabolic Type There is no one diet that is right for everyone. But there is a diet that is perfect for you. That means there is an ideal balance of food macronutrients\u2014proteins, carbohydrates, fats\u2014which you should consume for your specific biochemistry, as you'll learn in this chapter. Once you discover your metabolic type and follow its corresponding dietary principles, you will experience noticeable improvements with your body and mind, just as my patients experience. If you are overweight, you will lose weight while feeling satisfied with eating, and you'll actually want to continue with the program (versus having to force yourself to, as with other diets). If you are an athlete, you will experience a major increase in all aspects of your game, including stamina, strength, balance, and concentration, and this increase will continue as you stick with the program. If you have a chronic disease, you will likely be addressing some of the underlying nutritional caus- es of your disorder, and so you will also notice an improvement in your symptoms. While most of the diets that are currently popular are not centered carefully on maximizing health and prolonging life as my plan is, some do indeed at least effectively reduce weight\u2014for some people. That is, if the diet is appropriate for their metabolic types. Have you ever wondered why two people can go on the same weight-loss diet and one loses weight (at least temporarily) while the other remains the same or gains weight? It is because people have different nutritional needs based on their individual biochemistry. If you are a Protein Type, for example, nutrients act very differently in your body than they do in a Carb Type. As the saying goes, one man's food can be another man's poison. While medical practitioners and patients alike have been calling metabolic typing \"revolu- tionary\" and \"the missing piece\" in achieving optimal individualized nutrition, it is really just based on pure commonsense, as you'll learn below. You're an Individual, You Need an Individualized Diet Look around. You are unique. It's indisputable. Nobody looks exactly like you, and nobody ever has. Nobody speaks exactly like you, has the same gestures you do, or shares your fingerprints. No one thinks or feels exactly like you, either. So why do all the diets out there treat us like what's inside each of us is identical to what's inside everyone else? The one-size-fits-all approach to dieting is wrong because each of us is unique. These metabolic differences are evident when we examine how people react differently to various amounts of protein, fat and carbs in their diets. Everyone has specific macronutritional needs that ranges from those who need a very high level of carbohydrates in their diet and a relatively low level of protein and fat (Carb Type), to those who need a very high level of protein and fat and a 35DR MERCOLA'S TOTAL HEALTH COOKBOOK & PROGRAM "}
