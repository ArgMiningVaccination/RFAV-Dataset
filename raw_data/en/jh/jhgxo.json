Most Helpful Reviews Best Detox Complete Detox is a great product that I have recommended to many of my friends that are current users. It has made me feel like a new person. I feel lighter, younger, and healthier. I have also noticed that my seasonal allergies and sinuses are under control now that I am using Complete Detox. I was worried that this product would make my stomach cramp and I would stay in the restroom due to me not having a gallbladder, but it doesn't make your stomach cramp or make you feel weird. I wish I would have discovered this product sooner. I am so happy with this product cant wait to get some more I am so happy with this product cant wait to get some more. I started feeling cleaner after the first few hours using this stuff. You can really feel a difference. After two weeks I feel much healthier and cleaner. I don't have a way to test my blood for toxins or look into my colon, but I know I have a clean sensation now after using this for two weeks I feel much healthier and like I have been cleansed from impurities. I have to go by the sensation I feel but I recommend this product to anyone needing to revive themselves and get back into shape, this really seems to be a beneficial product to staying healthy and feeling healthy Very Satisfied I'm on the second week of this Detox and feeling better than ever. Now I feel more energitic and I can feel that I am shedding the extra pounds. One thing I love about it is that it does not have some of the harsh chemicals which completely upsets my stomach like some other products I had. It is gentle. I'll definitely use this product regularly. Clean Your Body Out You may be thinking to yourself that the damage that you have already done to your body is irreversible and there is nothing that you can do to help clean your body out, but you would be completely wrong because if you're looking at buying this Complete Detox you will be getting the nicest cleanse of your body out there on the market and there's only premium ingredients in these capsules so you wont have to worry about utting even more toxic chemicals inside of you. I felt ten times better after a few weeks of using this product. I was feeling fatigue & drained. This product helped me! Very often, I have to stay up late working under the pressure of project deadlines. In the past, I used to feel fatigue and dizziness all the time. The more fatigue I felt, the less efficient I could work. The less efficient I could work, the more pressure I would have. Even my acnes were out of control. I know I was not quite myself, but I just couldnt pin point an ailment. I came across this product and decided to give it a try. The first thing I felt that is the clarity in thinking process and more energetic. When I can think more clearly and feel more energetic, I can do much more than I used to. When I am in charge of my projects, instead of the other way around, I feel more relaxed. After a month or so, my acne also started to disappear. I am not sure if that is because this product was able to clean the inside of my body or it is because I am feeling more relaxed by this product. But either way, I am a fan!! I would recommend this project to anyone who is a busy young professional or anybody who has a super tight schedule and demand for peak performances. Works great! Starting out the New Year, I wanted to do a little something more for my health. I am big into all natural supplements and herbs, and I found just what I needed in this product. I already take a vitamin C and Echinacea every day, but this product has boosted my immune system even more. I wanted to lose just a little weight as well, and this Complete Detox product has helped me to do just that. I don't feel as tired during the day, and my allergies have come under control more than just with the over the counter medicine I was taking. I feel better overall. If anyone is looking for an all natural detox product, then I would highly recommend Complete Detox. Very helpful detox support I have been trying to detox from sugar overload after the holidays, and this product has been a great herbal support. I usually experience headaches and mood swings when detoxing from sugar, but these symptoms have been less extreme than usual. Also, the information included with the bottle has been very useful, all the herbs in the formula are listed and their common uses are described. Customer service also has been available for questions via email. I will continue to use Complete Detox as it seems gentle enough for long term detox support. it's a good detox this worked well for me and it's a quick detox. what i liked about this product opposed to other detox pills is that it didn't give me that urgency feeling to go. i didn't experience any stomach cramps. after i was done with the bottle, i did feel much less bloated. please keep in mind i also ate clean, kept my sodium down, and worked out. great! This is my first time taking cleanse pills, I was apprehensive, but this has been great so far! It took about a week for me to feel a difference, and I definitely have more energy! I had to set a timer on my phone to remind me 30 minutes after eating, so I wouldn't forget to take the pills! =P I highly recommend! detox pill that works I've been taking these for a couple of weeks and they've definitely improved my digestion. There a standard size pill and not too difficult to swallow. I also appreciate that I only have to take them once a day with a meal rather than trying to remember an hour before eating and several times a day like many other dietary supplements. I can't believe how great I feel I've been taking this supplement now for one month. I can't believe how great I feel. I have a very physical and demanding job and after taking this in the morning I am up for it! When I first started taking it (first 3 days) I really felt like my body was getting rid of the toxins I have built up from the food I eat and the chemicals I use in the products I use with cleaning every day. I noticed that I have extra energy, my weight loss program is on track (1 pound a week), and my sinus's are not as sensitive as they are during this high allergy season. i love this detox! I feel better every day and I have experienced no bad side effects! I am looking forward to continuing this detox for another month to see the long term results. I would have given this supplement 5 stars but I wanted to wait and see what two months would be like first. I'm pretty sure I'll be even more excited about the results after next month. I'll update my review then! #1 Complete Detox [New Formula 30 Cap-Sampler] - Rapid whole body detox - 10 + natural herbs - Scientifically formulated & most recommended for detox - 30 Capsules Sampler my focus is better, and I just have a calm OMG! OMG!! OMG!!!!!!!! THIS STUFF ROCKS!!! I started this 3 days ago and all I can say is OMG!!! :-D You will FEEL the difference in the FIRST DAY! My mind is getting clearer, my energy is clean and sustainable (NOT jittery!) my focus is better, and I just have a calm, AWESOME, feeling! It must be all the herbs that my body has just never had before...??? I don't know WHAT it is, but whatever it is, I'm LOVING it! I got TWO of my sister's on board as well as my niece! We're ALL gonna do this together! I can't shut my mouth about this! Believe me... you OWE it to your body to give this a try!!! You'll be SOOOO glad you did and your body will benefit beyond your wildest dreams! GET OFF THE FENCE ON THIS ONE! :-) Worked great! It cleansed my system pretty fast Worked great! It cleansed my system pretty fast. I am not sure what to say except I feel cleaner on the inside and more healthy! It didn't have any bad aftertaste like many pills do. They were medium sized and weren't bad to swallow at all. You are supposed to take 3 pills everyday after lunch. I fasted food for one day while taking this to jump start my cleansing and it worked really well. Anyways, it's a five star product. I recommend it. Happy cleansing! No liquids, juices or starving I was very skeptical. I always thought that cleanses had to be liquid. This product has shown me this is not the case, this product is amazing! I have had swollen lymphnodes for over a decade I have had several cancers and pounds of medications for years. After only three to four days of this cleanse, the worst of my lymphnodes have all but vanished. I didn't realize how much pain I have been in all over my body, when it's gone. I will keep using this product. An amazing and easy way to refresh your body As far as detoxing products go, this is one of the best. After going through a period where i was unable to properly look after my body (finances stress), I decided I needed a refresh and to detoxify. My nutritional balance was completely unbalanced, so i was hoping to cleanse my body and start anew. Thankfully this detoxifier is incredibly effective. The dosage is also very simple, 3 capsules daily. After using it for a while the results were obvious, my body felt 'fresh' with a great boost to my energy levels. A key factor in my decision to choose this particular product, is the all-natural ingredients. It is far better than flooding your system with chemicals. If you are in a similar situation to me where you can't properly manage your body, then give this a try. "}
