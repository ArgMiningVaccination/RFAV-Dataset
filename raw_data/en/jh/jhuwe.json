Some of the main premises of shamanism are that we are beings of spirit, that everything in existence has a spiritual essence, and that we are interconnected. If we care for our spirits and our relationships we can help facilitate health and balance in our lives. When we work shamanically we are working in concert with the compassionate spirits who are available to help us. The practitioner is the conduit, but not the healer. - Classic shamanic healing techniques, such as soul retrieval, help address past trauma and the loss of personal power. - Methods such as extraction help clear intrusive energies that can interfere with healthy functioning on many levels. - Journeying is done for guidance and for direct assistance. All shamanic work is done in partnership. Research on shamanic healing is is still evolving.

Healing with Spiritual Light Healing with spiritual light is a profoundly simple concept. Unlike most healing methods it does not involve trying to correct something in the client, instead the practitioner works through transfiguration. They are not actually \"doing\" anything to the client, but by shifting their own state of consciousness they are creating a state of radiance that has been demonstrated to create change in the environment around them. The client is seen as already whole, radiant in their own right. Reiki Reiki was developed in Japan in the end of the 19th century by Dr. Mikao Usui. The word 'Reiki' means 'Universal Life the universality of this energy, what shamanic cultures often call spirit. It signifies the life force that flows through everything in the universe, even more specifically the dynamic of the practitioner acting as a bridge or catalyst between \"heaven and earth.\" The second part of the word 'Reiki,' 'ki ,' relates etymologically to the Chinese word 'ch'i ,' the vital force that animates and sustains everything. Sessions generally provide deep relaxation, reduce stress and support healing. Reiki is increasingly being used in hospitals and there is an growing body of research on its effects.
