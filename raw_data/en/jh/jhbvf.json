A great benefit of essential oils is that they are safe and effective throughout every phase of life, including pregnancy. Due to the mild, non-irritating nature of many essential oils, they can be used confidently during this time. An important consideration throughout pregnancy is supporting healthy function of the entire body. Frankincense supports cellular function and, in turn, improves overall health. I have found Ginger, Peppermint, Lavender, and citrus oils can aid in the relief of pregnancy-related issues such as nausea, emotional imbalance, and other common discomforts. It's also important to remember that during pregnancy many women are especially sensitive. Adapting quantity, application methods, or dilution ratios may be necessary to accommodate these heightened sensitivities. How do I determine the appropriate dose of an essential oil? For many, the value of essential oils is understood and validated through personal use. It may not be a question of which oil to use, but rather, determining how and how much to use. The three primary methods of use include aromatic, topical, and internal application, all of which have documented benefit. Individual preference and experience will help you select the most appropriate application method to meet your personal needs. Although models of use may vary, I have found that consistency of application to be the most effective. I recommend using essential oils in smaller amounts and more frequently throughout the day rather than sporadically in large amounts. Consistency of use will help provide a sustained effect that allows for maximized benefit. What is the difference between the Zendocrine oil and the Zendocrine supplement? The body's natural detoxification organs are an essential element of health\u2014specifically the liver, colon, kidneys, and skin. Both the Zendocrine Detoxification Complex and essential oil blend should be used in conjunction to provide a balanced, comprehensive system of organ support. The Zendocrine supplement includes a blend of whole-food nutrition specifically targeted for each of the major cleansing organs. The Zendocrine essential oil blend contains Tangerine, Juniper Berry, Cilantro, Geranium, and Rosemary essential oils. Together, these oils help reduce oxidative stress, support proper cleansing, and stimulate detoxification activity. Although the products can be used individually, we recommend using them together as part of a comprehensive program of support. I recommend using two capsules daily, one with each the morning and evening meals. The Zendocrine softgels make for convenient internal use of the essential oil blend or it can be applied topically to the abdomen or on the bottoms of the feet.

Clove essential oil comes from the unopened flower buds of the evergreen tree. It is also one of the key ingredients found in the On Guard Protective Blend due to its powerful antioxidant and immune-enhancing properties. Clove bud contains a significant amount of eugenol, an active chemical component that gives the essential oil its energizing fragrance and a variety of therapeutic benefits. clove essential oil blends well with Wild Orange, Frankincense, Roman Chamomile, Cassia, Cedarwood, Ginger, Fennel, or Cinnamon essential oils. How to use AromaticPlant Part: Bud Extraction Method: Steam distillation Internal Topical DiD You Know? The name clove derives from the Latin word clavus which means \"nail.\" Cloves no doubt earned the name because the buds resemble small nails or tacks. In the third century BC, a Chinese leader in the Han Dynasty required those who addressed him to chew cloves to freshen their breath. Diffuse three to four drops alone or with other essential oils. Mix with water in a spray bottle and use to wipe down surfaces. Inhale directly from the bottle or the palms of the hands. Add one drop to your favorite recipe. Dilute one drop in 4 fl. oz. of liquid. Take in a veggie capsule to boost immunity. Put a few drops on a cotton ball or a Q-tip and apply directly on gums or teeth to soothe discomfort. Combine with dTERRA Fractionated Coconut Oil and massage the bottom of feet or desired area. Put 2-4 drops in a quarter glass of water and use as a mouthwash, or add to toothpaste. 6 / FALL 2014 lIVING MAGAZINE 2014 SlIM & S ASSY GRAND PRIzE WINNER ANDREW MARSHALL DECISION TO CHANGE Having worked in the medical field, I have seen the terrible complications that can arise from poor life choices. Although many health conditions can't be avoided, everything I was dealing with was a direct result of my poor health habits. It got to the point that my health interfered with my personal obligations as well as my academic pursuits. I was unable to enjoy all the activities that I used to do for fun. I began to experience multiple health problems ranging from excessively high blood pressure to pre-diabetic symp- toms. I no longer had the energy to keep up with my kids and found myself telling them \"no\" more often than \"yes\" when they asked me to play or do some-thing active. That's not the kind of father I wanted to be. Having passively tried and failed to make healthy changes and lose weight in the past, I was fearful of my future. I knew massive changes must be made and this time my whole heart and soul had to be in it. FINDING MOTIVATION I realized it was important to find motivation anywhere I could. My initial motivation came from realizing the state of my health. As I began to make changes, I found motivation in thinking of my future with my children. I found motivation in my increased energy and well-\"i am no longer the person i once was. \" \u00ae After many years of struggling with obesity, Andrew lost over 67 lbs. and 21 percent of his total body mass! He took control of his lifestyle and changed almost every aspect of his wellness in three short months. 6 / FALL 2014 lIVING MAGAZINEwww.doterra.com / 7 being. I found motivation in my changing physique. I found motivation in my ability to concentrate and focus and make progress in my long-term endeavors. I found motivation in my ability to be active for an entire day and still feel good at the end. Most importantly, I found moti- vation through the improved relationships with my loved ones and the experiences and memories I am now able to enjoy. I found motivation in developing a close, personal support system. For too long, I have experience a downward spiral with my wellness. Now, I am experiencing something much more powerful\u2014the success cycle of positive action. One small, positive change makes the next goal easier while reinforc - ing the last healthy habit. This became my foundation for motivation and supported my purpose, which was to achieve a level of wellness that would allow me to experi- ence life to its fullest and achieve my dreams. My lifelong goal is to attend medical school and, as part of my work, be the catalyst for helping others make lifestyle changes as well. Without first taking care of myself, I wouldn't physically be able to handle the pressure and demands of the academic process. I also wouldn't have the perspective to help others make those changes. EMBRACING THE CHANGE I have significantly changed almost every aspect of my wellness in three short months. I sleep better, have more energy, and participate in more physical activity than I have in years. I've noticed that even though I do have crav - ings for food I shouldn't eat, I am in control now. By cutting my refined sugar level down to a very minimal amount, I have noticed massive changes in my ability to heal, fight off illness, and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. I have begun hiking and enjoying the outdoors, areas I have not been able to go in several years. This has helped me reconnect with a part of me that has felt lost for some time. I have more energy to enjoy time with my kids, and I have the motivation to go the extra mile and plan more meaningful activities with them. I'm developing self confidence that I have not enjoyed for ages. I find that I just feel better in every aspect of my life. To state it simply, I have more vitality in every facet of my life. I have struggled with obesity for the better part of a decade now. This is the first time in almost nine years that I feel I have the power to take control and put my health in order. I have lost 67 pounds to date, but this is not the end! My end goal is to reach a weight of 180 lbs. While I have made amazing headway in a short amount of time, I still have a lot of work to do. The thing that surprises me the most is that I thought it would be so difficult through- out the entire journey. What I didn't expect was how enjoyable the process would be. It's like waking up every few days with a better body than I had the day before. Never in my life has my hard work paid off in a way that gave me such satisfaction. FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE Be patient! Don't expect to see results in the first day of your changes. In the past, I have given up because I didn't see changes in a 48-hour period. Long-term changes require long-term commitment. If you make healthy changes in your diet and exercise, you will see results. Make time for wellness.

Eliminate the unimportant, time- consuming activities that get in the way of living each day to the fullest. Make time to ponder and consider your wellness. Don't be so rushed that you force yourself into a position that you limit your options when it comes to food (yes, that means avoid fast food!). And most importantly, make time to have fun while being healthy. No matter what level of fitness you are at, there are ways to have fun while being active. Search out those things and enrich your life with them. Remember that this is all about long-term wellness, not a short-term competition. Starving your body or feeding it a drastic diet to see quick results will only hurt you in the long run. Begin by developing healthy eating habits that you can sustain for the rest of your life. Keeping your body's cells well fed with the proper nutrition is essential in the weight loss process. Don't let the tiny setbacks outweigh your overall progress. I weighed myself every morning during the competition. My weight would sometimes fluctuate 5 pounds up or down within 24 hours. At first, I was mortified on the days the scale would tell me that I had gained several pounds. But as I stuck to my goals and followed the program I made for myself, I learned that this is perfectly normal. In the end, I stopped worrying about the day-to-day fluctuations and was amazed at the progress I saw in the long run.

Your liver makes cholesterol that circulates to your skin, allowing UV light from the sun to convert the cholesterol into vitamin D. It is especially interesting that you can't get a toxic dose of vitamin D, no matter how long you are in the sun. If too many UV rays hit the vitamin D in your skin, it gets converted into another compound that your body excretes, leaving you with a perfect amount! Vitamin D is also added to orange juice and breakfast cereals, and can be found naturally occurring in fish and eggs. Between the sun and mentioned food sources, you would think most people get enough vitamin D in their systems; however, this is often not the case. Worldwide, an estimated one billion people have inadequate levels of vitamin D in their blood, and deficiencies can be found in all ethnicities and age groups. Vitamin D was added to milk in the 1930s to help with rickets, a deforming bone disease in children that was particularly prevalent in the northern latitudes. In the winter, people who live at higher latitudes (typically about 40\u00b0) can't make much vitamin D from the sun. Additionally, thick winter clothing makes it impossible for the little available sunlight to reach the skin. During the Industrial Revolution, rickets was prev - alent in cities where tall buildings and air pollution blocked the sunlight needed for vitamin D production in the body. It was thought that bone-building properties in fortified milk would solve the population's vitamin D deficien - cies, but it was only a partial solution to the problem. Getting vitamin D through natural sunlight is important to the body in many other ways. Worldwide, an estimated one billion people have inade quate levels of vitamin D in their blood, and deficiencies can be found in all ethnicities and age groups.How to make a D-lightful summer into a healthy winter!Nutrition Corner with Dr. Tory Parker, Ph.D. As a University professor, I taught Nutritional Biochemistry for many years. During that time, I learned that certain nutrients\u2014such as vitamin D\u2014can be hard to get enough of, even with a well-rounded, healthy diet. In fact, before joining doTERRA and taking the Lifelong Vitality Pack, I would tell my students that if they only took one supplement, it should be vitamin D.What are the benefits of vitamin D? Recent research has found that additional vitamin D may be good for autoimmune diseases, supporting healthy blood pressure, and protect against different types of illnesses. And, as you would expect, it also helps to strengthen bones. Typically, the amount of vitamin D needed to have an effect on any condition is higher than the RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowances). The most recent Institute of Medicine recommendations for vitamin D were increased from 400 IU to 600 IU per day for adults in response to new scientific studies that found additional benefits were gained with higher levels. Many felt that the recommendations didn't go high enough based on the evidence. Can't I get enough vitamin D from the sun? Many factors affect sun exposure, including skin pigmen - tation, clothing, and sunscreen. Light-skinned individu - als need about 5-10 minutes of sun exposure at least three times a week between 11 am and 2 pm in spring, summer, and fall. The goal is to get adequate sun exposure without getting burnt. Unfortunately, many people have a hard time meeting their sunshine needs. On the bright side, if you do get the necessary exposure, your body should be able to store enough for use during the winter months to prevent rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults. So, the more vitamin D you can get during the warmer months, the less likely you are to experience vitamin D deficiency in the winter. Remember, your body can't overproduce vitamin D from sun exposure. What about fortified foods? let's say you eat primarily vegetarian, and your only source of vitamin D was soy milk. On average, you would only get 100 IU of vitamin D a day if you simply consumed a cup of soy milk with your cereal in the morning. You could get additional vitamin D by drinking fortified orange juice and eating fortified cereal, but you would still be far below the minimum of 600 IU. Even if you added salmon and two eggs once a week, you would still average only about 200 IU per day. What about my children? The American Academy of Pediatrics currently sug gests that all infants, children, and adolescents receive 400 IU of supplemental vitamin D daily. Kids usually fare better than adults thanks to outside play, assuming they live in a place where sun exposure is easily obtained. However, children certainly spend far more time indoors today than in past generations. Children may need a supple - ment just like their parents to meet optimal needs. Dr. Parker recommends: Bone Nutrient Lifetime Complex: contains 810 IU of vitamin D for women. Dr. Parker holds a PhD in Nutritional Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr. Parker has extensive experience in food processing, food chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, and human nutrition. He has worked both in the supplement industry and in academia, making him uniquely positioned to understand product development, research, and the physiology and chemistry behind nutrition. Dr. Parker has a contagious passion for teaching people about the connection between nutrition and living a long life free from the early onset of degenerative conditions associated with poor lifestyle choices.

In partnership with CHOICE Humanitarian, the group traveled to La Paz, Bolivia, and then con - tinued on to a small rural community on the Bolivian Altiplano called Jalsuri. The purpose of the expedition was to work alongside Jalsuri community members to construct an expansion of their rural health clinic and to train rural health workers about the application and use of essential oils. The four-room expansion of the Jalsuri rural health clinic will now allow the clinic to receive an additional doc - tor and other health-care workers as well as resources provided through a government program. With this expansion, the Jalsuri clinic can now serve as a \"hub clinic\" to 13 additional communities, serving over 5,000 people. The group was also able to complete a small greenhouse connected to the clinic where they will be able to grow veg - etables and other medicinal herbs for treatment, as well as help with heating the clinic's birthing center. dTERRA Wellness Advocates and dTERRA staff members also held a training in Viacha on the basic application and use of essential oils with over 60 local health-care workers from seven different rural clinics representing approximately 82,000 people. The Healing Hands Foundation donated the oils to the participating clinics at the training and, following the expedition, delivered additional sets of essential oils to replenish these supplies for over a year. Healing Hands also was able to deliver physician diagnostic kits with important, basic instruments which will be kept and used at the Jalsuri clinic. The group also had many opportunities for intercultural ex - change with the community members.

Hill, Chief Medical Officer and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board Protecting Ourwww.doterra.com / 23 It is especially important to be mindful of our immune system during transitional times of the year, for instance, the beginning of a new school year when exposure to germs increases. Many lifestyle factors can also weaken our immune system, including stress, lack of sleep, exposure to toxicity, and poor nutrition. Managing each of these areas and adopting a model of consistency that actively supports the immune system is an excellent way to maintain health throughout the year. Although the physiologic functioning of the immune system is complex, it can be broken down into two main parts-fixed and mobile immunity. Fixed immunity serves as the body's first line of defense against potential threats by preventing harmful elements from ever entering circulation. This type of immunity is composed of the various protective barriers that exist between the delicate internal environment of the body and the outside environment, (for example, the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin). We also have mobile immunity that is activated if the body does become infected. Specialized immune cells quickly congregate at the site of infection to initiate the healing process. The combined work of both aspects of immunity is critical for staying healthy. Supporting our immune system can be easily achieved. We should focus on simple approaches that are easy to implement and easy to share with others. Among the greatest benefits of essential oils is that they are simple to apply and offer consistent benefits. Here are steps that can be used to support both fixed and mobile immunity and, in turn, maximize the health of your family during colder months. Build Healthy i ntestinal Flora The gastrointestinal (GI) system plays a key role in fixed immunity. If health of the GI tract is compromised, so is the immune system. A probiotic supplement such as do-TERRA PB Assist+ is an excellent way to populate the GI tract with beneficial microflora, thus enhancing immunity. It's important to use a probiotic supplement that bypasses the strong acidic environment of the stomach and releases the bacteria into the intestines where it will have the most substantial effect. Using innovative encapsulation tech - nology, PB Assist+ delivers a combination of live bacteria strains and a fructo-oligosaccharide prebiotic directly into the intestines, helping to populate the GI tract with helpful microflora while also optimizing colony adhesion and growth. This product is best used daily, but is especially important during periods when the immune system is vulnerable. Diffuse e ssential o ils Regularly Harmful organisms can be readily transmitted by coughing, sneezing, and nose blowing. Did you know that a single sneeze can transmit up to one hundred thousand contagious particles into the air? In turn, these airborne specks can be transmitted to others or land on open surfaces. Scientific study demonstrates that diffusion of essential oils can purify and cleanse the air, providing added protection when the seasonal threats are high. I recommend diffusing essential oils every day. Lemon and On Guard Protective Blend contain powerful cleansing properties that purify the air we breathe, delivering positive effects on the immune system. use e ssential o ils to Clean s urfaces Frequently touched surfaces such as door knobs, keyboards, cell phones, and grocery carts can be more harmful during certain times of the year. Cleaning these surfaces often is an important part of minimizing exposure to harmful particles. The On Guard cleaning products are a highly effective way to clean surfaces while preventing exposure to toxins. I also suggest using Lemon, Grapefruit, Wild Orange, Purify Cleansing Blend, or the On Guard Protective Blend. Our immunity is limited to its own ability to function properly. It is important to both minimize exposure to elements that may harm our immune system and to take proactive, consistent measures to enhance the body's ability to protect itself. By developing a daily routine and integrating these tips into a model of consistency, we can easily and effectively keep our families healthy throughout all seasons of the year. Our immune system is an especially important part of overall health. When the immune system is compromised, the risk of getting sick increases significantly.

FAllon HEndERson attends third grade at Dent Elementary in Escalon, California. She is also one of the youngest dTERRA enthusiasts. Because dTERRA has been a big part of her life at home, Fallon developed her own passion for essential oils and a desire to share them with her friends and classmates. Recently, Fallon conducted a successful science project where she per - formed a study on dTERRA essential oils in her classroom. The purpose of her experiment was to prove whether certain essential oils can improve focus, test scores, and overall classroom behavior. Before she could bring her project to life, Fallon had to receive an official approval from the students' parents, the district school board, and the county board. The research delivered incredible results and landed Fallon a first place ribbon. METHOD Before introducing essential oils to her class of approxi- mately 20 students and one teacher, Fallon gave each person a short survey to establish a base for the result comparison for the following three weeks of her study. At the beginning of week one, she placed the Aroma Lite Diffuser in the classroom where it was kept in the same location during the course of the study, only changing the essential oils. During the first week, Fallon diffused Peppermint with Wild Orange daily; during the second week: Rosemary with Peppermint; and the third week, Citrus Bliss Blend-which was everyone's favorite. To keep track of the results, students completed the same survey at the end of each week. Fallon's teacher helped her with averaging class math test scores and survey results. Let's take a look at what they discovered. RESUL TS Over the course of the study, most of the class felt less tired, seemed more alert, and students had an easier time remembering answers and paying attention during lessons. The class average for the math test jumped from 83.5 percent to 93.1 percent by the end of the second week. \"My study shows that diffusing essential oils improves our class behavior. We were able to remember our answers and stay focused throughout the day.\" Fallon is very excited for next year's science fair. She is plan-ning on doing another experiment with dTERRA essential oils! 1. Increased focus and alertness 2. Improved overall mood 3.

Arrowroot: White ( Purify ) Walnut: Gray ( Balance ) 30 / FALL 2014 lIVING MAGAZINE Patients often ask their health-care providers how they can improve their health. Sadly, much of this advice comes after the person is already sick or feeling less than healthy. As compared with repair methods, which are normally linear in their cause and effect approach, the vast power of preventive medicine is its ability to be significantly broader in effect. This means that just one preventative change can affect many outcomes. Prevention is, by nature, much more powerful and thus medically sound. As our lives change and choices become habits, our future is altered. Poor habits clearly have more potential to decrease positive cellular activity, and so the opposite is also true. We must focus our energy on powerful and productive health habits. It is the culmination of daily choices that will create the sum total of our health-care outcomes; do we chose to repair or prevent? When parents or health-care providers spend a disproportionate amount of time on repair and restore options rather than prevent and promote, we tend to find less healthy people and homes. In order to place an emphasis on preventing and promoting, health, office and home protocols need to be in place. The following tips may be useful in practice and within families to promote healthier lifestyles:Dr. David Steuer, DMD, MS, MMsC Our bodies rely on food to provide nutrients that we cannot generate on our own\u2014essential fatty acids for example. Our vascular and nervous systems rely on these fatty acids to function properly, and when the level of essential fatty acids is reduced, our body's functions also decline. Ingestion of Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) has been shown to reduce triglycerides and greatly improve our vascular and neurological health. Sadly, most people are always on the go and tend to rely on fast, pre-prepared foods that are loaded with the wrong fat, Omega-6. Excessive consumption of this fat has been linked to an increase in pro-inflammatory activity, meaning it may increase risk for heart disease and vessel inflammation. To be healthier, we must consume the appropriate daily amount of essential fatty acids. The LifeLong Vitality pack contains what we need.Eat fat, but especially the right fatTIP1www.doterra.com / 31 Within all families, there are many factors that can jeopardize a healthy immune system. The cleansing properties of many essential oils\u2014such as On Guard, Lemon, Wild Orange, and Purify\u2014 will reduce if not completely eliminate most harmful elements that can weaken your body's natural defense mechanisms. Many studies have shown that essential oils are effective on contacted surfaces, in the air, and even in wet solutions. Mixing a concentration of On Guard in spray bottles can be an excellent cleaning solution that can help purify contacted surfaces. The oils can also be diffused in areas such as the waiting room, conference rooms, and front desk areas. As a father and health-care provider, my decisions are based on both scientific and practical knowledge, which allows for the introduction of natural solutions into the health-care needs of my family and my patients. By simply adding a daily regimen of high quality supplementation and utilizing essential oils, we can enhance wellness, change moods, and reduce toxic load.Find time to relax and reduce stressClean with essential oilsTIP2TIP3Dr. David Steuer is a Harvard trained Endodontist, founder and manag - ing partner of Steuer Management, LLC, and Luminescent Capital Partners, LLC. Dr. Steuer is actively involved in researching new ways to incorporate essential oils into his practice. \"An intra-oral regimen of Cinnamon and On Guard is not only good for our breath, but also can improve the overall health of your gums and teeth. Brush your teeth every day with On Guard toothpaste. Then, place one drop of Cinnamon oil on your toothbrush and scrub your tongue. Everyone, especially those you may kiss, will be most thankful!\" In my practice, we diffuse Wild Orange, Grapefruit, and other calming citrus oils to modify the negative emotional response associated with the traditional aseptic smell of many medical facilities. Calming is not just a state of mind, but rather a complete physiologic response. The individual who is nervous and distraught will almost always have elevated blood pressure, pulse, and breathing as well as sweaty or clammy skin. These factors contribute to not only an unpleasant work environment for the staff, but to a poor patient experience as well. By doing nothing more than diffusing citrus essential oils, we can watch these physiologic conditions change before our eyes\u2014it is nothing short of amazing. While we see this occurring in our patients, we can also assume it will do the same in our homes. Diffusing oils creates an environment conducive to study, clear thinking, and restful sleep.
