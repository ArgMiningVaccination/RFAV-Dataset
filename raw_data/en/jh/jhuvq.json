Your passport is ready. But, do you know what might be lurking in the food on your plate as you travel outside the U.S.? The World Health Organization estimates that 2 million people die each year from contaminated food or drinking water. That's about 1 in 10 people! Risks range from: - Mild: travelers' diarrhea. - Serious: hepatitis A or typhoid, which can have long-term health effects. - Fatal: illness caused by harmful bacteria, parasites, viruses and chemical substances. If you're traveling, follow these tips: Tip #1 Plan Ahead - Research your destination. Anticipate issues, food safety or otherwise, that could arise during your trip. - Find out about the water supply. Check if your destination has a drinkable water supply and medical care that is available in case you do become ill. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travelers' Health and U.S. Department of State Travel Information are two excellent resources. - Check the altitude. Some people can become sick above 8,000 feet, especially children. Tip #2: Visit a Health Care Provider Before You Go - Find out about vaccines. Depending on where you're traveling, you may need new or updated vaccines. - Stock up on prescriptions. Get enough of your prescription drugs to last the entire trip. If need be, request a vacation exception to get enough for the whole time you will be gone. Also, fill prescriptions for any recommended special medications. - Don't forget over-the-counter medications. Consider bringing over-the-counter medications with you in case you experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, heartburn or gas. Talk to your doctor about recommendations. Tip #3: Pack Smartly - Carry hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes. These can be used for washing your hands and cleaning surfaces. - Stash nonperishable food items (that aren't liquids) in your carry-on luggage. Although many airports offer healthy options, you never know when will be the next time you can eat once you reach your destination. If you aren't sure if options are available, pack extra nonperishables in your luggage. - Bring a [travel health kit](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/preparing/travel-health-kits). And, carry your health insurance card in your wallet. Place prescription drugs in your carry-on luggage. Check the [TSA website](https://www.tsa.gov/)to determine what's allowed on airplanes. - Whenever in doubt, don't drink tap or well water or anything that was made with it, including fountain drinks. Your best bet is to opt for sealed, bottled beverages. Tip #4: Keep Your Guard Up - Avoid raw meat, fish, shellfish and eggs. Just as in the U.S., you can get sick from undercooked, raw and contaminated foods and beverages. - Avoid raw produce, including salads, advises the FDA. This will reduce the possibility of coming in contact with fruits and vegetables that may have been rinsed with tap water and may be contaminated. However, thoroughly cooked produce; fruits with a thick, intact peel or a covering that you can peel yourself (such as citrus fruits and bananas); well-cooked meat, poultry and fish; and dairy from large commercial dairies are considered safe by the FDA. Tip #5: Always Err On the Side of Caution - Steer clear of food that has been sitting at room temperature. That falls within the temperature \"danger zone\" where bacteria thrive. This includes not eating from a buffet-style service, since food may not always be held at safe temperatures and can easily become mishandled. Stick to cold or hot foods instead. Tip #6: Watch Out for All Water Sources - If you have to ask, don't drink it. A common question travelers ask when abroad: \"Is the water safe?\" The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding tap water, including cocktails, ice and water to brush your teeth. Undrinkable tap water can be contaminated with amoebas, parasites and viruses including hepatitis. - Choose drinks in manufacturer-sealed containers. For example, bottled or canned beverages and pasteurized dairy products. Tip #7: Wash Your Hands - Clean your hands often. Whether at home or abroad, [proper hand-washing](/food/home-food-safety/cleaning-tips/hand-washing)is an important key to preventing foodborne illness. - Use soap or hand sanitizer. Wash your hands with soap and warm water, especially before eating and after using the bathroom. When soap and warm water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead. Pack it in your carry-on, purse or backpack for easy access. Tip #8: Take Care of Yourself if You Get Sick - Stay hydrated. Even if you play it safe and follow the rules for food safety, you still may find yourself sick while on an international trip. If you experience diarrhea, drink plenty of clean fluids. - Seek help if you need medical treatment. If you experience a more serious illness, the [U.S. Department of State](https://www.state.gov/)can help travelers locate medical services. Bon voyage and have a safe culinary adventure!
