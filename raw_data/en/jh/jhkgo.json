Rose, An Intuitive Latinx Healer Our World Has Been Flipped, Turned Around And Shuffled Ten Times.. ...since 2020. We are all doing things and living in ways we never imagined! For some, immense change can help us thrive, for others it can create a feeling of being lost. Either way, I have come to see it as a time to lean into our spirituality \u2014seeking connection to the things that are bigger than our individual wants and needs. For many it has been about aligning to nature or considering the larger impact of our actions. This is why I want to introduce you to Shayla M. Rose (she/her/they) and the work she does \u2014astrology, tarot and oracle readings, vaginal steam services, and one-on-one spiritual healing sessions. Shayla is an intuitive Latinx healer here in NYC. She has a background in Sociology and Human Development which has been the foundation of her understanding of healing holistically and gave shape to her offerings. Shayla explains that the passing of two beloved family members gave her the push she needed to start sharing her healing work. She began her learning process with curiosity and by pulling tarot cards and reading about them. This eventually turned into a routine of pulling cards alongside her daily journaling practice, one practice informing the other. Shayla says \"each time I connect to the cards, I realize the healing effect they [the tarot cards] had on me.\" She also went through more formal training based on The Moon Deck by Aarona Lee. Afterwards, she found a style to integrate both the tarot and oracle messages while incorporating easy to do rituals for herself and her clients. Shayla talks about how writing is a significant part of her work. \"Sometimes verbal expression doesn't do written communication justice. When I write, my capacity for storytelling, dreams come alive, and creativity blossoms; I am better at expressing my emotions and releasing them on paper; hence I opened a space for writers like myself in the [Rowdy Writers Circle](https://www.shaylamrose.com/rowdy-writers-circle)\". RWC includes energy release through writing, working with the moon and ritual work. Writing is used as a tool in the group to heal and manifest change. Shayla explains \"My goal is for people to come as they are, no matter how intense they may feel, to release energy that is no longer necessary while creating space for gratitude.\" Shayla has humbly witnessed powerful changes in some of her clients that vary from gaining clarity to \"\"stepping into leadership roles and becoming pioneers within their profession.\" She also sees some \"heal through family-based trauma and mother-child relationships\". Recently Shayla worked with someone combating health issues and terminal illness, holding space and helping them as a guide and catalyst for change and acceptance. She firmly believes in \"healing together but also allowing space for joy and laughter for a successful healing journey.\" Shayla's Offerings: [Ancestral connection](https://www.shaylamrose.com/ancestral-connection) is a three, six, or twelve month program for clients to seek an understanding of lineage, learn practical steps about ancestral altar work, meet benevolent ancestors, and tap into past life for ancestral healing. As a practitioner and from personal experience, the goal is to self-heal and gain the tools to understand the self deeply. I guide the person through a ceremony and prayer and take them through ancestral guided meditations, which I create unique to my client's needs. Ancestral connection sessions are available in-person in Chinatown, phone and virtual. [Spiritual guidance ](https://www.shaylamrose.com/spiritual-guidance)is a three, six, or twelve month program for spiritual- body healing. As a spiritual guide, I combine shadow work, crystal healing, dreamwork, chakra cleanses, egg cleanses, herbs cleanse, teach spiritual hygiene and breath work. In addition, I include tarot and oracle readings with channel messages for additional guidance (upon each individual's comfort level). The sessions start with a personal check-in to explore clients' spirit-body needs, followed by ceremony and prayer. My goal is to ensure clients receive the best spiritual care plan by meeting in-between monthly appointments for 15 minutes to discuss assignments and spiritual follow-up. Also, Spiritual guidance is an excellent offering for individuals looking to find their life's purpose, step into healing, and find balance. Shayla also offers astrology, tarot and oracle readings and vaginal steam services. Services are available in Spanish and English. Find Shayla Online By Dr. Emily Grace Siy, "}
