Th e Site comprises approximately 5 acres of the 3,100-acre former pla nt property located as shown on Figure 1 . The conduct of any environmenta l assessment and cleanup activit ies on the Tradepoint Atlantic property, as well as any associated development, is subject to the requirements outlined in the following agreements: Administrative Consent Order (ACO) between Tradepoint Atlantic (formerly Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC) and the Mary land Department of the Environ ment (MDE), effective September 12, 2014; and Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not to Sue (SA) between Trade point Atlantic (formerly Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC) and the United States E nvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA), effective November 25, 2014. The majority of the Site remains subject to the requirements of the Multimedia Consent Decree between Bethlehem Steel Corpora tion, the USEPA, and the MDE (ef fective October 8, 1997) as documented in correspondence re ceived from the USEPA on Septemb er 12, 2014. An application to enter the full Tradepoint Atlantic property ( 3,100 acres) into the Maryland Department of the Environment Voluntary Cleanup Program (MDE-VC P) was submitted to the MDE and delivered on June 27, 2014. The property's current and anticipated future use is Tier 3 (Industrial) and plans for the prop erty include demolition and redevelopment over several years. The Site consists of approximately 5 acres currently slated for gradi ng (site preparation) for the future construction of a large building designated as the Proje ct Cobra building. The proposed rough grading plan for this project is provided in Appendix A and is also shown on Figure 2 . This site preparatory work is not intended to be the basis for the issuance of a No Further Action Letter (NFA) or a Certificate of Completion (COC). Future deve lopment and construction of the building will be subject to the submission of a separate Respon se and Development Work Plan (RADWP), which will evaluate the environmental condition of the Site and provide the standard requirements that have been a pproved for construction projects on the property. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 2 ARM Group LLC 2.0 SITE DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY 2.1. SITE DESCRIPTION The Site consists of approximately 5 acres, the majority of whi ch is within Parcel B6 with a smaller portion in Parcel B22. The position of the Site within the gre ater Tradepoint Atlantic property is provided on Figure 1 . The proposed rough grading plan for the Site is provided in Appendix A and is also shown on Figure 2 . The Site is currently zoned Manufacturing Heavy-Industrial M ajor (MH-IM), and is not occupied. A ll former buildings at the Site have been demolished, and the Site has been cleared of all si gnificant vegetation. There is no groundwater use on-site or within the surrounding Tradepoint Atlantic property. According to Figure B-2 of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) Revision 6 dated February 22, 2018, stormwater fro m the majority of the Site is discharged through the permitted National Pollution Discharge Eli mination System (NPDES) Outfall 014 at the end of the Tin Mill Canal (TMC), which discharges into Bear Creek to the west. Sto rmwater from the far southern portion of the Site is discharg ed through NPDES Outfall 017 int o Jones Creek to the east. 2.2. SITE HISTORY From the late 1800s until 2012, the production and manufacturin g of steel was conducted at Sparrows Point. Iron and steel production operations and proces ses at Sparrows Point included raw material handling, coke p roduction, sinter production, iron production, steel production, and semi-finished and finished pr oduct preparation. In 1970, Sparr ows Point was the largest steel facility in the United States, producing hot and cold rolled sh eets, coated materials, pipes, plates, and rod and wire. The steel maki ng operations at the facility ceased in fall 2012. As stated above, the Site encompasses portions of Parcel B6 and Parcel B22. Parcel B6 was formerly occupied by a portion of the Hot Strip Mills area, whi ch contained numerous product manufacturing operations. The pro cesses associated with this ar ea are further described in the Parcel B6 Phase II Investigation Work Plan (Revision 2) dated M arch 16, 2018. There were two sampling targets from the Parcel B6 Phase II Investigation that are within the Sub-Parcel B6-5 LOD\u2014a pickler tank and a waste a cid tank. Soil sample results from the Phase II Investigation are summarized below. The porti on of Parcel B22 covered by thi s Grading Plan did not historically include any significant st eel making processes. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 3 ARM Group LLC 3.0 LOCATIONS OF PO TENTIAL CONCERN The scope of development covered by this document is limited to fill material placement and grading activities which will be performed by Construction Work ers using heavy equipment. No utility installations or other excavations will be conducted du ring this phase of development; any such activities will be covered by a subsequent RADWP to be sub mitted in the future for the construction of the proposed bu ilding. Since excavation work w ill not be conducted under this Grading Plan, and the proposed fill material placement and grad ing activities will be performed by Construction Workers inside enclosed vehicle cabs, which mit igates exposure risk, a full human health Screening Level Risk Assessment (SLRA) is not necessary for this proposed work. Although a formal SLRA is not being presented within this Gradi ng Plan, an evaluation of existing data was completed to determine whether any locations of potent ial concern exist within the proposed limit of disturbance (LOD). The purpose of this evaluation wa s to determine whether any fut ure response actions and/or monitoring are reasonably antici pated to be required to facilit ate future use of the Site. This evaluation was based on existing data which were collected duri ng completed Phase II Investigations on the Tradepoint Atlantic property, including w ork associated with the Parcel B6 and Parcel B22 Phase II Investigations. The respective Phase I I Investigation Reports for these tasks have been submitted to the MDE and USEPA (Parcel B6 Revis ion 2 dated March 16, 2018 and Parcel B22 Revision 1 dated August 8, 2019). The relevant soil boring locations from the Parcel B6 and Parcel B22 Phase II Investigations are included o n Figure 3. While the Finishing Mills Groundwater Investigation covered the area encompassing t he Site, there were no groundwater locations located w ithin or near the Site boundary (LOD). The nearest groundwater locations from the Finishing Mil ls Groundwater Investigation ar e shown on Figure 4. 3.1. SUMMARY OF SOIL INVESTIGATIONS Soil conditions within and surroun ding the Site have been chara cterized by the Parcel B6 and Parcel B22 Phase II Investigations. The Phase II Investigation Reports for these parcels have been submitted to the MDE and USEPA (submittal dates listed above). Relevant soil boring locations from these Phase II Inv estigations are shown on Figure 3 . The data from these investigations were used to assess locations of pot ential concern within the LOD of the Site. Lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), total petroleum hydroca rbons (TPH)/Oil & Grease, and non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) a re subject to special requirem ents as designated by the agencies. Data from within, a nd in close proximity to, the Pro ject Cobra building were evaluated to determine presence or absence of any locations of potential concern including: lead concentrations above 10,000 mg/kg, PCB concentrations above 50 mg/kg, TPH/Oil & Grease concentrations above 6,200 mg/kg, a nd evidence of NAPL . Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 4 ARM Group LLC Based on the Phase II Investigations, there were no notable con centrations of lead, PCBs, TPH, or evidence of NAPL detecte d in soil at the Site. A boring located just outside the northern border of the Site i n Parcel B6 (B6-056-SB) was identified as a location of potential concern due to evidence o f trace NAPL observed in a narrow interval within the soil core. A piezometer was installed at t his location with a total depth of 15 feet below ground surface and gauged at 0 hours and 30 days wit h an oil-water interface probe. There was no evidence of NAPL observed in the piezometer during either measurement, therefore the piezometer was abandoned. No additional response actions o r monitoring are anticipated at this location. 3.2. SUMMARY OF GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATIONS Groundwater at the Site has already been characterized by the F inishing Mills Groundwater Investigation. The Phase II Inve stigation Report for this inve stigation has been submitted to the MDE and USEPA (submittal date listed above). However, there we re no Finishing Mills groundwater monitoring locations within or near the Site bounda ry (LOD). The nearest groundwater locations from the Finishing Mills Groundwater Inve stigation are shown on Figure 4. While it is not anticipated that groundwater will be encountere d during grading activities, the results from the groundwater sampling at the nearby locations a re summarized in the Finishing Mill Groundwater Investigation Report. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 5 ARM Group LLC 4.0 PROPOSED GRADING PLAN Tradepoint Atlantic is proposing to perform material placement and grading on the designated 5 acres of Parcel B6 and Parcel B22 in preparation for the future construction of a building. The proposed future use of the S ite is Tier 3 (Industrial). The scope of development covered by this document is limited to fill material placement and grading activities which will be performed by Construction Work ers inside the enclosed vehicle cabs of heavy equipment. Therefore, it is not expected that si gnificant exposures to potentially contaminated soil or groundwater will occur during the work pro posed under this Grading Plan. The proposed rough grading plan is provided in Appendix A . No utility installations or other excavations will be conducted during this phase of development; any such activities will be covered by a project-specific RADWP. The use of enclosed vehic les mitigates, but does not completely eliminate, potential exposure risks for Construction W o r k e r s . G e n e r a l h e a l t h a n d safety controls (level D protection) outlined in the property-w ide Health and Safety Plan (HASP provided in Appendix B ) will mitigate any potential incidental risk to Construction W orkers during fill material placem ent and grading activities. The process of completing the pr oposed activities at the Site i nvolves the tasks listed below. As- built and regulatory documentation for the outlined tasks and p rocedures related to site grading will be provided in an Interim Completion Report. A final Deve lopment Completion Report will be necessary following the construction of the Project Cobra bu ilding, as will be specified within the RADWP associated with the project. Depending on the schedu le of subsequent development, the preparatory grading work dis cussed herein may be incorporat ed into the final Development Completion Report in lie u of an interim report. Historically, there were no monitoring wells located within the Site boundary. As such, no monitoring well abandonments are required prior to grading acti vities. 4.1. GRADING AND SITE PREPARATION As indicated on the proposed rough grading plan in Appendix A , fill material will be placed to raise the elevation at the Site. The current and final (propos ed) ground surface elevations are indicated on the grading plan. The proposed work will require importing material to the Site. No excavations are planned to be c onducted during th is phase of th e project. It is not anticipated that unsuitable materials (i.e., poor soils) will be encountered. Processed slag aggregate sourced from the Tradepoint Atlantic p roperty will be used as the fill material for this project, and th e placement of this material w ill necessitate that the Site will be subject to surface engineering controls (i.e., capping) in the future when the RADWP is prepared for the Project Cobra building. No other fill materials w ill be used at the Site without the approval Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 6 ARM Group LLC of the MDE. Fill sources shall be free of organic material, fr ozen material, or other deleterious material. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 7 ARM Group LLC 5.0 GRADING IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOLS This plan specifically discusses protocols for the handling of fill materials in association with the planned grading and site prepara tion activities at the Site. I n particular, this plan highlights the minimum standards for constructio n practices to reduce potentia l risks to workers and the environment. No utility installations or other excavations wil l be conducted during this phase of development. On-site rough gradin g activities for the Project Cobra building will consist of fill material placement and subseque nt grading by Construction Worke rs inside the enclosed vehicle cabs of heavy equipment, which mit igates exposure risk. Theref ore, it is not expected that significant exposures to potential ly contaminated soil or groun dwater will occur during the work proposed under this Grading Plan. The Site is located entirely within the historical Finishing Mi lls area. Groundwater conditions throughout the Finishing Mills are a have already been character ized by the Finishing Mills Groundwater Investigation, althoug h there were no groundwater m onitoring locations located within the sub-parcel B6-5 boundary. Trace NAPL was observed in a narrow interval within the soil co re at B6-056-SB. A piezometer was installed at this locati on and NAPL was not observed to acc umulate in the casing. 5.1. EROSION /SEDIMENT CONTROL Erosion and sediment controls wi ll be installed prior to commen cing work in accordance with the 2011 Maryland Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control. The erosion and sediment controls will be appr oved by the MDE. In addition , the following measures will be taken to prevent contaminated soil from exiting the Site: Stabilized constructi on entrance will be pla ced at site entranc e. A dry street sweeper will be used as necessary on adjacent road s, and the swept dust will be collected and properly managed. Accumulated sediment removed from silt fence, and sediment trap s if applicable, shall be periodically removed an d returned to the Site. 5.2. FILL Processed slag aggregate sourced from the Tradepoint Atlantic p roperty will be used as the fill material for this project. No other fill materials will be use d at the Site without the approval of the MDE. Processed slag aggregate can be used as structural fill u nder areas to be capped without any additional required testing or a pprovals. Tradepoint Atlantic understands that the placement of slag aggregate at the Site will necessitate that the Project Co bra building will be subject to a capping requirement when it is e valuated in a subsequent RADWP for construction of the Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 8 ARM Group LLC warehouse building, unless separate approvals are received from the MDE following appropriate laboratory testing of the material. 5.3. DUST CONTROL General construction operations, including grading, will be per formed at the Site. These activities are anticipated to be performed in areas of soil impacted with constituents of potential concern (COPCs). Best management practices should be undertaken at the Tradepoint Atlantic property as a whole to prevent the generation of dust which could impact other areas of the property outside of the immediate work zone. To limit worker exposure to contam inants borne in dust and windblown particulates, dust monitoring will be performed in th e immediate work zone and at the upwind and downwind perimeter of the Site, and dust control mea sures will be implemented if warranted based on the monitoring results. The action level pr oposed for the purpose of determining the need for dust suppression techniques (e.g. wate ring and/or misting) during the development activities at the Si te will be 3.0 milligrams per c ubic meter (mg/m\u00b3). The lowest of the site-specific dust action levels, Occupational Safety and H ealth Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL ), and American Conference of Go vernmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Lim it Value (TLV) was selected as the proposed action level. The Environmental Professional (EP) will be responsible for the dust monitoring program. Air monitoring will be performed using Met One Instruments, Inc. E- Sampler dust monitors or equivalent real-time air monito ring devices. The EP will set-u p dust monitoring equipment at the outset of grading work or other dust-generating a ctivities, and continuous dust monitoring will be performed during this work. In addition to work area monitorin g, a dust monitor will be placed at selected perimeter locations tha t will correspond to the upwind and downwind boundaries based on the prevailing wind direction predicted for that day. The p revailing wind direction will be assessed during the day, and the positions of the perimeter mon itors will be adjusted if there is a substantial shift in the prevailing wind direction. Once all d ust-generating activities are complete, the dust monitoring program may be discontinued. If additional dust-generating activities commence, additional dust monito ring activities will be perform ed. If sustained dust concentrations exceed the action level (3.0 m g/m\u00b3) at any of the monitoring locations as a result of conditions occurring at the Site, oper ations will be stopped temporarily until dust suppression can be implemented. The background dust conce ntration will be utilized to evaluate whether Site activities are the source of the action l evel exceedance. Background concentrations will be based on measurements over a minimum of a 1-hour period at the upwind Site boundary. This upwind data will be used to calculate a ti me weighted average background dust concentration. The background dust concentration may need to be recalculated periodically during the workday, based on chan ged upwind conditions. Operat ions may be resumed once monitoring indicates t hat dust concentrati ons are below the act ion level. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 9 ARM Group LLC As applicable, air monitoring wi ll be conducted during grading activities in the immediate work zones and surrounding areas to a ssess levels of exposure to Sit e workers, establish that the work zone designations are valid, and verify that respiratory protec tion being worn by personnel, if needed, is adequate. Concurrent with the work zone air monitor ing, perimeter air monitoring will also be performed to ensure cont aminants are not migrating off- site. The concentration measured in the downwind portion of the Site shall not exceed the concen tration in the upwind portion, or 3.0 mg/m\u00b3, unless caused by background dust from upwind of the Site. If exceedances attributable to Site conditions are identifie d downwind for more than five m inutes, dust control measures and additional monitoring will be implemented. The dust suppressio n measures may include wetting or misting through the use of a hose connected to an available water supply or a water truck stationed at the Site. Dust control measures will be implemented as described above to address dust generated as a result of grading activities conducted at the Site. However, based on the nature of the area and/or on- going activities surrounding the S ite, it is possible that wind blown particulates may come from surrounding areas. As discussed above, the dust concentration in the upwind portion of the Site will be considered when monitoring dust levels in the work zone . A pre-construction meeting will be held to discuss the potential of windblown particulates from other activities impacting the air monitoring required for this res ponse plan. Site contact infor mation will be provided to address the possibility of upwind dust impacts. If sustained dust is o bserved above the action level (3.0 mg/m\u00b3) and it is believed to originate from off-site (i.e., upw ind) sources, this will immediately be reported to the MDE-VCP project team, as well as the MDE Air an d Radiation Administration (ARA). 5.4. HEALTH AND SAFETY A property-wide HASP (provided as Appendix B ) has been developed and is attached to this plan to present the minimum requirements for worker health and safet y protection for the project. The proposed fill material placement and grading activities will be performed by Construction Workers inside enclosed vehicle cabs, whi ch mitigates exposure risk. G eneral health and safety controls (level D protection) will mitigat e any potential incidental ris k to Construction W orkers during fill material placement and grading activities. All contractors wor king on the Site must prepare their own HASP that provides a level of protection at least as much a s that provided by the attached HASP. Alternately, on-site conta ctors may elect to adopt the H ASP provided. Prior to commencing work, the c ontractor must conduct a pre-con struction safety meeting for all personnel. All personnel must be made aware of the HASP. Alth ough intrusive work is not anticipated to be required for th is grading project, safety inf ormation shall be provided to personnel who may have incidental exposures to soils which could be impac ted by COPCs. Workers will be responsible for following safety procedures to prevent contact with potentially contaminated soil or groundwater (no t anticipated). Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 10 ARM Group LLC 6.0 PERMITS, NOTIFICATIONS , AND CONTINGENCIES The participant and their contractors will comply with all loca l, state, and federal laws and regulations by obtaining any nece ssary approvals and permits to conduct the activities contained herein. Any permits or permit m odifications from State or loca l authorities will be provided as addenda to this Grading Plan. There are no wetlands identified within the project area, so no permits are required from the MDE Water Resources Administration. Contingency measures will include the following: 1. The MDE will be notified immediately of any previously undiscov ered contamination, previously undiscovered storage tanks and other oil-related iss ues, and citations from regulatory entities related t o health and safety practices. 2. Any significant change to the implementation schedule will be n oted in the progress reports to MDE. Tradepoint Atlantic Project Cobra Grading Plan Revision 0 - October 19, 2021 ARM Project No. 21010206 11 ARM Group LLC 7.0 IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE Progress reports will be submitted to the MDE on a quarterly ba sis. Each quarterly progress report will include, at a minimum, a discussion of the following infor mation regarding tasks completed during the specified quarter: Grading Progress Dust Monitoring Soil Management (imported materials, stockpiling) Notable Occurrences (if applicable) Additional Associated Work (if applicable) The proposed implementation s chedule is shown below.

utilized as a steel making facility. It is located in Baltimore County, Maryland in the southeast corner o f the Baltimore metropolitan area (approximately 9 miles from the downtown area), on the Spa rrows Point Peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The facility occupies the entire pen insula and is bounded to the west by Bear Creek; to the south by P atapsco River; and to the east by Jones Creek, Old Road Bay and residential areas of Edgemere. The facility is bounded to the north by the Sparrows Point Country Club. The entire facility is a pproximately 3,100 acres in size . Pennsylvania Steel built the original furnace at Sparrows Point in 1887 and the first iron was cast in 1889. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (BSC) purchased the facil ity in 1916 and enlarged it by building additional plating facilities. BSC filed for bankrupt cy in 2001. A series of entities have since owned the site: the International Steel Group (ISG), Mitt al Steel, ISG Sparrows Point, LLC, Severstal Sparrows Holding LLC, which was renamed to Severstal Sparrows Point, LLC, RG Steel Sparrows Point, LLC, and then a joint venture to Sparrows Point LLC (SP) and HRE Sparrows Point LLC. In 2014, the property and assets were sold to Sparrows Po int Terminal LLC (SPT). Environmental liability was retained by SP. In 2016, SPT rebra nded into the entity known as Tradepoint Atlantic, LLC (TPA). The facility has been subdivided into various different parcels and subparcels based primarily on the redevelopment potential. The purpose of this document is to provide a Health and Safety Plan (HASP) for TPA personnel who are engaged in various envir onmental, maintenance, and rail related activities performed throughout the facility. 1.2 Historic Operations Steel manufacturing involves handling vast amounts of raw mater ial including coke, iron ore, limestone and scrap steel, as wel l as recovering byproducts and managing waste materials. The operations listed below either were or are currently performed at the TPA Facility.

The approximately 3,100 acre facility is being redeveloped into v a r i o u s d i f f e r e n t commercial/industrial land uses o n a systematic parcel by parce l basis under the oversight of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The redevelopment is proceeding in accordance with remediation plans approved by MDE and USEPA under Maryland's Voluntary Cleanup Pr ogram (VCP) and portions of the facility are also governed by the federal Resource Conse rvation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Various historical environmental investigations have been perfo rmed throughout the site. The data collected from these investigations has been compiled and compared against the applicable Project Action Limits (PALs). Concentrations identified as exc eeding PALs must be adequately addressed to the satisfaction of the regulators. The historica l environmental data have been compiled in various Phase II En vironmental Site Assessment (ESA ) Reports and al so presented in various documents intended to sat isfy VCP requirements, includi ng Response and Development Workplans (RADWP). The RADWP documents are generally specific to each individual subparcel being developed as part of the o verall redevelopment project. The historical environmental data has indicated that various co nstituents are present in either the soil and/or groundwater at co ncentrations exceeding the PAL s, including: Various metals; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs); Semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs); and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). While the construction projects a ssociated with the redevelopme nt are typically performed by contractors hired by TPA, after the initial construction has be en completed, TPA personnel perform various maintenance/repair activities throughout the si te. The maintenance activities may involve excavation of impacted soils beneath engineered bar riers, such as concrete or asphalt pavement. TPA personnel and their subcontractors may a lso perform a variety of environmental tasks including field investigations, sampling, s ystem maintenance, and remedial excavations. TPA personnel also regularly perform various task s related to railroad operations.

With in this context, a \"Competent Person\" is defined as \"one who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in t he surroundings or working conditions which are unsanitary, h azardous, or dangerous to emp l o y e e s a n d w h o h a s authorization to take prompt action to eliminate them.\" A \"Competent Person\" is typically identified by virtue of educa tion, training, and experience, or a combination and shall possess the skill of observation and th e knowledge of the subject, including the applicable regulatory guidelines as to ensure tha t safety and health of the public, workers, and the environment. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 313 HAZARD IDENTIFICATION This section outlines the potential hazards associated with var ious jobs listed above in Section 2.1. 3.1 Hazard Analysis The various jobs related to site environmental, maintenance, an d rail operations may pose p o t e n t i a l h e a l t h a n d s a f e t y h a z a r d s f o r s i t e w o r k e r s . T h i s s e c t i o n d e s c r i b e s t h e h a z a r d s associated with these operations. Detailed hazard information is provided in Section 4.0 (Health Hazard Information). Hazards to which workers may be exposed to as a result of the a bovelisted activities may generally include: potential chemical exposures, lacerations, excessive noise, thermal stress, lifting of excessive weight or bulk, hand tools and heavy equip ment, and slips, trips and falls. 3.1.1 Chemical Hazard Potential exposures to chemica ls in the soil or groundwater inc lude the possibility of dermal exposure (contact and/or absorpt ion), inhalation of chemical co ntamination that may be encountered during site maintenance or rail work, or ingestion of contaminants, if good personal hygiene practices are not followed. Various metals, VOCs, SVOCs, and PCBs are the primary contamina nts that have been identified in site soil and/or groundwater during previous environmental i nvestigations at the site at concentrations exceeding Project Action Limits (PALs). The app ropriate Safety Data Sheets (SDS) will be reviewed that apply to the various job tasks being cond ucted. Applicable SDS are located in Attachment B . A SDS for slag, which has been utilized for structural fill and could be encountered during excavation activities, is also included in Attachment B . Creosote is a chemical commonly used to preser ve wood railroad ties and could also be encountered by TPA workers performing maintenance o n railroad tracks. Finally, pr opane, butane, and coal are commonly transported in rail cars. Therefore, a SDS for these materials is also included in Attachment B . Note that this is a dynamic document: should any additional che micals be introduced or discovered during environmental, site maintenance or railrelat ed activities, the SDS will be added to Attachment B , as necessary. Further, some of the SDS apply to a pure form of the various compounds detected in the soils at the site. The actua l concentrations of these chemicals in the site soil is substantially lower. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 323.1.2 Physical Hazards The potential physical hazards associated with site maintenance and railrelated activities include: Slips, trips, and falls; Exposure to extreme outside temperatures and weather; Equipment hazards; Noise; Dust and fumes; Injury from tools, equipment, rotating parts; Electrical hazards; Buried and overhead hazards; Railroadspecific hazards; and Driving to, from, and around the site (including working in tra fficked areas). It is possible that additional hazards may be encountered based on the various tasks at hand. It will be the responsibility of TPA's management to identify and address additional hazards on a \"per task or job\" basis. If a new job or task not mentioned in this HASP is required, then a job safety analysis (JSA) may need t o be conducted prior to the sta rt of various tasks. Safety meetings will be conducted with all staff in attendance, before the star t of any new task, or when any significant personnel or other changes (such as a swift change in weather, for example) occur. Updated information relating to physical hazards will be presen ted during these meetings to familiarize the crew with potential hazards, discuss new situat ions, and assess how the associated risks can be managed. Further, good housekeeping practices wil l be employed to manage other risks potentially resulting from clutter and inattention to det ail. In addition, internal field audits may be randomly conducted to do cument adherence to procedures d escribed herein. 3.1.3 Biological Hazards Biological hazards that may be encountered when conducting the planned maintenance and rail related activities inc lude the following: Poisonous snakes and spiders; Stinging insects such as chiggers, bees, wasps, etc.; Various viruses and diseases spread via animal to human contact , such as West Nile Virus or rabies; Various viruses and diseases spread via human to human contact, such as colds or the flu; Dermal contact with poison ivy, oak, and/or sumac; and Blood borne pathogens when administering first aid. First aid kits will be available onsite. It is crucial to not e that any site personnel who has significant allergies should co mmunicate that information to th e operations team they are working with, along with the location of their autoinjector pe n (such as an EpiPen) for use in case of going into anaphylactic shock from something that would cause such a reaction (like a bee sting, for example). Personnel who suffer from such allerg ies are responsible for providing their own autoinjector devices, as those are typically prescri ption based, as well as specific to their particular allergy.

Occupational hazards associated with the components of the chemicals of concern pres ent in the soil may exist, along with physical and biological hazards related to the environment al work, maintenance work, and railrelated operations work, which are also discussed in this section. 4.1 Chemical Hazards Exposure to chemicals through i nhalation, ingestion, or skin co ntact may result in health hazards to site workers. Hazards associated with exposure will be evaluat ed using OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) and the American Conference of Governmental Indus trial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Values (TLVs). Each 8hour , timeweighted abov cann ot be exp os e d. TP A m a y als o us e th e National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Lim its (RELs) where applicable. Although the OSHA PELs are the only exposure limits enforceable by law, the most stringent of exposure limits will be used as t he TPAenforced exposure crite ria during workrelated activities covered by this HASP. The following is a summary of the potential hazards created by the compounds that may be encountered during TPA's environm ental, maintenance and/or rail related activities. Contaminants of concern may incl ude various metals, semivolati le compounds [i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)], volatile organic compounds, and PCBs. Table 41 below contains chemical information and exposure limits for various chemicals that could be present at concentrations exceeding Project Action Limits (PALs) during fu ture maintenance and/or rail related work activities. It is possible that carbon monoxide m ay also be encountered from the use of various internal combustion e ngines (vehicular or otherwise) ; however, it is anticipated that since any such engine will be used outdoors, it is not expected that concentrations of concern will accumulate. With the use of any such engine, the engine should be positioned such that personnel are upwind of the engine exhaust. If other chemicals are encountered during the course of TPA's w ork activities, the SDS must be made available and added to Attachment B . Personnel must be trained in the hazards and use of chemicals. This training will be primarily accomplished throug h the review of this HASP.

Physical hazards that may be encountered include the following: Heat and cold stress, Lifting hazards, Slips, trips and falls, Working around heavy equipment, Drilling hazards, Excavation hazards, Noise, Use of hand and power tools, Buried hazards, Electrical hazards, Underground and overhead utilities, Railroadspecific hazards; and Travel to and from site. The following sections provide additional discussion concerning ea c h of the abov e poten tial physical hazards. 4.2.1 Heat Stress Depending upon the time of year, local weather conditions may p roduce an environment that will require restricted work schedules in order to protect employees from heat stress. Supervisors will observe workers for any potential symptoms of heat stress. Ada ptation of work schedules and training on recognition of heat stress conditions should help p revent heatrelated illnesses from occurring. Heat stress controls will be started at 70\u00b0F for pe rsonnel in protective clothing and at 90\u00b0F for personnel in regular w ork clothing. Heat stress preve ntion controls include: Allow workers to become acclimat ed to heat (three to six days); Provide rest breaks in a shaded o r airconditioned break area; Provide sun screen to prevent sun Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide Provide drinking water and/or ele ctrolytereplenishing fluids; and Keep ice readily available to rapidly cool site workers. The following Heat Stress Index should be used as a guide to ev aluate potential heat stress situations.

Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hypothermia are tw o types of cold injury that per sonnel must be protected against during the performance of field duties. The objective is to pr event the deep body temperature from falling below 96.8\u00b0 F and to prevent cold injury to body e xtremities. Two factors influence the development of a cold injury: t he ambient temperature and wind velocity. Reduced body temperature will very likely resu lt in reduced mental alertness , reduction in rational decision making, and/or loss of consciousn ess with the threat of death. Use appropriate cold weather clothing when temperatures are at or below 40 F as exposed skin surfaces must be protected. These protective items can include facemask, hand wear, and foot wear. Personnel will wear protective clothing appropriate for the level of cold and planned physical activity. The objective is to protect all parts of the body, w ith emphasis on the hands and feet. Eye protection against glare and ultraviolet light should be worn i n snowy and icy conditions. The work rate should not be so great as to cause heavy sweating that could result in wet clothing. If heavy work must be done, opportunities for rest breaks will be provided where workers have the opportunity to change into dry cl othing. Conversely, plan work activities to minimize time spent sitting or standing still. Rest breaks should be taken in a wa rm, dry area. Windbreaks can also be used to shield the work area fro m the cooling effects of wind. If extreme coldrelated weather conditions occur, TPA field per sonnel will take the following precautions: Wear adequate insulated clothing when the air temperature drops below 40\u00b0F; Reduce work periods in extreme conditions to allow adequate res t periods in a warm area; Change clothes when work clothes become wet; and Avoid caffeine (which has diuretic and circulatory effects). 4.2.3 Lifting Hazards Field personnel may be exposed to injury caused by lifting heav ier objects and various pieces of large or unwieldy equipment. All TPA employees will be trained in the proper methods for lifting heavy and/or large equipment and are cautioned against lifting objects that are too heavy or too big for one person. Proper lif ting techniques include the foll owing: Keep feet approximately shoulder width apart; Bend at the knees; Tighten abdominal 9/22/20 rev2. docx 49 Lift with the legs; Keep the load close to the body; Keep the back upright; and Use the buddy system for larger or heavy pieces of equipment. 4.2.4 Slips, Trips and Falls The most common hazards encountered for workers outside vehicle cabs during site environmental, maintenance or railrelated activities is expect ed to be slips, trips and falls. TPA workers are trained to use commo n sense to avoid these hazards such as using work boots/safety shoes with nonskid soles. When working on slippery surfaces, t asks will be planned to decrease the risk of slipping via avoiding the slippery areas, if possible, or utilizing engineering controls. Engineering controls may involve the placement of supplemental material such as boards, gravel, or ice melt may be utilized to mitigate slippery conditions. O ther engineering controls may involve t h e u s e o f f o o t g e a r t r a c t i o n c o n t r o l d e v i c e s . T A P w o r k e r s w i l l avoid slippery surfaces, use engineering controls as appropriate, not hurry, and maintain go od housekeeping. 4.2.5 Buried Hazards Whenever the ground surface is penetrated, the potential for co ntacting buried hazards exists. During the planning/mobilization phase, prior to excavation act ivities, TPA personnel will establish the location of underground utility lines (gas, electrical, tel ephone, fiber optic cable, etc.) and/or substructures or other potential buried hazardous items. This may be conducted by review of historic utility and substructure maps, private utility locates , ground penetrating radar, or other technologies. If there is any evidence of utilities or subsurf ace objects/structures, excavation activities will either need to b e relocated or excavation shoul d proceed carefully. If activities cannot be offset, measures will be taken to remove, disconnect, and/or protect the utilities and/or subsurface structures and/or obj ects. Every reasonable effort will be made to clear the area of intrusive work prior to initiati on of excavation activities. 4.2.6 Electrical Hazards It may be possible that overhead power lines will be in proxima te locations during environmental, maintenance or railrelated activities. At least a 20 foot cle arance must be maintained from overhead power lines. No equipment such as dump trucks should be moved while buckets are in the upright position. Field personnel performing electrical wo rk are required to be appropriately trained to work on the electrical systems in question prior to start of work. Authorization from Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx equired prior to any electrica l work or work near overhead power lines. When using extension cords, all workers will ensure that they a re in good working condition, are correctly rated for use, and do not contain abrasions such that bare wires could be exposed to the environment. Extension cords will not be used in wet areas wit hout plugging the extension cord into a ground fault circuit in terrupter (GFCI). GFCIs will det ect a short circuit and cut power. 4.2.7 Heavy Equipment Operations Heavy equipment must be operated in a safe manner and be proper ly maintained such that operators and ground personnel are protected. Requirements for Operators Only qualified, trained, and auth orized operators are allowed t o operate equipment; Seat belts will be used at all ti mes in all equipment and truck s; If ground personal are endangered by equipment, operators will temporarily stop work whenever ground personnel or other equipment enter their work a rea; work will resume only when the area has been cleared; No personnel may ride on equipmen t other than the Authorized Op erator; No personnel may be carried or lifted in the buckets or working \"arms\" of the equipment; and Spotters will be used when ground personnel are in the vicinity of heavy equipment work areas and/or when an operator is backing equipment near other s tructures or congested area. Requirements for Ground Personnel All ground personnel must wear hivisibility orange or green pr otective vests, shirts, jackets, or equivalent in work areas with any operating heavy equipment; Ground personnel will stay outside of the swing zone or work ar ea of any operating equipment; Ground personnel may only enter t he swing or work area of any o perating equipment when: o They have attracted the operators attention and made eye contac t; o The operator has idled the equi pment down and grounded all exte nsions; and o The operator gives the ground pers onnel permission to approach. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 411 Ground personnel shall never walk or position themselves betwee n any fixed object and running equipment or between two running pieces of equipment. Equipment Maintain operations manuals at the site for each piece of equip ment that is present and in use; Ensure operators are familiar with the manual for the equipment and operate the equipment within the parameters of the manual; Ensure all equipment is provided with rollover protection syst ems; Verify that seatbelts are present and functional in all equipme nt; Prohibit the use of equipment that has cab glass which is broke n or missing; Ensure that backup alarms are f unctional on all trucks and equi pment; Require all extensions such as buc kets, blades, forks, etc. to be grounded when not in use; and Require brakes to be set and wheel s chocked (when applicable) w hen not in use. Daily inspections of equipment will be performed. Equipment de emed to be unsafe as a result of daily inspection will not be used until required repairs or mai ntenance occurs. During maintenance/repair, ensure that motors are turned off, all exte nsions are grounded or securely blocked, controls are in a neutra l position, and the brakes are set. 4.2.8 Drilling Safety Prior to any intrusive work, as previously mentioned above, the location of underground utilities, such as sewer, telephone, gas, water and electric lines must be determined and plainly staked. Necessary arrangements must be made with the utility company or owner for the protection, removal or relocation of the underground utilities. In such ci rcumstances, excavation will be done in a manner that does not endang er the field personnel engaged in the work or the underground utility. Utilities left in place will be protected by barricad ing, shoring, suspension or other measures, as necessary. The use of unsafe or defective equipment is not permitted. Equ ipment must be inspected regularly. If found to be defective, equipment must be immediately removed from use and either repaired or replaced prior to resuming work with that equipment. Field per sonnel will be familiar with the location of firstaid kits and fi re extinguishers. Telephone n umbers for emergency assistance must be prominently posted and kept current. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 412Good housekeeping conditions will be observed in and around the work areas. Suitable storage places will be provided for all materials and supplies. Pipe, drill rods, etc. must be securely stacked on solid, level sills. Work surfaces, platforms, stairways, wa lkways, scaffolding, and access ways will be kept free of obstructions. All debris will be collected and stored in piles or containers for removal and disposal. The area of the site to undergo intrusive activity must be walk ed over with the drillers and/or heavy equipment operators to identify all work locations, as well as verifying all marked utilities are seen by those doing the intrusive work. In areas where utilities have been identified or may be suspect ed, predrilling clearance such as hand augering, hand excavation (with shovels or posthole digge rs), or airknifing to a depth of at least 5' below ground surface (BGS) may be required. Project m anagement will provide guidance in those instances on what has been determined as an acceptable means of clearing drilling locations. It should be noted that if the soil lithology chang es to gravel within those 5 feet, that may be an indication of a utility trench and extreme caution sh ould be taken OR the drilling location should be offset 5 horizontal feet from the original location. Should three consecutive attempts be made without success to offset a particular drilling location, the field personnel should stop and contact management for further instruction. Special precaution must be taken when using a drill rig on a si te within the vicinity of electrical power lines and other overhead utilities. Electricity can shoc k, burn and cause death. When overhead electrical power lines exist at or near a drilling sit e, all wires will be considered dangerous. A check will be made for sagging power lines before a site is e ntered. Power lines will not be lifted to gain entrance. The appropriate utility company will be cont acted and a request will be made that it lift or raise, or c ut off power to the lines. The area around the drill rig will be inspected before the dril l rig mast is raised at a site in the vicinity of power lines. The minimum dis tance from any point on the dri ll rig to the nearest power line will be measured when the mast is raised or is being raised. The ma st will not be raised and the drill rig will not be operated if this distance is less than 20 feet, bec ause hoist lines and overhead power lines can be moved toward e ach other by the wind. Before the mast is raised, personnel will be cleared from the i mmediate area, with the exception of the operator and a helper, when necessary. A check will be mad e to ensure safe clearance from energized power lines or equipment (minimum 20foot clearance). Unsecured equipment must be removed from the mast and cables, mud lines and catline ropes m ust be adequately secured to the mast before raising. After it is raised, the mast must be secu red to the rig in an upright position with steel pins. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 4134.2.9 Excavation Safety excavating, the locat ion of underground utilities, suc h as sewer, telephone , gas, water and electric lines must be identified and plainly marked. Necessar y arrangements must be made with the utility company or owner for t he protection, removal or rel ocation of the underground utilities. In such circumstances, excavation will be done in a manner that does not endanger the field personnel engaged in the work or the underground utility. Util ities left in place will be protected by barricading, shoring, suspension or other measures, as neces sary. The use of unsafe or defective equipment is not permitted. Equ ipment must be inspected regularly. If found to be defective, equipment must be immediately removed from use and either repaired or replaced prior to resuming work with that equipment. Field per sonnel will be familiar with the location of firstaid kits and fi re extinguishers. Telephone n umbers for emergency assistance must be prominently posted and kept current. The area of the site to undergo intrusive activity must be walk ed over with the heavy equipment operators to identify all work locations, as well as verifying all marked utilities are seen by those doing the intrusive work. While the material being excavated is generally not expected to exhibit noticeable signs of impact in the field, if the material being excavated or graded exhibit s any of the following characteristics, then TPA personnel shall stop exc avation/grading activities wit hin the immediate area and contact the TPA Environmental Department, so that the proper management p r o c e d u r e s c a n b e established: Visible staining; Visible free product; or Unusual odors emanating from the excavation are detected in vic inity of the excavation. The TPA Environmental Department will determine the appropriate course of action, with regard to the visibly impacted material. If additional air monitoring is warranted, the air monitoring procedures are described below in Section 7. 4.2.10 Use of Hand Tools and Portable Power Tools Hand tools will be kept in good repair and used only for their designed purposes. Proper protective eyewear will be worn when using hand tools and portable power t ools. Unguarded sharpedged or pointed tools will not be carried in field personnel's pockets. The use of tools with mushroomed heads, split or defective handles, worn parts, or other defects will not be permitted. Inspect all tools prior to startup or use to identify any defects. Tools that have become unsafe will be Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx be discarded and repl aced. Throwing or dropping of tools from one level to another will not be permitted; rather, contai ners and hand lines will be used for transporting tools from one level to another if working at heig hts. Nonsparking tools will be used in atmospheres where sources of ignition may cause fire or explosion. Electricpowered sho p and hand tools will be of the doubleinsulated, shockproof type, or they will be effectively grounded. Power tools will be oper ated only by designated personnel who are familiar and trained with their use. When not in use, tools will not be left on scaffolds, ladders or overhead working surfaces. 4.2.11 Noise Exposure to high levels of noise may occur when working near he avy equipment. Also, depending upon where the work is being perf ormed, local equipment (e.g., airports, factory machines, etc.) may produce high levels of noise. A good indication of the nee d for hearing protection is when verbal communication is difficult at a distance of 23 feet. P ersonnel will be provided with ear plugs and/or earmuffs when exposed to noise levels in excess of the 8 hour Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 90 decibels. 4.2.12 Railroad Specific Hazards Working in close proximity to railroad facilities is inherently hazardous. In addition to the guidelines set forth herein, TPA personnel working in or near rail lines w ill follow all Federal Railroad Administration Rules. The following safety rules will a pply when working near railway tracks: Personnel shall be alert to train movement and shall expect the movement of trains, engines, cars, or other movable equipment at any time, on any track, and in any direction, even cars that appear to be stationary or in storage. Stay at least 50 f eet away from the ends of stationary cars when crossing the track, and never climb on, un der or between cars. To cross tracks, personnel shall look both ways, and if the tracks are c lear, walk at a right angle across the tracks. Personnel shall not rely on others to protect them from train m ovement. The responsibility is theirs for safety on the railway. Personnel shall not stand on the track in front of an approachi ng engine, car or other equipment. Personnel shall be aware of the location of structures or obstr uctions where clearances are close. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 415 Personnel should not stand or walk on railroad tracks, either b etween the rails or on the ends of ties unless absolutely necessa ry. Personnel shall stay clea r of tracks whenever possible. No work activities or processes are allowed within 50 feet of t he track centerline while trains are passing through the work site, unless specifically authoriz ed. Personnel shall always, where possible, stand at least 20 feet back from the track(s), to prevent injury from flying debris or loose rigging. Also, personnel shall observe the tra in as it passes and be prepared to take evasive action in the event of an emergency. Personnel shall not remain in a vehicle that is within 50 feet of a passing train, and shall not drive near moving trains. Perso nnel shall move vehicles away f rom the tracks at least 50 feet unless specifically authorized, or park the vehicle away from t he tracks and walk to a safe distance whenever trains pass. Personnel shall not stand on or between adjacent tracks in mult iple track territory when a train is passing. Personnel sha ll be especially alert in yards and terminal areas as engines may be pushing cars, cars may be moving without any engine attached and engines/cars change tracks often. Personnel shall not walk, stand or sit on the rails. As the ra il surface can be extremely slippery, personnel must step over the rails when crossing tracks. Perso nnel shall also be aware railway ties can also be slippery and th at railway ballast can shift wh ile walking on top of it. 4.2.13 Work Zone Traffic Control Personnel will exercise caution when working near areas of vehi cular traffic. Work zones will be identified by the use of delineators (traffic cones, flags, veh icles, DOT approved devices, temporary or permanent fencing, and/or safety barrier tape). Personnel w ill wear high visibility vests, shirts, jackets, or equivalent when working in these areas. Depending on frequency, proximity, and nature of traffic, a flag person may also be utilized. 4.2.14 Vehicle Use Personnel must use caution when driving to, from, and across th e site, paying special attention to other site traffic, as well as weather and road conditions. He avy equipment should be transported during nonrush hour traffic. 4.3 Biological Hazards Site environmental, maintenance and railrelated operations may expose workers working outside vehicle cabs to other hazards such as poisonous plants, insects , animals, and indigenous pathogens. Protective clothing and possibly respiratory protection, and be ing capable of identifying poisonous Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 416plants, animals, and insects, can greatly reduce the chances of exposure. Thoroughly washing any exposed body parts, clothing, and equipment will also protect a gainst infections. Avoiding contact with biological hazards is the best way to prevent potential ad verse health effects. Recognition of potential hazards is essential. When avoidance is impractical or impossible, PPE, personal hygiene, good general health and awareness must be used to prevent adver se effects. If working in wooded/grassy areas, use appropriate insect repellants (contain ing DEET and/or Permethrin) and apply them per the manufacturers' directions. The following is a list of biological hazards that may possibly be encountered while per forming site environmental, ma intenance and railrelated job tasks: BIOLOGICAL HAZARD and LOCATION CONTROL MEASURES Snakes typically are found in underbrush and tall grassy areas. If a snake is encountered, stay calm and look around; there may be other snakes. Turn around and walk away on the same path you used to approach the area. If bitten by a snake, wash and immobilize the injured area, keeping it lower than the heart if possible. Seek medical attention immediately. DO NOT apply ice, cut the wound or apply a tourniquet. Carry the victim or have him/her walk slowly if the victim must be moved. Try to identify the snake: note color, size, patterns and markings. Poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac typically are found in brush or wooded areas. They are more commonly found in mo i s t a r e a s o r a l o n g t h e e d g e s o f w o o d e d areas. Become familiar with the identity of these plants. Wear protective clothing that covers exposed skin and clothes. Avoid contact with plants and the outside of protective clothing. If skin contacts a plant, wash the area with soap and water immediately. If the reaction is severe or worsens, seek medical attention. Exposure to blood borne pathogens may occur when rendering first aid or CPR, or when coming into contact with medical or other potentially infectious material or when coming into contact with landfill waste or waste streams containing such infectious material. Training is required before a task involving potential exposure is performed. Exposure controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) area required. Hepatitis B vaccination must be offered bef ore the person participates in a task where exposure is a possibility. Bees, spiders and other stinging insects may be encountered almost anywhere and may present a serious hazard particularly to people who are allergic. Watch for and avoid nests. Keep exposed skin to a minimum. Carry a kit if you have had allergic reactions in the past and inform the TPA management and/or the buddy. If a stinger is present, remove it carefully with tweezers. Watch for allergic reaction; seek medical attention if a reaction develops. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 417BIOLOGICAL MEASURES Ticks typically are in wooded areas, bushes, tall grass and brush. Ticks are black, black and red or brown and can be up to one quarter inch in size. Avoid tick areas. Wear tightly woven, lightcolored clothing with pants tucked into boots or socks. Spray outside of clothing with insect repellent containing permethrin. Check yourself for ticks often. If bitten, carefully remove tick wit h tweezers. Report the bite to TPA management. Look fo r symptoms of Lyme disease that include a rash that looks like a bullseye and chills, fever, headache, fatigue, stiff nec k or bone pain. If symptoms appear, seek medical attention. As long as community spread of the COVID19 virus is deemed a c oncern by state and local public health officials, to protect against this spread, if site worke rs must work within close proximity of other workers, face mask coverings must be utilized while worki ng within the TPA facility. Further, TPA workers shall regularly wash hands with soap or utilize han d sanitizer during the course of the work day. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 515 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles will be used to p rotect TPA workers from potential contamination hazards. Level D PPE is expected to be used for most activities that do not involve direct prolonged exposure to impacted soils. Howev er, Modified Level D may be applicable if TPA workers are pe rforming intrusive environmenta l or maintenance work within impacted soils for extended time periods. For purposes of this HASP, \"intrusive maintenance work\" is defined as work performed by TPA workers entering a tr ench or excavation that subsequently involves direct con tact with impacted soils. Intr usive maintenance work does not include grading/excavation work performed by workers outside a trench or excavation/grading work inside enclosed vehicle/equipment cabs. 5.1 Level D Protection When the atmosphere contains no known hazards and work function s preclude splashes, immersions or the potential for unexpected inhalation of or con tact with hazardous levels of chemicals, Level D protection may be used. Level D PPE will be applicable for all job tasks performed by workers that are ty pically inside enclosed vehicle cabs and if the workers leave the cabs and remain in the operational area. The basic Level D doe s not provide respiratory protection and only provides mini mal dermal protection. The Le vel D ensemble consists of the following: Work clothes that may consist of a short or longsleeved cotton shirt and cotton pants, cotton overalls; Sturdy, highankle work boots, appropriate for the assigned tas ks; Safety glasses with side shields; Hearing protection, as necessary; Hand protection, as appropriate; Hard hat will be required at all times for all personnel outsid e of vehicles cabs unless pre authorized not to wear a hard hat due to operational difficulti es; and Hivisibility vests, shirts, jackets, or the equivalent will be required at all times for all personnel. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 525.2 Modified Level D Protection As mentioned above, construction activities involving intrusive environmental work as defined above may be performed by workers in upgraded Modified Level D PPE. If required, Modified Level D protection con sists of the following: Disposable overalls such as p olyethylenecoated Tyvek; Latex, vinyl, or nitrite inner gloves; Nitrile outer gloves (ta ped to outer suit); Chemicalprotective overboots (taped to outer suit). However, if chemicalprotective overboots create increased slip/trip/fall hazards, then standa rd leather or rubber work boots could be used, but visible soils from the sides and botto ms of the boots must be removed immediately after working with impacted soils; Steel toe/steel shank, highankle work boots, appropriate for t he assigned tasks; Hard hat; Safety glasses with side shields or goggles; Hearing protection, as necessary; and Dust mask. 5.3 Level C Protection No activities requiring Level C p rotection will be performed by TPA personnel. If such an activity is contemplated, a full JSA and PPE review will be performed, a nd an appropriate PPE program will be implemented under a modified HASP. 5.4 First Aid, Emergency and Safety Equipment The following first aid, emergency and safety equipment will be maintained in easily accessible areas throughout the TPA facility: A portable eye wash; Fire extinguishers as enforced by OSHA in 29 CFR 1926 Subpart F ; Industrial firstaid kit (one 16unit that complies with Americ an National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z308A for e very 25 persons or less); Blood borne pathogen precaution kit with CPR mouth shield; eaner and towels; and American Red Cross First Aid and CPR Instruction Manuals. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 616 PERSONNEL TRAINING AND STANDARD SAFETY PROCEDURES A safety orientation will be co nducted for all TPA employees. The training will involve review of this HASP (and documenting comple tion of review) prior to initi ation of work tasks for all employees and regular safety tailgate meetings during the cours e of regular operations. An Acknowledgement Form for documenting completion of the initial training activities is included in Attachment A. In addition to the training requirements presented in this HASP , TPA employees involved in rail related operations will be required to receive the applicable t raining specified in 49 CFR, which includes regular training on an annual to triannual basis. 6.1 Standard Safety Procedures This section describes the standard safety procedures that TPA requires all onsite personnel to follow during site activities. 6.1.1 General Safety Work Practices All TPA employees will observe the following general safety wor k practices: Health and safety tailgate briefings will occur to introduce ne w activities, any new safety issues, and emergency egress routes for work areas; any signifi cant change (added personnel, change in scope, or change in field conditions) will trigger a second (or more) tailgate meeting to address whatever change occurred; No food, drink, or tobacco prod ucts will be allowed near impact ed soils; Loose clothing, hair, and/or j ewelry will not be permitted arou nd moving or rotating equipment; The \"buddy system\" will be implemented as necessary whereby a p air of coworkers watches out for each other while i n proximity of potential phys ical work hazards; and Good housekeeping of all work a reas will be maintained on an on going basis. 6.1.2 Hand Safety This standard is intended to protect TPA employees from activit ies that may expose them to injury. This standard provides information on recognizing thos e conditions that require personal protective equipment (PPE) or sp ecific work practices to reduce the risk of hand injury. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 62Appropriate gloves must be worn when persons work with material s or equipment that presents the potential for hand injury due to sharp edges, corrosives, f lammable and irritating materials, extreme temperatures, splinters, etc. Guidelines for Working With and Around Equipment (Hand Tools, P ortable Powered Equipment): Employees should be trained in the use of all tools. Keep hand and power tools in good repair and use them only for the task for which they were designed. Inspect tools before use and remo ve damaged or defective tools from service. Operate tools in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. Do not remove or bypass a guard ing device for any reason. Keep surfaces and handles clean a nd free of excess oil to preve nt slipping. Wear proper PPE, including gloves, as necessary. Do not carry sharp tools in pockets. Clean tools and return to the to olbox or storage area upon comp letion of a job. Before applying pressure, ensure t hat wrenches have a good bite . Brace yourself by placing your body in the proper position so y ou will not fall if the tool slips. Make sure hands and fingers have sufficient clearance in the ev ent the tool slips. Always pull on a wrench, never push. When working with tools overhead, place tools in a holding rece ptacle when not in use. Do not throw tools from place to place or from person to person , or drop tools from heights. Inspect all tools prior to start up or use to identify any defe cts. Powered hand tools should not be capable of being locked in the ON position. Require that all powerfastening devices be equipped with a saf ety interlock capable of activation only when in contact with the work surface. Do not allow loose clothing, long hair, loose jewelry, rings, a nd chains to be worn while working with power tools. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 63 Do not use cheater pipes. Make provisions to prevent machines from restarting through pro per lockout/tag out. Guidelines for Cutting Tools: Always use the specific tool for the task. Tubing cutters, sni ps, self retracting knives, concealed blade cutters, and related tools are taskspecific an d minimize the risk of hand injury. Fixed openblade knives are prohibited from use. Examples of f ixed openblade knives include pocket knives, multitools, hunting knives, and standar d utility knives. When utilizing cutting tools, personnel will observe the follow ing precautions to the fullest extent possible: Use the correct tool and corr ect size tool for the job. Cut in a direction away from you rself and not toward other work ers in the area. Maintain the noncutting hand and arm toward the body and out of the direction of the cutting tool if it were to slip out of the material being cut. Ensure that the tool is sharp and clean; dirty and dull tools t ypically cause poor cuts and more hazard than a sharp, clean cutting tool. Store these tools correctly with covers in place or blades retr acted, as provided by the manufacturer. On tasks where cutting may be very frequent or last all day, co nsider Kevlar\u00ae gloves in the PPE evaluation for the project. Do not remove guards on paper cutters. 6.1.3 Respiratory Protection If an upgrade to Level C PPE is required, a full JSA and PPE re view will be performed, and an appropriate PPE program will be implemented under a modified HA SP. The action levels that would trigger upgraded respirator y protection are presented in Section 7 below. 6.1.4 Personal Hygiene Practices TPA employees must pay strict attention to sanitation and perso nal hygiene requirements to adequately control personal cont amination. The following instr uctions will be discussed and Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 64 During work activities, never put anything in the mouth, includ ing fingers; All employees must wash their hands, forearms, face, and neck b efore eating, drinking, smoking or using the restroom. A foot pump handwashing station containing soap/paper towels will be located on site and available to workers. Alter natively, wet wipes could be utilized for washing; Smoking is prohibited, except in designated areas; and At the end of the day, all empl oyees should shower upon leaving work. 6.1.5 Other Standard Safety Procedures 6.1.5.1 Fire Safety All flammable liquids will be used only for their intended purp ose and stored and handled only in approved containers. Portable containers must be the approv ed red safety containers equipped with flame arresters a nd selfclosing lids. All trans fers of flammable liquids must be made with the containers grounded or bonded. Also, gasoline co ntainers will be clearly labeled and storage areas (if applicable) will be posted with \"No Smoki ng\" signs. Fire extinguishers will be installed in all areas that contain flammable liquids. 6.1.5.2 Illumination All work is planned for daylight hours. No special requirement s are anticipated. However, should any work take place outdoors aft er daylight hours, suitable lig hting will be required. 6.1.5.3 Sanitation Adequate water and toilet facilit ies will be provided near the work areas in compliance with the OSHA 1926.51 standard. Any container used to distribute drinki ng water shall be clearly marked and not used for any other purpose. Single drinking cups will be supplied, both a sanitary container for the unused cups and a receptacle for disposal of the used cups will also be provided. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 717 CONTINGENT EXPOSURE 7.1 Contingent Air Monitoring for Volatiles and Combustible Gases If conditions in certain work area(s) warrant, the following su rveillance/monitoring program will be employed to ensure the adequacy of the level of TPA worker p rotection. The site conditions that would warrant air monitoring are listed above in Section 4 .2.9, and include: Visible soil staining; Visible free product in subsurface soil; or Unusual odors emanating from the excavation are detected in vic inity of the excavation. If air monitoring is warranted, an Environmental Professional ( EP) will monitor the work site for combustible gas concentrations and organic vapors. Calibration of all monitoring equipment will be performed in accordance with the manufacturers' procedures b y trained personnel. The appropriate TPA supervisor(s) w ill be notified immediately of a ny contaminant levels that could trigger an upgrade in PPE or caus e a suspension of work activit ies. One or more of the following directreading instruments may be used to aid in this evaluation. Photoionization Detectors (PID) and Flame Ionization Detectors (FID) will measure nonspecific organic gases and vapors. Combustible Gas Indicators (CGI) wil l detect explosive atmospheres. Oxygen (O2) meters will detect fluctuations in oxygen concentra tions. These instruments should be calibrated or bump tested reg ularly and whenever the measure ments may be erratic. 7.1.1 Combustible Gas and Oxygen Deficiency / Excess Monitoring Explosive gas concentrations are not expected to exceed 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL). Should the need be indicated for air monitoring, action guidanc e for the CGI/O2 meter responses is contained in Table 71 below. Table 71 CGI/OxygenMeterAction Levels Meter Response Action CGI response 0%10% LEL Continue normal operations CGI initial response >10% and <20% LEL Eliminate all sources of ignition from the work area; temporarily retreat from work area for 1530 minutes and then monitor area again CGI response after 1530 min. >10% and <20% LEL Retreat from work area; notify TPA management CGI response >20% Discontinue operations; retreat from work area Oxygen level <19.5% Retreatfrom workarea; notify TPA management Oxygen level >23.5% Retreat from work area; notify TPA management 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 727.1.2 Organic warranted due to nonstandard emergency conditions, realtim e monitoring for organic vapor concentrations in the breathing zone will be conducted during f ield operations with a PID equipped with a 10.2 or 11.7electron volt (eV) probe. Measure ments will be made where ground intrusive work is being performed. The instrument will be calibrated using ultrahigh purity air and isobutylene vapor of known concentration before each use. Air calibration measurements will be documented in writing and filed appropriat ely. Action guidance for PID responses is contained in Table 72 below. Table 72 PID ActionLevels forGeneralSiteWork Meter Response in BreathingZ one (sustained concen., for minimum of 3 m inutes) Action Required <5 ppm above background Use Level D or Modified Level D PPE >5 ppm above background Cease work, notify supervisor and investigate source. >50 ppm above background Stop work If air concentrations of organic vapors are greater than 5 ppm above background in the breathing zone continuously for a 3minute period, personnel will stop wo rk, retreat from the area, and allow time (at least 15 minutes) for vapors to dissipate. If s ubsequent monitoring indicates that concentrations still consistently exceed 5 ppm, workers will st op work and retreat from the area. TPA supervision will investigate the source and establish next steps. These action levels are based on the assumption that the major volatile constituents of concern are benzene and naphthalene, whi ch are the most common volatile constituents previously identified in the soils at the TPA facility. 7.2 Physical Conditions Monitoring Site workers will be monitored by TPA management for signs of w eatherrelated symptoms from exposure to excessive heat or cold. Whenever the air temperature exceeds 70\u00b0F for personnel wearing chemical protective clothing or 90\u00b0F for personnel wearing regular work clothes, TPA managem ent will assess conditions that may cause heat stress in site workers. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 818 SITE CONTROL MEASURES To provide for the protection of public health and safety and m inimize the possibility of transferring impacted soils from the site, contaminant control procedures are required. These procedures will consist of site control measures (i.e., delinea tion of work zones, communications, and site security) and decontamin ation procedures. Decontamina tion may be necessary for both personnel and equipment, if regu lar contact with visibly impact ed soils and/or groundwater occurs during the course of site environmental work. Contamina nts that may be uncovered during environmental soil regrading operations must not be tra nsferred outside the project area unless properly containerized, and must be removed from clothin g, personnel, and equipment prior to relocation. 8.1 Environmental Site Control Measures Site control can be achieved by delineating the appropriate wor k zones, providing appropriate communication, and establishing site security. 8.1.1 Environmental Work Zone Delineation To control the transfer of hazardous substances from the work s ites and allow for proper protection of TPA environmental employees and subcontractors, w ork zones will be established. The work zones will include: Exclusion Zone (EZ); Contamination Reduction Zone (CRZ); and Support Zone (SZ). A description of each of the abo ve work zones is presented belo w. Exclusion Zone (EZ) Contamination does or could exis t in this zone. Only properly authorized and trained individuals (refer to Section 6.0) wearing appropriate PPE will be allowed to enter and work in this zone. Workers and others entering the EZ must wear, at a minimum, Lev el D protection. An entry and exit point for personnel and equipment will be established at t he periphery of the EZ (between the EZ and the CRZ) to adequately regulate the flow of personne l and equipment. Contamination Reduction Zone (CRZ) Between the EZ and the SZ will be the CRZ, which will provide a transition between the potentially contaminated EZ and unimpacted S Z. The CRZ (located upwind of the EZ, if possible) will be a corridor leading from the EZ and will serve as a buffer to furt her reduce the probability of the SZ 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 82becoming contaminated. Exit from EZ will only be allowed t hrough this CRZ. The CRZ will provide additional assurance that the physical transfer of cont aminating substances on people, equipment, and/or in the air will be limited through a combinat ion of decontamination and zone restrictions. Within this zone, TPA environmental employees and subcontractors may perform personal decontamination (e.g., face and hand washing), and cer tain PPE and small equipment decontamination. Buckets or wash basins for boot washing and e quipment decontamination will be stationed on a sheet of plasti c, the boundaries of which wil l constitute the CRZ. Support Zone (SZ) The Support Zone will be considered a noncontaminated area. T he location of support facilities in the SZ will be upwind of the EZ (where possible) and readily accessible to the nearest road. The field office/support facilitie s, equipment vehicles, a firs t aid station and a visitors/personnel entry and exit log for the work site will be located in this zo ne. Potentially contaminated personal clothing, equipment and samples are not permitted in this zone unless properly containerized. 8.1.2 Environmental Decontamination Procedures Decontamination of environmental TPA employees, contractors, an d equipment leaving the EZ will be performed to control hum an exposure to hazardous substa nces and to minimize the spread of contamination to surrounding areas. The primary purp ose of the CRZ is to provide a s e t l o c a t i o n f o r p e r f o r m i n g l i m i t e d p e r s o n n e l d e c o n t a m i n a t i o n a n d c e r t a i n P P E a n d s m a l l equipment decontamination. 8.1.2.1 Environmental Personnel Decontamination Persons leaving the EZ must pass through the CRZ and follow dec ontamination procedures before entering the SZ. Hand tools and other sampling equipment used in the EZ and reusable PPE (boots, safety glasses, etc.) will be appropriately cleaned pri or to removal from the site each day. The stepbystep sequence for pe rsonnel decontamination is as f ollows: Remove boot covers (if applicable) at the boot washing station and place in the disposal container provided; Wash outer gloves and chemical r esistant boots (if used) at the boot washing station; Remove wrist tape (if applicable ) and outer gloves and place in appropriate container; Remove ankle tape (if applicable) and disposable coveralls (if applicable) and place in the appropriate container; Remove respirator (if applicable ) and place in designated locat ion in the Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 83 Remove inner gloves and discard t o the appropriate container; a nd Wash hands and face before proceeding to the SZ. Respirators (if warn) must be decontaminated after each use by the personnel who previously wore them. All TPA employees and subcontractors are required t o take a thorough soap and water shower at the end of each workday. If monitoring or a ge neral exposure assessment indicates that an employee has become contaminated, the employe e or subcontractor will notify the TPA management as soon as the contaminated state has been d iscovered. 8.1.2.2 Environmental Equipment Decontamination Equipment leaving the EZ must be decontaminated either within t he CRZ or at the central decontamination area. Small equipment, such as hand tools, wil l be thoroughly decontaminated within the CRZ before being placed in the SZ. The field tools may be scrubbed visually clean using a d e t e r g e n t s o l u t i o n ( A l c o n o x / L i q u i n o x ) w i t h w a t e r a n d a s t i f f , longbristled scrub brush. Following the solution scrubbing, the tools may be rinsed with distilled water or isopropyl alcohol. Vehicles working in an EZ will be decontaminated prior to leavi ng the site. The vehicle will be cleaned by sweeping excess soil and debris off the wheels. A h ighpressure sprayer will then be used to wash the wheels, if necessary. Each piece of equipment will be inspected after cleaning for so il remaining on the tires or elsewhere. Vehicles will be cleaned to the satisfaction of the appropriate TPA supervisor prior to e n t e r i n g t h e S Z o r l e a v i n g t h e s i t e . T P A e m p l o y e e s o r s u b c o n t r actors performing decontamination shall wear the a ppropriate level of PPE (refer to Section 5.0 above). 8.1.2.3 Environmental Waste Management Procedures TPA management will be responsible for overseeing the container ization and disposal of any field derived wastes from environmental activities. Contaminated or suspected contaminated field derived wastes shall be disposed of in accordance with all loca l, state, and/or federal regulations. Field derived wastes include decontamination rinse waters and o ther related decontamination generated wastes. Soils and groundwater expected to be encountered during samplin g or intrusive work found not to be contaminated, based on existing data, may be discharged t o the ground surface in the immediate vicinity of the monito ring well. However, any known or suspected to be contaminated soil (in small quantities) or groundwater will be containerized for future removal, likely in 55 gallon drums or other approved storage vessels. Depending on t he suspected contaminants, the recovered groundwater may be sent through one of the onsite gro undwater treatment units. However, the treatment unit must be designed to address the con taminants of concern in the Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 84groundwater being treated. Otherwise, the liquid must be stage d onsite for eventual offsite disposal at an approved facility. Impacted soil, if in drums, will be staged in an area designate d by TPA management for eventual disposal. For larger excavations, where excavated soil is stoc kpiled, it may be necessary to place soils on plastic and cover with plastic to control potential le achable runoff. The appropriate TPA supervisor(s) will provide the pr oper guidance necessary for ha ndling bulk soil piles. Any NAPL recovered via remediation systems or manual recovery e fforts will be properly containerized and either disposed of offsite as a recyclable ma terial, if possible, or as a hazardous waste. The receiving facility must be an approved facility. 8.2 Communications A loud and clear form of communication should be made available for TPA personnel to communicate with other appropriat e personnel during work. Site communication may be in the form of hand signals, voice, or other communication devices. A ll forms of communication should be understood by all workers on the Site prior to starting work . Offsite communications may be conducted with mobile phones or walkietalkies only if the atmo sphere has been deemed non explosive, or inside the cab of a stationary vehicle. 8.3 Site Security Access to the various work areas will be controlled with fencin g or other physical barriers. No site visitors will be allowed to travel unescorted by TPA or th eir representative around the project area.

Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 94Figure 92: Hospital Map 9.4 Accident and Emergency Medical Response All TPA employees will be aware of the location of first aid ki ts kept onsite. All vehicles used to transport injured persons to an offsite medical facility will b e provided with directions and a map to the medical facility. If treatment beyond first aid is required, emergency response p ersonnel will be contacted for assistance and transport. Before beginning site activities, th e TPA employee's supervisor will ensure that each site worker knows where the nearest emergency medical facilities are and how to get there. The closest hospital will be used in cases of li fethreatening emergencies. The telephone numbers of the local emergency services will be avail able at the project site, and TPA's management will brief workers on the procedures for calling for help in an emergency. TPA employees will inform TPA management of any medications, al lergies, or other medical information that may be applicable for their medical treatment. The employee's supervisor will supply this information to emer gency response personnel, and wi ll accompany the victim to the hospital, if possible. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 959.4.1 Chemical Exposure In case of accidental overexposu re to a hazardous material, gui delines shown in the table below will be followed. Table 92 Chemical Exposure Guidelines Type of Overexposure FirstAid Guidelines Skin Contact Skin: Wash/rinse the affected area thoroughly with copious amo unts of soap and water. Eyes: Eyes should be rinsed for at least 15 minutes following chemical contamination. Contact emergency response personnel if required, or transport victim to the hospital. Inhalation Move the victim to fresh air. Contact emergency response personnel if required, or transport victim to the hospital. Ingestion Contact Poison Control Center. Contact emergency response personnel, or transport victim to th e hospital. In the event of an incident with rail cars where potentially ha zardous materials are released to the environment, TPA employees shall not be involved in the act ive cleanup of the hazardous materials. Rather, TPA employees should immediately notify the appropriate local authorities by calling 911. The local authorities with specific training and experience in hazardous materials emergency response and cleanup will handle the cleanup of the h azardous materials that may have been released to the environment. 9.4.2 Decontamination During a Medical Emergency For minor medical problems or injuries, regular decontamination procedures will be followed. If emergency, lifesaving first aid and/or medical treatment are r equired, regular decontamination procedures may need to be abbreviated or omitted: Do not attempt to wash or rinse an unresponsive victim unless t he victim has been contaminated with an extremely toxic or corrosive chemical that may cause injury or loss of life to emergency response personnel; Outer garments can be removed if it does not cause a delay, int erfere with treatment, or aggravate the problem; PPE can be cut away and respiratory protective equipment must a lways be removed; and Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 96 If contaminated clothing cannot be safely removed, then the vic tim should be wrapped in a blanket or plastic sheeting to prevent contamination to th e inside of the ambulance and/or emergency response personnel. The TPA employee's supervisor will advise the medical staff as to the type of contamination possibly involved. 9.4.3 Small or Incipient Fire A small fire is defined as a fire that can be extinguished with an available type ABC fire extinguisher. An incipient fire is a fire that is small becaus e it has just started. In the event of a small or incipient fire, the fol lowing minimum actions will be taken: Evacuate nearby personnel from the area, if possible, to an upw ind location or to an area not affected by smoke or hazardo us decomposition products if an upwind location is not feasible; Attempt to extinguish fire using portable fire extinguisher or by smothering; Contact emergency response personnel, as needed, for any injuri es or exposures to hazardous decomposition products, or if fire cannot be put out; and After the fire has been extinguis hed, or emergency res ponse per sonnel have been contacted, notify the appr opriate TPA management. 9.4.4 Large Fire or Explosion An explosion, large fire or a small fire which cannot be exting uished is beyond the first line capabilities of TPA personnel. Professional emergency response personnel would be needed to provide emergency assistance for these types of incidents. In the event of a large fire, explosion or a small fire that cannot be ext inguished, the following mini mum actions will be taken: Evacuate all personnel from the site, if possible, to an upwind location, or to an area not affected by smoke or hazardous decomposition products if an upw ind location is not feasible; Perform a quick role call to a ccount for all site personnel; Contact the fire department; Contact emergency response personnel, as needed, for any injuri es or exposures to hazardous decomposition products; and Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 97 After emergency response personnel have been contacted, notify the appropriate TPA management. 9.4.5 Adverse Weather Conditions In the event of adverse weather conditions, TPA's management wi ll determine if work can continue without sacrificing the health and safety of TPA emplo yees. Threatening weather conditions will be monitored by the TPA management via radio, t elevision, internet, and/ or calls to the National Weather Service. Some of the conditions to be considered include: Potential for heat or cold stress, Limited visibility, Electrical storms, and Treacherous weatherrelated work ing conditions (i.e., heavy rai nfall, icy conditions causing slippery footing hazards, etc.). 9.4.6 First Aid for Heat Stress/Cold Stress First aid treatment for heat cramps includes shade, rest and fluid replacement. If available, the individual should drink electrolyte replacement fluids (e.g., G atorade, Sqwincher or 10K). The individual should recover within half an hour. First aid treatment for heat exhaustion includes cooling the victim, elevating the feet and fluid replacement. If the individual has not recovered within half a n hour, then transport the victim to the hospital for medical attention. Heat stroke is a medical emergency, requiring the immediate cooling of the victim and transport to the hospital for medica l treatment immediately. First aid treatment for frost nip and frostbite includes covering the affected area with warmth and retreating to a warm area. If the individual has not recov ered within half an hour, then transport the victim to the hosp ital for medical attention imme diately. First aid treatment for severe hypothermia includes handling the victim very gently; rough handling may set off of an irregular heartbeat. DO NOT attempt to rewarm the severely hypothermic victim; rewarming m ay cause the development of an irregular heartbeat. Frozen tissue is a medical emergency and the victim must receive medical att ention immediately. Contact emergency response personnel immediately or transport t he victim to the hospital. Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 98First aid treatment hypothermia includes using heat to raise the individual's body temperature. Heat may be applied to the victim in the form of heat packs, hot water bottles and blankets. If the individual has not recovered within half an h our, then transport the victim to the hospital for medical attention. 9.4.7 Snake Bites If bitten, lower the extremity below the heart to reduce the po ison's dissemination through the body. Remain calm, try to keep the heart rate reduced and seek medical attention immediately. Do not cut the wound or attempt to suck out the venom. Note an y physical features (e.g., shape of head and color or pattern on body) of the snake. 9.4.8 Animal Bites All bites should be treated as contaminated soft tissue injurie s. Bites should be washed immediately with large amounts of soap and water. If soap is n ot available, flush the wound with water. The severity and onset of any infection is dependent up on the number of organisms (viruses or bacteria) introduced into the wound. Washing saliv a out of the wound immediately will reduce the number of bacteria or viruses that can enter th e tissue. Medical attention must be sought if rabies is suspected or the individual has not had a recent tetanus booster. 9.4.9 Insect Bites and Stings Emergency care for insect bites and stings depends on the indiv idual's reaction. To treat a sting that results in a minor reaction, remove the stinger by gently scraping it off the skin. Do not try to grasp the sac or stinger, because this forces the remaining venom into the skin. Once the stinger has been removed, clea n the wound and surrounding area. Apply cold packs to slow the absorption of the venom and reduce pain and swelling. The trea tment for a severe reaction to insect stings includes the following: Confirm with the victim whether they are highly allergic to the insect that stung them, If victim has gone into anaphyla ctic shock, retrieve their epi pen or other autoinjector and administer per the directions as hastily as possible, Assuming the victim remains conscious, ask them to refrain from moving around, and to lie down, Immobilize the injured area immediately, If an extremity is involved, remove any rings or watch, Keep the affected part low, be low the level of the heart, Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. docx 99 Apply cold compresses to the affected area, If possible, try to identify the type of insect that inflicted the sting, Transport the victim to a medical facility immediately, continu ing supportive measures en route, and All TPA workers must report severe reactions to insect stings p rior to the beginning of work to TPA management. 9.4.10 Poisonous Plants Decontamination: Wash the skin immediately after contact with the plant. Proper washing may not be practical, but a product such as Technu or a small wash up kit with prepackaged, alcohol based cleansing tissues can be effective. Employees and subcon tractors should not forget to wash contaminated clothing and clean up contaminated equipment prior to reuse. Treatment: Options are as follows: Home treatment: Calamine lotion and an oatmeal bath (one cup t o a tub full of water) can help relieve itching. To prevent secondary skin infection, scratching is not helpful and the fingernails should be cut to avoid damage to the skin. Ove rthecounter hydrocortisone cream can decrease inflammation and itching; how ever, the label should be read and the cream used according to directions. When to see the doctor: Severe cases may require further treat ment. A physician should be seen if the rash appears infected, is on the face or other s ensitive body areas, or is too extensive to be easily treated at home. 9.4.11 Ticks To remove an attached tick: Use finetipped tweezers or a \"tic k tool\" to grasp the tick at the surface of the skin, If tweezers are not available, use a tissue to protect the fing ers (exposure to the tick's body fluid may lead to t ransmission of disease), With a steady motion, pull the tick straight out, Disinfect the bite site and the tweezers. Wash your hands thor oughly with soap and water. Save the tick if you can by placing it in a Ziploc bag; this may help with diagnosis in the future, and Weaver Consultants Group 9/22/20 j:\\projects\\37003799\\3774\\300\\01\\14\\tpa hasp faciltywide rev2. as fatigue, headache, neckstiffness or jaw discomfort begin following a tick bite, seek medical attention.

Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an explosive mixture if they are released into the atmosphere in sufficient co ncentration. Avoid sweeping spilled dry material. If sweeping of a contaminated area is necessary, use a dust suppressant agent. Eliminate all sources of ignition. Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny entry. Due to the concentration o f Creosote and the CERCLA (40 CFR 302.4) reportable quantity of 1 pound, the release of 6 pounds of this product requires National Response Center notification. Section 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE Precautions for Safe Handling Avoid breathing dust. Wash tho roughly after handling. Wear respiratory protection. Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace. Do not eat, drink, or smoke when using this product. Use only outdoors or in a well -ventilated area. Wear protective gloves/clothing and eye/face protection. Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Routine housekeeping should be instituted to ensure that dusts do not acc umulate on surfaces. Avoid significant deposits of material, especially on horizontal surfaces, which may become airborne and form combustible dust clouds and may contribute to secondary explosions. Dry wood dust material is defined as having a water conte nt less than 25% by weight. Avoid frequent or prolonged inhalation of sawdust from treated wood. When sawing and machining treated wood, wear a dust mask. When power -sawing and machining, wear goggles to protect eyes from flying particles. Whenever possibl e, these operations should be performed outdoors to avoid indoor accumulations of airborne sawdust from treated wood. Avoid frequent or prolonged skin contact with creosote - treated wood; when handling the treated wood, wear long -sleeved shirts and long pan ts and use gloves impervious to the chemicals (for example, gloves that are vinyl -coated). Use protective skin cream on exposed skin before and during work shift. To reduce sun sensitivity a sun -blocking lotion can also be applied prior to application of a protective cream. After working with the wood, and before eating, drinking and use of tobacco products, wash exposed areas thoroughly. If oily preservative or sawdust accumulate on clothes, launder before reuse. Wash work clothes separately from other hou sehold clothing. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including any Incompatibilities Store in a well -ventilated place. Store locked up. Store and handle in accordance with all current regulations and standards. Avoid heat, flames, sparks and other sources of ignition. Keep container tightly closed. Incompatible Materials oxidizing materials, acids Section 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION In AFL -CIO v OSHA, 965 F. 2d 962 (11th Cir. 1992), the Court overturned OSHA's 1989 Air Contaminants Rule, including the specific PEL's for wood dust that OSHA had established at that time. The 1989 vacated PEL's were: 5 mg/m3 PEL -TWA and 10 mg/m3 STEL (15 min), all softwood and hardwood except Western Red Cedar. Wood dust is now regulated by OSHA as \"Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated\" (PNOR), which is also referred to as \"nuisance dust\". However, some states have incorporated the 1989 OSHA PEL's in thei r state plans. Additionally, OSHA indicated that it may cite employers under the OSHA general duty clause in appropriate circumstances for noncompliance with the 1989 PEL's. Creosote is a complex mixture of variable composition, and while no odor threshold for creosote has been established, work done at the University of California has measured the odor thresholds for one of the more volatile components in creosote and determined that the involved odor threshold is in the part per billion range, and well be low applicable exposure limits. On the basis of these data the perception of creosote odor in and of itself should not be taken as an indication of exposure in excess of accepted exposure limits. Exposure to wood dust would not be expected under normal use conditions. If handling or use patterns associated with creosote treated wood involve the use of a power saw, sander, drill or any tool or activity resulting in the generation of airborne particulate the wood dust exposure limits should be observed and ap propriate steps taken to minimize exposure.

Medical Conditions Aggravated by Exposure respiratory disorders, skin disorders and allergies Additional Data COAL TAR CREOSOTE: This product co ntains coal tar creosote. Volume 35 of the IARC monograph states that there is limited evidence that coal tar derived creosotes are carcinogenic in humans and sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of creosote in experimental animals. Limitations in t he human exposure studies reviewed by IARC (including the presence of other chemicals, small study populations and not well documented exposure levels) contributed to IARC's conclusions regarding human exposure to creosote. When applied to the skin of mice in experimental studies, creosote produced skin tumors and in one study produced lung tumors. Most available information on the effects of coal tar creosote in humans comes from older occupational studies in the wood - preserving and construction industries . Today, with the use of engineering controls and personal protective equipment, occupational exposure to creosote components is expected to be below permissible exposure limits (measured as Coal Tar Pitch Volatiles). Wood dust is particles of varying size produced from processing or handling wood. Cancer of the nasal cavities and sinuses is associated with exposure to hardwood dust. IARC concluded that there were too few studies to evaluate cancer risks attributable to exposure to softwood alone and to any particular species of wood. In view of the overall lack of consistent findings, IARC also concluded that there is no indication that occupational exposure to wood dust has a causal role in cancers of the throat, lung, lymphatic and blood systems, stomach, colon or rectum. PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, LIGHT CATALYTIC CRACKED: High incidences of benign and malignant skin tumors have been reported in mouse skin application testing and IARC reports there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogencity in animals of li ght catalytically cracked distillates. IARC determined there is sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in experimental animals of light and heavy vacuum distillates, of light and heavy catalytically cracked distillates and of cracked residues (including h eavy thermocracked distillates/residues) from the refining of crude oil. Different woods produce different health effects and there is evidence that wood from different trees of the same species can produce varying health effects. Woods other than Western Red Cedar (WRC) seem unlikely to be responsible for large numbers of cases of respiratory Safety Data Sheet Material Name : CREOSOTE - PETROLEUM PRESSURE TREATED WOOD SDS ID : 00230493 ____________________________________________________________ Page 10 of 13 Issue date : 2018 -08-20 Revision 2.12 Print date : 2018 -08-20 allergies. Other common wood dusts produce asthma/pulmonary effects that are less well described than the responses to WRC. These other wood species (e.g., oak and pi ne) are considered somewhat allergenic.

Exposure controls/personal protection Hand protection Based on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the appropriate standard or certification. Respirators must be used according to a respiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important aspects of use.Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is necessary. If contact with the liquid is possible, insulated gloves suitable for low temperatures should be worn. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be noted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different glove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the protection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless the assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: safety glasses with side- shields.Eye/face protection Respiratory protection ::: Body protection Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti- static protective clothing. For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing should include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.:Environmental exposure controls:Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some cases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment will be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.Appropriate engineering controls:Use only with adequate ventilation. Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any recommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas, vapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment. Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before eating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period. Appropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers are close to the workstation location.Hygiene measures :Individual protection measures Skin protection Other skin protection :Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected based on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before handling this product. Thermal hazards :If there is a risk of contact with the liquid, all protective equipment worn should be suitable for use with extremely low temperature materials. Section 9.

(\"Marpol\" = marine pollution) UN = United Nations Other special considerations:The information below is given to call attention to the issue of \"Naturally occurring radioactive materials\". Although Radon-222 levels in the product represented by this MSDS do not present any direct Radon exposure hazard, customers should be aware of the potential for Radon daughter build up within their processing systems, whatever the source of their product streams. Radon-222 is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which can be a contaminant in natural gas. During subsequent processing , Radon tends to be concentrated in Liquefied Petroleum Gas streams and in product streams having a similar boiling point range. Industry experience has shown that this product may contain small amounts of Radon-222 and its radioactive decay products, called Radon \"daughters\". The actual concentration of Radon-222 and radioactive daughters in the delivered product is dependent on the geographical source of the natural gas and storage time prior to delivery. Process equipment (i.e. lines, filters, pumps and reaction units) may accumulate significant levels of radioactive daughters and show a gamma radiation reading during operation. A potential external radiation hazard exists at or near any pipe valve or vessel containing a Radon enriched stream, or containing internal deposits of radioactive material due to the transmission of gamma radiation through its wall. Field studies reported in the literature have not shown any conditions that subject workers to cumulative exposures in excess of general population limits. Equipment emitting gamma radiation should be presumed to be internally contaminated with alpha emitting decay products which may be a hazard if inhaled or ingested. Protective equipment such as coveralls, gloves, and respirator (NIOSH/MHSA approved for high efficiency particulates and radionuclides, or supplied air) should be worn by personnel entering a vessel or working on contaminated process equipment to prevent skin contamination, ingestion, or inhalation of any residues containing alpha radiation. Airborne contamination may be minimized by handling scale and/or contaminated materials in a wet state.
