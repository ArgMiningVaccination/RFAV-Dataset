Indulco Melvin M. Firestone's article, \"Sephardic Folk-Curing in Seattle,\" [1](#en1) is a welcome contribution to the neglected field of Sephardi folklore studies. The following comments are intended to supplement the information gathered by Firestone with some additional detail, pertaining mainly to its acted part, as practiced in the eastern Mediterranean area in particular. The sources familiar to me agree with my old friend Michael Molho. [2](#en2) The usual form of the name of the magic cure is (or was) indulco. [3](#en3) Whatever the actual linguistic derivation of the name, the Sephardi Jews took it to mean \"sweet\" or \"sweetening,\" i.e., a ritual intended to give something sweet to the demons and thereby propitiate them. This conforms to the principle employed throughout the ritual: everything sacred or holy is removed from the house in which it is performed, the patient himself (or herself) must refrain from uttering any word of prayer, from reciting any biblical passage, and from going to the synagogue during the period of his \"cure.\" The intention of the ritual is thus clear: to propitiate, appease, the demons who are believed to have caused the disability, to appeal to their goodwill, sympathy, pity. The indulco therefore stands in sharp contrast to the customary methods of protecting a person against the demons or of exorcising them; there the method is to erect a barrier of sanctity around the person which the demons cannot penetrate, or to expel them by bringing sacred influences to bear upon them before which they must flee. Hence the amulets containing the names of God and other holy names, the placing of the patient before the open doors of the holy ark, and so on. The evil power of the demons is, in all these methods, broken by the forces of holiness marshaled against them. In the case of the indulco, the demons are treated gingerly; they are almost cuddled; everything unpleasant (such as words or emblems of holiness) are carefully removed from their way. The effort is directed, not toward keeping them out or expelling them, but toward inviting them, making their temporary stay as \"sweet\" as possible, and then, groveling before them, imploring them to return whatever they have stolen from the patient. It is, in a word, a treatment of demons in exactly the same manner in which orthodox religion treats God. No wonder that rabbis found the indulco more abhorrent than any other \"superstitious\" practice prevalent in their flock, and that they saw in it something akin to idolatry, against which the biblical prophets had fought with such vehemence. A detailed description of the indulco is contained in a small Hebrew volume entitled K'nesiya l'Shem Shamayim [Gathering for the sake of heaven], written by Manasseh Matlub Sithon and printed in Jerusalem in 1874. In it the indulco is referred to by the Hebrew word matoq \"sweet\" (or, possibly, mittuq, \"sweetening\"). It is stated to be of two kinds: a \"great\" one and a \"small\" one. The custom of administering the indulco, the author states in a lengthy description in rhymed prose, prevails among the Jews of all Muslim lands, as a remedy or preventive against sickness, barrenness of women, spontaneous abortion, death of one's children in infancy, eye diseases, idiocy, \"and all kinds of painful illnesses.\" Its effectiveness is based on giving something \"sweet\" to the demons who cause these diseases and misfortunes, and thereby propitiating them. The procedure is described as follows (my translation from the Hebrew). They take a vessel full of wheat or barley, and three or four eggs, and water and salt, and honey made of grapes and dates or bee honey. And some take milk or sugar and other kinds of sweets. The entire house is thoroughly swept and cleaned, and all its rooms are emptied of people, as well as the neighboring houses and the courtyard, so that nobody remains in it, or near it. Also, all the holy books are taken out from the house, and some go so far as to remove even the mezuzot [doorpost scrolls] from the doors, so that there be no hindrance there to prevent the demons from entering the house. Thereafter, the sick person, or barren woman, or whoever it may be, is led into the house and left there alone overnight together with the woman who administers the Sweetening. And the patient is warned and doubly warned to say neither the Sh'ma' nor any other prayer, to recite neither a long nor a short benediction, not even the after-meal grace, to say which is a biblical commandment, nor to utter the name of God, nor any other holy thing, from neither the written nor the oral Torah, neither aloud nor in a whisper, so that the demons should enter the house and join him and appear to him in his dream. The woman takes a fistful of the wheat or barley, mixes it with the honey, and pours it around the bed of the patient, and into the four comers of the house, and on the threshold and next to the door and its hinges; then she does likewise with the water and the salt or the sugar and the milk and the mumia in all the places mentioned. And she begs and implores, and prostrates herself and pours out her soul in requesting the shedim [demons] and the s'irim [hairy demons] and speaks to them thus: \"I beg of you, you who are our masters, to have pity and compassion on the soul of your slave, the patient, So-and-so, son of So-and-so, your handmaid, and take away his guilt and if he sinned and did you any wrong, have pity on him and forgive him his sin, and give him his soul, his strength, and his health.\" (And for a barren woman they say, \"Open her womb and return to her the fruit of her belly and loosen her ties\"; and for women who abort they say, \"Cause the souls of her sons and daughters to live.\") \"And behold, here is this honey [or sugar] for you to sweeten with it your mouth and palate, and here is wheat or barley for food for your cattle and sheep, and the water and the salt to maintain the love, and the brotherhood and the peace and the friendship as an eternal salt-covenant between us and you.\" Thereafter she breaks the eggs before them and says, \". . . here is this sacrifice for you, a soul for a soul (for the egg out of which the chick is about to grow is regarded as a thing in which there is a living soul and spirit), so that you return to us the soul of this patient and his thoughts, or loosen the bonds of her pregnancy, and open the doors of her belly, or open their blindness, and heal their madness.\" And she pours the fluid of the eggs to the ground, and bows down before them, kneeling and prostrating herself, kissing the floor several times, in order thus to avert their wrath from the frightened patients. All this is done three times, and then repeated for three nights, for each patient. Some, however, insist that it has to be done as often as seven or even nine times, as well as at noontime on Friday . . . Also on certain other nights of the week, which are the fixed time for this procedure, because in them many Liliths and demons are abroad, and go up and down, and in particular on Wednesday nights . . . . [4](#en4) Some perform the Sweet in bath houses, or near pits and latrines in which the demons like to sojourn. Sometimes they have to make a channel for the remedies, a Great Sweet and a great banquet, and in addition to all the things mentioned above they prepare a great table for the demons, load it with all kinds of sweets and candies, and all kinds of spices, camphors, and nards . . . and the patient exchanges his clothes for white festive clothes, and they light many wax candles in their honor, and they break forty or fifty eggs, and they bring kinds of spices made of grasses and trees, and incense and cassia and cinnamon and a sheaf of nard and others from among the eleven spices, and they burn for them all these kinds as a sweet savor, so that they cease being angry at the smitten and suffering patients. And in some cities in certain countries they also slaughter a black cock for them to supplicate and entreat, and in some places they slaughter a lamb for them. Some repeat their folly several nights and days, and sometimes as often as forty days and forty nights. In some countries it is customary to set the table for them [the demons] on the New Year's holiday; this they call Mesa de Rosh Hashana [New Year's Table], and they forbid the patient to go to the synagogue lest he pray or utter a request, and lest he hear the voice of the shofar, which confuses Satan. And some are unable to empty the house and the courtyard of all people, because non-Jews live next to them, or because the patients are poor and cannot afford the expenses; these have to be satisfied with a little, with going to pits and tanners, and with pouring water and salt for the demons. And this, being easy to perform, is found so frequently, every day, that there is no day in which this would not be performed several times. And some throw sugar and mumia and spices. And this libation is the slightest of all the works of Satan, and it is called in several places \"the Small Sweet.\" And some pour water and salt on the door of the store of a poor man so that the demons loosen the ties of his livelihood and make him successful in all his undertakings. The wide prevalence of the indulco is attested by the fact that the above \"unmasking\" of its superstitious practices was approved of by the rabbis of all the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities in Palestine (Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron, Tiberius, Jaffa, and Haifa), as well as the Sephardi rabbis of Smyrna, Damascus, and Beirut, and the chief rabbi of Egypt. Their haskamot (approvals) are printed in Manasseh Sithon's book. Eight years after the publication of Rabbi Sithon's book, another attack was made on the indulco, this time by Abraham Moshe Luncz (1854-1918), a member of the small Ashkenazi community in Jerusalem and a pioneer of Palestinian studies. [5](#en5) He based his description of the indulco ceremony primarily on Sithon, but added several details which show that he had personally observed the ritual, which does not seem to have been given up by the people in spite of the stern rabbinical warnings against it. First of all, Luncz adduces a variant to the name indulco: indulcado. His explanation of these names is that they were originally applied to abandoned and desolate houses and then transferred to the ritual for whose duration the patient's house must be abandoned by all the other residents. The afflictions for which the indulco is resorted to are, according to Luncz, \"only impermanent diseases such as lunacy, blindness, sudden fright, barrenness of women, difficulty in childbirth, loss of children, epilepsy, and the like.\" Luncz's description of the ritual itself is an almost verbatim repetition of Sithon's account, but he adds that \"the amount of honey mixture which they scatter in the house every night is about half a rotl\" (ca. 3 pounds), and that the mixing together of the various ingredients is performed by the women at midnight. Luncz also makes a tantalizingly brief mention of a repeated dream experience reported to him by a Jerusalemite woman for whom the indulco had been performed. \"In the first and second night she dreamed that armed soldiers and many horsemen entered the house, but she was afraid and did not dare to cry out. On the third night the soldiers came again and rubbed all parts of her body with their hands.\" Luncz reports, in agreement with Sithon, that the indulco is performed either in a vacated house or in a place of impurity. Then, still quoting Sithon, he adds, \"Sometimes, on the contrary, they perform this thing in holy places, such as in a synagogue, or in the cave of the prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel, or in the house of study which is over the tomb of Ezra the Scribe in Baghdad. The patient is left lying alone in that place. And when the purpose of the ritual is to give children to childless couples, the man and woman will stay alone overnight in the sacred place, while the woman who performs the ceremony for them leaves the place upon its conclusion and locks them in.\" Although both Sithon and Luncz regard this ritual as a variety of the indulco, it is evident that\u2014whatever the formal similarity of the performance itself\u2014the two are based on completely different, in fact contrasting, motivations. While the true indulco aims at propitiating the demons, the varient ritual brings the patient into close contact with the holiness of a sacred site in order thereby to rid him of their baneful influence. However, the second variety too was and remained known under the name indulco. Michael Molho describes this second type, which was practiced in Salonica. Although in this ritual too everybody must leave the house, three or four women remain with the patient \"to guard him against the evil spirits who might attack him.\" [6](#en6) Moreover, and more importantly, in the Salonica indulco, the indulcadera (the old woman who administers the indulco) invokes Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other saints to intercede with God. [7](#en7) That the indulco is merely the special East Mediterranean Sephardi variant of a much more widely prevalent method of ridding patients of demonic possession is attested by the following report of a propitiation ritual coming from Fez, Morceco. If the disease is of a diabolic origin, that is to say caused by the jenun [demons], one takes, in order to combat it, a mixture of cumin and coriander and makes an offering of oil and of grains to the demons. The following are some of the cases in which these magic ingredients are used. An old woman goes to the patient. She takes a handful of cumin and coriander seeds, and she passes these around his head while addressing the following sentences to the demons. \"I enter under your protection, under the protection of the great ones and the small ones among you. Under the protection of our lord Semdayn, of our lord Jebrayn, of our lord Semharos and Lalla Kona bent Elkon [Dame Kona, daughter of Elkon], the daughter of the sultan of the demons. If So-and-So [name of the patient], daughter of [father's name] and of [mother's name], has caused you any offense, if she has conducted herself unjustly toward you, if she has become angry at you, or if she has run after you, seek out the one among you who has been wronged and beg him to deliver her.\" Thereafter the old woman chews the cumin and the coriander seeds and wets the patient's hand with her saliva. It seems that this rite is regarded as both an offering and a conjuratory performance. The cumin and the coriander seeds are undoubtedly as much a present as they are a prophylactic. If, as a result of a quarrel, somebody goes home angry, one sends a woman to throw a little oil on the spot where the argument took place. With this oil, which has appeased the demons whom the man has offended, the woman anoints the head of the patient, saying to him meanwhile, \"May this oil be efficacious to you and to Qrinek [your Qarina, demonic double].\" One recognizes the belief in accordance with which, at the precise moment when a human being is born, a double in the world of the spirits is born with him. This, however, is called his Qrine [qarina], or his brother, or more exactly, his companion who is inseparable from him. In Rabat, if the harm is attributed to the jenun [demons], a woman takes charge of casting oil into the sea, while saying to the devils, \"Here is your feast.\" In this city, according to an Arab custom reported by M. Brunot in La Mer dans les traditions et industries indig\u00e8nes \u00e0 Rabat-Sal\u00e9, the oil is placed in a glass and it is cast, during the course of three days at the same hour, either into the sea or into the slaughterhouse. In Fez, when a patient cannot recover in spite of all the drugs prescribed, people believe that he has been hurt by demons. In order to placate the demons one offers them a diyafa [meal]. The person charged with performing this brings some oil, and, without saying a word, goes to fetch the grain from the house of a woman married for the first time to a man who is neither a widower nor was divorced. Still without speaking a word, she mixes this grain with the oil and at night spreads it around the demons' favorite spots, comers of the bedroom and doors of the house and of the rooms. While doing this she pronounces the following invocation: \"We beg of you for the love of those among you who are powerful and those among you who are humble. For the love of our lord Simday, your sultan, we come to you as strangers. Have pity on us and be merciful. Console us while doing good unto us.\" [8](#en8) Although these Moroccan rituals differ in many details from the East Mediterranean one described earlier, they belong to the same category, inasmuch as they too aim at the propitiation of the demons. Remarkable in this context is the manner in which several individual male and female demons are addressed as \"our lord.\" The underlying psychology is identical: the sick and the ailing, the desperate and the troubled, are willing, in exchange for a cure, to sell their souls to the powers of darkness. II. Mumia In Manasseh Matlub Sithon's description of the indulco ceremony, reference is made to mumia, which is placed, together with the other substances, in various places around the patient. Firestone also reports the use of mumia among the Sephardim in Seattle. He states that his informants asserted that foreskins removed at circumcision were used in making mumia, and that, according to one informant, the mumia was made of flesh taken from a corpse before the funeral service. [9](#en9) The available evidence\u2014and it is plentiful\u2014contradicts both of these derivations of the mumia, and one must assume that these statements reflect a relatively recent folk belief which developed among the Seattle Sephardim or their parents after the actual origin of the mumia had been forgotten. A concise recapitulation of the history of the mumia is given by Warren R. Dawson, [10](#en10) who shows that the word mumia is of Persian origin (mm), that it originally meant \"wax\" and also natural bitumen derived from the \"Mummy Mountain\" in Fars. In Syriac books also, bitumen is sometimes called mumia. [11](#en11) Bitumen was regarded in antiquity as a potent drug; its power was believed to vary with the place of its origin. [12](#en12) The bitumen found in the Dead Sea in Palestine, called bitumen judaicum, was believed to be especially efficacious. [13](#en13) The bitumen of the Dead Sea was called mumia by the Arabs, who borrowed the term from the Persians. They used the same term also to denote the material which was used by the ancient Egyptians for embalming the dead, although this material was in reality not bitumen but resin. The erroneous belief that the substance used for embalming was bitumen gave rise to the transference of the term mumia to the embalmed bodies themselves. Arab and Jewish physicians in the Middle Ages continued to use and recommend mumia, i.e., bitumen, as a drug for many and varied ailments. By the twelfth century, Jews of Alexandria were engaged in breaking up embalmed bodies of ancient Egyptians in order to obtain what they believed was bitumen, but what in reality was resin. In the course of time the belief developed that mumia was efficacious only if it was taken from an embalmed human body. When the supply of Egyptian mummies dwindled, new ones were manufactured in order to meet the unabating demand. Guy de la Fontaine, physician to the king of Navarre, visited Alexandria in 1564, and a local Jewish mummy supplier told him that his practice was to buy the bodies of dead slaves and other persons, open them, fill them with bitumen, then bandage them and let them dry in the sun. The trader showed de la Fontaine some forty such \"mummies\" in various states of preparation. [14](#en14) \"Mummy\"\u2014i.e., mumia\u2014became a very popular drug in Europe, as evidenced by British, French, German, and other medical books of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. In them the mummy is described as deriving from the bodies of men or women, the best being taken from embalmed Egyptians. Desiccated bodies found in the Lybian sands were also much in demand, and other sources too were found. From the seventeenth century on, the term \"mummy\" was applied to any medicated flesh taken from the bodies of jays, owls, and so on. Finally, the word became a cookery term, denoting any dish cooked to a dry and tough consistency, even if it contained only vegetables. Nevertheless, as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, \"mummy\" still appeared in British pharmacologies. [15](#en15) In Upper Bavaria, Germany, \"Mumie\" or \"wild human flesh\" was sold in pharmacies as late as the nineteenth century, as a remedy against consumption. [16](#en16) Jews being so closely involved in the mummy trade, it was inevitable that they should also become its avid customers. Hence the concern shown by rabbis from the sixteenth century on in the question of whether eating mumia for medical purposes and trading in it were permissible from a religious point of view. The matter was taken up by Rabbi David ben Zimra (ca. 1479-1573), the famous Sephardi Talmudist and Kabbalist who was born in Spain, educated in Safed, Palestine, and was chief rabbi of Egypt from 1517 to 1557. One of his responsa [17](#en17) was written in answer to the question, \"On what basis do people use the flesh of dead persons, called mumia, as a drug, even when there is no mortal danger involved, and by swallowing it; and moreover, it is being traded, and bought and sold, even though it is our established law that it is forbidden to eat the flesh of a dead person.\" [18](#en18) David ben Zimra's answer is very lengthy. Its gist, however, is contained in these sentences. It is allowed, because its form has changed, and it has reverted to dust. For the mumia is the flesh of embalmed bodies which had been embalmed with all kinds of spices in order to preserve their form and their bodies. But it [the body thus treated] has become again similar to bitumen, and it is not forbidden to eat it. . . . Moreover, it is taken not for the sake of the flesh, but of the spices that are in it, for it is well known that the flesh of the other dead, which are not embalmed, has no medicinal value at all. [19](#en19) One generation later, Jacob Castro (died 1610), another Egyptian rabbinical authority, referred to this decision and approved of it. [20](#en20) Late in the seventeenth century, yet another Egyptian rabbi, Abraham Halevi, returns to the question of the mumia, and, while deciding against its permissibility (except to use it externally), gives us a description of the manner in which the mumia was obtained in his days. The mumia is made with spices and salves, and the corpse is wrapped in bandages and clothes, and then it is placed in a coffin made of sycamore wood, which withstands rot. The bandages and clothes, since they have not turned into dust, are removed from the mummy. And even if some of the bandages become like thin, polluted clothes, they nevertheless do not get mixed up with the flesh of the corpse, which is as hard as a stone. All one has to do is to blow on these clothes and they fall away. As to the wood of the coffin, even if there be some rot in the sycamore wood, it certainly does not mingle with the flesh of the corpse. The spices and salves do not cause the flesh to endure, but merely remove from it the harmful substances which would otherwise attack it. . . . One takes pieces from the upper limbs; from below its hips it is worthless. . . . And, although it is said that the mummy is now nothing but dust, and all its medicinal value is contained in the spices and salves, in any case there is an enjoyment and usefulness in the mummy itself [and it is therefore forbidden]. [21](#en21) Yet, in spite of this prohibition, the use of mumia continued among the Sephardi Jews. In 1870, Moshe Reischer described it. The Sephardim make to this day a remedy, mumia, which is prepared from the ground dry bones of dead people found in the desert in the sand. For along the road leading to Mecca there is a big desert, and there is a place full of sand which is called the Sand Sea. And when a storm arises, it lifts up the sand to a height of more than twenty cubits [about thirty feet] and covers everybody who happens to be on that road, for a distance of about one mile. And people go there and, searching diligently, they find these pieces in human form, black and dry as a stone, for even the biggest man who is left lying under the sand dries out and becomes as small as a finger. And they sell it to apothecaries, and they put it into remedies. And the Sephardim, when they have a patient sick for many days, God forbid, take it and grind it well and put a certain amount of it into honey water which the patient drinks from time to time during three nights. Before he drinks it, they wash him and clothe him into a white robe, and lay him on a bed covered with a white sheet. Menstruating women are not allowed to enter the house as long as the illness of the patient persists, lest this cause harm to the patient and to themselves. The patient lies alone, and nobody else is with him in the house, not even a hen. Moreover, he must beware of the smell of garlic and onions. The only food of the patient throughout the nine days is milk, bread, and butter. [22](#en22) Additional details about the mumia as used by the Jews of Jerusalem in the late nineteenth century are given by Luncz. By this name (mumia) is called in Arabic a piece of bone which has become completely black. [Footnote:] According to what the children of the land of the east say, this bone can be found in the sandy desert of Arabia, and it is a part of the bodies of people who were buried among the waves of that sea of sand while on their way to Mecca or to the other cities of that country, and from the great and burning heat their bones hardened and became black and exceedingly small, like the form of embalmed bodies. The mumia is offered for sale in Arab pharmacies of medicines and charms. The price of a dirham [drachma] is about five piasters, and those who buy a large quantity of it can see in it the shape of the member from which it is derived [end of footnote]. Its power is such as to heal all illness and disease, and especially sudden and unusual ones. This drug is prepared in the following manner. A certain quantity of the mumia\u2014or a part of the black bone\u2014is pounded in a mortar to thin powder\u2014and sometimes they mix some honey and spices into it\u2014and a handful of it is placed on the roof for a night so that the dew descends upon it, or they put it in a coffee cup, and of this balsam of Gilead the patient drinks for nine successive nights. On the fifth and ninth day, before he drinks of it, they wash his body, wrap him from head to foot in white clothes, and a man or a woman sits next to him all night to watch him\u2014for they believe that the two nights are most dangerous for the patient. The patient's food during this period consists of bread, butter, and milk only, and they also take care lest the patient inhale any strong smell, and especially the smell of garlic, onions, and fish. Women who are in their menses must not enter the house throughout that period, lest they cause damage to the patient and to themselves, and, in general, very few people will visit him. The neighbors who live in the same courtyard\u2014and who believe this nonsense\u2014are very much afraid lest the power of the mumia affect them adversely, and they therefore leave their houses for several days, or\u2014if they do not care about the state of the patient and about the improvement of his health\u2014they will draw on the door of his house the picture of a hand, which is a well-known amulet, and then the power of the mumia is broken, and it will neither help nor harm the patient. Therefore, if the patient is apprehensive lest his neighbors perform this contrary act, he will do everything in secret, unknown to anybody. [23](#en23) The unanimous testimony of all the sources, therefore, from antiquity down to the nineteenth century, is that the mumia is the body or part of the body of old, preferably embalmed, but at least desiccated, corpses. It was this circumstance that enabled the rabbis to find a ritual basis for permitting its internal use. The swallowing of a piece of flesh taken from a fresh corpse, before the funeral, would never have had a chance of rabbinic approbation. In view of this, it would be most interesting to find out whether any of Firestone's Seattle informants actually ever practiced or witnessed such a removal of a piece of flesh from a fresh corpse, or whether all they stated was that they believed that this was the source of the mumia. As to the identification of the mumia with the foreskin removed at circumcision, again the evidence adduced above speaks against it. However, it is known that the swallowing of foreskins used to be practiced by barren Sephardi women in order to conceive. Possibly this custom was confused or conflated with the mumia. The question of actual observed practice versus oral tradition based on hearsay is important in this case too. Another interesting deviation in Seattle from the centuries-old tradition is the surreptitious administering of the mumia. Throughout the two-thousand-year history of the mumia it was always given openly. The fact that it was thus taken, that it was a substance believed to be of a horrible, disgusting origin, that it was difficult and costly to obtain, provided it with an effectiveness on the psychological plane that it lacked physiologically. In the Seattle variant, if the patient did not know he was taking mumia, its psychological effect was confined to those who administered it to him and knew about it. This would seem to be a rather roundabout way of obtaining improvement in the patient. In view of these considerations, it would seem significant to establish precisely in what cases the mumia was given surreptitiously, and in what cases openly.
