Dr. Yang breaks down what acupuncture, Chinese medicine and naturopathic medicine are, what symptoms they address, and how they can work together to optimize health! If you've ever considered any of these different treatments, but aren't really sure where to start- this article is for you! Can you give a brief overview of what acupuncture, Chinese medicine, and naturopathic medicine are? Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture Steeped in a 5,000-year history of clinical application, Traditional Chinese Medicine is a sophisticated approach to healing for the prevention and treatment of illnesses that includes acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, tui na (therapeutic massage), qi gong, tai chi and dietary counseling. Acupuncture treatments use thin, stainless steel needles to stimulate points on the surface of the body. These acupuncture points are located along numerous channels or pathways, where energy or Qi circulates in the body. Qi, thought to nourish internal organs and tissues, can alter neural impulses that travel through the body to elicit beneficial responses. By stimulating acupuncture points with specific functions and indications, acupuncturists are able to promote and balance the flow of Qi, relieve pain, reduce stress and restore health. The treatment focus of Chinese medicine is to create an herbal formula with a balanced and synergistic effect that can treat both the root cause and the symptoms of a health condition. Although there are thousands of traditional herbal formulas for a variety of health ailments, a formula is almost always modified by the TCM practitioner to suit the subtle nuances of the condition and constitution of the patient, making each formulation highly individualized. Chinese herbal formulations are prepared in a number of different ways: - Chinese herbal decoctions. The most traditional method of preparing an herbal formula in China, decoctions can involve cooking Chinese herbs for several hours in to a tea form. These deco ruins are known for their strong taste and aroma. For these reasons decoctions are not as popular or as widely used in the United States. - Herbal powders, which can be mixed with hot water to make a tea, are more convenient to prepare and use, and are not as pungent as traditional decoctions. - Chinese herbal formulations in pill or capsule form are the most widely used form of Chinese herbal medicine. - Syrups, which are soothing preparations for coughs and sore throat, are also a convenient way to administer herbal formulations to children. - Liniments, salves, compresses and plasters, which are used for external application. Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic Medicine is a distinct, comprehensive system of healthcare emphasizing the use of natural therapeutics in promoting health and preventing disease. Naturopathic doctors are licensed to practice as independent doctors who are authorized to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. Naturopathic doctors diagnose by taking thorough histories, performing physical exams, and ordering imaging and laboratory testing. Naturopathic treatments include: - Dietary Counseling: healthy, nutrient-rich, whole foods dietary recommendations are made to promote wellness and prevent disease. - Nutrient Therapy: the use of vitamin and mineral supplementation to enhance immunity and aid in the prevention and correction of degenerative diseases, such as heart disease, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis. - Homeopathy: diluted doses of plant, mineral, or animal substances to stimulate the body's own healing responses. - Botanical Medicine: the use of whole plants and its active constituents to treat disease. - Natural Hormone Therapy: use of non-synthetic, bio-identical hormones (estrogens, progesterone, and/or testosterone), derived from plants, to treat hormone imbalances and deficiencies. - Counseling and Lifestyle Modification: help patients identify risk factors and achieve goals to promoting active, healthy lifestyles. - Physical Medicine and Hydrotherapy: Utilizes the principles of physics (heat, light, electricity, water, massage, stretching) in the treatment of injuries and physical anomalies affecting the human body. Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, and Naturopathic Medicine compliment one another and can result in a synergistic effect when combined together. Who is a good candidate for these different modalities? Everyone can benefit from these modalities of treatment whether they are looking to treat a specific health ailment or to prevent the onset of an illness. At CANH we specialize in family medicine, women's health, fertility support, pregnancy & postpartum care, pediatrics, pain management, as well as in adrenal and thyroid conditions. What symptoms are these modalities able to address? - Acute & chronic pain - Allergies & Asthma - Adrenal Fatigue - Infertility - PCOS - Diminished Ovarian Reserve - Peri-menopause & Menopause - Recurrent Pregnancy Loss - Postpartum Depression - Lactation Support - Thyroid Conditions - hypothyroidism & hyperthyroidism - Pediatric Conditions - ADHD & Autism - Acne - Irregular & Painful Menstrual Cycles How do these treatments support fertility? Acupuncture promotes fertility by: - Stimulating the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Ovarian Axis to balance hormone levels and promote ovulation. - Regulating menstrual cycles and improving blood flow to the uterine artery, uterus, and ovaries. - Assisting in the production of progesterone to maintain a healthy luteal phase. Progesterone builds the uterine lining to support implantation and maintain healthy pregnancy. Acupuncture can also enhance male fertility factors: - Male fertility factors account for 40% of all infertility cases. - Acupuncture along with healthy lifestyle and dietary changes, Chinese herbs and supplements can help increase sperm count, enhance sperm motility and morphology, and increase semen volume. Acupuncture reduces stress & anxiety: - Stress can disrupt ovulation, cause irregular menstrual cycles, compromise the immune system, and affect the digestion and absorption of nutrients. - Studies suggest that acupuncture can reduce stress and anxiety levels by increasing serotonin and endogenous opioid peptide levels (\"happy hormones\") stream and decreasing cortisol levels (\"stress hormones\") in the blood stream. - Reducing stress and anxiety is essential to promoting fertility, having a healthy pregnancy and a happy baby. We time your treatment according to the phases of your cycle or IVF protocol to enhance follicular growth, ovulation, and implantation. Acupuncture supports all phases of the IVF cycle: - During the stimulation phase, acupuncture helps improve blood flow and drug delivery to the ovaries and uterus while reducing stress levels and side effects. - After egg retrieval, acupuncture alleviates abdominal cramping and bloating which may be due to the high hormone levels and the empty follicles filling up with fluid again. This tends to quickly subside with acupuncture treatments, reducing any inflammation and tissue trauma, preparing a nice environment for the embryo implantation - During the transfer and implantation phase, acupuncture is shown to directly increase vascular response and suppress the sympathetic nervous system (\"fight or flight response\") at the spinal-cord level, which increases blood flow to the uterus and ovaries, reduces any uterine contractions which can inhibit an embryo from successfully implanting. This leads to a higher rate of implantation of embryos and an increased rate of successful pregnancies. - Acupuncture improves IVF Success Rate: A randomized study in Germany was conducted on 160 patients undergoing IVF ages 21 to 43. The acupuncture group received 25 minutes of acupuncture before and after embryo transfer. Control group received no acupuncture. Results: 34 of 80 patients (42.5%) in the acupuncture group were pregnant. 21 of 80 patients (26.3%) in control group were pregnant.
