By Yemisi Oladipupo Make Noise Go To Jail - Oyo State Min. Of Environment. By: Yemisi Oladipupo (onaaraTODAYnews) Nigeria, 30/7/2020. Oyo Government approved enforcement of Environmental Laws including Noise Pollution prohibition - Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. On his very popular radio program 'State of the Nation', Mr. Edmund Obilo complained to his guest who came from the Ministry of Environment about a neighborhood discotheque which disturbs with loud music and the officials replied in the affirmative that they would be dealt with DECISIVELY. In the words of the two men, \"we have equipments to detect the level of the noise. We are not going to use just the mobile courts, we are going to use the magistrate court as well. And one of the options is a jail term which is to be determined by the judge\". In this short interview in Yoruba at onaaraTODAYnews onlineRADIO which is available in over 10 most popular online podcasts systems, an enthusiast of *AntiNoisePollution* campaign says noise is a psychological violence that could destroy life. Call for holistic implimentation of the new enforcement rules.

By Dr. DAODU On Radio & Tv Channel. Excerpt from the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION article - WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.7 Brucellosis in Animal and Man. Excerpt from the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION article - WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.7 3.1.2.2 Infection from a contaminated environment This is difficult to document but probably occurs more frequently than is recognized. Infected animals passing through populated areas or kept in close proximity to housing may produce heavy contamination of streets, yards and market places, especially if abortions occur. Inhalation brucellosis may then result from exposure to contaminated dust, dried dung etc. Contact infection may also result from contamination of skin or conjunctivae from soiled surfaces. Water sources, such as wells, may also be contaminated by recently aborted animals or by run-off of rain water from contaminated areas. Brucella spp. can survive for long periods in dust, dung, water, slurry, aborted fetuses, soil, meat and dairy products. The precise duration of survival is dependent on many variables such as the nature of the substrate, number of organisms, temperature, pH, sunlight, the presence of other mi- crobial contaminants. Some examples are given in Table 3. 3.1.2.3 Occupational exposure Certain occupations are associated with a high risk of infection with brucel- losis. These include people who work with farm animals, especially cattle, sheep, goats and pigs: farmers, farm labourers, animal attendants, stockmen, shepherds, sheep shearers, goatherds, pig keepers, veterinarians and inseminators are at risk through direct contact with infected animals or through exposure to a heavily contaminated environment. Infection may occur by inhalation, conjunctival contamination, accidental ingestion, skin contamination especially via cuts or abrasions, and accidental self-inoculation with live vaccines. The families of farmers and animal breeders may also be at risk as domestic exposure may be inseparable from occupational exposure when animals are kept in close proximity to living accommodation. In some areas, the animals are kept in the yards of houses and may even be brought inside, especially in severe weather. In the case of recently aborted animals, this has resulted in infection of entire households. The use of dried dung as a fuel may also import infection into households. It should be noted that brucellosis often presents as clusters of cases in a family or tribal group, usually relating to a common infected food source, and often follows an outbreak in animals. Children can be particularly at risk as they may adopt newborn or sick animals as pets. In some areas they may be the only group presenting with acute symptoms, as older members of the community are likely to be immune or chronically infected. Persons involved in the processing of animal products may be at high risk of exposure to brucellosis. These include slaughtermen, butchers, meat packers, collectors of fetal calf serum, processors of hides, skins and wool, renderers and dairy workers. Direct and environmental contamination may present hazards through inhalation, ingestion, mucous contamination and skin contact or penetration. Staff employed in the maintenance of farm premises, factories or plants used for processing animal products are often overlooked as occupationally exposed groups but may be at considerable risk from environmental contamination. Laboratory staff involved in culturing Brucella are at particular risk. In some countries in which brucellosis is no longer endemic, this potential hazard may be overlooked or considered no longer relevant. Nevertheless, the performance of diagnostic procedures on patients with unsuspected imported disease may lead to culture of organisms which are not correctly identified until laboratory-acquired infection raises the level of suspicion. The use of rapid identification gallery test systems has caused Brucella strains to be misidentified as Moraxella spp, with serious consequences for the staff.
