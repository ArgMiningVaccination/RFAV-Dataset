Set the thermometer to a proper temperature and adjust the lighting to your preference if you want a cozy feeling environment. Proceed by holding the crystal in your left-hand palm as you settle down. Since the left hand is the hand for receiving, holding a crystal in your left hand will let you receive its energy. If you find it challenging to stay focused on your breath, you can use your crystal as your focus point. Concentrate on how it feels in your palm and what you're experiencing during the mindfulness meditation. Remember that mindfulness meditation may be difficult to practice if you are rushed for time or weary. So when you practice it daily, it becomes a natural part of your self-care routine.

Your objectives must always be for the greater good of society when practising crystal mindfulness. You should also communicate with your crystals and obtain permission to use their vibrations.

The session's goal is for you to do whatever makes you feel most at ease. Don't be too hard on yourself if your mind wanders. This is normal and will occur from time to time. Whenever your mind wanders, bring back your focus to your breath and the energy of the crystals.Conclusion Crystal mindfulness meditation is a helpful method for many individuals since there is a crystal for every need.
