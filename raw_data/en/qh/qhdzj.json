The term \"dioxins\" is commonly used to refer to a group of dibenzo- p-dioxin (PCDD) and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran less than 20 are considered tobe biologically active. Dioxins are produced in a number of thermalreactions, including incineration of municipal waste, domestic fires andbonfires, forest fires and internal combustion in automobile engines. Theyare also generated as trace contaminants during the synthesis of manyorganochlorine compounds (e.g. chlorophenoxy herbicides such ashexachlorophene, chlorodiphenyl ether herbicides) and during someindustrial processes (e.g. bleaching of pulp and paper with chlorine gas). 8.2 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmentally stable, lipophilic chemicals that were widely manufactured for a range of industrialapplications between the 1930s and 1970s. Use of PCBs for industrialpurposes has been discontinued but these substances may still be releasedto the environment during disposal of materials and obsolete equipment.There are 209 theoretically possible PCB congeners, of which 12 non-ortho or mono- ortho compounds exhibit similar biological activity to PCDDs and PCDFs, and are therefore referred to as \"dioxin-like PCBs\". Advice on fish consumption 1668.3 There is continuing public concern about the health hazards of dioxins and related compounds. These compounds are persistent in the environmentand tend to accumulate in biological systems. One of the most extensivelystudied PCDD congeners, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), exhibits a broad range of toxic effects in laboratory animals, someat very low doses. 8.4 Exposure of the general population to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs is primarily from food. The estimated exposures from the UK Total DietStudy samples for all age groups have declined substantially. In 1982,average intakes for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs were 7.2 and 18 pgTEQ/kg bw/day for adults and toddlers, respectively. In 1997 the averageshad fallen to 1.8 and 4.6 pg TEQ/kg bw/day for adults and toddlers,respectively. 1Over the same period, the intake estimates for high level (97.5thpercentile) consumers have fallen from 13 and 28 pg TEQ/kg bw/day to 3.1 and 7.2 TEQ/kg bw/day, for adults and toddlers,respectively. Dioxins and PCBs are detectable in almost all types of food.Highest concentrations are found in meat, fish, eggs and dairy products.However, cereals, fats and oils contribute significant proportions of thetotal dioxin and PCB intake because they are major components of the diet.The decline has been attributed in part to controls on emissions to theenvironment and the discontinuation of production and use of dioxin-likePCBs. It is anticipated that exposures will continue to decline with presentand planned environmental controls. 8.5 The highest dioxin exposures in humans have generally been associated with occupational exposure or accidental contamination of theenvironment or edible oils. Occupational exposure studies have beenundertaken at plants in the USA, Germany, the Netherlands and the UKthat manufacture chlorophenols and/or chlorophenoxy herbicides.Application of chlorophenoxy herbicides has been associated with muchlower levels of exposure. Exposures to more highly chlorinated PCDDshave been estimated for workers exposed to pentachlorophenol and/orother chlorophenates at saw mills or manufacturing plants. In addition, anexplosion in a chemical plant at Seveso in 1976, resulted in widespreadrelease of TCDD to the environment and exposure of the local population.The ingestion of edible oils contaminated with high levels ofAdvice on fish consumption 167polychlorinated compounds including PCBs and PCDFs was associated with toxicity in food poisoning incidents in Yusho and Yu-Cheng, whichwe reviewed in 1997. 2 Previous COT evaluations 8.6 The COT and our sister Committees on Carcinogenicity (COC) and Mutagenicity (COM) have considered dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs onseveral occasions in the past. 1-8In 1989 we made a comprehensive statement about the health hazards of PCDDs and PCDFs. 3We made a second statement in 1991 when UK exposure data on these compoundsfrom food became available. 4On that occasion, we endorsed the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 10 pg/kg bw/day 2,3,7,8-TCDD recommended by anexpert group convened by the WHO Regional Office for Europe 9and we recommended that, when considering mixtures of PCDDs and PCDFs, theTDI can be regarded as 10 pg/kg bw/day 2,3,7,8-TCDD Equivalents(TEQ). We further stated that, in view of the estimated long eliminationhalf-lives of this class of compounds, it would be more appropriate toregard the TDI as a time-weighted average tolerable intake. We reviewedPCDD and PCDFs again in 1995, when we concluded that the newinformation available at that time did not necessitate the alteration of thepreviously agreed TDI. 6 8.7 The Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) approach was initially used to facilitate risk assessment of PCDDs and PCDFs (i.e. dioxins). In 1997, wetentatively accepted that the TEF approach could be extended to includethe dioxin-like PCB congeners 2and in 1998 we endorsed the revised WHO-TEFs for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. 7 Recent International evaluations World Health Organization. 8.8 In 1998 the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (WHO- ECEH) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS)conducted a re-evaluation of the TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.The Executive Summary of this report was published in a special issue ofFood Additives and Contaminants 10, devoted to the 1998 WHO-Advice on fish consumption 168ECEH/IPCS Consultation on Dioxins, allowing an evaluation of the basis on which the WHO consultation reached its conclusions. 8.9 The WHO consultation recommended a TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of 1-4 pg WHO-TEQ/kg based on the NOAEL/LOAELs of thoseeffects considered to be the most sensitive in experimental animals,namely endometriosis, developmental neurobehavioural effects,developmental reproductive effects and immunotoxicity. Scientific Committee on Food 8.10 The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) undertook a reassessment of the TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for the European Union, adopting atemporary opinion in November 2000. This was revised in June 2001, inthe light of newly published data allowing calculation of the total amountof dioxin in the fetus (the fetal body burden) associated with maternalexposure at steady state. 11The SCF concluded that, because TCDD and related compounds have very long half-lives in the human body, thetolerable intake should be expressed on a weekly rather than a daily basis.Based on the LOAEL from a study showing developmental effects in malerat offspring following repeated subcutaneous administration of TCDD 12, the SCF established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw. 13 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives 8.11 The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) also considered dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in June 2001. The JECFA used asimilar body burden approach to that used by the SCF and also took intoaccount exposure from background contamination considered to be presentin feed provided to laboratory animals. It proposed a provisional tolerablemonthly intake (PTMI) of 70 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw 14, based upon the lowest LOAEL and a NOAEL for developmental effects in male ratoffspring. 12, 15 Environmental Protection Agency 8.12 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) commenced a reassessment of dioxin exposure and human health effects entitled,Advice on fish consumption 169\"Exposure and Human Health Reassessment of 2,3,7,8- Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds\" in April1991. In 1994, it released its initial external review draft describing healtheffects and exposures. In our 1995 statement 6, we welcomed the US EPA initiative to investigate further the health hazards of 2,3,7,8-TCDD andrelated compounds. The document provided a thorough review of theliterature on the effects of these compounds on various biological systems.However, we did not consider it provided any new information or analysisthat necessitated the alteration of the previously agreed TDI of 10pgTEQ/kg bw/day or of our previous advice. 8.13 Following public comment and advice from its Science Advisory Board, the EPA undertook an extensive revision of its review, particularly two keysections on Dose-Response Modelling and Integrated Summary and RiskCharacterization. 16These chapters were subject to public comment and further Science Advisory Board review during late 2000 and Spring 2001.The EPA's draft assessment considered that cancer was the mostappropriate end-point for risk assessment and undertook an evaluationbased on their risk assessment guidelines for carcinogens. The results ofthis evaluation are not yet available. Evidence considered in the current evaluation. 8.14 In 2000, we were asked to review the risk assessments of dioxins carried out by the WHO, the SCF, and the US-EPA. We concluded that it wasappropriate to conduct our own evaluation of the data, informed by theseinternational assessments and other relevant information, beforereconsidering the TDI for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. As part of thisevaluation it was essential that the evidence concerning human cancerrisks for dioxins be evaluated to determine whether or not it is appropriateto assume the existence of a threshold and hence whether a TDI could beestablished. We are grateful for the assistance provided by the COC and wehave taken account of its conclusions 17 in completing our evaluation. 8.15 In undertaking our evaluation we have had access to the published assessments of all three international evaluations. The EPA documentsprovided the most detailed and comprehensive review of the publishedAdvice on fish consumption 170literature. We have supplemented this by evaluation of the original publications identifying critical end-points and recently published data. Mechanism(s) of action of TCDD 8.16 Most of the actions of TCDD and related compounds can be ascribed to the consequences of an initial binding to what has become known as the Ah oraryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), although this binding protein is nowmore properly termed a ligand activated transcription factor. This bindingresults in multiple changes in gene transcription leading to increases inbiotransformation enzymes, modulation of cell cycling proteins and otherresponses. Inappropriate gene expression resulting from the high affinitybinding and long term occupancy of the receptor may be the basis of thetoxicity of TCDD. However, although the mechanisms of early molecularchanges are well understood, the relationship between changes in generegulation and observed toxicity is still unresolved. 8.17 It has become apparent that the sequence of events from TCDD binding to gene transcription involves other transcription factors, chaperones (such asHSP90) and regulatory proteins. The net result is the association of TCDD-AHR with another factor, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), inthe nucleus followed by binding of the complex to 'dioxin' responsiveregulatory elements (DREs) in enhancer regions upstream of particulargenes. Downstream activation of promoter regions then occurs withproduction of mRNA from the genes. Most of the molecular events fortranscription of the CYP1A1 gene have been elucidated. For other genesthe sequence of events is far less clear but probably occurs in a similarmanner 18and the number of known AHR-regulated genes is still increasing. 8.18 Mechanistic studies on the role of the AHR in the toxicity of TCDD have shown that proteins similar to the AHR have been found in manyorganisms suggesting that this receptor has an essential biologicalfunction 19. Sequencing studies on the AHR have shown that it is a member of a family of gene regulating proteins known as PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM)20. In mammals, these proteins (which include hypoxia inducible factor 1- [HIF1 ] and ARNT) regulate the transcription of specific genes.Advice on fish consumption 171Heterodimerization of the AHR with ARNT is apparently essential for the TCDD activated AHR to induce specific DNA binding and transactivationin vitro . However, heterodimerisation of ARNT can also occur with HIF1 and with a newly discovered factor AHR repressor (AHRR). 21 TCDD/AHR might act by competing against these, or even competingagainst the binding of a hypothetical normal endogenous ligand of theAHR that has yet to be found. Other studies have shown that levels of theAHR, AHRR, ARNT and HIF1 may be regulated by cell type and activation and by stages of growth and differentiation. 22 8.19 A number of lines of evidence in vivo support the role of AHR in TCDD toxicity. For instance, polymorphism of the AHR, with varying affinitiesfor TCDD, in mice correlates with variable susceptibility to toxic effects. 23Different strains of mice that do not possess the functioning gene for the AHR (referred to as Ahr null or 'AHR knockout' mice) have been shown to be extremely resistant to very high doses of TCDD for a variety of toxicendpoints. Binding capabilities of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs to theAHR, as shown by structure activity relationships, generally show similarranked order to their elicitation of biochemical responses. 8.20 However, in seeking to understand the mechanisms of action in order to inform risk assessment, it might be inappropriate to place exclusiveemphasis on the AHR. At very high doses of TCDD (in the Ahr null mouse) the chemical may have toxic actions which are not mediated by thereceptor. Similarly, in some in vitro experiments, various effects of TCDD have been interpreted as non-AHR dependent. 8.21 In terms of binding to the AHR, some ligands may be competitors of TCDD-induced gene regulation. Conditional disruption of the Arnt gene has recently shown that ARNT is required for AHR-stimulated geneactivation by TCDD in liver, but this association has yet to be extended totoxicity. 24Other, as yet unidentified, AHR ligands may be present, or TCDD-AHR complex may participate in cell dysfunction by unknownroutes not involving the regulation of gene expression via DREs andARNT. Although no endogenous ligand of AHR has been proven, anumber of naturally derived chemicals are ligands.Advice on fish consumption 1728.22 Some data suggest that the binding affinity, and the effect of binding, of TCDD to the AHR, are much lower in humans than in rodents, even theresistant DBA/2 mouse. 25This could contribute an extra safety margin but the difference in response may vary with endpoint. Some polymorphismsof the human AHR gene have been reported but the functional significanceof these polymorphisms is still under investigation. 26We note that, in view of this uncertainty, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the mostsensitive humans are as responsive as the most sensitive rodents. Overall,we agree that the evidence that toxicity is mediated via the AHR, and thelimited evidence that dioxin/receptor interaction does not inevitably lead toa toxic response, are sufficient to consider a threshold approach to the riskassessment. Toxicokinetics of dioxins Absorption 8.23 The extent of gastrointestinal absorption of dioxins is reported to vary with the medium or vehicle of administration, and the lipophilicity of theindividual congeners. The percentage absorption of TCDD isapproximately 60% in rodents. 27Similar absorption has been reported for other chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans, although theabsorption of than 20%. PCDDsand PCDFs are incompletely absorbed because they are not in solutionwithin the gut lumen, and absorption is dependent on the digestion andemulsification of the food matrix. Distribution 8.24 Once absorbed, probably via chylomicrons, TCDD rapidly leaves the blood compartment with a distribution half-life of approximately 30minutes in rats, after which time it is primarily found in adipose tissue, theliver, skin, muscle and other tissues. TCDD present within the blood islargely associated with lipoproteins. Studies in rats have shown that afterinitial rapid distribution there is a slower redistribution from muscle andother organs, primarily to the liver and adipose tissue, skin and thyroidgland; the concentrations in these organs show a slow increase over aperiod of about 4 days following a single intraperitoneal dose. 28ThisAdvice on fish consumption 173pattern of distribution is probably representative of distribution in humans and there is a high correlation between adipose tissue concentrations andthe levels in serum. 8.25 The duration of the distribution phase is very short compared with the elimination phase. After tissue distribution, which takes about 4 days, in vivo elimination is adequately represented by a single mono-exponential decrease and half-life. The distribution phase is important in theinterpretation of effects produced in utero in rats after a single oral dose given late in pregnancy, which are the basis for determining the tolerableintake. Metabolism and elimination 8.26 Although early studies suggested that TCDD is not metabolized, it is now recognized that it is slowly converted to polar metabolites that areeliminated as glucuronides. The main metabolites of are 1-hydroxy-2,3,7,8-TCDD and 8-hydroxy-2,3,7- TCDD. Other metabolites have been identified in including tri- anddichloro-hydroxy and dihydroxy- compounds. Oxidative metabolism doesnot appear to give rise to significant bioactivation or formation of DNAadducts and the limited available data indicate that the metabolites are lesstoxic than the parent compound. 29A major route of elimination of the hydroxy- metabolites is as glucuronic acid conjugates in the bile.Unmetabolized and PCDFs are not detected in bile but areexcreted in the faeces and faecal fat by direct intestinal elimination. 8.27 The half-life of TCDD has been reported to be about 20 days in the rat, 12 days in mice, 90 days in the guinea pig and between 6 and 11 years inhumans. 28,30-32The elimination half-life in humans correlates positively with the percentage body fat, indicating slower elimination in individualswith higher fat composition. Consistent with this is evidence suggestingan age-related decrease in half-life in the elderly, as the fat stores aremobilized during redistribution from the subcutaneous to abdominalareas 33. Mobilization of fat stores during lactation contributes to the presence of dioxins in breast milk34, and this is associated with a decrease in the maternal body burden during breast-feeding. Advice on fish consumption 174Human data Introduction 8.28 The human effects observed in one or more studies are summarized in Table 8.1. In assessing the effects of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs inhumans, we have selected those studies that provide the most informationon the relationship between outcomes and exposure to TCDD-contaminated materials. Case reports were not reviewed and only cohortstudies with calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) or equivalent,were discussed in assessing mortality. Many of the studies reviewed arecross-sectional in design and there are inherent limitations of this type ofstudy. We noted that the lack of adequate exposure data was a frequentlimitation of the available epidemiology. Exposure is measured in differentmedia and expressed in different units across the studies, which makescomparison difficult. Some studies were only able to use indirectestimates of exposure, which cannot be directly related to dioxin levels.Development of a tolerable intake requires studies with quantitativeassessment of exposure. 8.29 We focused our evaluation on studies in which exposure was assessed by measurement of dioxin concentrations in serum or body fat, which couldbe correlated with body burden and intake. The body burdens in humanstudies have been estimated in two ways. Firstly, the body burden may becalculated from the concentrations of dioxins in lipid and the percentagebody composition as fat. This does not allow adequately for sequestrationof dioxins within the liver, but this should produce only a minor error inthe calculation of body burden. The second method is calculation of thebody burden based on estimates of intake and half-life. In humans theintakes of dioxins will have varied historically and there is uncertaintyabout past exposures. In addition, little is known about the half-life ofdioxins and dioxin-like PCBs at different life stages. Calculation of bodyburden based on daily intake has to allow for the bioavailability from thefood matrix and the half-life or clearance from the body. A limitation tothis method for considering mixtures of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs isthat reliable estimates of the half-life of TCDD and also its congeners arenecessary.Advice on fish consumption 1758.30 We also focused on the relationship between exposure and response, particularly (although not exclusively, if other important health end pointswere investigated) for the health end points that are relevant/comparable tothe results of animal studies. We noted that the EPA report identified sixstudies or series of studies in humans, which measured serum levels ofTCDD and compared them with possible health effects. 35-43 We were also informed of an additional study in Dutch chemical workers, whichprovided exposure data 44and a series of Dutch studies on cognitive development. 45-53 8.31 W ith the exception of the series of Dutch studies on cognitive development, the studies reported the effects of high level occupationalexposure or the results of accidental release. Occupational or accidentalexposure would be associated with higher peak body burdens, followed bygradual elimination and were therefore difficult to compare with steadystate conditions associated with background human exposure via the dietor with repeated exposure in animal studies. Also, the occupational studieshave not addressed the reproductive effects that represent the mostsensitive endpoints in the animal studies. Studies of cognitive development 8.32 A series of Dutch studies involved cohorts in Rotterdam and Groningen, representing a highly industrialized region and a less industrialized, morerural area, respectively. The cohorts were sub-divided between breast-feeding for a minimum of six weeks and formula fed using a single batchof one commercial formula. Plasma from maternal and cord blood samplesand milk samples were analysed for dioxins and PCBs, including somePCB congeners considered not to have dioxin-like properties. The infantswere monitored at ages from 3 to 42 months, with assessments of motorand cognitive development, as well as indicators of thyroid function. 46-52 Similar studies were conducted on a smaller cohort in Amsterdam. 53We invited additional expertise to ensure that these studies were reviewedadequately, particularly the relevance of the methodology, and wegratefully acknowledge the assistance provided. Advice on fish consumption 176Table 8.1: Effects associated with human exposure to dioxins. 8.33 We noted that the measures used were standard for the age of children assessed, and the best available in the absence of an a priori hypothesis of specific effects. However, we were informed that in very young childrenit is only possible to perform crude tests which do not provide a cleardistinction between motor and cognitive development. Such teststherefore serve more as screening tests than definitive measures and thusEffect Epidemiological evidence Chloracne Proven association No clear dose relationship Gastrointestinal effects Transient increases in some liver enzymes and liver enzymes Cardiovascular diseases Positive association in occupational studies, but not in airforce veterans exposed to herbicides in Vietnam (Operation Ranch Hand).Dose-response in some studies Changes in lipid levels Results not consistentDiabetes Overall results not consistent Increased risks of morbidity in Seveso and Ranch Hand study Reproductive hormones Inconsistent resultsReproductive outcomes Change in sex ratio of offspring with highly exposed fathers in SevesoNo data yet on possible effects such as endometriosis and fertility in women - Seveso endometriosis study on-going Thyroid function Results not entirely consistent.

Tests of motor function had been conducted from shortly after birth until about 30months of age. Tests of cognitive function were conducted from 3 monthsto about 42 months. Different patterns had been observed in the studiesconducted at different ages and very little change was observed in themiddle of the age range. We noted that Prechtl's neurological examination(as conducted on the Rotterdam and Groningen cohort 47,48) was considered the most stringent, but with the disadvantage of generating a large numberof false positives. For infants, the Bayley Scales, based on a very largesample and well standardized, is probably the best instrument. This scaleis divided into a mental development index (MDI) that measures howmotor tasks (e.g. control of hands) are applied and a psychomotor index(PSI) that measures gross movements (e.g. walking). However, the Bayley Scales provide a measure of timing of appearance of certain skillsand not the quality with which they are carried out. We noted that thestudy used a 1969 version of the test whereas a more advanced version waspublished in 1993. 8.34 The paper of Patandin et al . 52 reported changes at 42 months using the Kaufman Assessment Battery. This was considered to be critical to ourassessment, since cognitive function is stabilising at this age and becomespredictive of function in later life. In contrast, Bayley scales are used foryounger age groups (3 months to 3 years) and have low predictivity. TheKaufman scores at 42 months suggested an effect of pre-natal dioxinexposure leading to an effect on cognitive development. 8.35 It was difficult to determine whether the effects were due to dioxin exposure or to confounding factors. Complex correlations were foundbetween dioxin and PCB levels and confounding factors, such as breast-feeding, smoking and maternal education. Linear regression analysis hadbeen used to assess the influence of confounding factors. It was not clearwhether this was appropriate, and the data were insufficient to determinewhether the statistical approach might result in over- or under-correction.Overall, if the effects were real, they were most likely to be due to pre-natal exposure. Breast-feeding ameliorated the effects. However concernsover the known and potential confounders made it impossible to reach firmconclusions.Advice on fish consumption 1788.36 We noted that distinction between pre-natal and post-natal exposure to dioxins and PCBs was an issue of concern relating to the Dutch studies.Prenatal exposure was based on analyses at 8 months gestation, and it wasnot clear whether these were fully representative of exposure throughoutpregnancy. However, when considering effects on thyroid function it should be noted that these effects may be confounded by changes inmaternal thyroid hormone production prior to thyroid development in thefetus. None of the populations examined in the Dutch studies wereconsidered to have exposures greater than the normal background range,differences were found between industrial and rural locations and therewas a very large natural variation. In addition breast-feeding appeared tobe a major confounder, with the highest proportion of breast fed infantshaving the highest dioxin concentration. Similarly level of maternaleducation appeared to correlate best with high exposure as did smoking.The paucity of information on the mathematical models used in the studymade it impossible to determine whether effects were \"real\" or due toconfounders. 8.37 We concluded that it was not possible to determine whether any cognitive changes represented temporarily delayed milestones of development or apersistent decrement and that follow-up studies were needed. Theseshould be carried out two to three years after the original study or duringthe teenage years, as increasingly sensitive measures can be used in olderchildren. Decreased variability in older children also tends to make thetests more sensitive. In the absence of such studies we do not consider itpossible to come to clearer conclusions about the outcome of dioxinexposure. Sex ratio 8.38 A recent study has reported on the sex distribution of children born between 1 April 1977 and 31 December 1996, with one or both parentsexposed to TCDD in the Seveso incident, for whom TCDD serumconcentrations were available relating to the time of the incident 54. The exposed individuals were between 3 and 45 years old in 1976. Comparedwith an unexposed population, there was a dose-related decrease in theproportion of male children born to TCDD-exposed fathers. We note thatthis difference was statistically significant at paternal serum TCDDAdvice on fish consumption 179concentrations of 118 pg/kg or more. This could be estimated to correspond to a body burden of 24 ng/kg bw, which is equivalent to a dailyintake of 12 pg/kg bw/day. However, the high exposure resulting from theSeveso incident is not comparable to steady state exposure, and the bodyburden derived from the peak serum concentrations in 1976 may not be themost appropriate dose surrogate for reproductive effects occurring insubsequent years. Endometriosis 8.39 Eskenazi and co-workers published initial details of the Seveso Women's Health Study 55. The primary objectives of this study are to investigate whether there is a relationship between TCDD exposure and the followingend-points; endometriosis, menstrual cycle characteristics, age atmenarche, birth outcomes of pregnancies conceived after 1976, time toconception, clinical infertility and age at menopause. Insufficient resultsare currently published to assess the effects of TCDD exposure in theSeveso incident on endometriosis and other reproductive end-points inwomen. We considered that further consideration of female reproductiveoutcomes should be deferred until further papers on the Seveso Women'sHealth Study become available. Immunotoxicity 8.40 We noted that, compared with studies in experimental animals, there is much less information regarding immunotoxicity in humans. Nevertheless,there are suggestions that human immune function may be less susceptibleto TCDD and dioxin-like PCBs that of rodents. 8.41 Evidence for immunotoxicity in humans resulting from occupational or accidental exposure to TCDD or related PCBs is inconsistent. However, acommon feature of some investigations has been a modest exposure-related reduction in the frequency of peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes. Theextent to which these effects represent an early indication ofimmunosuppression is unclear. 8.42 A recent paper has examined infectious and atopic diseases and immunological parameters in children with background levels of exposureAdvice on fish consumption 180to PCBs. 56These are the cohorts from Rotterdam discussed in paragraphs 32 to 37, above. A large number of analyses are reported, many of whichare simply correlation coefficients and some of the statistically significantresults are likely to have occurred by chance. The authors concluded thatexposure to PCBs and dioxins might be associated with a greatersusceptibility to infectious diseases and a lower prevalence of allergicdiseases. However, we noted a number of contradictions in the reportedresults, in addition to the uncertainty over control for confounders as notedin paragraph 35. We concluded that the study did not provide convincingevidence of a causal relationship between pre-natal exposure or total bodyburden to PCBs and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases ordecreased incidence of allergic disease. Cardiovascular disease 8.43 Some studies have reported a positive association between exposure to TCDD, or to PCDDs and PCDFs, and the incidence of ischaemic heartdisease. 39,40, 42,44. These studies have indicated that a significant increase in ischaemic heart disease is associated with a body burden at or above 25 ngTCDD/kg bw, or 55 ng TEQ/kg bw for However, theydid not adequately allow for confounding by other risk factors, such assmoking and diet. No studies included measurement of dioxin-like PCBsexposure or its contribution to the body burden. Cancer 8.44 The Committee on Mutagenicity (COM) and the Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) considered 2,3,7,8-TCDD in 1988/9 andconcluded that this compound was carcinogenic in rodents but that thiswas unlikely to be due to a mutagenic mechanism. The COC gave furtherconsideration to the carcinogenicity of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in 1993, when moreepidemiological data were available. The Committee concluded that thenew data strengthened the possibility of an epidemiological link betweenoccupational exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD and an increase in total cancers inhumans, although there was no consistent association with cancer at anyspecific anatomical site(s). It was considered that there was insufficientevidence for a clear causal link but it would be prudent at present to regard2,3,7,8-TCDD as a possible human carcinogen 5.Advice on fish consumption 1818.45 The COC reviewed TCDD in 1998, following the publication of the IARC monograph which concluded that TCDD should be considered as a definitehuman carcinogen 57. The COC agreed that TCDD is a potent carcinogen in laboratory animals, but that the information from the most heavilyoccupationally exposed cohorts suggested that there was, at most, only aweak carcinogenic effect in these individuals. It therefore concluded thatthere were insufficient epidemiological and toxicological data on TCDD toconclude a causal link with cancer in humans, but it would be prudent toconsider TCDD as a \"probable weak human carcinogen\". 58 8.46 The COC has reconsidered its 1998 statement in the light of recently published data on cancer epidemiology, including the twenty-year follow-up of the Seveso incident 59, and mechanisms of carcinogenicity. It agreed that TCDD should be regarded as a \"probable human carcinogen\" on thebasis of all the available data. The COC agreed that although a precisemechanism for carcinogenesis in laboratory animals or humans could notbe elucidated from the available information, the data (i.e. negativegenotoxicity in standard assays, and evidence from studies of mechanisms)suggested that a threshold approach to risk assessment was likely to beappropriate. The COC did not consider it possible to quantify the margin-of-safety risk assessment in view of the difficulties in selecting theappropriate metric of exposures. However, it noted that the excess cancermortality reported in the heavily exposed industrial cohorts was small andcommented that any increased risk of cancer at background levels ofexposure is likely to be extremely small and not detectable by currentepidemiological methods. 17 Animal data 8.47 There are few regulatory rodent toxicity studies and no regulatory non- rodent studies on the dioxins, and most of the available data relate toTCDD. Most of the regulatory toxicity studies were performed at least 20years ago and cannot be considered adequate for the determination ofNOAELs. The recent studies were conducted to non-standard protocolsand many of the studies examining the most sensitive end-points alsofailed to identify NOAELs. We have reviewed the experimental toxicologyAdvice on fish consumption 182of TCDD, with particular consideration to those showing effects at the lowest doses. Immunotoxicity 8.48 We noted that the available data presented a complicated picture, with diverse protocols, including the use of different species and strains; variousroutes and durations of exposure and a wide range of doses. Nevertheless,some general points could be made: 8.49 In rodent studies the most consistent effect is a reduction in antibody responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The SRBC assay is primarilya measure of the integrity of humoral immunity. However, as initiation andmaintenance of antibody responses to SRBC requires not only Blymphocytes, but also functional T lymphocytes and antigenprocessing/presenting cells, this assay provides something of an overallview of adaptive immunity. 8.50 The most sensitive adverse effect level resulting from exposure to TCDD in which an immune alteration has been implicated was reported byBurleson et al 60. An increased mortality of mice following challenge with influenza A virus was found following a single exposure to 0.1, 0.05 or0.01 \u00b5g/kg TCDD. However, there is no evidence that the observed increase in susceptibility to virus challenge was necessarily attributable toimpaired immune function and mortality was not associated with increasedtitres of virus in the lungs of mice exposed to TCDD. Therefore it couldnot be concluded that the lowest dose in this study represents the LOAELfor TCDD-induced immunotoxicity in mice. 8.51 We concur with the conclusion of the WHO, EPA and SCF reviews in considering the studies of Gehrs and colleagues to be important inassessing the immune effects of dioxins. 61, 62Pregnant rats (Fischer 344 strain) received a single oral dose (on gestational day 14) of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0or 3.0 \u00b5g/kg TCDD. Exposure at all doses was associated with a persistent (up to 14 months) reduction in males of delayed-type hypersensitivity(DTH) responses to bovine serum albumin. Maternal doses of 0.3 \u00b5g/kg TCDD and above were required for persistent suppression of DTHreactions in female offspring. On the basis of these investigations it isAdvice on fish consumption 183likely that 0.1 \u00b5g/kg TCDD should be regarded as the LOAEL for immune effects in young rats. 8.52 A second conclusion drawn from these studies was that maximal inhibition of immune function required both lactational and in utero exposure. This was more effective than lactational exposure alone, which was in turnmore effective that in utero exposure only. It was noted that these differences in potency related to rats and might differ in humans. Developmental and reproductive toxicity 8.53 The studies on developmental and reproductive effects in experimental animals mainly involved administration of TCDD alone, but there werecomparative data for other congeners on teratogenicity and ovarianfunction. TCDD was able to elicit a number of different developmentaleffects although the sensitivity differed. The most sensitive and robust end-point was the effect on epididymal sperm count. 8.54 The EPA provided an excellent comprehensive review of the literature on developmental and reproductive toxicity, and although some new studieshad emerged since it was written these did not have a major impact. Thehuman sensitivity (based on in vitro data on embryonic AHR concentrations in different species) appeared to be in the middle of therange shown by experimental animals. Whilst the AHR was clearlyimplicated in the teratogenicity of TCDD, its role in other developmentaleffects was less clearly established. The reproductive effects werecorrelated with body burden at the critical stage of sexual differentiation(GD 15-16, as noted by SCF and JECFA 13,14) and it appeared that equivalent fetal body burdens on day 16 of gestation were achieved byadministration of different bolus doses on day 8 and day 15 of gestation. 8.55 We noted that the most sensitive end-points were observed following bolus administration and paid careful consideration to the relevance in derivinga tolerable intake. These studies are considered in detail in paragraphs 64-70. We noted that there was evidence to support an extrapolation from abolus dose to a chronic exposure, as considered in paragraphs 71-74. Theonly multigeneration study was old 63 and was subjected to detailed evaluation in previous considerations by the Committee. 4We consideredAdvice on fish consumption 184that the results from this multigeneration study supported the body burden estimates but that there were questions about the statistics which requiredfurther evaluation. 8.56 We were informed that data from animal developmental studies did not show differences in the sex ratio of offspring, as had been reported forhumans in the Seveso region. However, we accepted the animal studieswere not designed specifically to address this issue. Endometriosis 8.57 In our 1995 statement we noted a study reporting an increased incidence of endometriosis in rhesus monkeys 10 years after completion of a studyin which TCDD was administered in the diet for a period of about 4 years. 64A recently published paper follows up the same group of monkeys 13 years after completion of the dietary study, reporting that the incidence ofendometriosis correlated with serum levels of certain PCB congeners, butnot TCDD. 65Monkeys involved in a study in which lead was administered were also found to show an association between serum PCB levels andendometriosis. The authors could not account for the source of PCBexposure to these animals. 8.58 We noted that a number of aspects of this observational study undermined confidence in the results and in the earlier findings and concluded that itwas not possible to draw reliable conclusions. Acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity 8.59 TCDD causes a wide range of toxic responses after short and long term exposure with large differences in sensitivity between species/strains ofanimals to particular responses. Most of the reported toxic responses couldbe produced in every species provided an appropriate dose was given. Thewide variability in sensitivity and the particular toxic response producedwithin and between species, makes it difficult to identify an appropriateendpoint for risk assessment. Lethality (as determined by LD50) varieswith species from the highly sensitive guinea pig to the relativelyinsensitive hamster. There is also considerable variation within species.The value of these studies for risk assessment is doubtful given the age ofAdvice on fish consumption 185the various studies, and the use of different strains, dosing regimens, routes of administration and observation period. No single site of toxicity hasbeen identified as the cause of lethality; each species has a differentspectrum of organ toxicity with a wasting syndrome and hepatotoxicity asthe most common features. The wasting effect occurs in several species,but no single explanation for this effect has been described. Hepatotoxicityincludes a wide range of liver effects in many species with rats and miceat the sensitive end and guinea pigs and hamsters as the least sensitivespecies. There is considerable variation in response within different strainsof rat. The chronic dietary administration studies of Kociba et al. 66 reported that the lowest dose of 0.001 \u00b5g/kg bw/day was a NOAEL for hepatocellular nodules, although low body weights were recorded atvarious times during the study and only animals surviving to the end of thestudy were necropsied. In this study, the tumour incidences weresignificantly increased at a number of sites at the 0.1 \u00b5g/kg bw/day dose level. 8.60 We noted that there was no adequate basis for decisions on acceptable risk levels in humans based on the standard toxicity studies. Two of the mostsensitive endpoints across the species seemed to be 1A1and oxidative stress. Although CYP 1A1 induction is not considered to bea toxic response, it could underlie toxicity resulting from disruption ofvarious endogenous processes. However, we noted that induction of CYPisozymes does not always show a good correlation with responsiveness indifferent mouse strains, indicating that it cannot be directly linked totoxicity. Oxidative stress had been detected in mouse brain 67, although it was not clear whether this was related to CYP induction. Overall assessment Use of body burden as a dose surrogate. 8.61 We considered that the most appropriate measure of exposure for assessing the sensitive endpoints of TCDD toxicity were the associated tissueconcentrations, rather than the administered dose. Ideally the concentrationin the target tissue would be the most appropriate measure of dose forcomparing effects in different species, but this is impracticable for humans.The tissue concentration is directly related to the body burden at steady-Advice on fish consumption 186state so that calculated body burdens are a valid surrogate. We therefore consider that the exposure/dose-response relationship for TCDD andrelated compounds should be based on body burden not external dose. Thebody burden approach allows for the massive interspecies differences inthe half-life, and the potential for accumulation. An additional advantageof using body burdens, compared with previous dose-responseassessments based on external dose, is that the body burdens can beestimated for occupational and accidental exposures, and body burden-response relationships assessed. We concur with the recent evaluationsthat, despite some limitations, the body burden provides the appropriatedose metric, and that there is sufficient scientific evidence to support theuse of body burden. Human daily intakes and body burden 8.62 Following dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, the body burden will be accumulated over a period of 15-30 years in humans, duringwhich time the environmental concentrations of these substances havedecreased. In consequence, the body is not truly at steady-state, and hencethere will be errors in the daily intake when calculated from currentconcentrations in body lipids. A pharmacokinetic model that allows fordecreasing environmental concentrations with time indicates that thesimple steady-state assumption over-estimates daily intake byapproximately 20%. Some equations relating daily intake to body burden(based on adipose levels) do not include a specific term for bioavailability,and this would need to be considered for each route/protocol for exposure.This analysis is particularly important in relation to interpretation ofhuman epidemiology studies where the body burden and daily intake isbased on analysis of adipose tissue concentrations. 8.63 Overall, the data indicate that dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs may be associated with a number of effects, including cancer and cardiovasculardisease, but generally at body burdens at least 10-fold higher than thoseoccurring in the general population. Most of the studies involve groups thathave been exposed to very high levels of dioxins resulting fromoccupational or accidental exposure and the pattern of exposure does notreflect long-term dietary exposure. Advice on fish consumption 187Evaluation Key studies 8.64 We conducted a detailed review of the human data linking health effects to dioxin exposure, and a summary of these data is available on the COTwebsite (http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/committees/cot/summary.htm).We concluded that the available human data did not provide a sufficientlyrigorous basis for establishment of a tolerable intake. This was because: the epidemiological studies do not reflect the most sensitive population identified by animal studies, there are considerable uncertainties in the exposure assessments and inadequate allowance for confounding factors; the patterns of exposure did not reflect exposures experienced in the general UK population, which are mainly from diet. We therefore found it necessary to base our evaluation on the data from studies conducted in experimental animals. 8.65 In accordance with the advice of the COC 17, we considered it appropriate to take a threshold approach to establishing a tolerable intake. This is basedupon the negative genotoxicity in standard assays and evidence fromstudies of mechanisms. 8.66 Because a threshold-based approach was considered appropriate, we examined all of the toxicological effects, in addition to cancer, in order toidentify the most sensitive end-points. We concluded that the mostsensitive indicators of TCDD toxicity were the effects on the developingreproductive systems of male rat fetuses exposed in utero . These data were used despite inconsistencies in the findings reported, and the fact that noneof the recent observations were made following sub-chronic or chronicdietary administration that would give constant (steady-state) maternalbody burdens. We note that tolerable intakes were also derived from theseendpoints in the recent SCF and JECFA evaluations. The key studies useddifferent strains of rats and tended to give contradictory findings. A changeAdvice on fish consumption 188Advice on fish consumption 189in urogenital distance was found after single oral doses given on day 15 of gestation (GD15) of 50ng/kg bw15, 200ng/kg bw68and 1000ng/kg bw69. We considered that the data on ano-genital distance were not robust because oflack of correction for body weight or other means of normalization, andshould be regarded as an intermediate marker with no functionalsignificance. Decreases in sperm numbers, production, reserve ormorphology were found after single oral doses of 50ng/kg bw and above(GD15) 68-70and subcutaneous dosage to give a body burden of 25ng/kg bw 12, but not, in one study, at 800ng/kg bw (oral dose on GD15) 15. Changes in the weight of the urogenital complex, including the ventral prostate werereported after an oral dose of not at 300ng/kg bw subcutaneously 12. 8.67 Despite some inconsistencies, we considered that the effects on sperm production and morphology represented the most sensitive effects. Thesewere indicative of the functional adverse reproductive effects in the rat thatwere produced by long-term administration in the multigeneration study ofMurray et al at doses resulting in a 10-fold higher body burden than those in the studies of sperm production 63. We also note that the sperm reserve in the human male is much less than that in the rat, and therefore thesechanges are considered relevant. No NOAEL was available for theseeffects, but the study of Faqi 12 provided the lowest LOAEL. We noted limitations in this study but considered that the results could not bediscounted and therefore, that this should be used as the basis for derivingthe tolerable intake. 8.68 We considered that a tolerable intake based on these effects would also protect against any risk of carcinogenicity from dioxins and dioxin-likePCBs. This conclusion is based on the mode of action of dioxins anddifference between the body burdens at background levels of exposure andthose associated with increased cancer risk as observed by the COC 17. 8.69 Three of the studies 15,68,70reported adverse effects in male rat offspring following a single oral dose of TCDD given on GD15, and one 12 following repeated weekly subcutaneous injections. In all cases the effects wereobserved postnatally and the pattern of both in utero and post-natal exposure would be different. Because of the long half-life of TCDD (21Advice on fish consumption 190days in rats), and its presence in milk, the male offspring would be exposed to decreasing concentrations until the time of measurements. The recentSCF and JECFA evaluations 13,14 used recently published toxicokinetic studies 11,27 that allow the fetal body burdens to be calculated on GD16, on the assumption that this is the appropriate site of action, and period ofsensitivity. 8.70 We have adopted a similar approach to the SCF and the JECFA. However, in view of the numerous assumptions in this approach (described below),we have used a simplified calculation of fetal and maternal body burdensassociated with these different dosage regimens and their conversion to thesteady-state dietary intakes that would result in the same fetal bodyburdens. Calculation of a tolerable intake for humans is complex andrequires a number of steps: calculation of the fetal body burden of ratsunder the experimental conditions; correction of the correspondingmaternal body burden in rats to represent chronic daily intake viathe diet; the use of uncertainty factors to give an equivalent tolerable humanmaternal body burden; and finally, derivation of a daily intake by humansthat would result in the tolerable human maternal body burden. Calculation of body burden 8.71 On the assumption that the critical period of exposure is GD16, the adverse effects following a single oral dose on GD15 would have been initiated ata time when the dose was undergoing tissue distribution. At this time, moreof the maternal body burden would have been associated with well-perfused tissues, such as the liver, and the reproductive system and lesswith adipose tissue. It is possible to estimate the fetal exposure on GD16by allowing for differences in the maternal dosage protocol using thetoxicokinetic data of Hurst et al., following a single oral bolus dose on GD15 27and following dietary administration of 1, 10 and 30ng/kg bw per day for 5 days per week from 13 weeks before mating 11. 8.72 A problem with the interpretation of the Hurst et al papers 11,27, which measured radioactivity after dosage with radioactive TCDD, is that theratios of maternal to fetal body burdens on GD16 were not independent ofdose, as would be predicted for such low doses. This non-linearity isdifficult to explain on biological grounds and may have arisen as anAdvice on fish consumption 191artefact of the low levels of radioactivity measured. The SCF evaluation used regression analysis with a power model forced through the origin tocorrect maternal dosage and derive a correction factor of 2.6 for the higherfetal body burdens when dosed on GD15 compared with daily treatment. 13 These regressions used the ratios of maternal:fetal body burdens in ng/kgbw after single doses of 50 and 200ng/kg bw on GD15 27(30:5.3 and 97.4:13.2, respectively) and 0.71, 21.3ng/kg bw/day 11(20:1.4, 120:7.5 and 300:15.2 respectively). The JECFA evaluation confirmed the results of the power model but also useda linear model that gave a correction factor of 1.7, and the JECFAconcluded that both models fitted equally well to the available data. 14 Although the power and linear models fitted equally well, they gavedifferent correction factors, especially at very low body burdens. Thisresulted in a discrepancy (see JECFA, 2001) 14when applied to the correction of the 5ng/kg bw subcutaneous maintenance dose used in thestudy of Faqi et al 12(see below). 8.73 Because the correct mathematical model cannot be determined based on goodness of fit, and because the regressions are determined largely bybody burdens higher than those relevant for derivation of a tolerableintake, we decided to adopt a simpler method of correction using the ratioscalculated directly from the lowest doses in each of the studies by Hurst et al. 11,27After a single oral dose of 50ng/kg bw on GD15, the fetal body burden on GD16 was 5.8-fold lower than the maternal body burden(5.3ng/kg bw bw). 27After sub-chronic oral treatment with 1ng/kg bw/day for 5 days a week, which gave a maternalbody burden of 19ng/kg bw, the fetal body burden on GD16 was 14.6-foldlower than the maternal body burden (1.3ng/kg bw compared with 19ng/kgbw). 11Thus a bolus dose given on GD15 results in 2.5-fold higher fetal body burdens (14.6/5.8) on GD16, than would occur if the same maternalbody burden had arisen as a result of sub-chronic treatment. Derivation of the TDI 8.74 In order to derive a tolerable intake for humans, it was necessary to convert the subcutaneous dosage regimen used in the Faqi study 12 into a steady- state maternal body burden on GD16. The study involved a bolus dose of25ng/kg bw, 14 days before mating, and subsequent weekly maintenanceAdvice on fish consumption 192doses of 5ng/kg bw. Assuming that the first day of mating corresponds to GD0, these weekly maintenance doses would have been given on GD-7,GD0, GD7, etc. By GD16, the doses given up to GD7 would havedistributed to all tissues, representing steady-state distribution andresulting in a maternal body burden of 18.3ng/kg bw. This value iscomprised of 9.3 + 2.3 + 3.0 + 3.7ng/kg bw remaining in the body from thedoses given on GD-14, GD-7, GD0 and GD7, respectively, assuming ahalf-life of 21 days. The maternal body burden from the 5ng/kg bwmaintenance dose given on GD14 would give a \"non-equilibrium\"maternal body burden of 4.5ng/kg bw on GD16. Using the correctionfactor described in paragraph 73, it can be estimated that a steady statematernal body burden of 2.5-fold higher (i.e. 11.3ng/kg bw) would beneeded to produce the same fetal body burden as this \"non-equilibrium\"dose. Therefore the calculated total steady-state maternal body burden onGD16 arising from the subcutaneous dosing protocol at the about 33ng/kg bw afterallowing for the TCDD intake from food. 8.75 Conversion of the calculated equivalent steady-state maternal body burdens from these studies in rats into an equivalent human body burdenrequires the use of uncertainty factors to allow for the use of a LOAEL andto allow for species differences and human variability. Both the SCF andthe JECFA evaluations used a default factor of 3 to allow for the use ofLOAEL, and an overall factor of 3.2 (10 0.5) to allow for species differences and inter-individual variability. 71,72The latter factor is lower than the default of 100 normally used because it incorporates the followingchemical-specific adjustment factors: a) inter-species differences in toxicokinetics: uncertainty factor of 1.0 because the body burden approach allows for toxicokineticdifferences. b) inter-species differences and human variability in toxicodynamics: uncertainty factor of 1 to cover both of these aspects based on theassumption that in general, rats are more sensitive than humans, butthe most susceptible humans might be as sensitive to TCDD as rats.Advice on fish consumption 193c) human variability in toxicokinetics: uncertainty factor of 3.2 to allow for potential increased accumulation, and hence body burden, ofdioxins in the most susceptible individuals. This is only relevant forcongeners with shorter half-lives than TCDD, because an individualwith a 3.2-fold longer TCDD half-life would not reach steady-statebody burden. 8.79 Applying the uncertainty factor of 9.6 (3 x 3.2) to the calculated maternal steady-state body burden from the study of Faqi et al (LOAEL=33ng/kg bw) gives a tolerable human equivalent maternal body burden of 3.4ng/kgbw. 8.80 Estimation of the daily intake of TCDD that would result in this body burden has to take into account the fraction absorbed (bioavailability) fromthe diet by humans (both the SCF and JECFA evaluations concluded thatthe bioavailability of TCDD in humans is 50%), and the very long half-lifein humans (which the JECFA concluded was an average of 7.6 years, whilethe SCF used a figure of 7.5 years). The human equivalent body burdenscan be converted into daily intakes by the equation: daily intake (pg/kg/day) = body burden (pg/kg bw) x ln 2 bioavailability x half-life in days 8.81 Using a bioavailability of 0.5 and a half-life of 2740 days (7.5 years), the tolerable human equivalent steady-state body burden from the study ofFaqi et al 12 would be produced in humans by a daily intake of 1.7pg/kg bw/day. Given the imprecision and assumptions inherent in thesecalculations we concluded that the tolerable daily intake for dioxins anddioxin-like PCBs should be based on this value rounded to a single figure,i.e. 2pg WHO TEQ/kg bw per day. We note that SCF and JECFA have usedlonger averaging periods, but because intakes are usually expressed on adaily basis, we considered that establishment of a tolerable daily intakewas more appropriate and transparent. This value is consistent withtolerable intakes derived recently consumption 1948.82 We note that the body burden is the most appropriate dose metric for establishment of a tolerable intake and, because of its long half-life, thebody burden of TCDD at steady state is about 2000 fold higher the averagedaily intake. For example, an intake of 10 times the TDI on a single daywould result in a 0.5% increase in the body burden. Therefore short termvariation in intake does not significantly alter the body burden, andoccasional exceedance of the TDI would not be expected to result inharmful effects, provided that intake averaged over a prolonged period iswithin the TDI. Conclusions 8.83 We conclude that dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs have the potential to cause a wide range of adverse health effects. The health effects most likely to beassociated with low levels of exposures relate to the developingembryo/fetus. 8.84 We recommend that a tolerable daily intake of 2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg bw per day is established, based upon effects on the developing male reproductivesystem mediated via the maternal body burden. 8.85 We consider that this TDI is adequate to protect against other possible effects, such as cancer and cardiovascular effects. 8.86 We note that the most recent intake estimates for the UK population are 1.8 pg/kg bw/day for the average consumer and 3.1 pg/kg bw/day for the 97.5percentile consumer and that dietary intakes are decreasing. 8.87 There are no short-term measures that can be used to decrease the body burden of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in humans because of their longhalf-lives and widespread presence at low levels in food. 8.88 Similarly, because of the long half-life, short-term exceedances of the tolerable intake are not expected to result in adverse effects. Nevertheless,it is not possible to identify a duration and degree of exceedance at whichadverse effects might occur.Advice on fish consumption 1958.89 Finally, we confirm our previous advice that, although intakes of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs by breast-fed babies are higher than is desirable,encouragement of breast-feeding should continue on the basis ofconvincing evidence of the benefits of human milk to the overall healthand development of the infant.
