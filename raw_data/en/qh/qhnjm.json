Editorial Reviews Review \"This book seeks to take the reader well beyond traditional, pharmaceutical-based treatment of Bipolar Disorder. It also seeks to expand readers' understanding of what natural medicine actually is. The information presented is based on research and interviews with physiciansand other professionals, not from other books. Part I of the book covers the history, definition, symptomology, and suspected causes ofBipolar Disorder. Part II details holistic treatments of the disorder. It includes in-depth accounts of the protocols of several successful,holistic practitioners, laced with case studies and quotes from those practitioner's patients. According to the author, effectively treating Bipolar Disorder, rather than just managing its symptoms, requires addressing the disorder at all levels of human existence, from the physical to the spiritual. The book contains lots of specific information, about both the suspectedcauses (vitamin deficiencies, stress, toxicity, etc.) and the holistic protocols being used successfully today. Consider displaying it withMarohn's earlier work, Natural Medicine First Aid Remedies , for a great take-action combo.\" - Anna Jedrziewski , New Age Retailer About the Author Stephanie Marohn is a medical journalist and non-fiction writer and the author of the Healthy Mind series for Hampton Roads.

Sturgill Yes No Yes No Natural Medicine Guide to Bipolar Disorder, The: New Revised Edition: Stephanie Marohn: 9781571746566: Amazon.com: Books AM]By Brenda H on June 27, 2007 Format: Paperback Verified Purchase Some good information. Some of which you can get off of the Internet. Some of which you can't. I waited a while before writing this review, because people were praising the book so highly Ithought I had missed something during my initial reading. So I went back and read it again. I didn'tmiss anything. It's nice to know that there are alternative therapies, because I have been on every med out there that's use to treat mania, and I've had major problems with all of them. They either don't work at all (the anti-convulsants) or send me to the emergency room with outrageous blood sugar problems (the atypical antipsychotics) that only clear up when I go off of the meds. My doctor talked about trying natural remedies, but he was unfamiliar with them. So after deciding that I was not going to take insulin just so that I could take psych meds, I started researching natural remedies for myself. I also decided that since one med that I know of does cut my mania within hours of taking it, I do not need to be on meds 24/7/365. I think this 24/7/365 med taking is marketing hype by the pharmaceutical companies. Plus, my doctor told me that, outside of lithium, no other drug is actually known to forestall manic episodes. So unless a drug takes weeks to build up in your system before it'll work, there is no scientific reason to take the drug 24/7/365. What I really need from this book is a clear and organized list of the names of the alternative meds and a description of each; for instance, a description of what each is supposed to treat, as well as comprehensive state by state lists of the clinics that practice natural medicine. My health insurance would never pay for me to go out of state for treatment. So the book is not helpful, unless I can use it to self-medicate. All I learned from it is that there are alternatives. However, formost of us, who have limited resources, the alternative resources are out of reach. 5 Comments Was this review helpful to you? 38 of 40 people found the following review helpful The Natural Medicine Guide to Bipolar Disorder (The Healthy Mind Guides) By K.
