One, two and three-bedroom units will be available with rents structured to support those earning anywhere from 30 to 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Positioned near commercial spaces like restaurants, gas stations, a highly rated daycare, an animal hospital and much more, tenants can easily access the shops and services essential to everyday life. MPC partnered with Dominium, the nation's fourth-largest provider of affordable housing, and Searles Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides gracious living services to elderly and disabled residents, to bring the project to fruition, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\"With its great location and reasonable rents, Grayson Ridge will enrich the lives of seniors in the Lawrenceville community,\" said Steve LeClere, Director of LIHTC for Monarch Private Capital. \"This new development is a perfect representation of our commitment to bettering communities by providing quality, affordable homes in areas that require it most.\"Lawrenceville is the county seat of Gwinnett County, which has experienced significant growth and revitalization in many areas over the past few decades. During the 1980's Gwinnett repeatedly ranked first among the fastest-growing counties in the United States. As a result, Lawrenceville began to really take shape. The most pivotal revitalization of Lawrenceville started in 2005 with the addition of new residences, shopping, dining and entertainment. The Georgia Gwinnett College opened in 2006, becoming the nation's first four-year public college to be created in the 21st century. These new additions sparked an influx of people, establishing an increased need for continued revitalization to keep up with the growth of the community. \"Grayson Ridge will be an incredibly valuable addition to the Lawrenceville community,\" said David Searles Jr., CFO of The Searles Foundation. \"Here, our senior residents have a greater opportunity to enjoy their golden years with less financial stress, rewarding programs and services, and beautiful homes in a great location.\"The development of Grayson Ridge will have a considerable economic impact on the area, filling a void in the market for age-restricted housing. In the first year alone, the project is expected to create about 300 jobs and produce nearly $19 million in local income.\"Grayson Ridge will provide seniors a great affordable housing option. We will serve local residents who, as they age, can no longer maintain their homes or seniors who want to move to be near their adult children who live in Grayson, an affordable place to call home,\" said Mark Sween, Vice President & Project Partner of Dominium. \"We thank our state housing tax credit partner, Monarch Private Capital, for their support. They were very responsive to the partnership's needs and easy to work with.\"For more information on MPC's programs and services, please contact Brent Barringer by emailing bbarringer@monarchprivate.com.About Monarch Private CapitalMonarch Private Capital positively impacts communities by investing in tax credit supported industries.
