Moreover, until recently, little has beenwritten or 'taught about, the valuable contributions which minorities have madeto science, engineering, and medicine.Because it is estimated that not even 10 percent of minhtycollege entrants. %are adequately prepated--or motivated--to seek degrees in,these fields-- it isespecially important that minority students showing interest in or aptitude forthe sciences be advised, (by junior high at the'latest!) to concentrate on math-,f,eics, science, and the 'language arts when choosing their high school- courses. It is equally important'the they - -and their classmates -- become more aware of ,kthe roplayed by minorities in the development of our Scientific and techno- .logical society. This Instructional Suggestions Bulletin is plapnea as a resource to 'helpscience teachers and counselors assist and advise students making academic andcareer choices. It offers an historical perspective on the development ofscience, engineering, and medicine and, the outstanding contributions made byminority groups. It also provides current role models (local as well as world-wide) for minority students.

Science and history books made/little' mention of their'discoveries and'inventiolipland,'as a result, too few lack students learnedaboutthe.conLributions that- members of their race have made to the world ofscience. Today's\"Black students should be.given the opportunity to study about theseindividuals and learn about their contributions.t This can be accomplished bycounselorswhb take the time to'etiphasize to Black students the, importance ofthe academic sciences, and byreachers who makean'extraeffort to encouragethe' participation of minority students in the study of science. Science is anestablishment that is truly committed to equality for all people& Failure toteach the, accomplishments of any race is a great disservice to the members ofevery race% Ii a ,HIST6RICAL AND CONTEMPORARY ROLES OF BLACKS Evidenceof the long march of Black history can be found from the OlduvaiGorge to the Sahara D\"ert. Archeological ,findings and the'dating of fossilsindicate quite strongly that East Africa was the cradle of humanity, that itWas here'that the world's first people made their appearance approximatelyone and three-quarter million years ago. Here, too, it is'believed, was theoriginal home of our more.remote ancestors whose origins caffobe traced backtwenty-five million years to the Lower Miocene epoch.These discoveries point, also; to the likelihood that the use of tools spreadfrom here--where stone implements for chopping and cutting were made over twoand one-half million years ago--to the countries of Europe and Asia. Duringthe three periods of the Stone Ag a Aumber'of progressively sophisticatedtools- -from all - purpose hand axes. o scrapers, 'picks, cleavers, choppers, etc.- -came into use. (In the rain fore ts, for example, heavier tools were neededfor chopping, as were finer ones for woodcarving.)AOther inventions dating from 30,000 to 100,000 years ago include tool handlesand the use of fire. Spears for fishing probably came next, as did boatbuilding; the use of pigments to make paint (for rock and wall drawings and todecorate the body; the-making of stone and bone knives and fishhooks; andpaintings which clearly depict a mixed African - Egyptian culture. In\".theirpaintings, the pre-dynastic Egyptians often pictured themselves as havingskins of black, reddish - brown, or yellows Scholars who have examined some 800,skulls discovered that while many were a mixture of Semeticand Caucasianstock, at least one-third were Negroid. It is generally conceded that Afric'answere the first to discover, extract, and refine iron. The people of the.ancient.Kush culture '(which is regarded as heavily inflitencing that of Egypt) 5 c. 4,* made their its capital, /ilia, a center-of iron- working.-It leThere (Ethiopia of the Bible) that civilization reached its highest:level,in the yeais from 250.B.\u00b0C. to 100 A.D.These people smelted the iron, using blast furnaces that operated anthe bhsic piinciples of those of today,-and fathiOned.it into such items as spears-and hoes. t The remains of, blast furnaces (constructed'of densely- packed, heat-retaining earth taken\\frow!the giant of Afiia.

Excavations in the Valley of the Nile have shown that Stone Age Blacks made ,pottery earlier than did the residents of the worlesfirst,city. It is knows that much later, the peopie_of Kush, who excelled at pottery making, grouhd colored earth to make pigments with which to decorate their work.Credited with being 'the' first to learn about the planetary system, early cans took the initial steps towards developing this science whiCh became espe-\u00b0,cially popular in Egypt, a civilization that-Blacks helped build over 6,00 years ,ago. They employed irrigation, plowing, hieroglyphic writing, calenda embalming; . and a decimal number system. The'Eiyptianwords for 1, 2, 3 and 10 are of African origin\"; those for 6, 7, 8,,and 9, 7semetic7-ind ating that their root language was African and that their number base was 5,t was here, too, that one of the earliest forms of cursive writing was de elope4 a form which -evert now - has been only partially deciphered.Thd early Africans, who were much given treflected their needs and conditions--grating and farming practic. ,therocks and soils by their water-bto grow crops and rocksby tclassification, used criteria thatd which could be applied to theirlisted grasses by their grazio valde; ,aring capacities (soils also by their abilityr MinAal'content); plants by the seasons '(wet - or dry) in which fruit was - orne; animals by theit habits; and clouds by the* relationship to the weather. The knowledge acquired in this way,anabled them to develop the best\".farming techniques for each area (foreits, open-woodlands, add grasslands); facilitating crop growth by making full use of natural condi- tions and the traits of different plants.Sensitive plants were sheltered from the sun and natural drainage utilized (as was the natural compost created by failing leaves). In areas with poor soil, a land rotation system was used and cattle manure and wood,ash were employed as fertilizers. The independent evolution of agriculture, uninfluenced by that of other cultures, occurred first in West Africa. Wheat, barley., millet,,and rice became the staple foOds and, much later, were supplemented, by anumber,of foreign crops.,The medicine men of the.Belgian Congo used ('and still use),Rauwolfia (from , whichReser:pine, a tranquilizing drug used for treating hypertension and'mental disea 'se, is made) .for Variousnervous and mental ailments.'

Henson (1866-1955), one of the, world's ablest expldrers, was thefirst man to reach the North Pole. (As his companion, Admiral Robert Peary,watched, Henson planted the American flag at theyole in celebration of thishistoric moment). Many long years of hard work, discouraging setbacks, andpainful struggle lay behidd this-moment of'triumph. Henson, who was born inMaryland, had a difficult childhood, His only real education came from thekindly 'captain of a ship on which he served, as a cabin boy for five years.Those years awakened in him a love of travel and a, desire for knowledge. Hen-son eagerly accepted Peary's invitation to accompany him on a, trip to surveyfor a possible canal across Nicaragua.: Although he was hired as, a servant,his skills and determination soon made Henson a valuable member of the surveyteam. ,Aea result,, when Peary decided to undertake his first voyage of Arcticexploration, he asked Henson to accompany him. This was the first of theseven journeys they made to the Arctic, journeys cul inating in'that finaA. day .of tand discovery. In the many years Henson spent traveling and livingam, ng the-Eskimos, he became one of the worliils foremost authorities on the 14 Arctic.This led to a consultant,job with:the American Museum of Naturalliis-tory in, New York, two honorary degrees, numerous medals and awards and perhapsmost memorable, the heartfelt accolade of Peary, \"I can't get along withouthim.\"Although outbursts of racial prejudice delayed the presentation of someof these awards, it could not stop this man, who began as Peary's servant andbecame his partner in one of mankind',4Lmost challenging pursuits of conquest. , \\I.-, o , t. from Control and /In-formation*4Systems DivisionNASA/HeadquartersElettriCal Engineer'NASA/Johnson, Center ChiefOffice ofiEnvironiental. .HealthNiS,A/Lewia Research.Center ,names 'B..\u00a7.11flathematidsIbuisiana (departmental' honors)Fisk University 11.Diane M.

Bothgoals may be met when, for example, a discussion of the nervous system includesmention of the work of Nobel Laureate Ramon Y Cajal or when,the contributions ofsuch prominent scientists as Juan Vucetich (fingerprint classification), Dr. Domingo.Liotta (heart-transplants) or Dr. Luis Alvarez (hydrogen bubble chambers) are`described.Hundreds of men and women are listed, amongIthemtome of the world's most prom-inent physieians and scientists. Classroom recognition of.their many and impor-tant achievements - -an acknowledgement that accomplishment knows no racial orethnic boundiriea--can benefit both Hispanic and non-Hispanic students. -:65. IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS OF HISPANIC* SCIENTISTS Heroes (examples, role models; those of whom it can be said \"If he/she did i4so can I! \") are especially important to minority students 'Seeking to change the, _patterns of the past., Because little has been written-7or taught - -about theicd- lishments of Hispanics, especially those in the fielda of science, medicine,4andeChnology, students hal'ie not had the opportunity to identify with Hispanic\"heroes\" in these areas: Achievement is not--and should never appear to be--the sole province of-any pnegroup or culture. When limited vision is allowed to distort-this reality, every- 4 one suffers.A knowledge and appreciation of the many and significant contribu-tions made by Hispanic scientists can--and should be--a part of the education ofall students. -A HISTORY OF HISPANIC SCIENCE Hi'sp'anic science, whichshas'roots in both Spain and the New World lands of Mexico,Central and South AmerVCa, has, over the centuries, born the stamp of many differ-,ent cultures. 4 I-PThe cave 4wellers of the Paleolithic -Era' (the time when humans first learned tohandle anashape materials, to use fire, and to study the'animals)and plants they'encountered), showed a talent for biologic#1 observation; a traitcrevealed,in suchremarkably accurate drawings of animals ed paintings of standingand squatting bison at Altamira,'Spain. tainted in xe.d. d outlinecOin black,these pictures were the work of a people who took great pains to mix their colorsimperly.They used soot to make black paint, and iron _for the red an- yellowcolors.Their paints were stored in bones (especially skulls) then-mixed with,water and applied 'to the cave walls with fingers and brushes. . ,.In \"Roman Times, LuciusCorailius Balbus, a mathematician bora in Cadiz La cityfpunded by the Phoenicians). during the early first century B.C., became Caesar'schief engineer and latert'a prominent government official. From the fourth century until the days of the Moorish invasion, the-expansidn ofthe Roman Empire and the-spread of Christianity impeded the progress of'science. ',The need teonform to established belief or face a charge pf heresy, and thetendency to limit the practice of science to churchmen, combined to matte this anera of scientific stagnation. -, -;1 *.Isidore of Seville was perhaps the best known Spanish scholar of 'the early MiddleAjges;.a time when the study of natural phenomena was'considered by many ChurchauthOritieb to'be an affront to God; His often'credulous EtymoloOae; a ZOume encyclopedia of the. arts and sciences which salvaged mud) of tbe learning of*Hispanic refers to a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban;ientral or SouthAmerican, or other Spanish culture or-origin, regardless of race or Country ofbirth. 313ti ,)1_ ^ the 'time.

In' an erawherkthe church-waS just comipg to terms with the popular science of astrology,_Isidore accepted many of its /tenets. He distinguished, however, between natural'astrology (in, which the Moon influenced plant and animal life and'cbntrolled thehumours of man) and superstitious astrology (which dealt with-predictions andprophesies); , Early in the 8th century A.D., the 'conquering Moors entered Spain, bwinging)iiith them knowledge of'Wrabic,Hindu, and some Greek science. For several den-'turies Spanish sciente. was-AO reflect the contributions of three widely diver--gent cultures -- Moslem, Christian and Jewish. The ninth and 10th centuries saw the creation of a remarkable and distinctiveArabic civilization in Spain and a stage of development unequalled t1en - -or formany centuries laterin Christian Europe. Cordova, the seat of the Moorishgovernment,'had at its height foi example, some 200,000 homes and miles of pavedand lighted streets. The Emirs (rulers) of Cordova became, as had their prede-cessors in Asia. patrons of learning. Thanks to their influence, Spainbedame a,wealthy, enlightened country., Loving luxury, the Spaniards encouraged themaking ofrich leathers and fine swords; the raising of Arabian horses; and thedevelopment of such ne \"inaustries as silkweaving, glass and paper making, andenameling.Silver wamined at.Jaen; pearls found at Catalonia; and coral`taken from along the dalusian,Coast. The Persian garden (now reflected inthe typical Spaniah g rden) was introduced, as were the exotic semi-tropicalfruits; vegetables, pla and trees whose growth was made porible by newirrigation technjquea. ,At first the fatalism inherent in the Moslems' faith inhibited the pursuit ofscientlfic studies unrelated to' manufacturing or agricultural procedures. TheSpanish Jews' involvement. in pure'science spurred the Arabs' inUrest; hoWever,and because contact with the Jews was not as limited as *as that with theChristians, they were soon on the way to/What has been called the golden ageof Moorish science. That age was indeed a golden time, a period when a single library containedover 600,000 volumes; when 400 camels were required to transport the books ofa prominent doctor; and when'a wealthy man might donate upwards of 200;000pieces of gold.to found a college' (SedgeWick & Tyler).' Cordova became the of scientific investigation with'medical knowledge, in particular, beingmuch 'sought after. It was here, too, that veterinary surgery first became afull-fledged science..Botany; pharmacy, astronomy,* alchemy, metallurgy, horticulture, and abori-' .culture were among the popular studies of the time. Algebra and other mathe-matic were put to practical uses. A mariner's compass was invented. TheGiralda, the first observatory in Europe, was built in Seville; astronomy thenbecame so popular that rich students were soon building private observatoriesfor \"their own use.Because pilgrimages to Mecca were a religious duty for the devout Moslems,travel,.with stops at the major cities of the time, became commonplace. Onthese journeys, scienti s visited their colleagues in other areas, copied . '1323 manuscripts, and discussed new,disclpveries. As all spoke the same language,their knowledge soon spread throughout the empire. (From there it t jelled, to France and Italy, the low countries; Scotland, and England). The Jews', many of whom spoke the Moors ' language, shared in this s en4ficexchange.Unhampered by the Christian religious restrictions rep rding dealingswith infidels, they found the whole of Arabic literature available fdr their use.Most, Christians of this period, in-keeping'with the teachings of their church,saw the world and its contents as finite and subject to the inevitable destruc-tion awaiting all things mortal, an attitude incondycive to scientific reSearch,-Curiosity and heresy were too closely related for comfort and many regardedscience as a tool-of the oppressors. The sciences ofastrology and alchemywere practiced, however. One of the best known Christian astrologers and chem-ists of theotime was Hugh of Santalla who worked under the patronage of Michael,Bishop of Taragona. Hie writings included the earliest Latin version of an _alchemy text, work on wmaacy, and two treatises on spatulamancy.In bringing scientific knowledge to Christian Spain, the Jews again took the-lead.Well-educated, with a fluent command of language, they worked in groupsof three or more to trahslate the writings of the Arabs. Arabic was renderedfirst into the vernacular or Hebrew, then into Latin, theriinto popular liter-ary form.Many technical terms ,9ould not be translated and so the language ofthe Medieval Latins (and by extension, today's_ English); was enriched with suchastronomical and mathematical terms as azure, zero, zenith, cipher, azimuth,algehia, and nadir. The 10th through'12th centuries were a high period ofJewish learning in Spain and their works, whether origlhal or translated fromthe Arabic, greatly influenced the directions takeny Western thought. (A'list of the great Jewish and Moslem scientists who were residing in Spain, circa900r1200 a.d. and who helped direct... the course of Hispanic science is includedin AppendixA). - .As'Moslem control weakened (a trendtwhirh could be Seen by the end of the 11thcentury, though Moorish scientists would be a part of Spanish history for yearto come) and the Jews became ever more isolated from the mainstream of Hispaniclife, Spain and itssscienc grew increasingly western in orientation.Alfonso X of Castile (1221-1287), whip not the most successful of Spanish mon-archs, was so noted for his scholarship, encouragement of learning, contribu-tions to law, poetry', and the recording of history and commentaries on alchemy,that he bedate known as Alfonso.el SabiO (the Wise). -The revisedplanetarytables he ordered prepared (based on the Ptolemaic view of the universe andknown as the Alfonsine Tables) were the best available for the next three cen-turies.He is also remembered for commenting during their preparation that hadGod sought.his adifide during the days of creation, he'would have recommended asimpler design for the universe. Several centuries later a moon crater--\"Alphonsus\"--was named in his honor.SArnald of Villanoxa (1235-1311), an alchemist, was apparently the first person,to,notide that wood burning in a place where the ventilation waspoor gave offtoxic fumes.He thus,,effectively, discovered carbon monoxide; and ,was thefirst to prepare pure alcohol.

MODERN HISPANIC SCIENTISTS Nobel Prize.Winners Five men of Hispanic heritage have won the Nobel Prize for their contributionsto science and medicine, three in the category of medicine:and,physiology, onein chemistry, and one in physics.The earliest of these was Santiago Ram6n Y Cajal (182-1934) Who receivethe.Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology in 1906 for his efforts (Using his im-proved methods of cellular staining) in working out the connections bf the cellsin the grey matter of the brain and spinal' cord (demonstrating the system'scomptexities)in determining the structure of the eye's retina, and establish-ing the neuron theory which stated that the nervous system was made entirely ofnerve cells and their processes. Born in Petilla,a village in the Pyrenees,'Cajal,(the son of a \"surgeon ,of the second class\"), Cajal was considered backwards while in school, and was apprenticed first.to a barber; then to a shoe-maker.Thanks to his father's tutoring, he was finally able to study medicine,graduating from the, University of Zaragozvin 1873 and, taking his medical de-gree from the Uni4ersity of Madrid. After his compulsory Army service in Cuba,he becate a demonstrator and professor of anatomy at Zaragoza; heldthe Chhirof Anatomy at Valencia (where he did research in bacteriology and' serology);then, turning to his major field, histology; held the Chair, in thaf subject atBarcelona.In addition to his work which lead)to the Nobel Prize,-heauthorednumerous, highly-acclaimed articles and books on the nervous systemvand a num-ber of popular essays, including a treatise on color photography.'Arientinarborn physician and physiologist, Bernado Albertaioussay (1887-f,the first Latin-Amerfcan winner, received thae,hondr in the category 414, _Atof Medicine and Physiology in 1947. His award-winning research led to dis-coveries of the crucial functions of the pituitary gland in the body, espe-cially-its effect on the course of sugar metabolism (demonstrating that a hor-mone secreted by the pituitary, prevented the metabolism of sugar and that in-jections of pituitary extract inchiced symptoms of diabetes) and enabled him todemonstrate the complex interlocking hormona1 effects involved. The Juan Peron-controlled press of Argentina considered the Nobel-Prize a political affront toPeron; Peron had removed Houssay from his University post because of his anti-Nazi, pro-'American opinions. (Houssay'3 response was that Nobel Prize\".). Houssay, who workedprivately until Peron's exile in 1955, was then reinstated at the University ofBuenos Aires Medical School. Be is also known for his studies in thee physiologyof circulation, digestion, and the nervdis system, and,for research in snakeand spider toxins.Severo Ochoa (1905- ), a Spanish-Atherican biochemist, received the NobelPrize in Medicine and Physiology in 1959. A graduat5 of'the University of ,Malaga, he receivdd his medical degree with honors from the University ofMadrid; ten doctor of Science degrees from schools in the United States, Eng=land, Spain, and Israel; a law degree from the University of Glasgow; a doc-torate of medical science from the University of Santo Tomas in Puerto Rico;and a Dr. Honoria Causa from the University of Brazil. lifter leaving Spain in1936, he spent one year in Germany and three in. England before coming to thSU.. S.a.-1940 (he became a citizen .in 1956) and becoming .(in 1942) a member ofthe faculty of the New York Univeisity College of Medicine. Known for his re-search On the chemical mechanisms of the body (especially how molecules ofcarbon dioxide are \"incorporated into and liberated,from compounds), his work(along with that of Lepmann) helped identify the two-carbon fragment, a keycompound in the metabolic pattern. He is best known. for his work on nucleicacid, and for isolating an enzyme (from a strain of bacteria) which reacts withnucleotides when a second phosphate unit has been,added and which, when strungtogether, form molecules of RNA. With syntbetib RNA, un'ike the natural RNA inwhich ,all varieties of nucleotides exist, he could start with one variety and,build up one which was endlessly repeated.Luis Walter Alvarez (1911- ), of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berke-ley, California, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968. Dr. Alvarez,who is alto a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley,is known for his investigations of thd properties of nuclei and of particleresonant states. the, co- discoverer of the cosmic ray East-West effeCt, he also-designed the first neutron die-of-flight spectrometer; linearaccelerator; the first charge exchange (tandem) accelerator;'several hydrogenbubble chambers and bubble Chamber film measuring systems; and was the first tomeasure the neutron magnetic moment. A patentee in radar Apd optics and memberof the President's Science Advisory Committee, his list of honors and awardsincludes the Collier Trophy, the Medal for Merit, the Scott Medal, - 'CaliforniaSc'lentist of the Year, the Einstein Medal, the Pioneer Award of\"the Institutefor EleCtrical and Electronic Engineers, the National Medal for Science, theA.

Because people outside the Anglo-Saxon accorded thesame respect.given their non-minority counterparts, theirachievements often go Unrecognized and, as a result, students are not giventhe opportunity to study and appreciate their work; Progress cannot be--andshould never be-- attributed to the contributions of any one country or groupof, people.It is, rather, a credit to the efforts of men and women from everyknown race, religion, culture, and civilization. CONTRIBUTIONS OF JAPANESE AN]) CHINESE SCIENTISTS AND'ENGINERS . The intellectual appetite of the Japa nese people may be counted as 'one of theirjvirtues and their interest in the unknown is particularlystrong.Thus, even dsping.the 250 years when, the country was closed .to the outside worlA the ,study df Western science, primarilyin themedical field, was puvtued by a certain number'of people throughNagasaki, the only city permitted at that time to conduct foreigntrade. In mathematics,, although. the figures were completely different fromthose used in the West, great progrest was achieved in certain fields,and as early as the f7th century, ,the theory of differential andintegral calculus had_alreldy bee' discovered.This love of learning of the Japanese people, coupled with an academiclevel which was extremely advanced, although limited to anatrow(.sphere, provided the conditions necessary, once the Meiji goveYnmentintroduced Western learning into the country, tofbring about anamazing dissemination of general education in various fields ofacademic endeavour. For example, Dr. Hideyo NogUchi, who was destinedto become world famout bacteriologist in tropical diseases ,started fr4m humble beginnings as the son of a Very poor farmer.(Japan in hvnertion, Ministry-of-Foreign Affiirs; Japan. 1975).A was made inthe improvemenc,,sf'strains of rice', cross-pollination., cultivation, irrigation, and fertilization. This was made possible by the now open wipunicationbetween clans and villages, by subsidies,,, and bythe government-fostereddevelopment of more modern tools and production methods..,The present emperor of Japan also has 4a strong iriterest in science,-particularlymarine biology and botany. He maintains a lab within the grounds' of the-Imperial'Palace and has collaborated oncsuch scientific works.aeOhe Sea Shells,'of Sagami Bay and Nova,4lora Nasuensis, He has made great progress in the .study of the hydrozoa, one of the most primitive forms of-life and is also.knownfor his studies of theplantlife in the vicinity of pasu in Tochigi Prefect.*ended in the mid-19th century \u00b0 79Cj .1O .The scientific and Xechnologica1 contributions made by people of Japanepe-- ,and Chinese--ancestry 41M far too numerous to list hetle.The following are -tbut a few of these important accomplishments:ASTRONOMY As early as 400 B. C., Sfuh Sen, Wu Hsien, and Kan Teconstructed celestialcharts (using the modern coordinate system referenced to the equator) which'accurately described the positions of more than 1500 individual stars. Thtfirst Chinese eclipse records date back to 1361 B.C. andtheir'list of novaeand super-novae details.some 90 of these events between 1400 B.C. and 1690 A',D..(Only three super-novae have ever been recorded and the first of these; theorigin.of the Pal) Nebula in Taurua,.was recorded only by Chinese and Japaneseastronomers in 1050,.D.) They listed 581 comets between 1600.;:.1.C: and.1600 A.D.arid, as early as 635 A.D., noted that the tails of-comets, point away from thesun.Their reiVy recorded observations of Halley'S Comet - -the earliest467 B.C.--helped modern astronomers approximate its orbit. Meteors and mete-orites were also listed; as were the appearance of sun spots (phenomtna they,observed as early as 28 B.C.). .4Chang Heng (78-139.A.D.), one of the greatest Chinese scientists, not-onlyexcelled in astronomy but in mathematics (calculating the value of pi),engineering, philosophy, poetry, geography, painting, and seismography. Amdnghis many inventions was a eater-driven planetarium.

'Shigeyoshi Mori (flourished c. 1600A.D.) was the founder of the abacus calculating method in Japan and YasaukiAida (1747-41817 A.D.) evolved Japahese'work on math, the dinko-ki 01 which explained 404operations on Soroban, including square and cube roots. oshisukeMatsunaza.(1693-1744 A.D.) was the first J anese to calculate pi'down to 49 decimal .. points.Naonobu Ajima_4-1.---21798 .D.), One of the 'two most important men.,11..Japanese math, simplified the comp ex-calculating methods of time; foxmulated.an original theory on the circle; developed an infinite series de ling'with .problems of logarithmic theory, cylindrical\\inteesection, and the investigationof equations; andmgolved the problem of inscribing spheres within a larger.'sphere.MEDICINE Because acupuncture has become a household word in America, we tend to forgetthat Chinese medicine is-7and has long been--qufte,similar to flat of the modernWest'.Pien Ch'io(500 to 600 B.C.), who specialized in pediatrics and femalediseases,'laid the foundation of sphygmologf.in his book, NO Ching.

The possibility of sex reversal was mentioned in-80 A.D. and human urineWas .used to treat sexual dysfunctions as early as the third century B.C. Themedievalists used crystalline hormones extracted from urine-(by evaporation orthrough the use of precipitants) for thialourpdbe, generally separating maleand, female (and yoking and old) urine but sophisticated enough in their ideas-to prepare special mixtures of die 'two for certain con*ditions. From the eighthcentury on, placental tissue was an important fart of hormone therapy and,starting in-the 13th century, testicular tissue taken from animals was used totreat some of'the problems for which androgens are now prescribed.China's easily physicians were the first to add mineral drugs such as mercuryand antimony to their pharmacopia and the first, to recognize that diet alone4could cure some diseases; (In the 14th century A.D., Hu Ssu-Hui wrote a bookin which the ue of diet to cure beri-beri was advocated). Another physician,Chu Hsiao (flArished 1390 A.D., died 1425), wrote an important treatise onmedicine', but made bls major contributions in the field of botany; describingand illustrating 414 species of plants, among them many new ones; and accli-matizing many wild plants for use in times of famine. 44In 1247 A.D., slung Tzhu wrote the first work medicine- -The Clearingof the Innocent; or The /aching Away of Wrongs and the Japanese physician,Gempaku Sugita, opened the world of Western medicine to his' people when he zeh translated a famous Dutch medical'book. MODiRN CON11/4IBUTIONS The limited number of documents translated into English and the decided lackof intereseby Western historians,in, the science and engineering of the FarEast probably explain ths\\paucity,of *formation available during the longperiod from about the first century to. the 1700'8,4. At.that time, Asian namesonce again began.to appear in scientific journal*, primarily as a result of,,work,d6ne.in cooperation with European scientist*.Oneof the first of these was Baron Shibusaburo Kitasato'(1856-1931) who,attracted by the ,UntributiOns 9i.Robert Koch, traveled to the mid-19th-cedtdlry to work thii renowned scientist.

CONTRIBUTIONSTO .SCTENCE, ENGINEERING, AND MEDICINE The following paragraphs haVe been excerpted and combined from speeches givenby Jerry Elliot, a NASA aerospace engineer and an Osage/Cherokee Indian. Onespeech *as presented. during National Native American Awareness Week (October 14,1976); another for the University of Oklahoma/NASA Space Symposium (\"Careers forToborrow,\" March 17-18, 1977); and the \"gOther.Earth..,Father State University Symposium (April 27-28, 1977). e\" The centraj. theme of Native American Awareness Week (October10-16, 1976) is to focus national attention on the many positive,achievements made to society by American ,Indians and to more realis-tically portray the true image of American Indians in modern,America.,,The non-Indian is seeking a new understanding and appreciation of theIndian in modern society. To them, we wantto bring the real imageof our native' people, and destrpy distortipn ok whichwe the victims -so long. Thesb- days an Indian doesn't need to dressor act like an Indian because he is one. Today we exist everywhere.and are making notable contributions in education, law, medicine, art, 1bpsiness, science, and literature. This represents the greatestgrowth and self-determination that has ever been assembled in the 4 two hundred years of this country's existence. Despite fiR grave problems that face us, the greatest goals'American Indians face are with our young people. We are proud of. our past, our heritage, and find deep meaning in our ancestry. But_Aar are we going to pass on to our children for 'the future? Thefuture of our people lies in the hands of our youth.We area peoplewho know where we have been and where we are going.But if our ,chil-dren are to look forward to anything in the future, it is importantthat we retain our Indianness. We need to hold on -to what is impor-tant to us as Indian people. Today, more than ever, it is importantthat we listen to our older people'so that our children may enjoy a ,future Indian'life. For us to survive, our younger generation needsto undeistand and retain our,valuea and beliefs.0the story bf the iiIndian in' America is something more than therecord of frequent aggression, greed and broken promises by the white,man.Itis more than turquoise jewelry, beads, braids,jand johnWayne movies.It is a story bf endurance, of survival, of adaptation-and creativity in the face of overwhelming obstacles. ,It is a storyof enormOusvtontributions to the-countiy--- - Today,- I see a new day. C 17This week, I see a new beginning.Thisyear,.I see a new future.4,Let us walk with peace and beauty in our hearts and accept that whichyill produce good things for our people. 'Let us touch.Loft us, eachto the other,nourish each other: Let us not destroy ourselves by,-fOrgetting that'we are-all,Indians. Let us have a common voicezthatcan be heard.I offer a prayer to keep our people iogether. This isthe day the spirit sliesks to all our mat and women..11311 0r'e Yesterday, 'we were disappearing as snow before the setting Sun. ButI strongly believe in my heart that we are not a vanishing race, onlyan unconquered one. From where the Sun now sets in the father sky, let the winds ofchangeblow in a new direction foi our people We need to reach but and grasp that'which is needed for our survival. 'We need to seek skills pat will provide us a sense of worth andpurpose Technology is touching all of our lives. But what is scienceend technology? Actually, it has to do with interpreting thephysical world, the world around you everyday. It is the'classifica-tion of Mother Naturd'. To the Indian, it is studying and appreciatingMother Nature in the ways we have always respected, but in another'way. a It comes under the fategory of new knowledge.The Navajo wise men say science has a definite place in mankind'senvironment.Since science is knowledge of the laws of:nature, theybelieve the more one goes about acquiring this knowledge, the cldser,one comes to the mysteries of the universe and to the Great Spirit.Engineers and scientists are doers. They make things happen. It isnot science that is harmful but how it is used that may be harmful.Problems that face us today, such as the energy crisis, environmentalpollution, unwise deveIopmdnt of resources, and using space for thebenefit of mankind, cannot be solved without the aid of the engineer.We need soundlelgershipto protect our land and_our resources and tomeet the needs of our people.' We can no longer afford to drift.aThere can by no,turning back as a race, as a nation or planet. To doso could prove to be a guarantee of extinction. Since our very survi-val is dependent upon how well we are prepared for the future, none ofus.should play down the importance of the technical opportunities',available to us. When we turn our back on the.future to concentrateoh the present, 'we cannot see what lies ahead. We cannot allow our-selves \"to beCome shortsighted. 'The dwindling resources, pollution, and contamination of the Earth,our Mother: are examples of some people's shortsightedness. Andmany still have blinders on. We need young, fresh minds to help\\solve these-problems We need you to accept the challenge. Yes,,you are the future of our people If you let it happen!',-S. .70r, A HISTORY OF AMERICAN' INDIAN SCIENCE They .came, it is thought, from the mountainous land now calleil Siberia andthey came, a few ap a time, over uncounted thousands of years , and reachedthe WeStern HemislAere by.crossing the Bering Strait.' Of many tongues ofvaried (but generally Mongoloid) stock, these primitive wanderers (theearliest were of the Stone Age) from an isolated country knew nothing ofother peoples', or their accomplishments. On their own, in a new and untouchedworld, they were to develop over the centuries cultures remarkable for theircontributions,inventiveness, and scientific \"oneness\" with the laws ofnature.Spurred undoubtedly 0 the hard necessities of their lives.(thesearch for food, shelter, and safety in unfamiliar surroundings, and thelimitations imposed by,their simple tools and a scarcity of tamable animals),..'they learned to investigate and respect the world around them and to cultivateand preserve its riches. In the process, the nomadic hunters who becameNorth, Central, and South America's \"Indians\" (a latter-day misnomer resultingfrom Columbus' belief that he had reached India) also became both naturalagronomists and the first true environmentalists.Believing that all aspects of life were governed by nature, the AmericanIndians learned in the years following their arrival to revere \u00b0Mother Earth\"2(who, together with the sun, was consideAd the source of life) and strived tolive in harmony with her. Staying \"in balance\" with nature was,essentialjust to their well-being-but to their very survival* Accordingly, it was aswrong to offend the water gods by polluting their domain (led to illness) asit was necessary to placate the spirits of newly killed animals and celebratethe planting of the corn crop '(rituals which promoted respect for animal lifeand for the land). Most of them \u00b0took from nature only what was necessary;used contraception to prevent the birth of children neither they nor theirearth could support; and, followed myth-based agricultural practices whichrevealed their powers of observation (planted beans tnd corn together, therebyachieving a balance between the corn's. depletion of soil nutrients and the ,beam' restoration of them) and their' modernity (sang to their plants). Tiiosefirst Indians roamed the hemisphere, following the prey' (mamiOths, giantcamels, and mastodons) they hunted with crocks and stone spears. As the supplyif-animals, lessened, however, they became increasingly dependent on plant lifeand on their.. ability to utilize, adapt, preserve, and store the products 'ofnature and, most important, to develop new food crops. Starting with teosinte (teocintli),'a wild grass of Central America, IndiansthroughoUt the Americas spent hundreds of years developing what*is now the'world's third-,most important grain3. Continually observing and experimenting1Receht evidence suggests that this migration began between 50,000 and 100,000. , 1. or more years ago.2In the Navajos' story of creation, a tale now especially prophetic, ChangingWOman,and the sun were the,parentssd twin herpes who saved the world frommonsters liVing here when the first people arrived. From their father, thesun, came the technolO6, used to slay the monsters. ( .. , 3Com, which requires complicated care and cannot be scatter 'planted, is themost highly developed grain, knownlivome researchers believe this.to be anindication of its age and of, therefore, the possibility that Indian civilize-,tion could predate all others. 115 \"`.ti '5 (scientific techniques which probably resulted 'from .their \"taste and -take theConsequencee'introduction to the plant life of the NW World, they harvested,sowed; crossbred, and processed the grain, eventually producing over 300 (ormore).variefies of maize (corn).

(Other techniques includedroasting cashews An their shells, a treatment used for rendering their juicenon - poisonous, and a complicated process for leeching out the tannic acid in ,. the acorns used to make flour.)
