Ideally, they are built to filter and remove waste from the body. But modern living - from pollution to a Standard American Diet - can clog these pathways, making it harder for your body to efficiently process waste. One of our most popular programs, the [Provenance Detox](/provenance-detox), is designed to support these systems through whole food meals, targeted supplements, and our hydrating herbal tea tonic - custom blended and brewed in house. What makes this [Immune-Boosting Herbal Tea](https://www.provenancemeals.com/shop/immune-boosting-herbal-tea) detoxifying? Our unique blend of dandelion, nettle, cleavers, ginger, hibiscus, and lemon peel. Dandelion You may know dandelions as pesky weeds, but they are actually nutritional powerhouses with high levels of essential minerals like magnesium and zinc. Dandelion reduces inflammation, is great for the skin, and can help balance hormones. Most importantly, dandelion supports liver function and helps to boost your body's own natural detoxification process in the liver - filtering blood, metabolizing fats, and aiding digestion. Nettle Stinging nettle is another plant that may seem bothersome in the wild, but actually contains powerful health benefits. Natural polyphenols in nettle leaves act as antioxidants to help prevent oxidative stress and accelerated aging. They have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties to help fight infections, and can help lower blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Cleavers Cleavers is known particularly as a lymph tonic. Your lymphatic system is like a drainage system for the body - moving toxins and endocrine waste away from the tissues and into the bloodstream to be filtered by the spleen. Cleavers also support the kidneys and help reduce water weight gain. Ginger Ginger is a warming spice that is excellent for aiding digestion. It stimulates bile production to help your body break down and efficiently eliminate waste. Gingerol, the main bioactive compound in ginger, is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant to help fight oxidative stress in the body. Hibiscus Hibiscus does more than give your tea a lovely pink hue, it directly helps with weight loss by inhibiting the productions of amylase - an enzyme that helps your body break down carbohydrates into sugar. This means a lower absorption of starch and glucose. It can also help calm the nervous system and reduce anxiety and depression. Lemon Peel Lemon peel contains even more vitamins and minerals than lemon juice. It's particularly high in vitamin C and d-limonine, which helps detoxify the liver. It also has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, helps with a variety of metabolic functions, and even helps with weight management. Remember [a detox is all about self-care](/provenance-detox) and nourishing your body especially during stressful times. We encourage all of our clients to plan a detox to support their body during seasonal changes. A detox is also great pre- or post- vacation or important celebrations, to help recover from an illness, or to kickstart weight loss and a new clean eating routine. "}
