A poorly functioning immune system can cause anything from susceptibility to the flu to serious health concerns like cancer. Many factors can contribute to a disordered immune system. These include insomnia, stress, poor nutrition, stagnant Qi, exposure to toxins, and more. Suffering from poor immune health can cause significant health difficulties and add stress to your life. Health challenges that are related to poor immunity include: The common cold The flu Bronchitis Sinusitis Seasonal allergies Asthma Digestive difficulties Chronic or recurring diarrhea Chronic or recurring constipation Nausea or vomiting Autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's, Celiac, or rheumatoid arthritis Cancers like leukemia, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer Fortunately, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has solutions for both boosting your immune system and helping your body to heal holistically. Each methodology works to find and treat the cause of your immune system difficulties - rather than just addressing symptoms. Acupuncture is the gold standard of TCM treatments, assisting in pain relief and unblocking the flow of Qi throughout your body. Additionally, acupuncture has been shown to increase the production of defensive white blood cells throughout the body, allowing your body to hone its response to bacteria or other invaders. Many other Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments can accompany acupuncture and increase immunity. These include cupping, gua sha, moxibustion, herbal remedies, homeopathic remedies, and the application of essential oils. Additionally, Neuro Emotional Technique can assist in healing by addressing the patterns at the root of your immune system response. All TCM remedies are designed to work in concert with each other and with your body to provide you with long-term health and wellness.
