READY TO TAKE A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF AND FAST-TRACK YOUR WAY TO THE TRULY BALANCED + THRIVING MIND, BODY AND LIFE YOU'VE BEEN SEEKING? You try your best to eat well. You practice yoga (although you wish there was more time for it!) You've tried meditation (though it felt impossible to switch your mind \"off!\") You're the \"woo-woo\" one in your family. You're switching to natural cleaners and skin care. You shop your local health food store. You own almost as many crystals as you do essential oils, you've tried reiki and have even been to a healer or two! You follow inspiring wellness based IG accounts and binge listen to personal growth podcasts. You've taken countless self-development courses, have your own personal library of self-help books. Despite all the amazing things you do to stay happy and well, you haven't been feeling great lately. You just haven't been feeling yourself. Like something is \"off... You've been feeling a bit anxious, stressed and overwhelmed... well, burnt out! Brain fog, low mood, less energy, racing mind, feeling on edge. Uncomfortable PMS, digestive issues, tension headaches. Tired and unmotivated to do the things you love (and hitting snooze on repeat each morning!) So much has been going right in your life and you have so much to be grateful for! Yet lately you've just feeling a bit blah... unfulfilled, lacking zest for life. Disconnected from yourself and your purpose and not exactly sure why and how to get back on track. You *know* there's more in life for you. You're here for a reason! To love, to serve, to make an impact upon the world.. You're here to thrive. To learn and grow, to truly be your best self. You put a lot of pressure on yourself! Most people would never know it, but deep down, you struggle with self-worth and lack self-confidence. You can be really hard on yourself, beat yourself up over little things and often find yourself criticizing yourself or overanalyzing something you did or said. You've got a busy schedule! You've got lots going on, lots of responsibilities and lots to take care of. You find it hard to find time for yourself as you're always taking care of everyone else. You're a bit of a perfectionist. There's a pesky, self-critical voice in your head that holds you to impeccably high standards and leaves you waking up most days feeling anxious and under pressure from doing it all. You try to stay positive, but your busy mind can easily pull you down into a downward spiral of worry, self-doubt and negativity. It can feel really hard for you to properly switch off and relax which leaves you feeling exhausted and burnt out. You genuinely care about others, but tend to people-please and struggle with boundaries and expressing your needs. You give and give to make sure everyone around you is taken care of and your needs often goes unmet which leaves you feeling depleted, unfulfilled and (even resentful at times.) Something with your health doesn't quite feel right... whether it's poor sleep, lack of mental clarity and focus, tension headaches, feeling tired all the time, digestive issues or maybe your hormones? And you suspect it might be connected to your mental state. When it comes to feeling happier and healthier, you've tried it all... listened to all the podcasts, read all the books, went to workshops, gone to therapy, and maybe even your GP. You've journaled and practiced affirmations... all of which helps for a moment but feels more like a nice band-aid than a long-term solution. Despite all the challenges you've been facing, you're READY FOR CHANGE. You know when you put your mind to something you're capable of creating meaningful change. You know there's more to life for you and are determined to find the tools you need to make a lasting change and get on top of all this so you can start to truly enjoy life to the fullest again!

In these months of working with you, I've learned more about myself than in 30 years of life! I've gained massively when it comes to my self-confidence, authenticity and my inner security. My inner world feels so at peace and empowered and this makes me really happy!! I started a very healthy relationship with myself. I finally feel much more connected to myself, I know what my heart needs. I've started to love all parts of myself and have so much more compassion towards myself. I hear my inner voice, have started to follow her and the pressure I used to put on myself is not there anymore! My biggest take away is that I have all the power, knowledge and wisdom within myself. (I know this before but I had not that constant access I have now!) I've loved all of this experience! Seeing myself grow and becoming my true best friend. I finally feel like letting go with peace became a part of my nature! I would 1000% recommend Bindi, she is a blessing! She is soooo endlessly talented and I am deeply thankful being able to learn from her! There is no better investment than the investment within yourself.\" Working with Bindi was one of the best decisions I have ever made! Before I was extremely tense, anxious and burnt out. I felt very disconnected from myself and just wanting to feel more at home in my body and fulfilled. Common thoughts were: \"Something is wrong with you\", \"You \"Why can't you just be happy\", A core feeling of deep okay-ness is rising up inside me now, even on the days where I am not happy and thriving. I know now that this is part of the journey. I have a clearer sense of what I am here for, how I can serve the world and I am so lit up by that. I am taking away the ability to listen to my body and heart and acceptance for all parts of myself. And for the first time in a long time, I am feeling fulfilled again and deeply grateful that I am here! I always felt so safe, seen and heard, acknowledged understood and loved in sessions. It gave me the knowing that nothing is wrong with me. I never felt alone and could surrender and let go and open myself to the possibilities that lie underneath my struggles. I love the way Bindi teaches, guides and makes everything so applicable and doable. It really comes from her heart which can be truly felt. I know now that I have a wellness tool belt for life. After our sessions I was like a little kid jumping around because I was so uplifted and hopeful. I am so much more resilient and gentle with myself. My commitment to my path, my growth and alignment to my Soul deepened so much. One of the best feelings was that she saw my potential, believed in my vision and knew it's all possible for me. Sometimes we need a little nudge to follow our dreams and Bindi was definitely that nudge for me! I feel so empowered, brave and on the right path... like my Soul can breathe again! I laugh more, I feel more free. I can enjoy the little things and appreciate the magic around me. I can handle difficult emotions with calmness and ease and feel clear in my intentions and my life's work. Bindi is such a beautiful, kind soul with immense empathy and compassion. She has such a caring heart. I appreciate all the time and energy she invested into me and how much she was available (and how affordable it was compared to what I got out of it!) I would always and without hesitation recommend Bindi! \"Before starting Find Balance, I was feeling quite lost and scatter-brained. My body was feeling slow and sluggish and I was so frustrated by my digestion and chronic pain. My biggest frustration was feeling like I wasn't able to express myself as I'd like to. Some key things that have shifted for me is now being able to voice my opinion and feelings when I need to and knowing how to make myself heard, putting self-care practices in place (daily meditation, healthy, balanced, nourishing meals, taking daily time out for myself) and setting boundaries with my loved ones in the most loving way possible without worrying about upsetting other people. I have loved every minute of this work! Feeling like there's someone there who is truly listening and understanding everything I have to say. Having Bindi to hold space for me and to feel heard, respected and valued and knowing that whatever we might be discussing, I feel safe to open up knowing that she's there has been huge. My favourite part was knowing that I feel safe to fully and truly express myself, and knowing that between us we'll find the answer, or a step in the right direction to carry on the journey. I feel so much lighter, happier! I know that I am in control of the rest of my path on my journey of life. I have so much more clarity in my head! I would definitely recommend Bindi as a guide to others! This has been absolutely life changing, and I'm able to see things in a much clearer light. Thank you so much for the work you're doing, I can't believe how much it's helping me!\" I LOVE working with you, Bindi! Since our work together, I've gained an improved ability to be in touch with myself, and to feel emotions without trying to bury them. I've learned some practical tools that I can implement when I'm having a hard time connecting with my emotions or expressing myself. A key thing that has shifted has been my ability to get out of my head and into my body to assess how I am doing. I have really appreciated this, and realized that I spent a lot of time going in circles in my head, when my body is actually telling me \"settle down, you are at peace, you are OK\". Your ability to make me feel comfortable, heard, and appreciated - even through a screen - is very much appreciated. As someone who struggles feeling emotions, and crying openly, I have become less and less uncomfortable feeling these in our sessions, which has helped my overall ability to connect with these emotions. Your ability to pivot and adapt the session to what is going on in the current moment is very helpful. The practical exercises and assignments have given me real, concrete solutions to challenges I've been dealing with my entire life. My favourite parts have been the practical tools that I've learned and been able to implement on a daily basis, as well as some of those \"aha\" moments. I feel more at peace, a greater sense of trust in myself and that I am building my strength and courage. There has been a sense of relief, and a sense of healthy, empowered, independence. I now realize that my priority should be to be truly authentic, vs being the person that will keep me away from pain or hurt. This authenticity is the only thing that can bring me true joy and guide me on my path (and be the best thing for the people I love as well.) It has helped me learn to communicate with others my needs. I couldn't be more grateful for your guidance, support, and partnership in this work. I think so many people can benefit from your guidance, Bindi! YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO FROM ANXIOUS, BURNT OUT AND UNFULFILLED TO VIBRANT WELLBEING AND A THRIVING MIND WITH ZEST FOR LIFE You wake up each day feeling calm, balanced, energized and ready to take on the day. You flow through your day with ease, focus, drive and presence. You notice the beauty around you and feel so grateful to be ALIVE! Life has its ups and downs, but you know exactly what to do when anxiety strikes. You have crystal clarity on how to support yourself when life throws a curveball your way, so you ride out life's winds and waves with ease, balance and resilience. You have the energy and inspiration to do more of what you love... hello nature hikes, yoga events, spending more time truly present with those you love or finally creating that garden you've always wanted to! You have the confidence, headspace, inner fearlessness and to feel secure enough finally go after your dreams! Finally launch that dream business. Go back to school. Change careers. Meet your soulmate or build that relationship of your wildest dreams! Finally go on that spontaneous adventure or solo trip to Bali! Do more of what you truly love in love (and to actually remember again what those things are that truly light you up!) People pleasing is a thing of the past. You know your worth. You feel supported, seen and heard by those around you. You feel confident expressing yourself, your needs and boundaries in a loving way and your relationships are thriving (because you've done the inner work to create that reality!) You go to bed each night with a calm, grateful and truly fulfilled heart where your last thought is \"omg... this is my life!? Wow, I'm so grateful!\" You sleep like a baby all night long and wake up feeling rested, refreshed and thrilled for a new day ahead! \"Prior to taking this course my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I was feeling stuck both physically and mentally. I was plagued by negative habitual thinking that I was honestly unaware of. Bindi provided a professional, safe and caring space and supported me as I released a lot of pent-up emotion and self-limiting beliefs. I am not usually someone who can openly discuss my innermost feelings, but together with Bindi, I was able to unpack a lot of damaging thought patterns that had been with me for many years. These sessions led me to a lot of honest soul searching. Bindi guided me in reconsidering my existing beliefs with a fresher more balanced perceptive and I had some incredible life-changing \"light bulb \"moments. I have made some very positive changes to my life since. I look after myself with a lot more love but the most valuable change is at a very deep soul level. I feel infinitely lighter and quieter inside. I am still a work in progress but the war inside has stopped and I feel like a new person! Bindi shared wonderful insights and tools for me to incorporate into my daily life. I am eternally grateful for her generous spirit and the sacred space she shared with me. Find Balance has been so valuable for my growth and wellbeing and I highly recommend it to anyone needing some guidance in making positive change in their life!\" \"I am free from the anxiety that I was experiencing on a daily basis that consumed my mind daily. Before our work, I felt depressed, overwhelming fear and unworthiness. My anxiety would cripple me to the point where I couldn't even go to the grocery store without it taking over. I felt hopeless and stuck with no way out. I just felt numb and didn't feel like I experienced any joy or happiness even in moments where those feelings would normally be felt. Throughout the work I felt free and almost as if weights were slowly lifting from my shoulders as my vision started to become clearer as I developed a different way of looking at myself, the world, other people, and the experience of life. I have connected to my higher self. Bindi is kind, compassionate, understanding, accepting, and trustworthy. The environment and energy that I received from her allowed me to open up the closed doors of shame, guilt, embarrassment, hurt, pain, abandonment and memories that I had pushed so far down I forgot they were even there. Being able to trust someone wholeheartedly in a safe place was extremely comforting and also very powerful in my healing. The biggest transformations I've noticed in my mind and life is the abundant feeling of hope that stems from the core of my being every day that I wake up. I see what I can do, what is possible. I see my potential, happiness, mystical moments, wholeness and oneness now. I feel as if this has led me to the beginning of discovering my purpose and my work. I feel lighter, happier, calmer and present after completing this work and this is just the beginning. I can't thank Bindi enough for her teachings and giving me the space to heal. Grateful for this opportunity and for the time with you, thank you so much!\" \"I'm so grateful to have you in my life! Sometimes it makes me want to cry actually. To finally have someone who really listens, gently challenges and guides me and really cares. It really feels like I'm starting to really take control of my life, my anxiety and learn how to do it in a way that isn't a short-term fix or \"damage control\" kind of way. I never knew i had a higher self until you taught me that I did and how to listen to that. You're helping me so much so I can't thank you enough, really!\" \"You are helping me in more ways than you know... You changed my view on myself, life and the human experience so radically and I can feel more ease, joy and peace rippling into my life every day I'm starting to be much kinder to myself and much less critical of myself. I'm feeling a new compassion towards anxiety and I think of myself as not being alone anymore. We need people like you Bindi. People who don't judge, make us feel like there's hope and more to life for us... (unlike how I often feel after a GP appointment!) The less afraid I become of anxiety, the quieter I can feel it becoming. You're giving me the courage to feel like I can cope with it with compassion.\" \"I clearly reached another level in my life that I couldn't have done by myself... I reached out to Bindi as I felt I needed support to get clarity about my life purpose and overcome obstacles. Bindi not only helped me to do so, but also taught me how to accept myself and have more self-love, which is invaluable. I could see the positive changes throughout the coaching. Bindi is a pure gem, I highly recommend starting coaching with her as she will give you all the tools, support and kindness you need to get empowered and reach your goals. Bindi, just thank you for being who you are. I realize that you helped me twice in my life like no one else has done it on this planet.\" You receive your mind-body wellness assessment and goal setting forms and we create a personalized wellness plan Learn, implement and apply what you learn from our weekly meetings and text support You start to experience the happiest, healthiest, most vibrant you with your truly balanced mind, body + life I see you, love...
