The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) provides a taxonomic scheme that supports the accurate tracking and reporting of fields of study and program completions activity. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020. Information on the 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2010 CIP can be accessed on the resources page under the section heading Archive and Historical. On the 2020 CIP Website, you can view both the 2020 CIP and the 2010 CIP. The default option is to view the 2020 CIP, which is the most recent version of the CIP.
