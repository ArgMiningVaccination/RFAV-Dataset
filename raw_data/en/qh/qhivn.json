Is there a difference? Why choose to keep buying one over the other? As a Naturopath I see a lot of people wondering why I would suggest that use a different supplement over another. Here is a list of a few reasons of the difference between getting supplements over the counter vs. them being prescribed to you 1. Practitioner only means can only be prescribed by a naturopath who have spent 4 years studying and are apart of an association. Meaning we actually have to know our stuff to prescribe. 2. Many vitamins and minerals even herbs are found in different forms. Different forms may have different qualities or some might be easier to absorb than others. For example magnesium, one form is great for the nervous system and another the other is used as a colon cleaner, very different. Companies may choose a form that is less absorbed because it is cheaper. So you might be taking something and feeling no result because you aren't actually absorbing it (money down the drain). Without knowledge in the area, you may not know which one if best for you and your condition. 3. Naturopathic supplements tend to be at a therapeutic dose, which means it is generally higher in concentration and have been proven to exert clinical benefits. 4. Off the counter supplements tend to have more excipients, bulking agents or preservatives. Which for those with sensitivities or allergies, it can be difficult to pick which ones you won't react to. 5. Supplements aren't designed for long term use, they are to support for a shorter amount of time until the cause can be found and resolved. Without a naturopathic treatment plan you may be taking unnecessary supplements for too long, causing more harm than good. 6. Just because things are natural doesn't mean they are safe. Some herbs and nutrients can negatively effect medication, so it is import to have proper and safe advice associated. Don't waste your money on cheap over the counter supplements, get proper advice to be safe "}
