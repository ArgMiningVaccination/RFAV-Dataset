This is true not only where \"traditional\" medicine is practiced; it can also inform the ways contemporary doctors in conventional settings interact with their patients. This seminar explores a Buddhist perspective on health, illness and the healing arts with Tibetan physician, Buddhist monk and Public Health Ph.D (UCLA) Kunchok Gyaltsen. Other presenters include anthropologists engaged in cross cultural study of health and illness and local practitioners of medicine and Buddhism. The format includes lectures, invited response, audience comment and opportunity to engage in Buddhist meditation practice.
