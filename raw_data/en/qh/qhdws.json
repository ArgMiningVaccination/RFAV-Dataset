Course Descriptions Pharm.D. course descriptions, as well as registration information, and ter ms offered can b e found in the online catalog . 16 Interprofessional Education Oregon State University College of Pharmacy's interprofessional educational (IPE) program is based on the World Health Organization's definition of interprofessional education where \"...students from two of more professions learn about, from and with each other to enable effective collaboration and improve health outcomes\" ( WHO 2010 ). Our IPE program intentionally connects students from different health professions within our local community to learn how to provide interprofessional collaborative care to patients and their families. Utilizing t he Interpr ofessional Education Collaborative's (IPEC) domain of Interprofessional C ollaboration, our IPE program focuses on the core competencies of values and ethics, roles and responsibilities, interprofessional communication and teamwork . At Oregon State, IPE is an expectation of all students during their student career and is promoted as a framework for lifelong learning. The IPE program is integrated across the curriculum, with formal educational programming spanning the P1 and P2 years and practice oriented experiences through Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPE) and Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE). Our goal is to develop pharmaci sts that are team and practice -ready to provide high -quality, safe, and patient - and family -centered care to improve individual and population health outcomes. Since we work other colleges and institutions in the community, students may be required to tra vel off campus for IPE activities and course expectations. Students are responsible for their own transportation and carpooling is always encouraged. Experiential Education The intensity, breadth, and duration of professional experience provided at Oregon State University College of Pharmacy produces graduates who are prepared to participate in patient care and implement innovative pharmaceutical care programs in their person al pharmacy practice. Students progress from being observers of the healthcare system to active involvement in providing patient care in specialized settings. Early and continuing opportunities for students to apply classroom knowledge in pharmacy practice settings are at the center of the professional curriculum. Similarly, students will interact with students from other health professions to gain perspectives required to deliver healthcare in a collaborative team setting. A variety of experiences tailored to student specific interests assure that we achieve our goal of creating competent, confident, creative and caring independent pharmacy professionals. P1 Year Fall Term: Career Perspectives and Professional Development. Introduction to certifications, skills and attitudes expected of pharmacy professionals. Students will develop the necessary knowledge i n the areas of professionalism and teamwork. Preparation to participate in experiential education including: Board of Pharmacy Intern regulations, CV pr eparation, interviewing skills, HIPAA, etc. Winter and Spring Terms: Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience I & II: Community Pharmacy. Students will have the opportunity to complete community pharmacy rotations. Sites are located between Eugene and Sal em. If students are commuting, it may be possible to make 17 arrangements for student assignments in their city of residence. Transportation is the responsibility of the student. Goals: By the completion of the P1 year, students will be prepared for experien tial training in pharmacy settings and have the tools to effectively interview for a summer internship. An understanding of the unique role that pharmacists play in the health care team is developed during the experiential portion of the course and discuss ed in depth in the classroom. Students will have the opportunity to participate in immunization clinics, in addition to patient outreach events in the local community. All required paperwork and site visit reports become part of the student's experiential portfolio. Total Experiential Hours: 90 hours P2 Year Fall, Winter, and Spring Terms: Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience III, IV and V: Community Pharmacy and Ambulatory Care. Students will be assigned to assist in the ongoing provision of patient c are at sites throughout the Willamette Valley, with specific focus on patient counseling and immunization services in the community pharmacy setting and ambulatory care pharmacy.

Total Experiential hours : 120 hours P4 Year Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring Terms: Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience . The P4 year begins almost immediately after the completion of the P3 year and the Pre APPE Readiness Block. Each student will complete eight different rotations of six weeks each, 40 hours per week. Students are assigned one six -week period during the year to take as their \"off block.\" One rotation must take place in a rural or underserved setting that has limited access to health care services. Students return to campus each term for seminars geared towards pharmacists in training preparing to enter the w ork force. 4 Required Experiences: General Adult Medicine Hospital / Health Systems Community Ambulatory care 4 Elective Experiences: Student can choose from among a large variety of patient and non -patient care rotations. At least two electives must be in a patient care setting. Goals/Outcomes: Build upon the didactic lectures and introductory experiential training the student has experienced in the P1 through P3 years. By the time the student completes their fourth year they are prepared to enter any p harmacy practice setting to deliver optimal and evidence based patient focused care to a wide variety of patient population. Students maintain a copy of the project and presentation they complete at each rotation in their portfolio. Continuing self -assess ment and self -improvement are important aspects of the educational process throughout the P4 year. Total Experiential hours = 1920 hours In Summary: Introductory Pharmacy Practic e Education = 314 hours Advanced Phar macy Practice Education = 1920 hours Total = 22 34 hours 19 Students are eligible for intern licensure upon entering the Pharm.D program, at the start of the P1 year. As a P1, students will have the opportunity to function as an \"academic intern,\" but are not eligible to work in a paid internship position. Upon successful completion of the P1 year, students are able to apply and work as a paid intern. The College will be responsible for counting internship hours throughout the Pharm.D program. Upon successful completion of the program, t he College will notify the Oregon Board of Pharmacy that a student is now eligible to sit for the NAPLEX and MPJE exams. If a student has plans to practice in another state, he/she must request that intern hour/graduation information be sent to that state and comply with the Board of Pharmacy rules for that state. Additional Program Options Pharm.D./Ph.D. Program The OSU College of Pharmacy's Graduate Studies program offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in pharmacy with emphasis in pharmacology, pharmaceutics, or medicinal chemistry. The Pharm.D./Ph.D. degree option is available to students after admission to the Pharm.D. program. A separate Graduate Studies admission process must be completed, and acceptance to the program is not guaranteed. Students intereste d in learning more about the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program should contact Dr. Kerry McPhail (kerry.mcphail@oregonstate.edu or 541 -737-3424 ). This dual degree option would appeal primarily to students who have a passion for research and who want to spend most of their time working in research and new drug development, but who also want to have access to clinics and professional practice settings. This option requires roughly 3.5 to 4 years of work after completin g the Pharm.D. Pharm.D./Ph.D students may be eligible for a loan forgiveness program. Pharm.D./MBA Program The OSU College of Pharmacy offers a Pharm.D./MBA degree option in collaboration with the College of Business .

Residencies and Fellowships (Advanced Patient Care Education) Although not required for licensure as a pharmacist, some students choose to pursue advanced postgraduate education, such as residencies and fellowships. Residencies are experiences designed to provide practitioners greater confidence and skill in direct patient care, and to provide leadership in roles such as clinical care coordinators for health care systems. Fellowships are research focused experiences that prepare practitioners for roles in academia or other research based settings. 20 Section 3: Academic and Profess ional Standards Introduction Welcome to the pharmacy profession and a life -long learning process. There is no question that in your career you will make a difference in the lives you touch. Patients, colleagues and the public in general place a high degree of trust in the expertise of pharmacy professionals. Pharmacists commit to fulfill that trust by maintaining intellectual and behavioral competencies required to excel in their chosen profession. The Oregon State University College of Pharmacy is committ ed to providing students, staff and faculty a welcoming environment in which to learn and work. We promote community that is founded on collegiality, mutual trust, and respect. The College has a similar commitment to the public in assuring that professiona l students and, upon graduation, pharmacists have the essential attributes and abilities required to provide quality patient -centered care to a diverse population. The Oregon State University Student Conduct Regulations define several expectations of stud ents. The College of Pharmacy professional program has defined additional academic and behavioral expectations and characteristics considered essential to being a student pharmacist and pharmacist. Individuals who choose to become student pharmacists do so with the understanding that admission, progression and graduation are dependent upon their capacity to personally demonstrate essential characteristics defined by the College and profession of pharmacy. Academic and Professional Standards for students en rolled in the Oregon State University Pharm.D. program are outlined on the following pages. You must follow these standards whether at OSU in Corvallis, OHSU in Portland, or at a clinical site on a rotation. Academic policies, policies that provide for student and patient safety, and other requirements of the professional program are detailed. Also included are specifics of how policies are implemented, consequences of failing to meet standards, and appeal procedures. Every attempt has been made to be compr ehensive, but every situation may not be specifically addressed. The College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards committee has the responsibility to implement and interpret academic and professional policies and to determine how to respond to s ituations not specifically addressed. 21 Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists The Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists (\"Essential Characteristics\") identified below are drawn from a number of different resources that govern the profe ssional expectations of pharmacists, including but not limited to the national Pharmacy Code of Ethics, the Oath of a Pharmacist, and the Pledge of Professionalism. The Essential Characteristics are intended to ensure that student pharmacists and pharmacis ts educated at the College of Pharmacy have the capacity to meet federal and state regulations and policies that pertain to pharmacy, and to meet or exceed expectations that the public has for professional competence and behavior among pharmacy professiona ls. Academic and professional environments present different challenges, but the Essential Characteristics required to succeed in pharmacy are common to both settings. Students in the College must observe and fulfill the Essential Characteristics, which ha ve been divided into the following relevant categories: Intellectual Ability, Empathetic and Collegial Communication Skills, Psychomotor Skills, Respect for Diversity, High Ethical Standards, and Behavioral and Social Expectations. Under each category are examples that describe and clarify these Essential Characteristics. Intellectual Ability Comprehend, interpret and analyze new information Reason and carry out evidence -based decision making Use critical thinking skills and problem solving to evaluate information from multiple sources and synthesize a plan of action Thrive in a rigorous foundational and clinical science -based curriculum Participate in self - and programmatic -assessment intended to sustain a continual improvement process Be curious and pu rsue life -long learning Empathetic and Collegial Communication Skills Formulate concise, accurate synopses of essential information Contribute in a meaningful and collaborative manner in group discussions Interact constructively with other members of a hea lth care team Communicate difficult concepts orally and in writing at an appropriate level for specific patients or audiences Listen empathetically and develop rapport Appropriately display, and interpret, non -verbal communication signals Communicate fluen tly in English Effectively utilize resources to communicate in non -English languages 22 Psychomotor Skills* Participate effectively in preparation and distribution of sterile and non -sterile drug products Utilize and analyze information from varied sensory inputs Participate in drug administration, including injections Carry out tasks required for objective and subjective assessment of patient health Discern critical elements of a problem through observation Respect for Diversity Communicate in a manner that respects all individuals Proactively seek ways to provide an inclusive environment that addresses unique patient needs Provide care without judgment of a patients' personal choices or situation Individualize care with consideration of cultural norms f or the patient Individualize care with consideration of unique therapeutic needs or challenges High Ethical Standards Maintain confidentiality Act with compassion, empathy and altruism Accept responsibility and provide leadership Abstain from illicit drug use Act with integrity and expect the same of professional colleagues Behavioral and Social Expectations Demonstrate a history of appropriate behavior in personal actions Perform effectively and display sound judgment while under stress Perform appropriate ly in academic or professional settings Address disagreements with tact and avoid public altercations Exhibit the capacity to adapt to change readily and adjust responses in dynamic, unpredictable situations Accept constructive criticism and adapt behavior *Students may be able to be admitted and progress to graduation while not possessing selected psychomotor skills. In the instance of a documented disability, the College will work to provide reasonable accommodation. The absence of some skills, however, m ay limit the variety of settings in which a pharmacist can work. 23 Requirements for Progression Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students must meet university requirements and standards and adhere to the university Student Conduct Regulations ( http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct ). The College of Pharmacy has adopted additional requirements to assure that all pharmacy graduates have the best possible educational background and prepa ration for their pharmacy practice careers. College of Pharmacy standards may vary from or exceed the university standards in order to ensure compliance with policies, regulations and expectations specific to the pharmacy profession. Students are expecte d to meet specific academic and professional requirements to matriculate in the College of Pharmacy and to progress to each successive year of the professional program. Each student's standing is reviewed at the end of every term, or at any time in the int erim 'for cause'. The review includes core pharmacy term GPA, cumulative GPA, and other characteristics identified as being essential to student pharmacists and pharmacists. The professional Pharm. D. degree program at Oregon State University is designed to be completed within four years. The program combines didactic courses, structured clinical practice experiences, personal and professional development opportunities and, op timally, significant work experience. Our goal is to educate pharmacists that have a combination of foundational strength, and currency of knowledge and skills that will enable them to be change agents for pharmacy and societal health. In order to assur e currency and in -depth knowledge for each graduate, the professional program must be completed within a five year period.

Concerns may also impact progression by preventing licensure or placement in experiential sites. *Experiential sites may require additional backg round checks and drug screenings. Students are required to notify the College immediately of any events that could impact background checks or drug screenings. Students are also required to notify the College immediately of any interactions with law enfo rcement or events that could potentially result in disciplinary actions by a state Board of Pharmacy . 26 Academic and Professional Policies University Requirements and College Requirements Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students must meet university require ments and standards and adhere to the univers ity Student Conduct Regulations . The College of Pharmacy has adopted additional requirements to assure that all pharmacy graduates have the best possible educational background and preparation for their pharmacy practice careers. College of Pharmacy standards may vary from or exceed the u niversity standards in order to ensure compliance with policies, regulations and expectations specific to the pharmacy profession. Disability Access Services The College of Pharmacy will provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations to students with qualifying disabilities to maximize their opportunities for success. If a student suspects a disability may be limitin g his or her performance, they are responsible for contacting Disability Access Services (DAS) as soon as possible, at 541 -737-4098. All requests for accommodation must be approved by DAS. The University will determine whether accommodations can be offered based on a number of factors, including whether a student has a qualifying disability and whet her the requested accommodations would effect a fundamental alteration of the pharmacy program. DAS will work with the student to determine whether the student has a qualifying disability to receive potential accommodati ons. The College will determine, thr ough the Academic and Professional Standards Committee, whether any requested accommodations will effect a fundamental alteration of the program. Students with accommodations approved through DAS are responsible for contacting the faculty member in charge of the course prior to or during the first week of the term to discuss implementation of approved accommodations. To request accommodations, students must follow the procedures described at Getting S tarted with DAS, which include registering online, providing appropriate documentation, completing a DAS orientation, and making requests for accommodations each term. Students with disabilities are offered many different types of auxiliary aids to ensure access and accommodation to education. These auxiliary services and aids include (but are not limited to): accessible formats, alternate testing, note -taking services, interpreting services, and tape texts. Students must submit requests for auxiliary aids each term. If a request is submitted after the relevant deadline, DAS will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the request but cannot guarantee that such a request can be met. Untimely requests may result in delay, substitutions, or denial of accom modation Bachelor's Degree Requirement Pharm.D. students must complete a bachelor's degree before the beginning of their third professional year. Any student not completing the bachelor's degree prior to their third professional year will be placed on Susp ension and will not be allowed to continue until the bachelor's degree is complete. A 27 printed official transcript verifying completion of the degree requirement must be submitted directly to the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Prerequisites Stud ents may register for only those courses for which they have completed the stated prerequisite courses. Exceptions are allowed only with approval of the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee . Students are responsible for verifyi ng that they have completed all prerequisites. They must not enroll in any course for which they lack a prerequisite. If enrolled in such a course by mistake, they must immediately drop it. Enrollment in a course for which a student lacks a required prereq uisite will result in an automatic failing grade for that course. Incompletes Incompletes (I grades) in core professional pharmacy courses must be removed within three weeks after the date that marks the beginning of the next term or advanced clerkship. Failure to remove an Incomplete within three weeks will result in a failing grade for the class and the student will be placed on Suspension , unless the student has petitioned and been granted an extension by the College of Pharmacy Academic and Profession al Standards Committee . Repeating Core Pharmacy Courses A student may re -enroll in a pharmacy course one time for the purpose of earning a grade of C or above or earning a P in a P/N course. If the student receives a grade below C or N the second time t hey take a didactic or experiential course, he or she will be dismissed from the professional program. Selected courses include specific assessments that must be completed at a minimal level of competency. It may be possible for a student to pass the overall course, but fail to meet competency on a specific assessment. In this instance, students will be required to engage in remediation activities until the assessment(s), or approved equivalent, is satisfactorily completed. The student will not be al lowed to advance or continue into advanced experiential courses until competency in all areas of assessment have been demonstrated. Repeated failure to achieve competency will be considered equivalent to failing a course and may result in Suspension and D ismissal. Students who fail a core advanced experiential course are typically not allowed to continue using the previously approved advanced experiential plan. Students who fail a core advanced experiential course (PHAR 780, 785, 790, or 792) will typical ly be required to reschedule and successfully complete an equivalent advanced experience, prior to continuing in the program. The Assistant Dean for Experiential Programs, the Director of Student Services, and the Executive Associate Dean (representing th e College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee) will work with the student to determine the best path forward, including exploration of possibilities for remediation, if appropriate, before the student reenrolls in a subsequent advance d experiential course. Leave of Absence The Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program is a four -year program. Students may take up to five years to complete the program with approval from the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee . Any student wishing to use the fifth -year option (sometimes called \"flexing\") 28 must first petition the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee for approval. Students should contact the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor for specific instructions regarding the petition. Academic Integrity The College of Pharmacy does not tolerate academic dishonesty. Similarly, students must not tolerate dishonesty in the behavior of their colleagues. Students that engage in academic dishonest y will minimally receive a zero on the assignment, and may earn a failing grade in the course and/or may face Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program on the first offense. The process for handling academic misconduct is located in the Petitions, Appeals, and Grievances section. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to falsifying or cheating on an examination, plagiarism resulting from incomplete citations of source material, and other unprofessional behavi or as described in College and University policies. For situations that involve group work, faculty members have a responsibility to clearly define which assignments permit group work and which do not. The College expects all Pharmacy students to give appropriate credit to others whose ideas are cited. Students must actively participate and accept responsibility in group assignments when all members of the group receive the same grade. For work turned in for individual credit, the student must have indepen dently completed the work and accept personal responsibility for all work submitted. Definitions and examples of Academic Dishonesty are found on the OSU website under the Office of Student Conduct. If there is any question as to what constitutes plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty, students should actively seek clarification from the instructor. Examination Policies Students unable to take a quiz or examina tion at the scheduled time must make every attempt to notify the course coordinator before the examination period . Email or phone message will suffice in the case of incapacitating illness. In all other situations, prior permission must be obtained from the course coordinator - and may require written documentation. All students are expected to take all regularly scheduled examinations. If the course coordinator agrees that missing an examination could not be avoided, accommodations will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Accommodation will involve an assessment scheduled during finals week and may utilize a format different than the original exam. Questions or concerns about points or grading of an exam need to be submitted in writing, along with the exam, within one week of the date the exam was returned to students. Submitting such a request allows the instructor to review the exam for any additional oversights that may have occurred. Below are the College of Pharmacy standard examination procedure s: Sit every other seat. Instructors/proctors may arrange seating in a crowded room. 29 No hats or caps. Put your possessions away. Turn phones to silent. Zip backpacks. Scratch paper is not allowed. Using a #2 pencil, PRINT your name (registered name, n ot your nickname) and OSU ID# on the Scantron and the paper exam. FILL IN THE APPROPRIATE BUBBLES. Fill in the form number. Every question has a best answer. Mark the appropriate letter on the answer sheet. Do not ask questions during the exam. Write on the exam or in the margins if you want to note or explain a concern regarding a specific question; then indicate on the front of the exam any specific questions that you would like to have reviewed. The instructor will review your concern during the grad ing process. Students may notify instructors/proctors if there are inaccuracies on the exam (e.g. numbering). Only approved electronic devices (e.g. approved calculators) are permitted when allowed by the faculty of record. Leave the room after the exam. Do not stay outside the room as it causes distraction. Please take care of personal needs before the exam starts. Tell the proctor if it's an emergency. Students are expected to conduct themselves during examinations in a manner that will not be disruptiv e to other students. If health or personal situations may require a student to disrupt the class (e.g. if a phone must be left on to be available for a sick child), the student should notify the instructor prior to the exam. Students are expected to avoid behavior that might cause an instructor to be concerned about academic dishonesty. Phones, 'smart' watches, wearable technology that allows communication or data storage, entertainment electronics, tablets, mobile devices and computers must be turned off and stowed away from the student. Students may not have any of these devices in their pockets or within reaching distance. All papers must be inside a folder or backpack and put away. Students should keep test papers and scoring sheets covered when they are not being used. If a student receives approval to take an examination at a time other than the originally scheduled time, the student will be asked to sign a statement verifying that they have not received information related to the examination from o ther students and will not discuss the examination with students that have not yet completed the examination. Class Schedule and Required Assignment Policies Class, recitation, lab and exam schedules are established early in each term. Non -emergency perso nal plans should not conflict with scheduled class times, examinations or required assignments. Parents should make arrangements for child care on scheduled no -school days for their children who regularly attend school. Students should not schedule experie ntial rotations during scheduled class time. 30 When making personal plans, students should assume that it will be necessary for them to be available until the end of finals week. Students will not be admitted to examinations if they arrive after a student has already completed the examination. Generally, no additional time will be allowed if a student arrives late for an examination. The instructor does have discretion to allow additional time, if there are extenuating circumstances. If at all possible, stu dents are required to contact instructors prior to any examination, or assignment due date, if they will be unable to attend the examination or submit the assignment when scheduled. The remedy for excused absences is at the discretion of the course coordin ator and is published in individual course documents. Documentation of the reason for excused absences may be required. Unexcused absences from examinations will result in a failing grade. Student Guidelines Regarding Course Materials To protect privacy ri ghts, intellectual property rights, and the quality of the teaching and learning experience, the College of Pharmacy has adopted the following policies and guidelines governing course materials. Course materials include presentation materials created by in structors or other students, materials distributed in support of class activities, course assessments, and audio or video recordings. Except as provided below, students shall not give, sell, publish, or otherwise distribute any materials, in any medium, o f any course given at the OSU College of Pharmacy, without the written consent of the course instructor and the Dean of the College of Pharmacy. Students currently enrolled in a course may make audio recordings of course content, for use in study or other noncommercial purposes. Video recordings are not allowed. Students currently enrolled in a course may distribute recordings to other currently enrolled OSU College of Pharmacy students for use in study or other noncommercial purposes arising from particip ation in the course, but they must ensure that recordings are distributed only in private forums. Any online distribution or posting of such recordings must be made on a password -protecte d site available only to current Pharm.D. students . If granted permis sion to use recordings or content from faculty or student presentations (e.g. slides, figures, charts) in their own presentations, papers, or other scholarly activities, students must cite the source of those recordings or content appropriately. Students should exercise special caution when creating or distributing audio, video, or image recordings of patients or fellow students . Students must not create or distribute recordings of patients without securing the permission of everyone identifiable in the re cording and their course instructor or preceptor. Experiential Education Policies All pharmacy students have additional responsibilities to themselves, the College, their preceptor, and the profession to maintain the highest professional standards while in professional practice settings. These professional standards, or experiential program guidelines, are identified in experiential program manuals that will be made available to pharmacy students. Pharmacy students that fail to adhere to experiential pro gram guidelines are subject to disciplinary action and removal from the practice site, 31 which may delay or prevent graduation from the professional program. Several guidelines are emphasized below, but experiential program manuals should be consulted for a complete description of expectations. 1. Students must be licensed as a pharmacy intern with the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy, as well as any state in which they will complete a clerkship experience. 2. Students must exhibit professional appearance in both man ner and dress as specified by the preceptor. If appropriate, students must wear a nametag or ID badge approved by the College and identifying them as an OSU/OHSU student. Students may not use nametags from places of employment while completing clerkship ex periences. 3. Students are obligated to protect patient confidentiality and respect all confidences. 4. Students are expected to display active participation and initiative in seeking learning opportunities. 5. Students are expected to display respect and courtesy to the preceptor. Disagreements should be addressed in private as part of an overall learning process. 6. Students must be punctual. Changes in previously approved schedules must be communicated to and approved by the preceptor. 7. Students are encouraged to co mmunicate with healthcare professionals and patients. Communications that involve professional judgment should be discussed with the preceptor prior to implementation. 8. Students must be familiar with and observe all laws and regulations governing the practi ce of pharmacy and should seek clarification from the preceptor when necessary. 9. Students must fulfill the Essential Characteristics of Pharmacy Students identified by the College. Pharm.D./MBA Policies Prospective Pharm.D./MBA students: Must meet with C ollege of Pharmacy (COP) Pharm.D./MBA advisor to discuss the program. Cannot have a grade of C+ or lower in any class the term prior to meeting with the COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor in order to be eligible to take Core 1 or Core 2 classes. Must fill out and su bmit interest form online after meeting with COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor. The interest form will automatically be sent to the COP advisor. Once interest form has processed and student has been accepted, the student must meet with the College of Business MBA a dvisor. P1 students can meet with the COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor in fall term and register for winter term Core 1 or Core 2 courses, but must wait to fill out interest form until fall term grades are posted. o If the student receives a C+ or lower in any Pharm.D. courses in fall term, they must drop the MBA course they are enrolled in for winter term. Current Pharm.D./MBA students: Must receive a C or higher in all Pharm.D. coursework to continue taking Core 1 or Core 2 courses the following term. Cannot b e on warning or probation with the College of Pharmacy and are ineligible to take Core 1 or Core 2 courses in the term following their warning or probation. 32 Must inform COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor if they plan to withdraw from Core 1 or Core 2 courses. Must r eceive a B - or higher in all MBA coursework (as outlined in the College of Business' MBA Handbook) Must complete all Core 1 courses in order to be eligible to take PHAR 798, the MBA qualifying administrative rotation. Must notify Assistant Dean of Experien tial Education in fall term of P3 year that they want to be part of the MBA qualifying administrative rotation (PHAR 798) in their P4 year. (PHAR 798 MBA qualifying administrative rotations are limited. Eligible students will be ranked and then allowed to enroll until available sites are filled. Ranking will be based on progress toward completion of other MBA requirements and overall academic performance.) Cannot take more than one Core 1 or Core 2 class in any term of the P1 -P3 years, except summer. P1-P3 students must meet with the COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor every spring term to be eligible to continue taking Core 1 and Core 2 classes. Flex Students: Eligible to complete the interest form after meeting with COP Pharm.D./MBA advisor. Eligible to take Core 1 courses in the year they flex. Current Pharm.D./MBA Advisor Contact Information : College of Pharmacy Lauren Corwin (Meet with Lauren first) lauren.corwin@oregonstate.edu (541) 737 -3424 College of Business Robin Silveira robin.silveira@oregonstate.edu (541) 737 -5510 Student and Patient Safety Policies Disclosure of Criminal Activity Pharm.D. students must immediately disclose any encounters w ith law enforcement to a member of the Office of Student Services or Executive Associate Dean . Encounters with law enforcement include criminal activity, alleged criminal activity, citations, arrests, or any other interactions that result from student beh avior, or circumstances in which law enforcement intervenes and the student is present. The disclosure will be referred to the Academic and Professional Standards committee, but the Executive Associate Dean may determine that immediate removal from pract ice sites or Suspension is appropriate until circumstances surrounding the incident can be clarified. Failure to disclose may result in Dismissal from the College. 33 Disclosure of Board of Pharmacy Action Pharm.D. students must also immediately disclose any action taken against them by a Board of Pharmacy, including but not limited to any investigation, warning, probation , and revocation of licensure. Failure to do so could result in Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program. Criminal Background Check and Drug Screening Pharmacists are entrusted with the health, safety, and welfare of patients, access controlled substances and confidential information, and operate in settings that require the exercise of good judgment and ethical behavior. Accordingly, the Coll ege of Pharmacy requires all pharmacy students to complete Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening s. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening have become standard requirements for employment in pharmacy and placement in clinical rotations and early experiential rotations. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening may also be required for licensure. Students who cannot participate in clinical rotations and early experiential rotations due to criminal or other activities of concern that are rev ealed in Criminal Background Checks or Drug Screening may be unable to fulfill the requirements of their College program. Therefore, it is in everyone's interest to conduct Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening early to resolve any issues prior to commitment of resources by the College and by students. The following College policies regarding Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening were developed in accordance with national standards and the November 2006 Report of the AACP Criminal Background Check Advisory Panel. Purpose The purposes of criminal background checks and drug screenings include: To enhance the safety and well -being of patients, To ascertain the ability of accepted applicants and enrolled pharmacy students to eventually become a licensed pharmacist, and To bolster the public's continuing trust in the pharmacy profession, Application The policies regarding Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening apply to all applicants accepted into the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Accepted applicants must submit to the Criminal Background Checks, regardless of any previous criminal background che cks that may have been conducted for the applicants. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screenings are only completed on accepted applicants, and, therefore, the results are not a factor in the initial admission decision process. The College, however, may rescind an initial offer of admission should the results of either the Criminal Background Check or a Drug Screening show that the student has engaged in behaviors that are not consistent with the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists or are ot herwise indicative of an inability to fulfill the requirements of the College program for which they were admitted. Decisions to rescind admission are made on a case -by-case basis after a formal committee review by the College of Pharmacy Academic and Prof essional Standards Committee (\"APSC\"). The APSC will communicate its decision and the reason or reasons for its decision to the affected student. Accepted applicants whose 34 offer of admission is rescinded based on the results of the Criminal Background Chec k or a Drug Screening may appeal the decision through the standard College of Pharmacy appeals process. Background Check The College of Pharmacy requires that students submit to a Criminal Background Check using a vendor designated and approved by the Coll ege. Criminal Background Checks typically involve access to court records containing local, state, or federal incidents of arraignment, trial, and disposition; law enforcement agency records containing incidents of complaint, investigation, arrest, and ind ictment; and, correction agency records containing information about probation, parole, and incarceration. In addition, a sex offender registry check and Department of Motor Vehicle driving history check will be completed. Frequency: All persons enrolled in the professional program must submit to a Criminal Background Check following notification of admiss ion and no more than four months before matriculation. The College shares information regarding background checks with OHSU at the end of the second pro fessional year. This information is required before OHSU will issue an OHSU student ID, and an OHSU ID is required to progress into the third professional year. Background checks cannot be more than 2 years old at the end of the second professional year w hen we communicate background check information to OHSU. If your background check is more than 2 years old at the end of the second professional year, the College requires that you submit a new background check . The College will pay for this background c heck. Any student who has had any interaction with law enforcement must inform the College of Pharmacy (see Disclosure of Criminal Activity ). Failure to reveal an interaction with law enforcement may result in dismissal at any time that the event is discovered. Any student who has had an interaction with law enforcement will be required to complete a second background check, at their expense, at the end of the second professional year. While unusual, it is po ssible that specific clerkship sites or practice settings will require that students submit to additional Criminal Background Checks. Procedure: Students will be contacted directly by the College -approved vendor for background checks . It is important that students carefully follow directions provided. Results of background checks are sent directly to the College. Results are stored separately from the student's academic file. Committee Review Standards: The APSC will review all Criminal Background Checks. T he College may rescind an offer of admission, dismiss a student, or place a student on Warning, Probation, or Suspension, based on information revealed in the results of the Criminal Background Checks or conduct violations while a Pharm.D. 35 student in the C ollege . The College may also refer students to the Oregon Professional Recovery Network, a non -profit organization that counsels pharmacists regarding chemica l dependency . OHSU, individual experiential sites, and the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy will mak e independent decisions about the results of a student's Criminal Background Check. If OHSU refuses to allow a student on campus due to the results of a Criminal Background Check or the Oregon Board of Pharmacy refuses to issue an intern license, the stude nt will not be able to complete the professional program, resulting in dismissal from the professional program. Similarly, if an individual experiential site refuses to accept a student, progression will likely be delayed and it may not be possible for the student to complete the professional program. If the College is unable to find alternative experiential sites the student may, therefore, be dismissed from the College for failure to make reasonable progress in the pharmacy program. Confidentiality/Record Keeping: All records related to background checks are stored separately from academic files. Only members of the APSC and faculty associated with experiential education have access to Criminal Background Check results. College Disclaimer: The Criminal Bac kground Check process does not guarantee the safety of students, patients, faculty, or staff. An acceptable criminal background check, as defined by the College, does not guarantee the student will be eligible to complete the program or obtain a license to practice pharmacy upon graduation. OHSU, experiential sites or the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy may apply different standards or uncover new information not revealed in previous record searches. Payment Process: All expenses associated with a Background Check are the responsibility of the student or applicant. Refusing Background Check: A student will not be allowed to m atriculate in or continue in the Pharm.D. program if: He or she does not consent to required Criminal Background Checks, He or she has an unsatisfactory history revealed by the results of a Criminal Background Check, He or she does not meet the eligibility requirements for Oregon Intern Licensure. Drug Screening The College requires students to submit to a Drug Screening prior to matriculation. The test must be conducted by the College's designated vendor and will, at a minimum, screen It may also screen for additional illegal drugs or controlled substances. 36 [Cannabinoids: Recreational and medical use of cannabinoids, including marijuana, has been legalized for persons over 21 years old in several states, including Oregon. Possession, use , or distribution of marijuana in any form, however, continues to be prohibited on any of the University's campuses or facilities and during any University activities. These rules are consistent with federal laws that regulate institutions receiving feder al funds. Additional federal laws, such as the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug -Free Workplace Act also prohibit use of marijuana. A number of pharmacy corporations have personnel rules that prohibit use of cannabinoids. Stude nt use of cannabinoids may severely limit the ability of the College to provide student access to required experiential education practice settings delaying or preventing student progression. The College strongly recommends that students behave in a manne r that presumes possession, use, or distribution of cannabinoids to be prohibited in all settings. ] Regardless of state laws permitting use, any student that appears to be impaired by substance use, legal or illegal, in a curricular or co -curricular activ ity will be immediately removed and prohibited from patient care settings, and may be Suspended pending an investigation. Frequency: All professional students participate in a Drug Screening prior to beginning the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Students whose progression through the professional program is delayed are required to participate in a second Drug Screening prior to their fourth year in the professional program. Specific experiential sites or practice settings may also require additio nal Drug Screenings. The Assistant Dean for Experiential Education has a list of sites that require additional screening. Additional Drug Screening can be required \"for cause\" upon a reasonable suspicion that a student is engaged in the misuse of drugs or use of illegal drugs at any time during the professional program. If a faculty member, preceptor or colleague believes there is sufficient cause for Drug Screening, the request with rationale will be submitted to the APSC. The APSC will make all decision s regarding whether to administer a mandatory Drug Screening for cause upon reasonable suspicion that a student is engaged in the misuse of drugs or use of illegal drugs. The decision of the committee is final. The College will pay for the first \"for cause \" Drug Screening. Failure to comply with an APSC request to undergo Drug Screening for cause will be grounds for Suspension and, potentially, Dismissal. Procedure: Students will be contacted directly by the College -approved vendor for Drug Screenings. It i s important that students carefully follow directions provided. Results of Drug Screenings are sent directly to the College. Results are stored separately from the student's academic file. Committee Review Standards: If a student fails an initial Drug Scre ening, the medical director of the testing center will contact the student to discuss issues that might have resulted in a failed Drug Screening. The student may be cleared at that point or referred to take a second Drug Screening. The school is not notifi ed unless the 37 results of a second Drug Screening are positive, in which case the results will be forwarded to the College and referred to the APSC. If the College of Pharmacy is notified of a positive Drug Screening prior to matriculation, the student's offer of admission will be rescinded and the student will not be allowed to begin the Pharm.D. program. Current students with an unsatisfactory Drug Screening will be referred to the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy and the APSC. The APSC will determine the s tudent's standing in the College. Additionally, they will be referred to the Oregon Professional Recovery Network, a non -profit organization that counsels pharmacists regarding chemical dependency. Confidentiality/Record Keeping: All records related to Dru g Screening results are stored separately from the student's academic file. Only members of the APSC and faculty associated with experiential education have access to the drug screening results. College Disclaimer: The Drug Screening process does not guara ntee the safety of students, patients, faculty, or staff. Payment Process: All expenses associated with a Drug Screening, with the exception of a first drug screening for cause, are the responsibility of the student or applicant. Refusing Drug Screening: A student will not be allowed to matriculate in or continue in the Pharm.D. program if he or she does not consent to the required drug screening. APSC determines whether a student should undergo a drug screening 'for cause' based on a demonstrated failure o f the student to meet the Essential Characteristics of a Pharmacist that the APSC reasonably believes may be tied to substance abuse. A student who refuses drug screening 'for cause' will face Suspension and then considered for Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program. Experiential Site Requirements Specific Experiential Sites may require students to complete background checks, drug testing, immunizations, or other requirements on a more frequent time frame than required by the College. Students are responsible for the cost associated with these requirements and should check with Experiential Directors about additional requirements when selecting experiential sites. Confidentiality, Diversity, and Harassment Training All pharmacy students receive training on issues relating to confidentiality (including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training), diversity, and harassment. These training sessions assure that student, staff, faculty and patient inform ation is handled appropriately and that students, staff, 38 faculty and patients find an environment that is welcoming and respectful. Training sessions offered by the College occur early in the first professional year and again before pharmacy students move to the OHSU campus, and they are mandatory. Individual experiential sites may have additional training requirements. Identification Pharm.D. students are required to wear a nametag while representing the College at any experiential site or event. The namet ag must be approved by the College and identify them as an OSU/OHSU student. Students may not use nametags from places of employment while completing clerkship experiences. Immunizations All Pharm.D. students must have TB screening . Each student must have complete immunization records on file with Student Health Services before matriculation into the Pharm.D. progra m. If immuni zation records are not complete, registration for winter term classes will be blocked and the student will be placed on Suspension. A Hepatitis B Surface Antibody blood titer is required by the end of the second professional year. Annual TB s creening is required of all pharmacy students. Students should review the categories outlined on the TB Annual Monitoring Form provided by the College and follow procedures appropriate for their category. Individuals with a history of BCG vaccination ARE N OT exempt from this requirement. P3 students are required to meet OHSU's immunization standards. Specific clerkship sites or practice settings may also have site specific immunization standards. Information regarding OHSU's immunizati on requirements can be found by reading the New Student Immunization Requirements . This immunization policy is necessary to prote ct the health of students and patients. Therefore, students who do not maintain current immunizations or com plete an annual TB screening will have holds placed on their registration and may be referred to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Blood -Borne Pathogen Training Blood Borne Pathogen training assures safety for healthcare professionals and patients in situations where body fluids may be present. Mandatory training sessions are held at several points in the professional curriculum. A dditional training may be required by specific experiential sites. CPR and First Aid Certification Students must have a current Fi rst Aid Certification and Healthcare Provider CPR certification at the time of matriculation to the C ollege of Pharmacy. Alter native certification may be substituted, but must be approved by the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Online certification, or recertification, for CPR or First Aid is NOT accepted. CPR certification must be current while enrolled in the College of Pharmacy. Newly admitted students may not begin the program if proof of current Healthcare Provider CPR and First Aid certification is not 39 provided prior to the first day of fall term classes. If a student's Healthcare Provider CPR certification lapses , a registration hold will be placed for the following term and the student may not progress until proof of current certification has been received by the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Immunization Certification Successful completion of the Im munization Certificate Program (which allows you to give immunizations) is required of all professional students prior to beginning the second professional year. Students will be provided one copy of the immunization certification certificate. A fee will be charged for each additional copy requested. Bodily Fluid Exposure an d Needle Stick Policy Post -Exposure Procedures Student pharmacists experiencing a body fluid exposure should immediately cleanse the wound or mucous membrane with soap and water, or if contact is to the eye(s), flush with water for several minutes. Exposure involving a known HIV positive source should be considered a medical emergency and post -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be initiated within 2 hours of exposure per CDC recommendations. The exposure should be reported immediately to the appropria te personnel at the site and at the College of Pharmacy. The student pharmacist should immediately contact the Director of Experiential Programs and seek care for necessary medical testing and evaluation for post -exposure prophylaxis. Advanced Pharmacy Pr actice Education (APPE) If the exposure occurred at an APPE site, the student should immediately notify the preceptor and the Director of Experiential Programs. The student should seek immediate medical evaluation and care with employee health at the site or, if directed, with the nearest urgent care/emergency department, health care facility or personal physician of choice. The preceptor should provide guidance to the student regarding the procedure to follow regarding post -exposure medical care and the st udent should comply with the preceptor's instructions. The Director of Experiential Programs and the Director of Student Services should be notified as soon as possible regarding the incident. The individual who is the source of any potential blood borne pathogen should be informed of the exposure by the preceptor or the Director of Experiential Programs, not by the student. The preceptor or Director of Experiential Programs should arrange for consent to be obtained from the source for the appropriate medi cal testing. Introductory Pharmacy Practice Education (IPPE) If the exposure occurred during a patient visit for IPPE, the student should immediately notify the Director of the IPPE Program, the Director of Experiential Learning and the Director of Studen t Services. The student pharmacist should seek immediate medical evaluation and care. The source should be informed of the exposure by the Director of the IPPE Program or the Director of Experiential Programs. 40 Other College of Pharmacy Sponsored Events If the exposure occurred during a College of Pharmacy sponsored event other than IPPE or APPE, the student should immediately notify the faculty advisor or the preceptor involved in the event, the Director of Experiential Programs, and the Director of Stud ent Services. The student should seek immediate medical evaluation and care. The source should be informed of the exposure by the faculty advisor or preceptor, not the student. Laboratory Testing Laboratory testing should be conducted for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C based on current guidelines and available source patient data. Laboratory testing should be conducted immediately after the exposure. Additional testing may be required over the next few weeks or months. Results of laboratory testing shou ld be re ported directly to the student. Costs of Treatment APPE and IPPE sites are under no obligation to provide medical evaluation or treatment if needed. Some APPE sites will treat the student as they do employees but sites are under no obligation to d o this. Students should learn the policies and procedures to follow at each site by discussing them with their preceptors. In all cases, the cost of treatment is the responsibility of the student. The College of Pharmacy does not provide reimbursement for costs related to exposure. Students are required to have health insurance and are expected to use their insurance to cover costs of treatment. Reporting Form Students should make reports using the Incident Report Form in Appendix E . Other Policies and Requirements Email All pharmacy students are required to activate and use their ONID e -mail account. Official correspondence from the University (including the College of Pharmacy) will be sent to the ONID e -mail accoun t. Students are responsible for information sent to their ONID account. Forwarding ONID emails to another email account is not recommended. Failure to receive e -mail because your alternative email account is no longer valid or for any other reason related to use of an alternative email account will not be an acceptable excuse for missing information or assignments communicated from the College or University. All Pharm.D. students will be assigned an OHSU email account. Pharmacy students are required to chec k both their ONID and OHSU email account s and will be held responsible for any information sent to either e -mail account. The College asks that you maintain these professional standards when using email: Check your email daily, as you will be expected to do while working full time. You will have both an OSU and OHSU email account. As a P1 and P2 you will be expected to check your ONID daily 41 and your OHSU account at least twice per term. When you move to Portland for your P3 year, you will be expected to ch eck your OHSU and ONID email daily . In general, compose email exactly as you would compose a written business letter or a written assignment for a class. Devote the same attention to editing and proofreading - or perhaps greater attention! After all, no one individual class assignment will cost you a job, but a poorly written email might. Use a subject line that will be understandable to the recipient - something like \"Question about Immunization Requirements.\" Using an extremely short subject line like \" Hi\" or \"Question,\" or leaving the subject line blank is confusing and unprofessional . Use the correct salutation for the recipient - \"Dear Dr. Proteau\" or \"Dear Ms. Austin Haney.\" Not using a salutation is unprofessional and can imply a demanding tone . Please don't use first names until the person has told you that doing so is okay. Marital status is irrelevant, so use Ms. rather than Miss or Mrs. for your email salutations. Please be aware that a ll pharmacists are not Doctors, many are RPh. and using Dr. would be inappropriate. If you don't know Pat McGee's gender or credentials, then do some research. Get on the organization's website or you can call them and ask. \"I'm writing to Pat McGee. I've never met Pat and I want to use the correct form of address. Should I use Dr., Mr., Ms.?\" You can also consider asking faculty or advisors if they are familiar with a pharmacists' credentials. Be clear and direct. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation should all be perfect. Take the time to properly compose, proofre ad, and edit your emails. If you are concerned about your ability to use correct English grammar or spelling, please contact any of the advisors. Use a standard font like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman at 10 to 12 pt. Email is not private and emails a re forwarded all the time. Assume the president of the Board of Pharmacy, the CEO of your employer, and your grandmother will see everything you ever write in an email. Inappropriate, disrespectful, or hurtful communications are considered a significant br eech of professional ethics as described in the Essential Characteristics of a Student Pharmacist and will result in the referral of student behavior to the Academic and Professional Standards committee. Use a signature block at the end of your emails that gives your name and contact information. An example is below. Benny Beaver Pharm.D. Candidate, 2022 Oregon State University and Oregon Health & Science University College of Pharmacy Class President Cell: 541-555-1212 Here are some additional resources on -101.html Dress Code Students enrolled in a professional program are expected to dress in an appropriate manner. Typically, classroom and laboratory settings are informal, but students should adapt their dress to that which is commonly observed on the specific campus at which they are attending classes. Business casual attire is commonly expected in practice settings or in educational settings where patients are present. Guidance from preceptors or instructors regarding site or campus specific expectations should be respected. In all settings, students should be well groomed and use good judgment as to what constitutes attire that is 'too casual' for a professional program. Students who wear attire that is unprofessional may be asked to leave the site or classroom. Students wit h repeated violations will be referred to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Professional Student Orientation Program Professional student orientation programs are held prior to the beginning of each professional year. Attendance is require d and students are responsible for all information presented. If a student cannot attend an orientation, they must contact the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor at least two weeks in advance. Intern Licensure All incoming Pharm.D. students are requ ired to apply for their Oregon intern license prior to matriculation. The OSU College of Pharmacy requires that all Pharm.D. students have an Oregon intern license. Any student that is unable to get licensed by the Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) will not be allowed to matriculate or continue in the Pharm.D. program. The actual licenses will distributed within the first two weeks of the fall term. Your intern license allows you to participate in structured educational activities in a pharmacy immediately u pon entering pharmacy school. These activities will progressively develop your competency in a practice setting, so that you are prepared to assume the full scope of responsibilities of an intern by the end of the first professional year. Please note that during the first year of you professional program your license only allows you to act as an intern while completing course requirements for the professional program. You cannot use you license for any non -academic purposes, such as employment as an intern, until you have satisfactorily completed the first year of the Pharm.D. program. It may be necessary for students to obtain an intern license in additional states, if they choose or are assigned to advanced clerkships outside the state of Oregon during t he fourth professional year. General and Professional Liability Insurance Each College of Pharmacy student is covered under general liability and professional liability insurance through a commercial insurance policy purchased by the Students of the Oregon University System. This insurance delivers liability insurance on an occurrence basis, with primary limits of not less than $1 million/$3 million. 43 This policy covers students only when they are engaged in activities that constitute a required component of the professional pharmacy program. This policy does not cover activities a student engages in as a component of his or her personal professional development plan that are not required components of the pharmacy program, such as outside work as a pharm acy intern or volunteering at outreach events . In order to ensure that students are adequately covered during these outside activities, students are required to maintain individual liability insurance coverage. Student Health Services First and second pr ofessional year students are required to pay OSU student health fees. Student health fees provide access to OSU's student health services, but do not provide for a personal or group health insurance plan. Third professional year students are required to pa y OHSU student health fees, which provide access to OHSU's student health services. Fourth professional year students are required to pay both OSU and OHSU's fees. Student Health Services Records Requests Students can request copies of immunization docume ntation or other records from OSU's or OHSU's Student Health Services, as applicable. Such requests may take up to two weeks to process and students should plan accordingly. See their websites for more information Requirement Pharmacy students are exposed to risks in experiential practice sites and on the OHSU medical campus. Additionally, many experiential practice sites require students to have adequat e health insurance. Therefore, all stud ents are required to purchase the OHSU student health insurance plan (SHIP) which covers students for an entire year. Information about the 1 8/19 SHIP can be student m ay be able to request that another health insurance plan, such as the plan provided by OSU Student Health Services , a spouse's employer etc., substitute for the OHSU plan. Students must follow all OHSU procedures for requesting such a substitution. Waivers are only granted to students who have another plan that is comparable in coverage. Waivers must be renewed annually . Waiver procedures, deadlines, and requirements are described in detail on the OHSU Student Health 44 Student Standing in the College of Pharmacy The Academic and Professional Standards Committee (\"APSC\") may, at any time, review a student's standing in the College of Pharmacy . APSC is charged with ensuring that students are aware of academic performance or behavior which is not consistent with Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists and that, therefore, places their completion of the Pharm.D. program at risk. Academic performa nce and behavioral concerns are often evaluated independently but have equal significance in determining whether a student is meeting the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists. Severe, continuing or repeated academic or behavioral problems can r esult in dismissal from the Pharm.D program. APSC, when necessary, provides Student Standing information to communicate performance deficits, insufficient student progress, and lack of progress in a student addressing academic or behavioral problems. APSC and the College's Director of Student Services/Head Advisor provide students guidance regarding what the College expects from a student to increase their opportunities for success in the College. Student performance and progress are evaluated on a case -by-case basis, utilizing the experience of APSC members. APSC uses good faith, informed, academic judgment to determine appropriate recommendations for each student's situation. The following Student Standing notifications may be received by students who are demonstrating performance deficits or insufficient progress in the Pharm.D. program . Warning Warning status is cautionary and identifies student performance which may place a student's completion of the Pharm.D. program at risk. Students are placed on war ning status if they have a term core pharmacy GPA of less than 2.5 or receive 2 or more C grades in core or elective professional courses in a term. Students may also be placed on Warning status if they engage in behavior that does not meet the Essential C haracteristics of Student Pharmacists . The first time students are placed on Warning status , they must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor to discuss their situation. The second time students are placed on Warning status , they must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor and develop a holistic action plan for overcoming academic and non-academic barriers to success. They must subsequently execute this action plan. The third time students are placed on Warning status , they are automatically placed on Probation. Probation Probation status identifies an academic or behavioral concern that places the student's completion of the Pharm.D. program at serious risk. This may be the result of concerns that arise while enrolled in the professional program, or in some cases if concerns are evident prior to beginning classes, a student may be considered to be on probation prior to matriculating. Probation may be accompanied by a delay in progression at the determination of the APSC. 45 Students are placed on Probation status if they have a term core pharmacy GPA of less than a 2.0 or if they receive a C - or lower grade in any core or elective professional course. A third warning automatically results in Probation. Student behavior that i s a significant departure from the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists will also result in Probation status. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to, violations of Academic Integrity policies, criminal violations, repeated or intentional violation of college policies, or significant breaches of the University Student Conduct Code . Students on Probation status mus t follow recommendations of the APSC and the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Students on Probation status must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor following each term to review their progress and standing in the College. Stud ents that successfully fulfill the recommendations prescribed will be removed from Probation status. Students that fail to follow or are unsuccessful in fulfilling the recommendations will be suspended and evaluated for dismissal from the College. Student s who are placed on Probation status for a second time will also be evaluated for dismissal from the College. Suspension Students that have failed to make adequate progress, or who have displayed severe or repeated departures from the Essential Characteris tics of Student Pharmacists, may be placed on Suspension status. The College will place an indefinite hold on the progression of a student placed on Suspension status until APSC can adequately evaluate whether the student will be allowed to continue in the Pharm.D. program. Students engaged in an appeal of their dismissal from the College will also be placed on Suspension status. Students placed on Suspension status will not be allowed to progress in the Pharm.D. program. APSC will review the status of a student on Suspension no later than the beginning of the next academic term. After review, ASPC may recommend immediate Dismissal from the College, recommend that the student be continued on Suspension status pending receipt of additional information, or p rescribe a plan to address specific concerns that resulted in the student's Suspension status. If a plan for progression is developed by APSC, the student will be changed to Probation status. If at any time it becomes evident that the student will not be a ble to address concerns and graduate within the required five year window, the student will be dismissed immediately. Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the professional program if they are not making adequate academic progress, or if they fail to c onstructively address professional or behavioral concerns. 46 Petitions, Appeals, and Grievances Petitions Requests to deviate from the Academic and Professional Standards, requests to deviate from the normal curriculum, and requests for other exceptions t o College policies, rules, or standards must be approved by the college Academic and Professional Standards Committee using the following process: 1. Complete the petition , clearly statin g the request, the reason for the request and describing how the request will influence the student's academic career. 2. Submit the completed petition to the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. 3.

The Academic and Professional Standards Committee will not meet with the student in person before issuing decisions on petitions. 4. The Academic and Pro fessional Standards Committee will attempt to address petitions in a timely manner. The committee will notify affected students of decisions by mail or email. Appeals Students may appeal any decision in response to a Petition or an Academic Grievance issue d by the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Students may also appeal any admission rescission or decision by the Academic and Professional Standards Committee regarding Student Standing in the College of Pharmacy. However, any such appeal must follow the following appeal process guidelines: 1. Any student unsatisfied with a decision issued by the Academic and Professional Standards Committee must submit an appeal in writing to the Dean of the College within seven (7) calendar days following the issuance of a decision by the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. The Dean may refer the issue back to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee for additional review, if warranted. Following the review, the Dean will notify the affected st udent of his or her decision by mail or email. 2. The student may appeal the Dean's decision to the Oregon State University Provost 's Office in writing within seven (7) calendar days following issuance of a decision by the Dean. The Provost's Office decision on the appeal is the University's final decision. 47 Academic Misconduct Students may appeal any decision in response to a report of academic misconduct. 1. Faculty identifies a potential violation and is encouraged to communicate the concern to the student. 2. The faculty member seeks advice from the Department Chair, Director of Student Services and Executive Associate Dean as needed. If the faculty considers it to be appropriate, they go to the Academic Misconduct website and login to complete the Academic Misconduct Report (AMR ) noting suggested sanction. The report is then forwarded to the College Hearing Officer (Executive Associate Dean). 3. The CHO asks the student to meet with the faculty member and the Director of Student Services, as soon as a meeting can be arranged. 4. The faculty member, with the Director of Student Services or CHO as an observer, meets w ith the student, reviews the AM R and Student Rights information, including the proposed sanction. 5. The student is allowed 10 days from the date of the meeting to co mplete their portion of the AMR , including any statement they wish to be included, and return it to the CHO. The student may waive this right or submit a response prior to ten days. 6. The CHO reviews the evidence, makes a recommendation to the Academic and Professional Standards committee, and a final decision is made on the case; which may include a sanction greater than that indicated by the instructor. 7. The student is notified of the decision in writing and has 5 days from the date of notification to submit an appeal the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs. Academic Grievances Students should first refer to their course syllabi for instructions regarding how to challenge grading decisions for each of their courses. Unless the syllabi instruct otherwise, students must submit challenges to grading decisions in writing to the relevant course instructors within seven (7) calendar days after the applicable examinations or assignments have been graded and made available for review, which is typically the day the students' grades ar e posted. Instructors will provide a timely academic decision in response to students' challenges.

Section 5: Licensure Licensure, NAPLEX, and Law Examinations The profession of pharmacy is, for the most part, regulated at the state level. The Federal government regulates drug approvals, drug manufacturing and labeling and, in general, those aspects dealing with the product. Therefore, as Pharm. D. students and pharmacists, you will deal mostly with the Oregon Board of Pharmacy or the pharmacy board in the state where you practice. As a Pharm.D. student, you will need to obtain an Internship License in order to work in a pharmacy and accrue inter nship hours necessary for professional licensure. In Oregon, you become eligible for an internship license upon matriculation to the first professional (P1) year. Do not take the responsibilities that go with this license lightly. Under Oregon law and rule s, pharmacy interns have the same responsibilities as a registered (licensed) pharmacist with the exception of the final check of the prescription. The college's professional curriculum is designed such that you should accumulate enough intern hours to be eligible to take the NAPLEX and Multistate Jurisprudence Examination (MJPE) immediately following graduation. Intern licenses are not issued by the College of Pharmacy, but by the pharmacy board(s) for the state(s) in which you plan to intern. Internship l icensure requirements vary from state to state. Most state pharmacy boards recognize intern hours earned in another state, but they usually require that you use the forms from the state where you will receive your initial license. For example, you might want to be licensed in California, but because of our curriculum, you will be earning intern hours in Oregon. You 59 would need both California and Oregon intern licenses. It is your responsibility to check with the pharmacy board in the state where you plan to practice. Links to all of the state pharmacy boards can be found at the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy website. ( www.nabp.net ) The College of Pharmacy maintains an excellent working relationship with the Or egon Board of Pharmacy. In the beginning of your P1 year, Board staff will meet with your class to answer your questions and help you with the intern license application. Professional licensure is required to practice as a Pharmacist in the United States. This licensure is not conferred by the OSU College of Pharmacy, but by the pharmacy board in the state where you graduated from pharmacy school. Pharm.D. graduates must successfully complete the NAPLEX and MJPE in order to be licensed. These are computer adaptive exams offered throughout the year at commercial testing centers. All states recognize the NAPLEX and most states the MJPE. The latter will have specific questions covering pharmacy law in the state where you will be initially licensed. Should you later reciprocate to another state, you will need to take the drug law exam (usually the MJPE) for that state. Oregon Board of Pharmacy The Oregon Board of Pharmacy was established by legislative action in 1891. The mission of the Oregon Board of Pharmacy is to promote, preserve, and protect the public health, safety and welfare by regulating the practice of pharmacy and the quality and distribution of drugs and medical devices. The Board of Pharmacy has the responsibility to regulate the practice of phar macy and enforce the laws pertaining to drug outlets, pharmacists and the sale of drugs within the state of Oregon. The Board of Pharmacy generally meets every other month for a two -day meeting where cases are presented and current issues confronting the B oard are decided. These meetings are open to the public. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy consists of seven members. Five of these members are licensed pharmacists and two are representatives of the public. Each member of the Board is appointed by the Governor , subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, for a period of four years. No member of the Board serves more than two consecutive full terms. The Board is supported by the agency staff, which includes an Executive Director, Administrative Director, O ffice Manager, and Pharmacy Recovery Network Program Director. Office staff includes a Project Manager, Pharmacist Consultant (Public Information Officer), Administrative Secretary, and Receptionist. Three Licensing Representatives manage the licensing of pharmacists, interns, preceptors, technicians, wholesalers and drug outlets. Compliance staff consists of a Compliance Director, Compliance Secretary, and five Pharmacy Inspectors. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy invites students, pharmacists, and the public to participate in meetings, ask questions, and request information or clarification at any time. We look forward to working with you to promote, preserve, and protect the public hea lth, safety and welfare. Oregon Board of Pharmacy 800 NE Oregon St., Suite 150 60 Portland, OR 97232 Licenses Oregon All incoming Pharm.D. students are required to apply for their intern license prior to matriculation. The OSU College of Pharmacy requires that all Pharm.D. students have an Oregon intern license. Any student that is unable to get licensed by the Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) will not be allowed to matriculate or continue in the Pharm.D. program. The actual license will be distributed during th e first two weeks of fall term. Your intern license allows you to participate in structured educational activities in a pharmacy immediately upon entering pharmacy school. These activities will progressively develop your competency in a practice setting, so that you are prepared to assume the full scope of responsibilities of an intern by the end of the first professional year. Please note that during the first year of your professional program your license only allows you to act as an intern while comple ting course requirements for the professional program. You cannot use you license for any non -academic purposes, such as employment as an intern, until you have satisfactorily completed the first year of the Pharm.D. program. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy will run a separate background check for licensure. They will not accept the background check required by the College of Pharmacy. Please read the Intern Regulations - Division 031 very closely before submitting your application. As an intern you are respo nsible for knowing and upholding these regulations. Students are responsible for maintaining their Oregon intern license and meeting all renewal deadlines. Intern licenses are typically renewed every 2 years. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy has an online renewal process that opens in October. If your current email address is on file with the Board, you will receive an email from them about renewing your intern license. The College will not remind you to renew your intern license. Other States Students interested in interning outside Oregon should consult the Board of Pharmacy for the state in which they would like to intern to determine licensure requirements. Internship paperwork generally requires the signature of the Director of Student Ser vices/Head Advisor. Please complete and submit internship paperwork allowing at least one week for processing. 61 Section 6: Student and Professional Organizations Student Organization Chart Executive Council Officers 201 8-201 9 President: Samantha Vosika Secretary: Marcos Romero Treasurer: Brandon Montgomery Events Coordinator: Kristi Stanford Fundraising Coordinator: Jessica All Aalberg/Brian Destine Advisors: Gary DeLander / Jessina McGregor 62 Oregon State Student Pharmacists (OSSP) Oregon State Student Pharmacists (OSSP) is a combination of the student branches of several professional pharmacy organizations, including: American Pharmacists Association (APhA) National Community Pharmacists Association (NC PA) Oregon Society of Health -System Pharmacists (OSHP) American Society of Health -System Pharmacists (ASHP) Oregon State Pharmacy Association (OSPA) American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) OSSP also provides a wide variety of professional development opportunities for students through affiliations with state and national organizations, health education presentations, and patient care outreach committees (e.g. Operation Diabetes, Heartburn Committee, Hypertensio n Committee, Operation Immunization, Mr. Yuk Poison Awareness, Health Equity Week).

I will consider the welfare of humanity and relief of human suffering my primary concerns. I will apply my knowledge, experience, and s kills to the best of my ability to assure optimal drug therapy outcomes for the patients I serve. I will keep abreast of developments and maintain professional competency in my profession of pharmacy. I will maintain the highest principles of moral, ethic al, and legal conduct. I will embrace and advocate change in the profession of pharmacy that improves patient care. I take these vows voluntarily with the full realization of the responsibility with which I am entrusted by the public. Developed by the A merican Pharmaceutical Association Academy of Students of Pharmacy and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Council of Deans Task Force on Professionalism, June 26, 1994. 69 Appendix C: Code of Ethics Preamble Pharmacists are health professiona ls who assist individuals in making the best use of medications. This code, prepared and supported by pharmacists, is intended to state publicly the principles that form the fundamental basis of the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists. These principl es, based on moral obligations and virtues, are established to guide pharmacists in relationships with patients, health professionals, and society. A Pharmacist respects the covenantal relationship between the patient and pharmacist. Considering the pati ent-pharmacist relationship as a covenant means that a pharmacist has moral obligations in response to the gift of trust received from society. In return for this gift, a pharmacist promises to help individual achieve optimum benefit from their medications , to be committed to their welfare, and to maintain their trust. A Pharmacist promotes the good of every patient in a caring, compassionate, and confidential manner. A pharmacist places concern for the well -being of the patient at the center of professional practice. In doing so, a pharmacist considers needs stated by the patient as well as those defined by health science. A pharmacist is dedicated to protecting the di gnity of the patient. With a caring attitude and a compassionate spirit, a pharmacist focuses on serving the patient in a private and confidential manner. A Pharmacist respects the autonomy and dignity of each patient. A pharmacist promotes the right of self-determination and recognizes individual self -worth by encouraging patients to participate in decisions about their health. A pharmacist communicates with patients in terms that are understandable. In all cases, a pharmacist respects personal and cultu ral differences among patients. A Pharmacist acts with honesty and integrity in professional relationships. A pharmacist has a duty to tell the truth and to act with conviction of conscience. A pharmacist avoids discriminatory practices, behavior or work conditions that impair professional judgment, and actions that compromise dedication to the best interest of patients. A Pharmacist maintains professional competence. A pharmacist has a duty to maintain knowledge and abilities as new medications, device s, and technologies become available and as health information advances. A Pharmacist respects the values and abilities of colleagues and other health professionals. When appropriate, a pharmacist asks for the consultation of colleagues or other health p rofessionals or refers the patient. A pharmacist acknowledges that colleagues and other health professionals may differ in the beliefs and values they apply to the care of the patient. A Pharmacist serves individual, community, and societal needs. The pr imary obligation of a pharmacist is to individual patients. However, the obligations of a pharmacist may at times extend beyond the individual to the community and society. In these situations, the pharmacist recognizes the responsibilities that accompany these obligations and acts accordingly. A Pharmacist seeks justice in the distribution of health resources. When health resources are allocated, a pharmacist is fair and equitable, balancing the needs of patients and society. Developed by the American Ph armaceutical Association Academy of Students of Pharmacy and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Council of Deans Task Force on Professionalism, June 26, 2004. 70 Appendix D: Pledge of Professionalism As a student of pharmacy, I believe there is a need to build and reinforce a professional identity founded on integrity, ethical behavior, and honor. This development, a vital process in my education, will help to ensure that I am true to the professional relationship I establish between myself and society as I become a member of the pharmacy community. Integrity will be an essential part of my everyday life, and I will pursue all academic and professional endeavors with honesty and commitment to service. To accomplish this goal of professional development, as a student of pharmacy I will: DEVELOP a sense of loyalty and duty to the profession by contribution to the well -being of others and by enthusiastically accepting responsibility and accountability fo r membership in the profession. FOSTER professional competency through lifelong learning. I will strive for high ideals, teamwork, and unity within the profession in order to provide optimal patient care. SUPPORT my colleagues by actively encouraging per sonal commitment to the Oath of a Pharmacist and the Code of Ethics as set forth by the profession. DEDICATE my life and practice to excellence. This will require an ongoing reassessment of personal and professional values. MAINTAIN the highest ideals an d professional attributes to ensure and facilitate the covenantal relationship required of the pharmaceutical caregiver. The profession of pharmacy is one that demands adherence to a set of ethical principles. These high ideals are necessary to ensure the quality of care extended to the patients I serve. As a student of pharmacy, I believe this does not start with graduation; rather, it begins with my membership in this professional college community. Therefore, I will strive to uphold this pledge as I adv ance toward full membership in the profession. I voluntarily make this pledge of professionalism. 71 Appendix E: Exposure to Bodily Fluids/Needle Stick Report Form BF/NS REPORT FORM (Page 1 of 2) This form is to be used to report bodily fluid exposures, needle sticks, and similar injuries to College of Pharmacy faculty, staff and students.
