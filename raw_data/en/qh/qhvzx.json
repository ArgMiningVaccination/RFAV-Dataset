We receive an average of 340 applications a year and can easily match the top applicants due to the great reputation the program has maintained over the years. Founded over 30 years ago, the Critical Care Medicine fellowship program at Montefiore is one of the oldest and most prestigious in the country. Our mission is to train our fellows to become leaders in academic medicine through a variety of clinical experiences, research opportunities and quality improvement projects in a diverse patient population. The fellows at Montefiore have graduated to become local and national leaders in critical care medicine with a board pass rate of over 96% and recognizable research presence. Due to the pandemic, the critical care fellowship program has grown significantly with a dramatic increase in our patient population and therefore an increase in both clinical and educational opportunities. This includes expansion of existing ICUs such as the Einstein CTICU/SICU from 12 to 18 beds opening of a new 7N MICU at Einstein An increased volume of critical care consults in the ED and non-ICU floors. During the past few years, we have increased our educational activities to include simulations, ultrasound courses and formalized lectures by our faculty as well as invited speakers. There has been an increase in clinical duties with over 1600 critical care consults a year including rapid responses, cardiac arrests and requests for procedures which the fellows are primarily involved with. The fellows remain the first responders to all in-patient emergencies in 3 campuses day and night. Being a quaternary center, our ICUs are constantly accepting transfers from all over the country for advanced measures including ECMO, LVADs, organ transplantation and neurosurgery. As a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic, there has been an increase in research with over 4 new multinational studies in the past year and an expected increase in the next few months. Our fellows have an abundance in research opportunities with distinguished research faculty who are well known in the field. There has also been a focus on quality improvement over the past few years with a dedicated quality improvement track. This educational track gives the fellows an opportunity to create their own quality improvement project and help with implementation of ongoing projects. Because of these unique characteristics, we are able to successfully recruit and train Critical Care Fellows to become leaders and educators in the field. Rotations A balanced rotational curriculum exposes our fellows to a wide variety of clinical settings, allowing them to obtain the broad skill set required of the modern intensivist. Didactic Curriculum From traditional lectures by world-renowned experts to hands-on ultrasound and simulation training sessions, our educational program is high yield, innovative, and extensive. Research Fellows receive didactic training and are expected to participate in mentored research projects. Faculty Montefiore Einstein Critical Care Medicine faculty listing.
