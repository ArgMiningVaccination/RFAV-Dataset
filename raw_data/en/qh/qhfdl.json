Prior to Covid-19, often times people would get lulled into the idea that it was only cold and flu season when more attention and focus should be made to taking care of one's immune system. But the pandemic has made it clear that working on keeping a person's immune system strong - all the time \u2014 year round \u2014 is a critical thing that everyone needs to consider and take steps to accomplish the best they can. Cold and flu season is not all we need to be concerned about. We have now all been dealing with the issues of Covid-19 for more than a year \u2014 and there's new concerns and question about what other new virus strains might crop up to present challenges as well. One thing is for sure \u2014 it has become ever more critical for each of us to have a strong immune system! Acupuncture Can Help Strengthen The Immune System Often times people only think of Acupuncture when they are dealing with pain. But Acupuncture can do so much more than just help relieve pain. Acupuncture can help to naturally boost a person's immune system. Even a few annual treatments can help. As we all review what we can personally do to help our immune system be as strong as possible \u2014 year round........... Acupuncture is one of the ways we can boost our immune systems to help us stay healthy. Traditional Chinese Medicine And Six Stages Of Illness From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a person's body goes through six stages of sickness when they catch a cold/get sick. As an Acupuncturist we look at what stage of the cold/flu/illness a person is in to help determine the best position for Acupuncture needles to help boost the immune system. In Traditional Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture we look for imbalances of Qi (pronounced 'chee', which means our energy). Qi takes on many forms in a person's body. One element is called 'Wei Qi' or 'Defensive Qi'. This is better known as the immune system in our West medicine culture. The main function of 'Wei Qi' is to protect a person's body from external pathogens that can make us sick. When 'Wei Qi' is strong, our bodies can more easily ward off illness. Acupuncture Has Positive Effects On A Person's Immune Systems To Help Them Stay Healthy Using Acupuncture to boost a person's immune system is more than idle thinking. There have been several scientific studies to date where scientists have been able to determine the positive role Acupuncture plays in boosting the body's immune system by enhancing the production of natural killer cells. Our own immune system is the primary defense mechanism against organisms that can make us sick. Acupuncture also acts as a positive influence on a complex immune building system which regulates white blood cells directly linked to the fight against infections, allergic reactions, and even autoimmune disorders. A person really should not wait until they end up getting sick to benefit from the immune-boosting benefits of Acupuncture. Regular Acupuncture visits can become a pro-active element in a person's preventative regime to ward off colds and flu - and viruses, such as Covid-19. At minimum a person can benefit from as few as even one Acupuncture treatment at the beginning of every season - with four to six treatments per year. If a person waits until they are already sick to begin Acupuncture treatments then they may require several additional Acupuncture treatments for the body to respond appropriately - along with an assortment of other cures. 'Tune up' visits can also be very beneficial year round \u2014- particularly in the world of pandemics, Covid-19, along with flues, virus, sniffles, and seasonal allergic issues.
