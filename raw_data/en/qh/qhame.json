Many people are quickly exhausted as a result of stress and lack of sleep. When a person is constantly fatigued, to the point where he or she never feels rested and has difficulty engaging in typical daily activities, fatigue becomes a severe health risk that must be addressed. TCM or Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is all about achieving balance, particularly in terms of energy. Whether you seek help from a Western or an Eastern practitioner for weariness, you're likely to receive the same advice: find greater balance in your life. TCM will give you a variety of tools to help you achieve equilibrium. If you're experiencing weariness for no apparent medical reason, you might want to try some TCM treatments that target the fundamental causes of the problem rather than just the symptoms. An acupuncturist inserts small needles into the skin at certain places in the body's energy field in this well-known TCM procedure. Acupuncture is used to modify certain qi meridians. Acupuncture can be used to calm yang energy and stimulate yin energy in the case of weariness. Acupuncture is thought to be effective because it works quickly since it directly influences qi energy.

Acupuncture Helps You Feel Energized The everyday health benefits of acupuncture don't end with a good night's sleep or just a relaxful feeling. It can also assist you in maintaining the energy required to do a variety of chores throughout the day. We could all benefit from more energy. Who among us, after all, doesn't want to be and do more? The issue with chronic fatigue is that we don't recognise we have it until it's too late. Worse, Western medicine has little to offer in terms of curing the disease's energy-sapping consequences. To help with the problem, doctors will simply give vitamin B12 shots as well as other supplements. Acupuncture could be really beneficial in this situation. And you don't have to wait until you've lost a significant amount of energy to take action. Acupuncture, when used on a regular basis, can provide you with more energy, allowing you to be more productive during the day. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC), between 836,000 and 2.5 million persons in the United States have chronic fatigue syndrome, with the majority of them going undiagnosed. Some individuals did not believe chronic fatigue syndrome was a legitimate condition in the past. However, in recent years, doctors have begun to take it more seriously, and research is underway to determine why it occurs and how to cure it. In the meanwhile, lifestyle changes and medical treatment may be able to help people cope with some of the symptoms. Causes of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Experts are unsure what causes chronic fatigue syndrome, however some persons with the illness claim that it began after another health issue, such as a virus, a stomach bug, or another infection, significant physical stress, such as surgery, and hormonal imbalances. There is mounting evidence of a relationship between chronic fatigue syndrome and the functioning of the immune system, but further study is needed to determine the mechanism. What Studies Have to Say? According to a 2014 review of medical literature, studies of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for chronic fatigue syndrome have a high risk of bias. However, [researchers found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229914001022?via%3Dihub) that TCM (which included studies involving acupuncture)\u2014alone or in combination with other treatments\u2014appears to be effective at reducing fatigue. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm the possible advantage, they say. This appears to be a substantial improvement from a 2011 evaluation that found inadequate evidence for the effectiveness of complementary/alternative treatments (including acupuncture) for chronic fatigue syndrome symptom relief. Meanwhile, according to a [2010 study](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6882-11-87) of alternative treatments, acupuncture and other forms of meditation have the most potential for further research.

Fatigue Can Lead to Other Mental Health Problems There are unmistakable connections between stress and weariness. Stress is the body's reaction to adversity and change in circumstances. The body and mind grow fatigued as a result of chronic stress. Emotional weariness can result from [long-term stress](https://www.balancewithinyou.com/stress/therapeutic-massage-to-treat-stress-and-anxiety-amid-covid-19/). Lack of attention and motivation leads to poor decision-making, and eventually, a person is unable to properly care for herself and her family. Anxiety, sadness, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) become obtrusive and disruptive in daily life. Every day, we are all exposed to several pressures in today's world. Mental exhaustion is inevitable when we are constantly bombarded with fresh knowledge on top of everything else we have to deal with. Feeling overwhelmed has become the new normal, but we must treat emotional tiredness to avoid it from becoming a significant health issue. Acupuncture is What You Need - We Can Help!
