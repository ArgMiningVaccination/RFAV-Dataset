In R&D, we increased our investments to fuel our rapidly advancing pipeline which was further enhanced through BD collaborations such as Seagen, IGM, Exscientia and Blackstone during the period. As highlighted at our investor event in March, we remain focused on our path to industry leadership in Immunology with a broad set of novel treatments in development, including additional indications for Dupixent\u00ae in diseases such as Prurigo Nodularis and Eosinophilic Esophagitis which were recently submitted for regulatory approval. In addition, we are particularly excited about the positive pivotal trial readout for efanesoctogog alfa, our potentially revolutionizing treatment for Hemophilia A patients, with its filing planned for mid-year. Also in the quarter, we continued to execute well against our strategic priorities with our decision for the proposed EUROAPI shares listing and spin-off through an extraordinary dividend. Based on the strong first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 2022 financial guidance, despite the challenging business environment.\" |Q1 2022||Change|| Change | at CER |IFRS EPS(1)||\u20ac1.94||+20.5%||+16.1%| Changes in net sales are expressed at constant exchange rates (CER) unless otherwise indicated (definition in Appendix 7) (1) In order to facilitate an understanding of operational performance, Sanofi comments on the business net income statement.

Exchange rate movements had a positive effect of 4.0 percentage points, mainly due to the U.S. dollar. At CER, company sales were up 8.6%. Global Business Units First-quarter 2022 net sales by Global Business Unit (variation at CER; \u20ac million; % of total sales) First-quarter 2022 net sales by geographic region (variation at CER; \u20ac million; % of total sales) First-quarter 2022 operating First-quarter business operating income (BOI) increased 16.2% to \u20ac3,065 million. At CER, BOI increased 12.2%. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 1.0 percentage point to 31.7% (31.7% at CER). Pharmaceuticals First-quarter 2022 Pharmaceutical sales increased 7.5% to \u20ac7,326 million, mainly driven by the Specialty Care portfolio (up 17.8%) with continued strong performance of Dupixent\u00ae while sales in General Medicines decreased 0.7%. Specialty Care Dupixent |Net sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 2022|| Change at CER Dupixent\u00ae||1,614||+45.7%| In the first quarter, Dupixent\u00ae (collaboration with Regeneron) sales increased 45.7% to \u20ac1,614 million. In the U.S., Dupixent\u00ae sales of \u20ac1,176 million (up 38.1%) were driven by continued strong demand in AD in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 to 11 years, and continued uptake in asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis Dupixent\u00ae sales grew 53.3% to \u20ac211 million reflecting continued growth in AD and additional launches in younger population in AD, asthma and CRSwNP. Neurology and Immunology |Net Immunology||611||+0.3%| and Immunology sales grew 0.3% to \u20ac611 million, reflecting strong Kevzara\u00ae sales which were partially offset by lower Aubagio\u00ae sales. Aubagio\u00ae sales decreased 6.6% in the first quarter to \u20ac491 million due to lower sales in the U.S. as a result of both competitive pressure and price. Sales in Europe were stable. First-quarter Kevzara\u00ae (collaboration with Regeneron) sales increased 61.4% to \u20ac95 million due to a COVID-19 related increase in global demand for IL-6 receptor blockers and the temporary tocilizumab shortage. Rare Disease |Net sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 first quarter, Rare Disease sales increased 1.9% to \u20ac804 million driven by the Pompe franchise, partially offset by unfavorable purchasing patterns in Rest of the World region primarily for the Gaucher and Fabrazyme franchises. Underlying patients base treated grew around 6% compared to the same quarter of last year. First-quarter sales of the Pompe franchise (Myozyme/Lumizyme\u00ae + Nexviazyme\u00ae) increased 8.9% to \u20ac265 million primarily from new patient accruals and the ramp up of Nexviazyme\u00ae. Myozyme\u00ae/Lumizyme\u00ae sales decreased 3.0% to \u20ac235 million mainly reflecting the conversion to Nexviazyme\u00ae in the U.S. Sales of Nexviazyme\u00ae (which was launched in the US in August 2021 and in Japan in November 2021) were \u20ac30 million in the first quarter (of which \u20ac26 million in the U.S.). Sales of the Gaucher franchise (Cerezyme\u00ae + Cerdelga\u00ae) decreased 4.2% (to \u20ac232 million) in the first quarter. Over the period, Cerezyme\u00ae sales decreased 6.7% to \u20ac165 million, mainly due to unfavorable buying patterns resulting in lower sales in the Rest of the World region. In parallel, Cerdelga\u00ae sales were up 3.2% driven by switches and new patient accruals in Europe and the U.S. First-quarter Fabrazyme\u00ae sales increased 2.4% to \u20ac220 million driven mainly by Europe and the U.S. In the Rest of the World region, despite unfavorable purchasing patterns, Fabrazyme\u00ae sales were stable. Oncology |Net sales \u20ac244 million) driven by the Sarclisa\u00ae launch which more than offset the impact of Jevtana\u00ae generic competition in Europe. First-quarter Jevtana\u00ae sales decreased 25.4% to \u20ac98 million following the entry of generic competition in some European markets (down 75.6%) at the end of March 2021. In the U.S., sales were up 8.6%, where Jevtana\u00ae is currently covered by four Orange Book listed patents US 7,241,907, US 8,927,592, US 10,583,110 and US 10,716,777. Sanofi filed patent infringement suits under Hatch-Waxman against generic filers asserting the '110 patent, the '777 patent and the '592 patent in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. Sanofi has reached settlement agreements with some of the defendants and the suit against the remaining defendants is ongoing. A 3-day trial against Apotex and Sandoz has been scheduled starting January 2023 and the remaining defendants have agreed not to launch any generic cabazitaxel product until the earlier of a district court decision in favor of the defendants or four months after the completion of the post-trial briefing. Jevtana\u00ae also received a regulatory data exclusivity related to the CARD clinical study which expires in December 2023. First-quarter Sarclisa\u00ae sales were \u20ac65 million (versus \u20ac34 million in the first quarter of 2021) primarily driven by performance in the U.S. (\u20ac25 million), Europe (\u20ac22 million) and Japan. Rare Blood Disorders |Net sales (\u20ac 2022|| Change |Cablivi\u00ae||46||+15.8%| |Total Rare Blood Disorders||293||+1.8%| In the first quarter, Rare Blood Disorders franchise sales increased 1.8% (\u20ac293 million), reflecting Cablivi\u00ae and Alprolix\u00ae growth partially offset by lower Eloctate\u00ae/Alprolix\u00ae industrial sales to Sobi (recorded in the Rest of the World region). Eloctate\u00ae sales were \u20ac138 million in the first quarter, down 3.0% reflecting lower sales in the U.S. (down 1.9%) and in the Rest of the World region. First-quarter Alprolix\u00ae sales were up 2.0% to \u20ac108 million driven by the U.S. sales (up 8.9%), partially offset by lower sales in the Rest of the World region. Cablivi\u00ae sales increased by 15.8% to \u20ac46 million in the first quarter driven by launches in Europe (up 46.7% to \u20ac23 million). In the U.S., sales of the product were down 4.5% to \u20ac22 million, due to the COVID-19 environment impacting treatment initiations at the hospital level. General Medicines First quarter General Medicines sales decreased 0.7% to \u20ac3,760 million and were stable excluding portfolio streamlining. Core assets |Net sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 quarter, core assets sales increased 4.7% to \u20ac1,594 million, driven by Toujeo\u00ae, Praluent\u00ae, Multaq\u00ae, Thymoglobulin\u00ae and Rezurock\u00ae (consolidated from November 9, 2021), partially offset by lower sales of Lovenox\u00ae. Core assets sales grew across all geographies in the first quarter. First-quarter Lovenox\u00ae sales decreased 8.2% to \u20ac377 million, mainly reflecting lower sales in the Rest of the World region (down 11.9%) due to high base of comparison in the first quarter of 2021 which benefitted from strong Covid-related demand (WHO guidelines recommending the use of low molecular weight heparins in hospitalized COVID-19 patients). In addition, biosimilar competition and supply limitations affected the performance. First-quarter Toujeo\u00ae sales increased 6.3% to \u20ac274 million due to growth in Europe and the Rest of the World region, partially offset by lower sales in the U.S. In China, the Volume Based Procurement (VBP) for insulins is expected to be implemented in May 2022. In November 2021, Sanofi participated in the VBP tender for basal insulin analogues and was among the bidding winners in the group A with Lantus\u00ae/Toujeo\u00ae. Sanofi expects that its glargine (Toujeo\u00ae/Lantus\u00ae) sales to decrease by around 30% in China in 2022, benefitting from high volumes at significantly lower prices. In China, Toujeo\u00ae/Lantus\u00ae sales were \u20ac459 million in 2021. Plavix\u00ae sales were stable in the first quarter to \u20ac261 million, higher sales in the Rest of the World region (up 1.4%) offsetting lower sales in Europe. Plavix\u00ae sales in China were down 3.4% to \u20ac123 million due to a high base of comparison in the first quarter of 2021. Multaq\u00ae first quarter sales grew 13.9% to \u20ac87 million, reflecting strong U.S. sales growth. Sales of Rezurock\u00ae, a recently FDA-approved, first-in-class treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older who have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, were consolidated as of November 9, 2021 (through the Kadmon acquisition) and generated \u20ac41 million in the first quarter. Rezurock\u00ae performance reflects the rapidly expanding pool of prescribing institutions as well as pent-up demand from cGVHD patients who have already failed multiple systemic therapies. Praluent\u00ae first-quarter sales were \u20ac69 million, up 21.4% driven by Europe performance. In Rest of the World region, sales were up 6.7%. In China, Praluent\u00ae was included in the NDRL list at the beginning of 2022. First-quarter Soliqua\u00ae sales increased 15.9% to \u20ac53 million driven by the Rest of World region (up 54.5%) supported by new launches and Solimix results. Non-core assets |Net sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 assets||1,187||-7.4%| |Total non-core assets||1,983||-4.2%| In the first quarter, non-core assets sales decreased 4.2% to \u20ac1,983 million reflecting portfolio streamlining (-1.4ppt), lower Lantus\u00ae sales as well as the impact of VBP wave 5 in China on Eloxatin\u00ae and Taxotere\u00ae sales. Lantus\u00ae sales were \u20ac671 million, down 1.5% in the first quarter, due to lower sales in Europe, reflecting biosimilar competition and continuous Toujeo\u00ae switches. First-quarter Aprovel\u00ae/Avapro\u00ae sales were up 17.8% to \u20ac125 million, due to some supply improvement and compared with a low base in the first quarter of 2021. Pharmaceuticals business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) of Pharmaceuticals increased 12.6% to \u20ac2,831 million (up 8.8% at CER). The ratio of BOI to net sales increased by 0.3 percentage point to 38.6% (38.8% at CER), reflecting an improvement of the gross margin ratio. Vaccines |Net sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 2022|| Change million driven by double-digit growth of Polio/Pertussis/Hib vaccines sales and partial recovery of Travel vaccines. In the first quarter, Polio/Pertussis/Hib (PPH) vaccines sales increased 10.3% to \u20ac613 million. In the Rest of the World region, PPH sales grew 23.1% driven by a strong performance of Pentaxim\u00ae in China compared to a low base last year and favorable timing of polio tender delivery. In the U.S., PPH sales were impacted by inventory fluctuation and progressive ramp up of Vaxelis\u00ae sales. As a reminder, Vaxelis\u00ae in-market sales are not consolidated and the profits are shared equally between Sanofi and Merck. First-quarter Meningitis sales decreased 16.4% to \u20ac112 million, due to lower sales in Latin America reflecting price competition in public tenders. Booster vaccines sales increased 4.0% in the first quarter to \u20ac109 million, driven by the Rest of the World region. First-quarter Travel and endemic vaccines sales increased 61.0% to \u20ac98 million, reflecting a partial recovery of Travel vaccines in Europe and the U.S. as well as higher endemic vaccines sales in the Rest of the World region. Influenza vaccines sales decreased 18.2% in the first quarter, reaching \u20ac66 million due to an exceptional high demand in the first quarter of 2021. Vaccines business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) decreased 20.2% (down 24.8% at CER) to \u20ac296 million compared to the same period of last year. This reflects higher R&D expenses related to Translate Bio and the mRNA center of excellence and the payment from Daiichi Sankyo recorded in the first quarter of 2021. BOI to net sales ratio was 29.0% (versus 40.5% in the first quarter of 2021, 27.5% excluding the payment from Daiichi Sankyo). Consumer Healthcare (\u20ac Healthcare||1,328||+17.0%| quarter, Consumer Healthcare (CHC) sales increased 17.0% to \u20ac1,328 million sustained by growth in Europe and the Rest of the World region. This performance was mainly driven by the strong demand for Cough & Cold products, as well as the performance of Pain Care and Digestive Wellness categories. This global performance includes a positive price effect of 3%. The divestments of non-core products had an impact of -0.6 ppt of growth in the first quarter. In the U.S., first-quarter CHC sales increased 2.1% to \u20ac310 million driven by double-digit growth of Allergy category partially offset by lower sales of Personal care and non-core assets mainly due to supply constraints. In Europe, first-quarter CHC sales increased 21.0% to \u20ac406 million mainly reflecting strong growth of the Cough & Cold and Pain Care categories. In Rest of World, first-quarter CHC sales increased 22.8% to \u20ac612 million, supported by growth in all categories. CHC business operating income In the first quarter, business operating income (BOI) of CHC increased 51.3% (up 48.0% at CER) to \u20ac596 million. The ratio of BOI to net sales increased 9.5 percentage point to 44.9% versus the prior year, reflecting strong top line growth as well as a capital gain related to divestments of non-strategic assets. Company sales by geographic region |Sanofi sales (\u20ac million)||Q1 2022|| Change U.S. increased +12.1% to \u20ac3,484 million supported by the strong performance of Dupixent\u00ae. In Europe sales increased +6.7% in the first quarter to \u20ac2,392 million mainly driven by Dupixent\u00ae performance as well as strong CHC growth. In Rest of World sales increased +7.0% to \u20ac3,798 million in the first quarter, reflecting the performance of Dupixent\u00ae, CHC and Vaccines which largely offset lower sales of General Medicines. Sales in China increased 13.4% to \u20ac901 million mainly as a result of the growth of Dupixent\u00ae, Vaccines and CHC. In Japan, first-quarter sales increased 1.6% to \u20ac433 million driven by Dupixent\u00ae and Sarclisa\u00ae which more than offset lower sales of General Medicines. In Russia, due to strong cough, cold and flu related sales, higher vaccines sales and unprecedented stockpiling at pharmacy and patient level sales increased 34.4% in the first quarter. In March, Sanofi has decided to stop any new spending not related to the supply of its essential and life-changing medicines and vaccines in Russia. This includes all advertising and promotional spending. R&D update at the end of the first quarter 2022 Regulatory update - The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion recommending to extend the approval of Dupixent\u00ae (dupilumab) in the European Union to include add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) who are inadequately controlled on two maintenance therapies. - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent\u00ae as an add-on maintenance treatment for children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is June 9, 2022. Dupixent\u00ae remains the only biologic medicine approved for patients 6 years of age and older in this indication. - The FDA has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent\u00ae 300 mg weekly to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and the ability to swallow. - The FDA has approved Enjaymo (sutimlimab-jome), the first and only approved treatment to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion due to hemolysis in adults with cold agglutinin disease (CAD). CAD is a chronic and rare blood disorder that impacts the lives of an estimated 5,000 people in the U.S. Sanofi estimates around 3,200 patients to be drug-treated per year and that Enjaymo could reach a market share of around 25% in the years to come. - The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for Xenpozyme\u00ae (olipudase alfa) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). Xenpozyme\u00ae is currently the only approved treatment for ASMD and represents Sanofi's first therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE or pioneer designation, which is the Japanese government's regulatory fast-track pathway to promote research and development of innovative new medical products addressing urgent unmet medical needs. - The EMA has accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for nirsevimab under an accelerated assessment procedure. Nirsevimab, the first investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season, is being developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published detailed Phase 3 results of the MELODY trial. In this study, with healthy infants born at term or late preterm entering their first RSV season, the primary endpoint was met, reducing the incidence of medically attended LRTI, such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, caused by RSV by 74.5% compared to placebo. - The EMA has started to evaluate the application for the conditional marketing authorization of the Sanofi-GSK first-generation recombinant COVID-19 vaccine as a primary vaccine and a booster designed to boost all currently approved COVID-19 vaccine platforms. Final analysis of the VAT02 COVID-19 booster trial confirms universal ability to boost neutralizing antibodies 18- to 30-fold across vaccine platforms. The VAT08 primary series trial, with two doses of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine in seronegative populations demonstrated 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalizations, 75% efficacy against moderate or severe COVID-19 disease, and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease, in line with expected vaccine effectiveness in today's environment dominated by variants of concern. When the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was used as a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose, neutralizing antibodies increased 84- to 153-fold compared to pre-boost levels. - Sanofi and Regeneron announced the voluntary withdrawal of the sBLA for Libtayo\u00ae (cemiplimab-rwlc) as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced cervical cancer. The decision was made after the companies and the FDA were not able to align on certain post-marketing studies. Discussions with regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. are ongoing. Portfolio update Phase 3: - Sanofi and Sobi announced positive topline results from the pivotal XTEND-1 study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of efanesoctocog alfa (BIVV001), a once-weekly recombinant factor VIII therapy, in previously treated patients 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. The study met both primary and secondary endpoints, showing a clinically meaningful prevention of bleeds in people with severe hemophilia A over a period of 52 weeks, with a median annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0 and a mean ABR of 0.71, and a superiority to prior prophylactic factor VIII replacement therapy based on intra-patient comparison. Sanofi plans to submit the data in the U.S. mid-2022. Submission in the EU will follow the availability of data from the ongoing XTEND-Kids pediatric study, expected in 2023. - A second trial (PRIME) evaluating Dupixent\u00ae in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis (PN), met its primary and key secondary endpoints, showing it significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo at 24 weeks in this investigational setting. The data confirm the positive results that were previously reported from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial. - The LIBERTY-CPUO-CHIC study evaluating the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Dupixent\u00ae for the treatment of adult participants with chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) has initiated, and enrolled its first participant. - The CUPID Study B evaluating Dupixent\u00ae in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), who were refractory to omalizumab, stopped due to futility based on a pre-specified interim analysis. Although positive numerical trends in reducing itch and hives were observed, the results from the interim analysis did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoints. The LIBERTY-CUPID pivotal program was initiated in 2020 with an accelerated direct-to-Phase 3 strategy. The previously reported Phase 3 trial (Study A), which evaluated a different group of patients who were biologic-na\u00efve, met its primary and all key secondary endpoints at 24 weeks showing that adding Dupixent to standard-of-care antihistamines significantly reduced itch and hives compared to antihistamines alone. Sanofi and Regeneron remain committed to advancing Dupixent for patients with CSU uncontrolled on antihistamines, next steps are being evaluated including discussions with regulatory authorities. - The clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of amcenestrant compared with tamoxifen in patients with HR+ early breast cancer who have discontinued adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy due to treatment related toxicity (AMEERA-6), enrolled its first participant. Phase 2: - Three studies assessing rilzabrutinib have initiated, and enrolled their first participants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults double-blind, placebo-controlled study in CSU, and an open-label study in adults with Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA). - The non-randomized and open-label study assessing the clinical benefit of SAR444245 combined with other anticancer therapies for the treatment of adults with advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal cancer was initiated, and was administered to the first participant. - The pivotal AMEERA-3 clinical trial evaluating amcenestrant, an investigational optimized oral selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), as monotherapy compared to endocrine treatment of physician's choice in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer who progressed on or after hormonal therapies, did not meet its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival as assessed by an independent central review. Phase 1: - The study assessing the safety and efficacy of 4 investigational HSV 2 vaccines in adults with recurrent genital herpes caused by HSV 2 (HSV15) has been discontinued. Given the war in Ukraine and the suffering of the Ukrainian people, Sanofi has adapted its clinical trial implementation in the region. The company decided to halt any new recruitment of patients for ongoing clinical trials in Russia and Belarus, though it will continue to treat patients already enrolled. In Ukraine, Sanofi is doing everything it can to support and supply patients currently enrolled in Sanofi-sponsored clinical trials, including transferring them within Ukraine or into neighboring countries. In anticipation of potential loss of data, the company is currently activating new clinical sites and expanding patient enrollment in geographies not impacted by the war. This may lead to the planned primary completion dates of its pivotal trials in MS and COPD to shift, previously communicated submission timelines remain unchanged. Acquisitions and major collaborations - Sanofi and Blackstone announced a strategic, risk-sharing collaboration under which funds managed by Blackstone Life Sciences will contribute up to \u20ac300 million to accelerate the global pivotal studies and the clinical development program for the subcutaneous formulation and delivery of the anti-CD38 antibody Sarclisa\u00ae, to treat patients with multiple myeloma (MM), expecting to begin in the second half of 2022. - Sanofi announced the research collaboration and license agreement to develop up to 15 novel small molecule candidates across oncology and immunology with Exscientia, leveraging their end-to-end AI-driven platform utilizing actual patient samples. The companies have been working together since 2016 and in 2019, Sanofi in-licensed Exscientia's novel bispecific small molecule candidate capable of targeting two distinct targets in inflammation and immunology. - Sanofi announced the completion of the acquisition of Amunix Pharmaceuticals, Inc, adding a promising pipeline of T-cell engagers and cytokine therapies. The acquisition also provides access to their Pro-XTEN, XPAT, and XPAC technology to deliver next generation conditionally activated biologics. The technology platform is highly complementary to Sanofi's existing R&D platforms and supports Sanofi's efforts to accelerate and expand its contributions to innovative medicines for oncology patients, with approximately 20 molecules currently in development. - Sanofi and Seagen announced an exclusive collaboration agreement to design, develop, and commercialize antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for up to three cancer targets.

An update of the R&D pipeline at as of March 31, 2022, is available on Sanofi's website: https://www.sanofi.com/en/science-and-innovation/research-and-development Progress on implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy Sanofi continues its progress to improve access to medicines Sustainability-linked bond tied to Sanofi's Access commitments Sanofi is committed to integrate sustainability within its Play to Win business strategy, as well as within its investment and financing strategy. More than a year after issuing its first sustainability-linked credit revolving facilities, Sanofi successfully priced an inaugural sustainability-linked bond indexed on access to medicines. A nominal amount of EUR 650 million of notes, tied to Sanofi's commitment to improve access to essential medicines in low- and lower-middle-income countries via its global health non-profit unit. This transaction demonstrates Sanofi's commitment to society, to ensure access to healthcare for the world's vulnerable people. Access and Pricing Principles at Sanofi Sanofi has a long history of working with healthcare systems to make its treatments accessible and affordable to patients in need. Sanofi understands and shares concerns about the affordability of medicines for patients and Sanofi encourages countries to improve value in healthcare spending. However, the Company firmly believes that the pharmaceutical industry is only one of the many stakeholders in the healthcare system that can and should contribute to this goal. Given the growing concerns over rising healthcare costs, Sanofi has developed an approach to pricing that reflects its commitment to broadly expanding patient access to medicines and vaccines while maintaining sustainable investment in Research & Development. The Access & Pricing Principles it puts forth are founded on 2 pillars: - Clear rationale for pricing and access at the time of launch of a new medicine or vaccine - Inclusion of affordability criteria into pricing considerations for new launches When the Company sets the price of a new medicine, it holds itself to a rigorous and structured process that includes consultation with external stakeholders and considers the following factors: - Holistic assessment of value (clinical, social and wellbeing and economic value) - Availability or anticipation of similar treatments at the time of launch - Ability of market to afford new medicines - Unique factors specific to the medicine or vaccine at the time of launch Sanofi discloses more information on its global access and pricing principles on its global website and specifically on its U.S. pricing policy on the Sanofi U.S. website. Building partnerships to support Sanofi's pediatric cancer commitment For the childhood cancer flagship program, Sanofi aims to work together with partners, across sectors, to advance knowledge in pediatric studies. In the research field, Sanofi is now one of the partners of the Pediatric Pre-clinical Proof of Concept Platform (ITCC-P4) that aims to enable state of the art upfront preclinical testing of novel molecularly targeted compounds. Sanofi has recently engaged in a Pediatric Oncology Relevant Target collaboration led by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) to review and prioritize targets. For the development of innovative clinical trials, Sanofi is proud to be working closely with experts at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Institut Gustave Roussy, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All of these efforts are centered on patient needs as highlighted by Sanofi's support to childhood cancer advocacy groups including Coalition Against Childhood Cancer (CAC2) and Imagine for Margo. ESG dashboard In 2020, as Sanofi renewed its CSR ambitions, the Company reviewed and updated its portfolio of initiatives. Numbers shown below highlight the ongoing progress in the implementation of Sanofi's CSR strategy. Affordable access Sanofi Global Health, a non-profit unit formed within the company in April 2021, aims to provide 30 of Sanofi's medicines across a wide range of therapeutic areas to patients in 40 of the lowest income countries. Beyond the products provided, Sanofi Global Health will also focus on integrated programs that ensure optimal care management over time for patients. Sanofi is also committed to helping 1,000 patients living with rare diseases who have no access to treatments and will donate 100,000 vials of medicine for their treatments each year. This continues Sanofi's 30-year commitment to patients suffering from rare diseases, such as Fabry, Gaucher or Pompe diseases, for which access to treatment is often limited. The third initiative on access is to develop a global access plan for all new products, making them available in selected relevant markets within two years of launch. |Dashboard for Innovating for vulnerable communities Sanofi continues its efforts to fight polio and sleeping sickness, two of its legacy programs that address global health issues.

The ESG Evaluation awarded Sanofi a score of 86 out of 100 points, one of the highest scores across all sectors globally. Sanofi's ESG profile was awarded 80 points for its solid fundamentals, completed with an additional strong preparedness opinion of 6 points awarded for its excellent awareness of risks and opportunities and its capacity to anticipate and adapt to a variety of long-term plausible disruptions. Sanofi's Social Profile was ranked as 'leading' in the category of communities highlighting the recent 2021 creation of its global health unit which aims to provide 30 of Sanofi's medicines across a wide range of therapeutic areas to patients in 40 of the lowest income countries. The report also noted Sanofi's commitment to eliminating infectious disease such as polio, sleeping sickness and malaria. Sanofi was notably distinguished for its commitment to access to medicines, particularly in vulnerable communities. The study, which recognized 'the increasing challenges and inequalities in healthcare across all geographies', identified the creation of a non-profit unit dedicated to providing poorest countries with access to essential medicines as one of Sanofi's leading differentiators. The continuous implementation of Sanofi's social impact strategy has led in recent months to a range of positive updates of the company's rank or grade in most of the ESG rankings. Covid Update Sanofi and GSK applied for regulatory authorization of their first-generation COVID-19 vaccine in Europe with data supporting its use as a universal booster, designed to boost all currently approved COVID-19 vaccine platforms. In addition, the companies are developing a next-generation booster vaccine designed to provide broad protection against all variants of concern, from the original strain to Omicron BA.2. The data (VAT02 Cohort 2) is expected to be communicated in Q2 2022.

Business net income is defined as net income attributable to equity holders of Sanofi excluding: - amortization of intangible assets, - impairment of intangible assets, - fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration related to business combinations or to disposals, - other impacts associated with acquisitions (including impacts of acquisitions on associates and joint ventures), - restructuring costs and similar items(1), - other gains and losses (including gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets(1)), - costs or provisions associated with litigation(1), - gain on Regeneron investment as a result of the transaction completed on May 29, 2020 (the amount does not include the gain related to the remeasurement at fair value at this date of the 400,000 retained shares), - tax effects related to the items listed above as well as effects of major tax disputes, - effect of equity method accounting for Regeneron investment (excluded from Business net income) as a consequence of the sale of the entire equity investment in Regeneron (with the exception of 400,000 shares retained by Sanofi) on May 29th 2020), - net income attributable to non-controlling interests related to the items listed above. (1) Reported in the line items Restructuring costs and similar items and Gains and losses on disposals, and litigation, which are defined in Notes B.19. and B.20. to our consolidated financial statements. Free cash flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial indicator which is reviewed by our management, and which we believe provides useful information to measure the net cash generated from the Company's operations that is available for strategic investments1 (net of divestments1), for debt repayment, and for capital return to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is determined from the Business Net Income adjusted for depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/loss in associates and joint ventures net of dividends received, gains & losses on disposals, net change in provisions including pensions and other post-employment benefits, deferred taxes, share-based expense and other non-cash items. It comprises net changes in working capital, capital expenditures and other asset acquisitions2 net of disposal proceeds2, and payments related to restructuring and similar items. Free cash flow is not defined by IFRS and it is not a substitute measure for the IFRS aggregate net cash flows in operating activities. 1 Amount of the transaction above a cap of \u20ac500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction). 2 Not exceeding a cap of \u20ac500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction). 1 See Appendix 7 for definitions of financial indicators. 2 definition in Appendix 7 3 Not exceeding \u20ac500 million per transaction (inclusive of all payments related to the transaction). 4 Non-GAAP financial measure (definition in Appendix 7).
