Scents can induce an amazing power as they influence our moods. Our sense of smell is the most direct path to our emotions. This is the principle behind the Ancient Art of Aromatherapy. Fragrance affects us through the sense of smell. However, the effects of various aromas differ radically. Just as various emotions and thoughts change the colors of the aura, so do different scents. The psychic body is the seat of our emotions and is thus strongly affected by fragrance. Essential Oils are extracted from certain varieties of trees, shrubs, herbs, grasses and flowers, extracted in a variety of ways. Their therapeutic value now being rediscovered and used widely. Aromatic Oils were used by the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans for thousands of years. Aromatherapy has both physiological as well as psychological use. Aromatherapy scents are designed to assist in reaching a heightened awareness for Meditation, Euphoria, Relaxation, Stress Relief, Inspiration, Stimulation, Sensual, Healing and many other specific purposes...and uses.

Once you understand the purpose of why essential oils exist, you will want them in your life forever. They represent life itself, the source of all healing. My wish is that you will share them with a friend, and let them experience some of your oils. Essential Oils work on several different levels. They affect most people through the sense of smell. The sense of smell is the most complex and sensitive of the five senses. Once the Olfactory receptors identify an aroma, nerve cells relay this information directly to the Limbic system of the brain. Here, aromas can trigger memories and influence behavior. Additionally, the Limbic system works in conjunction with the pituitary gland and the Hypothalamus region of the brain to regulate the hormonal activities thus triggering the production of hormones that govern appetite, body temperature, insulin production, overall metabolism, stress levels, sex drive, and conscious thought and reactions. The Limbic system also influences immunity. Essential oils can have a positive affect on all these functions. Essential oils work through the skin as well. They can stimulate surface skin cells, calm inflamed or irritated skin, release muscle spasms, soothe sore muscles and relieve muscle tension.

Clinical therapies, such as chemotherapy, surgery, and [mesothelioma radiation](http://www.mesothelioma.com/radiation.htm) therapy are likely the most medicinally beneficial. However, this is not to say that other, complementary, therapies are not important as well. These complementary therapies may not be able to cure the disease, but will often treat the holistic wellbeing of the person. Among the cancer patients who use these are patients of [mesothelioma](http://www.mesothelioma.com/). One of the more common complementary therapies used by patients of mesothelioma is aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is not for all mesothelioma patients and offers no cure for the disease.
