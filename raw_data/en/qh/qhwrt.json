I know,because I've been asked to take my \"Traveling MedicineShow,\" a lecture I've prepared on Mexican-Americanherbal remedies, not just all over lexas, but to otherstates as well. And I've been asked to appear on varioustelevision shows and have been interviewed by newspa-per reporters more often than I can easily remember.That's the sort of interest that the subject of herbalmedicine inspires.There's a lot of interest in reading about the subject,'-) BESTCOPY AVAII4Ric too. In fact. I have never appeared before a group with-out someone in the audience asking me if I have a bookabout herbal medicine that they might buy. That is whyI decided to write this one: to serve as an introductionto the subject of green medicine, much as my \"TravelingMedicine Show\" does.Oh, there are books about the subject, to be sure.Most of these, however, are written by scholars forscholars. They don't take into account the average per-son who just wants to get acquainted with what can bea very complicated subject. And those books that aremore general are just that: too general. They includeremedies from all over, not just those used by Mexican-Americans.This is, of course, the portion of the subject thatinterests me. I am a Mexican-American who has alwayslived in Thxas, where curanderismo, or folk healing,flourishes. I grew up with many of these remedies, andeven though I went on to earn a doctorate in Educationand become a Vice President at Texas A&I University inKingsville, I have not abandoned many of them, particu-larly the teas.But even those that I, personally, do not use haven'tceased to fascinate me. It is my pleasure to share themall with you nowthe green medicine which is part ofcuranderismo. 7-.--Vie.:..,pli-ii.ous......./5 An Introduction If I were to use the word \"medicine,\" and ask you topicture something illustrating that word in your mind,what would you think of? Chances are you would thinkof a patent medicine you might find on the supermar-ket shelf: Alka Seltzer or Pei. `o Bismol or maybe a coldremedy like NyQuil. Then again, you might envisionone of the little plastic bottles that pharmacists use forprescription drugs, the kind with the impossible-to-openchildproof lids and the brightly colored capsules inside.Or maybe you'd think of the vaccination that you gotbefore you took that trip abroad a few years back. In anycase, if I were to use the word, \"medicine,\" you probablywould not conjure up the image of a plant.Many modern medicines, however, come fromplants. Most people know that digitalis comes from theFoxglove plant, which was used for heart ailments longbefore anyone had figured out why it worked. A lot ofpeople know, too, that the chemical which is found incurare is a potent anesthetic. But let me give you anotherexample which in many ways serves to illustrate onemajor premise of this book:In the early 1600s, when the Peruvian Indiansseemed to be the only pople who were not dying ofmalaria, it was discovered that they were treating theillness with a tea made from the ground bark of theChinchona tree. This \"Peruvian Bark,\" as it later wascalled in Europe, contains the substance known asquinine.Eventually, as often happens with remedies derivedfrom plants, synthetic versions of quinine were devel-oped and these superceded the botanical remedy. Thisis what usually happens and this is why the word\"medicine\" so infrequently makes us think of plants.But interestingly, in this case, the original remedy stagedan unexpected comeback when a strain of malaria sur- 67 faced during the Vietnam war. This strain proved resist-ant to the synthetics that had been developed in thelab.Was there anything that would cure this new strain?Yes. The original botanical remedy: Peruvian Barkfrom the Chinchonu tree.What does this demonstrate? That the old reme-dies derived from plants do have a solid medical basis.And that they are sometimes better than the syntheticsderived from them.But the story of Peruvian Bark is illustrative in stillanother way. For instance, though malaria was theworld's number one killer disease when a Jesuit firstpublicized the Peruvian Indian cure, the medical profes-sion in Europe went out of its way to disprove the claimsthat were made for it.A few physicians, for example, tested the bark withdisastrous results. It was too dangerous to use, theyconcluded. Plus the remedy didn't have tt.e sanction ofappearing in a text by Galen a famous physician ofancient Romewho had codified his cures by writingthem down in what had become the bible of the medi-cal profession. Pretty soon someone came on the scenewith a secret mixture that was supposed to be betterthan the remedy that the Indians used. Everyone ig-nored Peruvian Bark and chose this (probably muchmore expensive) medicine instead. After the death ofthe perscn who concocted it, its ingredients were re-vealed. And, of course, the main one was Peruvian Bark.We can learn a lot from this one, not atypical,example.But herbal cures today are being given more cre-dence than they were, say. thirty years ago. I doubt thatwell return to the era when physicians routinely tookcourses in botany in order to study the Materia Medica,but, largely because of the mounting popularity of the7 holistic movemente.g., the theory of looking at aperson's illness in the context of his beliefs, his lifestyle,his diet, and so onherbal cures are once again com-ing into their own.In the Mexican-American tradition, herbal curesor green medicine, as it is sometimes called havealways been prominent In large measure, these are usedto treat minor ailments and are no more than inexpen-sive and readily accessible home remedies or, as theyare called in Spanish, remedios caseros. But moreimportantly, herbal cures are part of an elaborate sys-tem of folk healing which Mexican-Americans callcuranderismo.You have only to look at the word to know o- atleast to come up with a very good guess at what itmeans. It derives from the Spanish verb, curar, to cure.And a practitioner of curanderismo a healerwouldbe a curandero or a curandera, The former, if a man; thelatter, if a woman. Interestingly, female healers are asprevalent as male.But curanderos, like physicians, have specialties.There are materias or espiritistas those who aremediums between this world and the beyond; there areparteras, or midwives; and senoras, who foretell thefuture by reading cards. Finally, and of greatest interestto us here, there are the yerberas, or herbalists. Theyare the ones who are most likely to employ green medi-cine to its fullest. Many of the vendors who bring herbsto the marketplaces in Mexico are, in fact, curanaerosand yerberas.Is curanderismo dying out? It dces not seem to be.In many American cities far from Mexico even Detroitand Chicagothere are enormous numbers of Mexi-can-Americans whose presence keeps it alive. In Chicago,for instance, there is even a shrine to a famous Mexicancurandero, Nirio r'Idencio, and each year, people fromChicago and from other cities all over the United Statesjourney to Espinazo, Mexico, where El Nino lived and8 healed. One might say that, far from dying out, curan-derismo thrives.And those in formal medicine have begun to respectit, too. In one Denver mental health facility, for example,there is a curaiidera on the staff. But more and more,too, formal medicinebecause of the aforementionedholistic or naturopathic swing has begun to resem- ble curanderismo. For example, a 1983 article in anational women's magazine touted something calledTherapeutic 'Ibuching as a medical breakthrough. Aform of this has been practiced by curanderos forcenturies! Another popular magazine, just a month later,had a page devoted to the medicinal value of oil extractedfrom Evening Primrose. As Fior de San Juan, EveningPrimrose had long been part of curanderismo!Some social scientists say that natu:opathy is notmerely a fad but a reasonable reaction against the tech-nological brand of medicine we see everywhere aroundus: laser surgery, organ transplants, battery-poweredlimbs and even electronic mood equalizers. All of this ison the one hand, m...rvelous, and on the other, offputtingin the extreme. Most people, after gasping in awe, can-not but say, \"Wait a minute, what about us? As people?\"Thus begins the search for something with deeper roots.Well, the Mexican and Mexican-American cultureshave, in fact, never let go of what other cultures haveonly begun to realize is of importance. This insistenceon the human element is, probably, what has keptcuranderismo from fading away through all these years.It is true, of course, that some practices havechanged. Hueseros, or bonesetters, for instance, haveall but disappeared, replaced by physicians who are moreeffective at setting bones. But for other ailments, theformal practitioner is, well, too formal. He requires thatan appointment be made. He requires a rather highcash payment, too. And in all likelihood, he doesn't speakSpanish. He might also be in another part of town. Thetypical curandero will have none of these drawbacks: he 9 will be, most likely, a neighbor or at least a trusted mem-ber of the patient's community. He will, therefore, speakSpanish. He will understand the social and psychologi-cal context in which the patient has developed thedisease. And his curebecause he believes that it isdictated by Godwill not be costly. In most cases, itwill cost whatever the patient deems it to be worth.The element of belief on the part of the patient will,of course, play a part in the cure. But even the stuffiestformal medical doctor cannot deny that it always does,whether the patient is treated in a barrio in San Antonioor at a shock trauma center somewhere. Expectation ofcure is a7,vvays important.But some remedies will work just as well withoutthe element of faith. Iv.exican housewives, for instance,used to scrape the mold of tortillas and feed it to thosesuffering from infection. How were they to know thatthe folk medicine they were offering would later be calledpenicillin? There are many common substances usedmedicinallygarlic, for examplewhich, after scien- tific study have been found to contain known healingagents.But Mexicans and Mexican-Americans do not haveto be convinced of this. They have for so long relied onherbal reliefs that, if anything, it seems odd not to relyon them. Evelyne Winter, who gathered a list of folkremedies from all over Mexico in the1950s, reported, forexample, that one of her informants had a hard timeconvincing a cab driver that she wasn't daft when sheadmitted to drinking tea just for the pleasure of drink-ing tea, rather than to effect a cure for some ailment orother! 10 ChamomileManzanilla A Brief History 'iNvo scholars from Pan American University stud-ied curanderismo and concluded that it derived from oris influenced by six separate elements:Judeo-Christian religious, symbols, and ritualsEarly Arabic medicine and health practicesMedieval and later European witchcraftNative American herbal loreModern Western belief3 about psychic phenomenaModern medicine.Of these six, some pertain to green medicine moreclearly than others. An understanding of the nativeAmerican herbal lorethat is, those remedies whichthe Indians of Mexico were practicing at the time of th,Spanish conquestand a brief examination of thereference to early Arabic medicine is sufficient to pro-vide a simplified view of herbal healing, not just as it ispracticed by the curanderos, but as it is handed downin Mexican-American families from one generation tothe next.Let us consider first the Aztec culture, which, morethan any other Indian culture in Mexico, including theMayan, Tbltec, and Zapotec-Mixtec, influenced the herbalaspects of curanderismo.At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Azteccivilization was remarkably advanced. There was social-ized medicine, for example, including hospitals in vari-ous cities thioughout the Aztec empire where injuredwarriors could he treated free of cost. There was greatemphasis on sanitation, not merely from the personal 12I 3 standpoint, but also regarding public sanitation as itaffected public health. And there was ongoing botanicalresearch for medical purposes.The Huaxtepec garden, for example, devoted entirelyto this purpose, had a seven mule circumference! Mon-tezuma's gardens are described by Cervantes de Salazarin his1554 book entitled \"Dialogues,\" and here we learnthat there were some two thousand species of trees,shrubs, and herbs for healing.Unfortunately, the Spanish friars destroyed all ofthe Aztec's own written records of botanical successesand failures. The Aztecs, after all, were considered sav-ages by these priests. What we do know of Aztec civiliza-tion was documented by men commissioned by moreenlightened members of the government of Spain espe-cially so that Aztec medical contributions would not beentirely lost!It's no wonder, though, that few realize how ad-vanced the Aztecs were. But even some who should knowbetter tacitly insult the mighty Aztec nation. Considerthe opinion inherent in this passage, for instance, fromthe pen of George Fe Ater a scholar writing in theJournal of American Folklore The Aztec understand-ing of medicine, he writes, \"was probably not greatlyinferior to that of Spanish physicians.\" This offhanddismissal of Aztec achievement fails to take into accountall of the things I mentioned earlier the hospitals, thepublic sanitation, and even documented surgicalsuccesses!This is not to say that the men who came to Mexicofrom Spain brought nothing. Some items they areknown to have introduced include Chamomile, Onions,Garlic, Rosemary, Lemons, and Oranges, to name a few.Most importantly, however, they brought with them amedical theory which pervades curanderismo eventoday.This is the theory of \"the humors,\" first introduced 131 13:,T Hippocrates, the Greek physician who is called the\"father of medicine.\"The theory of the humors presumes that there arefour liquids in the human body: blood, phlegm, yellowbile, and black bile. These are allied with the elements:Blood, allied to air, is hot and moistPhlegm, allied to water, is cold and moistYellow bile, allied to fire, is hot and dryBlack bile, allied to earth, is cold and dry.Physical ailments, and even the various disposi-tions that people have, were said to be caused by thebalance or proportion of the humors. Medicine, then,was an attempt to restore the balance. This theory ofthe humors, though, is not peculiar to curanderismo. Itplays a large part in all traditional healing systems. Whileit originated with the Greeks and Romans, it was trans-mitted via the Arabs and thus reached Spain. In thosedays, it was part of formal as opposed to folk medicine, with all medical practice being a matter ofrestoring the body's fundamental harmony.Formal medicine was very early entrenched inMexico, by the way. A chair of medicine was establishedat the University of Mexico in 1580, and before then,curing was taught on a more casual basis at the Colegiode Santa Cruz in Tlaltelolco. Where to Get the Herbs Originally, herbal medicine was the only possiblechoice. There were no drugstores. If Aloe Vera was plen-tiful in a given area, it was chosen over Maguey, andvice versa. Availability is one reason there are so manyalternatives listed for a given ailment occasionally an illness struck and one had to cast about for an herb tocure it.Eventually, botanical gardens not necessarily onthe scale of the Aztec gardens, but planned herbal plotsnonethelesswere standard. Even tcday, some easy-to-grow herbs are cultivated, even in city apartments. AloeVera, for instance, flourishes as a houseplant, and Mint,Parsley, and similar herbs can be grown in the back-yard or even in a window box.And of course, herbs still grow in the wild.The most common method of getting the herbs isedin green medicine, however, is to buy them. 13c ausemany are used in cooking, they will often be fou.id onthe spice shelf of any supermarket. Other more esotericherbs can be found in health food stores. Only occasion-allysay in the case of powdered garlic will the method of preparing herbs for sale alter their healingpr' exit ial.Those who livc in cities near the Mexican border orin cities with a iarge Mexican-American population willusually find these herbs on sale in their neighborhoods.In most cases, they'll be bundled, wrapped in plastic,and tagged with the iiames in Spanish, just as they'regiven in italics in the glossary of this book. In thesestores which sell herbsYierberias, Hierberias, orBotcinicasit is frequer: tly possible to get advice aboutthe use or preparation of a given herb, though the pro-prietors must take care net to violate the law by \"prac-tising medicine without a license: Usually you will be-VW- told that \"one often uses ...or \"it is sometimes recom-mended that you ...\", much as I have done in this book.In Mexico itself, most marketplaces or mercadoswill have a yerberia with bulk or prepacked herbs. Inmany areas, too, there is often an open air market withmakeshift stalls where herbs gathered frcm the plainsand mountains will be sold. And remember, often thevendors are curanderos who can give advice on the useof the herbs they sell. 1b Preparing Herbs for Use Herbal remedies are most often taken as teas, inwhich case they are decocted or infused terms to beexplained later. Chamomile is probably the best knownexample of an herb used as a tea.Occasionally, however, herbs are burned and eithersmoked or used as an incense. In the latter category,Juniper is often used. Many of the herbs which aresmoked are illegal (Marijuana) or dangerous (JimsonWeed), but some are not: Eucalyptus or Mullein are twogood examples.Sometimes, too, the herbs are prepared in tinctureor maceration. The former uses alcohol and the latter,water. Both of these methods seem to concentrate thequalities of the herb so prepared.Or herbs can be made into a poultice or plaster tobe applied directly to the skin. The Mustard plaster isprobably the one with which most people are familiar.But washes, too, are popular, either applied to theskin or used to rinse the mouth. A Rosemary wash,prepared exactly as the tea to be consumed is prepared,is probably the best example.Usually when an herb comes with instructions thatit be brewed as a tea, the method of preparation will beinfusion or decoction. An infusion requires that boilingwater be poured over the herb and that it then standfor at least five minutes in a covered container. A decoc-tion requires that the herb be placed into water whichis boiling and then be permitted to simmer (not boil)for at least five minutes. In either case, the herb isstrained away and the resulting liquid is the tea, how-ever it is used.A maceration is made by placing the herb in water 181 J and leaving it for at least ten hours, but often as long asa week. The constituents will separate and the thin toplayer can be poured off. The resulting mixture, after theherb has been strained away, is taken in the appropri-ate dosage.A tincture is prepared by mashing the herb andthen soaking it in vodka or wine in a darkened placesuch as a closet. Usually a week is sufficient. Before thetincture is used, it is strained.One general rule that should be followed no matterwhat mode of preparation is chosen is this: Never usealuminum or leflon when preparing herbs. Glass is best,though steel is acceptable.It is also wise to remember that dried herbs arestrongersometimes even twice as strong as freshlypicked herbs.It is very difficult to give exact dosages when deal-ing with herbs. The potency of the plant can changewith the size of the plant, the soil in which it has grown,and a host of other variable elements. This, in fact, isone reason plant remedies were eventually synthesizedin the lab: they could thus be made predictable. Ingeneral, however, a tablespoon of dried herb to a cup ofliquid is a good starting point whatever the method ofpreparation. Herbs are potent. Just keep in mind thetiny amount of tea in an average teabag! - 19 - A Few Cautions Any beck about herbs is bound to he filled withcautions. Herbs are, after all, potent medicine. It's possi-ble to overdose on herbs just as it is to overdose onstree` drugs.In addition, many plants have poisonous parts. Itmay be perfectly safe to eat the leaves of a plant, forexample, and deadly to eat the blossoms, or vice versa.Or the plant may be perfectly safe if eaten fresh, butbecome poisonous as it wilts.It's no wonder, then, that books about herbs haveto contain a lot of warnings. In fact, to be on the safeside consider this statement an inflexible rule: nevereat, chew, or drink tea brewed from any part of anunknown plant.For example, some plants with poisonous berriesare Mistletoe, Holly, and any variety of Ivy. Plants withpoisonous leaves include Azalea, Lily of the Valley, andElephant Ears. Plants with poisonous roots or bulbsinclude Iris, Daffoldil, and Violet. Some plants have poi-sonous stems or vines or seeds. In this category arePotato, Tomato, Cherry, Rhubarb, and Hydrangea. StillothersPeach and Apricot, to name two have poi-sonous pits.Herbal medicine, obviously, can be far from benign!The Brooklyn Botanic Garden in New York illus-trated this very well one year by exhibiting a surprisingarray of plants which can cause harm. These rangedfrom English Ivy to Yew (the leaves and seeds of Yew, ifeaten, can cause heart failure!).And from an historic standpoint, the toxic charac-teristics of some plants have provoked some really inter- 2 120 esting speculation. For example, there's one theory thatthe Salem witches weren't witches after all, but hadeaten an hallucinogenic substance similar to LSD. Theyare thought to have consumed St. Anthony's Fire, afungus that grows on grain especially on Rye.Also, every now and then, dangerous ingredientsare inclue xl in pre-packaged herbal remedies. Forexample, one produced twocures for empacho called \"Greta\" and \"AzarcOn.\" Gretaproved to have a base of lead monoxide and Azarconwas 90% lead tetroxide. Both were extremely toxic andwere in regular use in a number of Mexican and Mexi-can-American homes! Though they were originallyblended to cure empacho, which is similar to intestinalblockage, they were being used to treat headache andeven menstrual discalers.Lead monoxideand Greta, when analyzed, provedto have 90 to 98 percent of this substance as its basechanges to lead chloride at stomach temperatures and,because of this, is readily absorbed into the bloodstream.The base metal of Azarcon did not convert to lead chlo-ride and was less dangerous. But both, if ingested overlong periods of time, would cause lead poisoning.Lead poisoning can kill but more often those whosurvive are left severely retarded or handicapped in otherways.It is thought that Greta and Azarcon became popu-lar because they are similar in color to a remedy usedby curanderos: Saffron or, in Spanish, Azafrdn. Thepre-packaged formulas seem to be attempts to copy thefolk remedy for empacho, but alas, in this case, withdisastrous or even lethal results.Still another caution is not to rely on folk remediesand neglect standard medical treatment. Indeed, folkand formal med. cine should complement each other. Itis not unusual, nowadays, for a curandero to refer apatient to a licensed medical practitioner. 21 Important Terms There are a lot of terms used to describe what agiven substance does which are unfamiliar to the gen-eral reading public. Whenever I've used them in myglossary, I've defined themat least on the first use. Ifyou're planning to read other herbals, though (that'swhat glossaries describing herbs and their effects areoften called), you'll be encountering them regularly andought to memcrize them:Analgesic: Something that takes pain away, butdoes not cause loss of consciousness. An analgesic maybe swallowed or rubbed on the skin or be used as agargle. The effect categorizes it. Willow bark falls intothis category.Anaphrodisiac: Something that lessens sexualdesire. Its opposite, of course, is the Aphrodisiac. Lettuce,for instance, is thought to be an anaphrodisiac.Anesthetic: This can refer to a subs# Tice whichcauses loss of consciousness, but then again, it couldalso refer to one which doesn't. Oil of Cloves would bean example of the latter. An anesthetic kills sensation.Anodyne: Can refer to a pain killer or merely tosomething that soothes. Aioe Vera, for example, couldbe an anodyne to someone with sunburn, or Papaya tosomeone who had been stung by a jellyfish.Anthelmintic: This means that it eliminatesworms. Pumpkin seeds are the most renowned anthel-mintic.Antidote: This is a substance which counteractsthe effects of a poison.Antiemetic: Something that stops vomiting ^.ndnausea. Mint, for instance, is antiemetic. 2223 Antihydrotic: This is the opposite of a diaphoretic.It refers to a substance winch dries up bodily fl lids.Antipyretic: Something that reduces fever.Antiseptic: Something which stops the growth ofmicro-organisms (germs) and therefore is likely to pre-vent infection.Antispasmodic: Stops muse!\u00b0 spasms and cramps.Valerian, for instance, is a known antispasmodic.Aphrodisiac: Something that increases sexualdesire.Astringent: Something that is applied to contractpores.Carminative: Also called an antiflatulent, this issomething that gets rid of gas. Juniper berries are saidto be carminative.Cathartic: Causes bowels to evacuate. Anotherword for a laxative or purgative.Coagulant: Causes clotting.Demulcent: a substance which soothes an in-flamed area Aloe Vera, for example.Diaphoretic: Something that increases sweating.Disinfectant: An antiseptic or a substance used tokill germs.Diuretic: Something that increases the flow ofurine.Emetic: A substance taken to induce vomiting.Emollient: Something applied externally to softenand soothe. 2324 Expectorant A substance taken to expel mucousfrom the respiratory tract.Germicide: An antiseptic or disinfectant thatis, something to kill germs.Purgative: Something which causes the bowels toevacuate. Another term for a laxative or cathartic.Restorative: Something taken to renew energy.Mint tea is thought to be a restorative, for instance.Sedative: Something which calms and reducesnervousness.Soporific: The opposite of a stimulant, a soporificinduces sleep. Tha made from Orange blossoms, forexample, is said to be a soporific, as is Chamomile.Stimulant: A restorative.Styptic: An astringent applied to stop bleeding.Lemon, for instance.Tranquilizer Something which calms. A sedative.Unguent A soothing or healing salve.Vulnerary: A substance which promotes healing. 2 524 1ft A111611l. 1111.101,_/ 1 A Glossary of Herbs Aloe VeraZabila, Sabi laThe healing properties of Aloe Vera have been knownfor centuriesin tact, the first reference to it wasmade in 33.E B.C. Aloe Vera, part of the same family asonion and garlic (not of cactus as is widely supposedbecause of the plant's spines), grows wheie there is nodanger of freezing. In the United States, this meansSouth Thxas or Florida Of course, Aloe Vera can also becultivated as a houseplant.Because Aloe Vera has become popular, it is possi-ble to buy the extracted lel in bottles for use on cuts,burns, raies, insect bites, acne, or as a wrinkle-pre-ventative. This g.... is usually liquified and often is stabi-lized so that it needs no refrigeration. Mexican-Ameri-cans mix the gel with water and drink it to treatarthritis, rheumatism, and stomach disorders. If youare using the plant itself rather than the bottled gelsimply break off a leaf, slit it, squeeze out the gel thatyou find inside and apply. Aloe Vera can also be used asa meat tenderizer. AniseAnts Es trelladoThe seeds of this plant have a warm, spicy taste,and are often used in cooking. As a medicinal herb,however, a tea is made by boiling the Anise seeds ineither water or milk. When prepared with milk, the teais used to cure colic; when prepared with water, it iseither consumed to cure a cough or used externally asan erwash. An old Indian remedy advises travelers tochew :',rise seeds to cure stomach gas.\" AshFresnoAsh is said to be a snake repellent, so effective thatsome people, when venturing into snake-infested areas,carried boughs of It with them. This rumor may havegrown as the result of a mention in a 1597 book entitled\"Gerard's Herbal,\" to wit: \"serpents dare not be so boldeas to touch the morning and evening shadows of the(Ash) tree.\" In any case, Ash is said to be a remedy forsnake bite (should carrying these boughs fail to wardthe snakes away). To use in this manner, make a strongtea from the leaves and drink it if yru are bitten. Thistea is also supposedly a remedy for gout and rheumHsi.' and can be takes to reduce fever. Ash is also saidto have the ability to increase longevity, and, when usedfor this purpose, should be ingested each day. Ash isalso rumored to be an aphrodisiac.Basil (Sweet Basil)AlbahacaBasil is an easy herb to grow. Its leaves and some-times the flowering tips of the plant are used, eitherfresh or dried, to make a tea This tea is supposed tohave sedative and antispasmodic properties and there-fore 13 often administered to those suffering from sustoor shock. In a more concentrated form, Basil tea can beused as a gargle for sore throat or to heal sores in themouth. The same tea can also be used externally oninsect stings. A decoction of Basil, Honey, and Nutmegis supposedly good to give Lo a mother immediately afterchildbirth to aid in expelling the afterbir th.BayLaurelBay is a tree whose leaves are used to make a teathat is said to cure colic and diarrhea. Bay leaves aresupposed to keep insects away and are often tuckedinto the band of a hat for this purpose. The oil from theberries can be extracted, too, and applied externally tomuscles which are sore because of rheumatism oroverexertion. 2728 BayberryArbol de la CeraSwallowing a nickel-sized piece of the berry wax orchewing the dry berries will, it is said, quiet a cough orcure dysentery. A teaspoon of the liquid extracted fromeither the root or the bark has a similar use. It willsupposedly ward off a cold if it is taken at the yen/ firstsign of the cold's onset. Still another method of treatingor preventing a cold is to dry a piece of the root barkand powder it, then make a tPa of the powder. The samepowder can be used as a snuff to cure nasal congestion.Or the powder can be mixed with water to make anastringent mouthwash, especially good as a remedy forsore or BirthwortMoja de Guaco, AristoloquiaA Birthwort causes sweating (thatis, is a diaphoretic) and, reportedly, is a stimulant. Largedoses of this tea, however, can cause vomiting and stom-ach pains. Birthwort is also used in the form of atincture, which means that its leaves are soaked inalc-hol, then strained out and the resulting liquid savedto be applied as an antiseptic in cases of insect bite,especially if the insects are poisonous. BlackberryZarzamoraThe leaves are boiled for about ten minutes and theresulting liquid is used to rinse out the mouth if thegums are inflamed or if ulcers are present in the mouth.The same decoction, in lesser strength, is taken fordiarrhea. The root bark is more potent than the leavesand is also used. BorageBorrajaThis herb was known by the Mors as Abou-Rach,\"the father of sweat.\" Indeed, Borage is said to purify 28 the body by increasing not only sweat but urine as well.Drinking a tea made of Borage is also alleged to keepthe body cool, so it is sometimes used as a Summerdrink It is also offered to those suffering from fever forthe same cooling effect. Borage tea is considered espe-cially effective when the fever is attributable to Measles.Because Borage increases the flow of urine, it issometimes used to treat bladder infections. Scientificanalysis of Borage shows that it contains potassium. BougainvilliaBugambiliaA tea can be made from the flowers and used tocombat a cough or sore throat. Cactussee Prickly Pear Cactus Camomilesee Chamomile CamphorAlcanforThe oil from the leaves of this tree is used as ananaphrodisiac, e.g., a substance which diminishes sex-ual desire. This oil is obtained through an elaborateprocess of steaming the branches, pressing the liquidproduced into crystals, and then liquifying the crystals.The oil, then, is best purchased.

This list is not meant to beexhaustive:Green F _amacy, Barbara Griggs (Viking, 1981):This is a history 0; herbal medicine, in eluding Lie dis-putes and controversies that have surrounded itthrough the ages. It makes no mention of curanderismo,but does include an account of the way in which thebirth control pill was derived from the Mexican yam.Herbs and Things, Jeanne Rose (Workman, 1.972):A charming and informal herbal which includes suchthings as herbal baths, veterinary potions, sachets andpotpourris, and a section entitled \"Various ForbiddenSecrets,\" e.g., some ceremonies from witchcraft.Mexico's Ancient and Native Remecites, EvelyneWinter (Editorial Fournier, 1968): This sounds morepromising than it is. It is not a collection of old remedies,but rather, a collection of the remedies of various peo-ple ,vhom Winter encounters.Grandmother's Tea, Joe Graham (Institute of Tex-an Cultures, 1979): This was really designed for schoolchildren and provides a very elementary approach toherbal healing in the Mexican-American culture. Thereis a slide show which goes with the text, however, and agood bibliography.Folk Medicine and Herbal Healing, G. Meyer,Kenneth Blum and John G. Cull, eds (Charles C.Thomas, 1981): It will probably be hard to find thisb- ok, even in libraries. It is a collection of articles onthe subject in \"an effort to present ... the current sta-tus of folk healing and herbal medicine.\" The editorsare based in San Antonio, and, though their intention 6%-i is to discuss all folk systems rather than just curander-ismo, many of the articles have a Mexican-Americanslant.Cooking and. Curing with Mexican Herbs, DoloresL. Latorre (Encirr- Press, 1977): This beautiful book isillustrated with woodcuts. About two-thirds of it couldbe called a cookbook. The healing portion lists condi-tions and diseases and then the herbs which are saidto cure them. Some books which are about the practice of curan-derismo rather than the more specialized subject ofherbal medicine would, nonetheless, make interestingfollow-up reading. A few good ones are:Curanderismo: Mexican American Folk Psychi-atry, Ari Kiev (The Free Press, 1968): Kiev's researchwas done in San Antonio. He examines the therapeuticaspects of curanderismo from the point of view of apsychotherapist and concludes that curanderismo isbeneficial in many ways, not the least of which its recog-nition that emotions can strongly affect physical health.Folk Practices in Northern Mexico, Isabel TruesdellKlly (University of lexas Press, 1965): This is a hardbook to find, but it focuses on beliefs relating to health.Although the study was done in Mexico, the findingsalso apply to Mexican-Americans.Curanderismo, Robert T Trotter and Juan AntonioChavira (University of Georgia Press, 1981). Primarilyaddressed to health care professionals, this book seeks\"to lessen cultural barriers to the delivery of health careto Mexican-American patients\" by providing backgroundinformation on curanderismo.61 -62 Afterword I hope that the information presented in this bookhas given you a greater appreciation of green medicine,which has been around since the beginning of manand has evolved through the centuries.The valuable knowledge of herbs has basically beenpassed from mother to daughter and from father toson. Nowadays, however, many second and third genera-tion Mexican-Americans are forgetting the traditionaluse of green medicine. For this reason, I have chosen toelaborate on the subject here.The Mexican and Mexican-American practice ofgreen medicine has been of special interest to me and Ihope to aid, in some small way, in keeping that knowl-edge alive.It has always been a source of pride to me as it should to everyone with Mexican ancestry that Mexican-American herbal medicine is the product ofsuch a rich blend of European, Asian, and native Indianknowledge and tradition.Perhaps it is this that has sparked the interest inboth the historical and therapeutic aspects of herbalmedicine now being shown by those who are not mem-bers of the Mexican-American community.I hope that this book will answer the need for infor-mation on this subject. Much of it is not readily available,and often, when it can be found, is addressed to thescholar or botanist rather than the average person withan interest in herbal medicine.This book then, like the herbs which are its subject,is also a remedy of sorts. i626, 6 IBEST COPY AVAILABLE "}
