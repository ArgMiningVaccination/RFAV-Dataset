Chapter 7 (https://www.ihs.gov/ihm/pc/part3/p3c7/ ) A. Contract Prescribers Not Licensed in the State Where Delivering Services . In accordance with DEA approv ed protocols, a facility DEA number may be assigned followed by a hyphen and a unique identifier for the prescriber , including locum tenens practitioners. This provider-specific identifier will be maintained in an area designated by the facility and will be readily retrievable. This provider-specific identifier can only be used within the confines of the SU and is not permitted for prescribing of controlled substances outside of the SU. To comply with IHS Chapter 7 and DEA approved protocols, follow these instructions to enter the unique identifier into RPMS under the provider profile as shown in the following screen shots. These instructions are for entry through the Add/Edit Providers menu in RPMS. The first set of instructions is for systems who have not yet installed RPMS Electronic Prescribing of Controlled Substances (EPCS) and/or enabled specific providers for EPCS. The second set is for those who are using EPCS. If EPCS is not yet i nstalled and enabled for a provider at your location: 1. Navigate to the AVA Add/Edit Providers Menu ADD/EDIT PROVIDERS use this option to add new providers to your system OR to edit those already in the system. You do NOT need to enter the provider as a person first. Just use this option. Enter NEW PERSON'S name the provider you wish to edit 3. Enter in all required fields and when you get to the DEA field, leave blank. This will be auto populated in the prescription file with the facility DEA number and the unique identifier. In the VA# field, add a unique identifier of your choice. Choose a system that works for your facility and can be tracked to ensure that it is unique and is readily retrievable. Note character limits in PDMP transmission of the unique identifier (see below). If your location is using RPMS EPCS, and the particular provider is enabled for EPCS, the steps to add the VA number are different. VA numbers still retain full functionality after the EPCS patch VA Numbers can still be entered/edited thru RPMS for NONEPCS enabled providers Once the provider has been enabled to use EPCS, then the VA Numbers can only be entered/edited using the EPCS system's graphical user interface for editing provider data. This includes split role functionality where User1 will make a change and User2 will verify the change. Detailed information on setting up providers for EPCS is included in those specific trainings and documentation and is outside of the scope of this quick reference document.

These FAQs apply to \"regular\" DEA licenses: https://www.deadiversion.usd oj.gov/drugreg/faq.htm#4 Question: Are separate registrations required for separate locations? Answer: A separate registration is required for each principal place of business or professional practice where controlled substances are stored, administered, or dispensed by a person. If a practitioner will only be prescribing from another location(s) situated within the same state, then an additional registration is not necessary. Question: What happens if a practitioner/physician relocates his/her business? Answer: A practitioner who moves to a new physical location must request a modification of registration. A modification is handled in the same manner as a new application and must be approved by DEA. A modification of registration can be requested online at www.DEAdiversion.usdoj.gov or by writing to the local DEA Registration Program Specialist responsible for the area in which the new office is located. If the change of address involves a change in the state, the proper state issued license and, if applicable, state controlled substances registration must be obtained prior to the request to DEA for an address change. If the modification is approved, DEA will issue a new certificate of registration. The registrant should maintain the new certificate with the old certificate until expiration. Therefore, when a provider moves to a new state to work as a direct employee of a federal government agency, they will still need to update their address on their \"regular\" DEA license. They may do this if they wish. However, this will require them to get a new DEA registration in the new state. As an alternative, in order to avoid paying for a new state DEA registration, the FEDDOC program allows them to apply for a fee exempt DEA license that can be updated with new addresses as needed in the future with no fees associated. A DEA memo dated 7/23/2010, titled \"Revised Policy Regarding the Federal Government Doctor (FEDDOC) Program (DFN: 60104)\" is provided and https://www.ihs.gov/sites/opioids/themes/respo nsive2017/display_object s/documents/DEA_FEDDOC_ Policy.pdf Special Circumstances: If you are participating in the FEDDOC program and if you are going to be prescribing or dispensing controlled substances at sites in different states or cities simultaneously, you would need to have 2 separate DEA numbers. If you are practicing at 2 different sites in the same city, you would need to contact the state office of the DEA, let them know that you are going to be adding a practice location, and ask how that should be handled. There is significant statetostate variation in what is required. "}
