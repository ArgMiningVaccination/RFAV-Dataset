Macadam Ave. Portland, OR 97239 Hours Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. PST This innovative online degree in integrative health is designed to help guide the evolution of healthcare by creating, educating, and actively supporting a community of professionals who embody the philosophy and practice of integrative health. This terminal professional degree allows students to work toward a specialization in Aromatherapy or Herbal Medicine, or to complete a general degree by completing electives to satisfy the degree requirements. Emphasis is placed on the science and philosophy of holistic health using a variety of techniques that are in harmony with nature and the individual. The varied techniques that a member of the holistic health industry employs are covered, focusing on the desired outcome to increase the natural vitality of the individual and bring the body systems back into balance. We examine the belief fundamental to natural healing that the human body contains a strong power to heal itself. While examining this belief we also look at how the individual is able to stimulate this power by educating others how to maintain health once it is achieved, increasing vitality and building up one's resistance through improved nutrition and a harmonious, balanced lifestyle. Students will integrate their learning across a wide variety of integrative health disciplines through these concepts, which emerge in each subject area. The use of these concepts also provides faculty and students with a vehicle to pursue intellectual integration, similarities and differences, and engage in dialogue and debate across the modalities studied. This online integrative health degree provides a foundation for personal wellness, tools and strategies to support community health, and professional pathways based on students' goals and interests.
