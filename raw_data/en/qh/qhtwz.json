Tell congress to stop Medicare cuts for DCs Take five minutes today to send a letter to the U.S. Congress regarding payment reductions that will further exacerbate the financial instability of health care providers, especially doctors of chiropractic. On Oct. 30 of this year, Representatives Ami Bera, MD (D-CA), and Larry Bucshon, MD (R-IN), introduced H.R. 8702, the Holding Providers Harmless from Medicare Cuts During COVID-19 Act of 2020. This comprehensive bill has wide support in the U.S. Congress and among Medicare providers and patients. H.R. 8702, through what is known as a \"hold harmless\" approach, would ensure that payments to doctors of chiropractic remain at current 2020 levels through 2022. The American Chiropractic Association says, \"This critical legislation recognizes the importance of allowing significant scheduled pay increases to primary care and others who primarily provide E/M services to take effect while also avoiding the devastating corresponding cuts for physician and non-physician providers that will occur because of Medicare's budget neutrality requirements. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to halt the implementation of any payment reductions.\" Send a letter now to your member of congress and urge them to co-sponsor this critical legislation for doctors of chiropractic by going to acatoday.com. Thank you, loyal readers We received an email this week that was signed \"loyal reader,\" which made us thankful, through all the difficulties that 2020 has brought, for the steadfast support of our readership. Chiropractic Economics magazine and ChiroEco.com are both the No. 1-voted, most-trusted and most-used resource for practice building, product information and purchasing decisions by doctors of chiropractic. We have also developed the most complete, integrated marketing programs to build brand equity and generate quality leads for the chiropractic and industry companies we work with. We're continuously updating and refining our services to reflect the changing needs of the chiropractic marketplace, which has resulted in surpassing our 2020 goals, even in these difficult times. BPA Worldwide certifies that Chiropractic Economics has the highest number of requested readers compared to any other chiropractic magazine, so thank you for your support! In 2021 we'll be bringing our readers a number of new topics, trends, and the practice-building articles that are requested via our annual Readership Survey. These new 2021 issue themes will include Immune Health, New Treatment Protocols, Preventative Wellness, our second Women's Health Issue, Top Tech, and a Reader's Choice issue that will be combined with the 2021 Winter Buyers Guide. We've received a lot of feedback from DCs wishing to put this difficult year behind them. But at the same time we're gearing up for a big 2021 and new opportunities. We're wishing happy holidays and a great new year to you and yours.

Try these four tips. 1. Post! How often do you post? Once a month? Once a week? Daily? Social media platforms must be updated regularly. When folks go to check you out and there's not a recent post, the page seems old or irrelevant or they even wonder if you are still open. 2. Be responsive. Never let a comment or message, particularly a negative one, sit for too long without some kind of response. Maybe that means empowering someone you trust to have access to the accounts, or even using an outside marketing group. 3. Be creative and incentivize. Encourage activity on your social media channels. For example, when a new pair of stabilizing orthotics comes in, ask the patient if you can take a picture and post on Facebook. Let them know they'll be helping others by doing so. Identify and capture little \"moments\" in your office and then post to social media. Giving the world a glimpse of what goes on in your office on a daily basis will help \"leads\" be more comfortable in reaching out to you for help. 4. Let your patients do the talking. People love to be asked to help with a cause they care about. Your patients already know and like and love you, so give them an easy way to show you off to their friends and family. Encourage patients to \"tag\" you in their social media posts about the great treatment they received. \u2014 Amanda Bledsoe, DC For more information on social media marketing, visit the Business Tips section of ChiroEco.com.Each month we'll ask a new question on our Facebook page.

An internally clean body may help other therapies and modalities work better. Detoxification and relaxation with the IonCleanse by AMD is a great choice as part of your protocol - whether you are addressing a specific condition or creating a general platform for health. The IonCleanse by AMD's proprietary and patented technology results in only biocompatible electrical frequencies entering the water, which elicits a relaxation response. Concurrently, these frequencies create an ionic field that cleanses and purifies the body through the power of ions. The IonCleanse process ionizes the water as H2O is split into OH- and H+ ions. These ions attract and neutralize oppositely charged toxins. After a session the user feels calm, relaxed, and focused. Typical session times vary from 10-30 minutes, based primarily upon age. There are no harmful side effects, and the process is painless, non- invasive, and completely safe.

If you have a DME / PTAN number and are in a CB zone you may no longer be able to bill for bracing unless you are classified as a Medical, Multidisciplinary or Physical Therapy clinic. If you aren't listed as one of the above clinics and you would like to be reclassified, there are steps you can take. Give me a call and I can explain. Competitive Bidding in a nutshell is this. Medicare solicits bid amounts for specific DME from companies who have PTAN numbers. Normally the bids come from DME companies. PTAN means Provider Transaction Access Number. Forever ago (30 years) when I started in healthcare it was simply called a DME Provider Number. Unless you are exempt from CB, you will need to be Accredited and secure a Surety Bond.Another benefit to being classified as one of the exempt clinics I mentioned in the beginning is that your client would not only be exempt from CB, but also be exempt from Accreditation. Even if you aren't exempt from CB but have a PTAN number (or want one) you can still dispense & bill for LSO back braces but they will need to be custom fit to the patient by a Certified Fitter or \"Individual with Expertise\". There are also inexpensive fast-tracked programs that will allow you to become credentialed as a Certified Fitter. Keep in mind there are more rules to custom fitting. There is a lot more to go over but it would make this a never- ending article. And my typing skills just aren't that good. Call me at 865.368.0202 with any questions you may have. Our goal, to make sure that with CB and dispensing DME you remain in safe harbors and are successful with your DME program.

Pain Therapy Line > learn more at aspenmp.com/pain-therapy > contact your local Aspen Sales RepTo place an order or for more information > call 800.295.2776The Pain Therapy line is low profile, easily customizable and designed to enhance trunk stiffness and reduce the load on overworked muscles. Patients dealing with chronic low back pain are typically less active. Using the lower back muscles is painful; therefore, the tendency is to avoid using them. This lack of activity leads to muscle weakening.1 The increased trunk stability and targeted compression delivered by the Aspen Pain Therapy line of braces can help this downward spiral of pain inactivity and muscle weakening and help get patients back to pre-injury levels of activity. As recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force2, bracing should be part of the clinician's toolbox for treating chronic low back pain. 1 KnockOutPain\u00ae Secrets to Maintain a Healthy Back: Read This Before You Go To The Doctor by Dr. Winifred Bragg 2https://www.hhs.gov/ash/advisory-committees/pain/reports/index.htmlSUPPLIES Chiropractic Economics is pleased to present the profession's most comprehensive Supplies list.
