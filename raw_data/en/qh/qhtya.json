The 32-year-old, who can't be named for legal reasons, spent [lockdown](/news/coronavirus-lockdowns/index.html) in his room at a care home because his parents refused to let him be vaccinated, Jersey's Royal Court heard. The man, named 'B' in legal papers, has a severe learning disability, sufferers from seizures and his non verbal. His father has responsibility for his care and makes decisions for him. He was one of the so-called Lancet 12, one of the children with autism who took part in disgraced Andrew Wakefield's study which was published in the medical journal, falsely claiming that the MMR vaccine caused autism. 'B's nurse made the application to get him the jab on behalf of Jersey's health minister. Jersey's Royal Court granted the vaccination order, saying that it was 'the right best interests decision' for B who had been in 'groundhog day'. The 32 year old, named 'B', was one of the children in disgraced Andrew Wakefield's (pictured appearing before the General Medical Council in 2007) MMR vaccine study He spent lockdown confined to his room in a care home because his parents refused to let him be vaccinated, Jersey's Royal Court heard last month. His parents believe the MMR jab given to him in 1991 when he was 16 months old has caused his health conditions. The father said B was in a 'very bad way' on the evening of the vaccination and by the morning he was 'completely blank', according to [The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/forced-to-have-covid-jab-at-32-the-autistic-son-of-antivaxers-who-still-believe-andrew-wakefield-qr26hq3zl). The 16 month old was part of the 'Lancet 12' - a group of children who were used in Andrew Wakefield's MMR study, which falsely claimed the vaccine caused autism in children. In 1995 Wakefield was allegedly approached by the parents of an autistic child who had stomach problems. He then spoke to more parents, who said their child had first shown signs after receiving the three-in-one jab for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Three years later Wakefield and 12 co-authors published research in The Lancet, which proposed that there was a connection between the MMR vaccine and autism and bowel disease. In 2004, an investigation found Wakefield's findings to be inaccurate and that some of the parents of the 12 children were recruited via a lawyer who was preparing a lawsuit against MMR manufacturers and had paid Wakefield \u00a3400,000 for the study. Wakefield was subsequently removed off the medical register in 2010 after UK's General Medical Council found him guilty of dishonesty, giving children unnecessary and invasive medical procedures and other unethical approaches. It has since been proven that there is no connection between the MMR vaccine and autism,and in year before the MMR jab was introduced, there were 86,000 cases reported. However, B's parents have said Wakefield could have been wrong about other children but the was 'not wrong' about their son. 'The parents felt they had a different and disabled child,' the court heard. 'It was hard to convey how tragic that was, and the vaccine had had a devastating effect on both [B] and on his family.'

'We stress that we have no doubt that the evidence by the parents was given truthfully,' the court said. B's mother told the court that the family faced 'a number of difficulties with vaccinations', including that she thought the infancy death of her first child was linked to the flu vaccine she received in 1986. The court case serves as an example as to how disgraced Wakefield's study caused a drop in vaccine uptake as parents feared the side-effects of the MMR jab. Wakefield obtained a medical degree in 1985 and trained as a gastrointestinal surgeon. Following the scandal, he moved to the US and reinvented himself as a filmmaker and campaigner. It was reported last year that he had stirred up paranoia surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and vaccinations. He and his ex-wife Carmel, who settled in Austin, Texas, separated in early 2017.
