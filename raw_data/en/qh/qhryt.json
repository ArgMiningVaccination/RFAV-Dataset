Nurses on the front lines of a pandemic need education, training and institutional support. The idea, says our experts, was to shut down Obamacare. But it didn't work out that way. This could take on more importance as the number of uninsured swells due to coronavirus. Human beings have difficulty assessing distant threats. The government doesn't know how many people have died of COVID-19, in part because it didn't require nursing homes to report cases to the CDC. In some states, over half of deaths are in nursing homes. When you're stuck at home during social distancing, it's only natural to feel on edge at times. So how do you listen to a loved one who's on edge, too? Southern governors are starting to reopen their economies at the same time COVID-19 cases are spreading through the rural South. How and when the US economy reopens will look different state to state, and for good reasons. This Q&A explains why, and why some states are working together. Without massive change, the US health care system will continue to be disorganized and inefficient. While COVID-19 raises the risk for people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and COPD, social distancing can make it harder to keep up diets and medication. Pharmacists are well positioned to provide communities with a lifesaving drug. Testing everyone for COVID-19 isn't realistic in a country the size of the US, but there are ways to design testing systems that can catch most of the cases. In addition to testing and special facilities for COVID-19 patients, the country's government-run tracking system allows the health care system to identify infected people and their contacts. Office buildings have been left mostly empty for weeks amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving standing water in pipes where harmful organisms can grow. What happens when those buildings reopen? It is impossible to anticipate if, how or when COVID-19 might take a loved one. But there are ways to prepare. When the 1918 influenza pandemic struck India, the death toll was highest among the poor. Wildfire smoke makes it harder for firefighters' bodies to fight off viral invaders. But firefighting conditions make the usual protective measures nearly impossible. CBD may not be a panacea for your aches and pains - and it certainly isn't for COVID-19. Rural America has special problems as it copes with the COVID-19 pandemic. As the health care system tries to solve the crisis in care around the coronavirus, pharmacists stand ready to help, but they face limits. As coronavirus continues to spread, older adults face a challenge: how to get the medications they need without putting themselves at risk. A new national survey shows they aren't prepared. Blacks are dying at higher rates from COVID than whites, showing yet another example of gaps in outcomes between blacks and other groups. The cause is more sociological than biological. Asthma rescue inhalers are in short supply, and asthma sufferers are worried about the risks they face from COVID-19. A doctor answers six key questions. A community effort is creating do-it-yourself hand-washing stations for the homeless population in Los Angeles. An expert on forensic science explains the critical role of coroners and pathologists in the COVID-19 crisis, as many cities struggle to manage the soaring number of dead bodies. "}
