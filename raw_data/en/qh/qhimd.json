According to the Mind/Body Medical Institute at Harvard University, 60 to 90% of all medical office visits in the United States are for stress related disorders. Relaxation techniques are helpful tools for coping with stress and promoting long-term health by slowing down the body and quieting the mind. Such techniques generally entail: refocusing attention (for example, noticing areas of tension), increasing body awareness, and exercises (such as meditation) to connect the body and mind together. Used daily, these practices can lead to a healthier perspective on stressful circumstances. In fact, more than 3,000 studies show the beneficial effects of relaxation on health and wellbeing. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) an agency of the Federal Government and housed within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, defines mind body therapy as those practices that \"employ a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind's capacity to affect bodily function, our thoughts and actions.\" Who can benefit from this approach?
