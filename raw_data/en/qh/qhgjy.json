Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 5 BACKGROUND 1. WHAT IS LIVE ATTENUA TED INFLUENZA VACCINE (LAIV)? FLUMIST\u00ae is a live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and is administered by the intranasal route by a healthcare provider . Each pre- filled glass sprayer contains 0.2 mL dose (given as 0.1 mL in each nostril) of live, attenuated influenza virus reassortants of three strains of virus .(1) The spray is colorless to pale yellow, clear to opalescent liquid; small, white particles may be present. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 6 2. WHY IS LAIV AN INTRA NASAL SPRAY? LAIV (FLUMIST\u00ae) is made from attenuated viruses that are able to replicate efficiently only at temperatures present in the nasal mucosa. LAIV is manufactured using the 3 influenza virus strains recommended by the W orld Health Organization (WHO) for the northern hemisphere. Through manufacturing processes the 3 influenza virus strains become: cold- adapted so they are only able to replicate at cooler temperatures of the nasopharyngeal mucosa temperature sensitive so they are unable to replicate at warmer temperatures of the lower airways and l ungs attenuated so they are unable to cause clinical influenza disease The cumulative effect of these properties is such that the viral strains induce protective immun ity without causing disease. (1) 3. HAS LAIV BEEN WELL STUDIED? LAIV ( FLUMIST\u00ae ) has been studied in over 140,000 patients in clinical trials .(2) A number of studies (LAIV versus placebo and LAIV versus trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIIV) ) have been conducted in children and adults.(3)(4) The results of e fficacy and safety studies have demonstrated that FLUMIST\u00ae is effective, safe and well tolerated.(3)(4) 4. WHY IS LAIV NOT APPROVED FOR USE IN CHILDREN < 24 MONTHS OF AGE? LAIV ( FLUMIST\u00ae ) is contraindicated in this age group due to increased risk of wheezing.(4) A multi- centre efficacy trial found that rates of wheezing were statistically Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 7 significantly higher among children 6 - 23 months of age (5.9% 5. WHY DOES NACI RECOMMEND LAIV OVER TIIV FOR IMMUNIZATION OF HEALTHY CHILDREN? Based on effectiveness, efficacy and immunogenicity data, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends LAIV as the preferred product for use in healthy children and adolescents 2- 17 years of age. If LAIV is not available, TIIV should be used as it is safe, efficacious and effective in this group. NACI states that LAIV has generally been shown to be equally, if not more, immunogenic than TIIV for all 3 influenza strains in children 2- 17 years of age .(3)(4) 6. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE STUDIES TH AT SUPPORT THE PREFERENTIAL USE OF LAIV IN YOUNGER HEALTHY CHILDREN? Several clinical trials have been conducted in young children, and this literature has been systema tically reviewed in two papers (5)(6) and also reviewed by NACI. In five randomized controlled clinical trials, the absolute vaccine efficacy of LAIV against laboratory confirmed influenza in children aged 6 years and under was 85% (95% CI 77 to 100%). Similar findings of vaccine efficacy were made in one trial of children up to age 7 years . (7) In contrast 2 studies of TIIV in this age group found absolute vaccine efficacy of 39% (95% CI -8 to 66%) against the same outcome of laboratory confirmed influenza. An additional benefit to use of LAIV is demonstrated cross -protection against mismatched strains, including great er cro ss-protection versus TIIV.(3) This is to be expected because the attenuated virus is a more complete antigenic stimulus than the antigenic components used in inactivated vaccines. 7. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE STUDIES TH AT SUPPORT THE USE OF LAIV IN OLDER CHI LDREN? Randomized cli nical controlled trials of LAIV vaccine efficacy have not been conducted in healthy children and youth older than 7 years. Several observational studies have been done, however, in children up to 18 years old with the outcomes being medically attended acut e respiratory illness. Findings have generally been consi stent with those described above (see question 6) with some suggestion of declining effectiveness at older ages, but confidence intervals have been wide and findings are inconclusive. Therefore the data to support preferential use over TIIV in this age group are not as Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 8 strong, but the vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness and offers the additional advantage of needle free administration and potentially improved cross -protection to other strains, as outl ined above. (s ee question 6) One randomized open label study has been c onducted in asthmatic children (8) aged 6 to 17 years, using either LAIV or TIIV. During the 2002- 3 influenza season, the study demonstrated a significantly greater relative efficacy of LAIV compared to TIIV of 34.7% (95% CI 3.9% -56.0%). Asthma exacerbations were similar in the two groups. Those who received LAIV had higher incidence of runny nose or nasal congestion (66.2% compared to TIIV at 52.5%) and about 70% of TIIV recipients reported injection site reactions. 8. CAN LAIV BE ADMINIST ERED TO CHILDREN WIT H CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS? NACI recommends that LAIV can be used in children 24 months and older with stable, non-severe asthma and in children with chronic health conditions (excluding those with immunocompromising conditions and severe asthma). Based on expert review, it is expected that LAIV should be as safe, immunogenic and efficacious in immune competent children with chronic health conditions as it is in healthy children. However, at this time there is insufficient evidence available to prefer LAIV over TIIV in children with chronic health conditions.(4) 9. WHEN WAS LAIV APPROVED AND WHERE ELSE IS IT PROVIDED IN CANADA? LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae) was approv ed in Canada in June 2010 for active immunization of persons 2 - 59 years of age. Since 2010, more than 850,000 doses of FLUMIST\u00ae have been distributed in Canada.(2) FLUMIST\u00ae timeline in Canada: (2) 2013 -14 - Alberta, British Columbia, North West Territories, Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Yukon 2012 -13 - Alberta, British Columbia (pilot project in Vancouver Coastal Health), Nunavut, Prince Edward Island, Quebec 2011 -12 - Private market only Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 9 10. HAS LAIV BEEN APPROVED FOR USE IN OTHER COUNTRIES? LAIV (FLUMIST\u00ae) has been available in the United States sinc e 2003 .(3) Since 2002, more than 60 million doses of FLUMIST\u00ae have been manufactured and distributed globally .(2) Outside of North America, countries with approval for FLUMIST \u00ae (called FLUENZ \u00ae in Europe) are: the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, Israel, Malaysia and Hong Kong.

Available from : http://www.bccdc.ca/dis -cond/comm - manual/CDManualChap2.htm 11. WHICH 3 INFLUENZA VI RUS STRAINS MAKE UP THIS YEAR'S SEASONAL TRIVALENT INFLUENZA VACCINES? For the northern hemisphere the World Health Organization (WHO ) (5) recommended that the 2013/2014 Seasonal Trivalent Influenza and virus B/Massachusetts/2/2012- like virus The A strains are unchanged from the 2012/13 season; the B strain is new. 12. IN THE 2013 -14 INFLUENZA SEASON WHO IS LAIV PUBLICLY FUNDED FOR ? LAIV ( FLUMIST\u00ae ) is publicly funded for eligible children aged 2 to 17 years old inclusive ; those eligible are listed in the : BCCDC Communicable Disease Control Manual, Chapter II -Immunization Program, Section VII- Biological Products, August 2013, Page 31. Available from: http://www.bccdc.ca/dis -cond/comm -manual/CDManualChap2.htm 13. WHAT ARE THE DOSING AND SCHEDULE S FOR ADMINISTRATION OF LAIV? Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 11 2 - 8 years of age: 1 or 2 doses given as 0.2 mL (0.1 mL in each nostril) intranasal spray . This product should be preferentially offered to children in this age group. A 2nd dose of influenza vaccine is recommended 4 weeks later for children receiving influenza vaccine for the first time that season. (See ques tion 15). 9 - 17 years of age: 1 dose given as 0.2 mL (0.1 mL in each nostril) intranasal spray . This product is recommended for use in this age group and offers the advantage of needle- free administration. 18 - 59 years of age: 1 dose: 0.2 mL (0.1 mL in each nostril) intranasal spray . This product is approved for use in this age group but TIIV provides better protection against influenza; it is not provided free in the BC program for this age group. 14. WHAT IF A CHILD < 24 MONT HS OF AGE RECEIVES L AIV? LAIV ( FLUMIST \u00ae) is not approved for this age group due to an increased risk of wheezing found in clinical trials in this age group.(4) If FLUMIST \u00ae is inadvertently administered to a child < 24 months of age there is no need to offer TIIV subsequently as LAIV provides protection in this age group.(10) However, inform the parent/guardian of risk of incre ased wheezing and recommend that they contact the child's primary care provider as well as report to public health if w heezing occurs. Complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organization. Children under 9 years of age who have not previously received seasonal influenza vaccine require 2 doses given 4 weeks apart. When a child < 24 months inadvertently given LAIV for the 1st dose presents for a 2nd dose, give TIIV. 15. WHAT IF A CHILD PRESENTS FOR LAIV AND THE PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE ? If a child presents for a 1st or 2nd dose of LAIV and the product is no longer available, offer TIIV. LAIV is the preferred product; however, TIIV may be given interchangeably if LAIV is not available. (12) Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 12 Children under 9 years of age who have not previously received seasonal influenza vaccine require 2 doses given 4 weeks apart. If the child has received 1 or more doses in any previous season, only a single dose is required. 16. IS THE EXPIRY DATE OF LAIV DIFFERENT FROM TIIV? The shelf -life of LAIV is considerably shorter than that of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIIV). The default expiry date of this product is NOT the last day of the month. Be sure to check the expiry date as vaccine lots received in BC will expire during the period of January through April 2014. All immunization service providers are asked to optimize planning of use to ensure that the product quantities allocated to your branch office are used up prior to expiry. 17. WHAT IF A CHILD RECEIVES AN EXPIRED DOSE OF LAIV? If an expired product is given inadvertently, the dose must be repeated. To ensure that a child is protected against the 3 seasonal influenza strains contained in the vaccine, offer a valid dose of LAIV on the same day the expired vaccine was given or as soon as the error is discovered. There is no minimum i nterval between an expired and a valid dose of LAIV as it is the same product being administered and protection against influenza should not be delayed. If the c hild or parent/guardian refuses to repeat LAIV administration, offer TIIV as an alternative . To document the administration of an expired dose, complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organization. EXPIRY DATE Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 13 18. WHAT ARE THE STEPS F OR INTRANASAL ADMINI STRATION OF LAIV? FLUMIST IS AN INTRANASAL SPRAY AND IS NOT FOR INJECTION. The product is provided in a 'sprayer' in a firm device that looks like a syringe with a tip protector at one end and a plunger with a dose divider clip at the other end. Details and accompanying diagram on how to administer the product are contained in the product monograph on page 11 and 12 and the accompanying text is reproduced below: 1. Remove the rubber tip protector. Do not remove the dose- divider clip at the other end of the sprayer. 2. With the recipient sitting upright, place tip of the sprayer just inside a nostril to ensure vaccine is delivered into the nose. 3. In one motion depress the plunger as rapidly as possible until the dose- divider clip prevents you from going further. 4. Pinch and remove the dose divider clip from the plunger. 5. Place the tip of the sprayer just inside the other nostril and with a single motion depress the plunger as rapidly as possible to deliver the rest of the vaccine. 19. HOW SHOULD THE SPRAY ER BE DISPOSED AF TER USE? The sprayer should be disposed of according to the standard procedures for medical waste (e.g.,) sharps container or biohazard container. (1) Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 14 20. CAN YOU PROVIDE AN I LLUSTRATION OF THE STEPS OF LAIV INTRANASAL ADMINISTRATION? ` Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 15 21. WHAT I F A CHILD SNEEZES RI GHT AFTER BEING IMMUNIZED WITH LAIV? Both NACI(3) and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)(13) support that if the vac cine recipient sneezes immediately after administration the dose should not be repeated. The binding of the virus to epithelial cells occurs very rapidly and there are more virus particles in the vaccine than are needed to establish immunity. Therefore sneezing or blowing your nose immediately after immunization with LAIV will not affect immunity.(11) 22. WHAT IF A CHILD RECE IVES BOTH HALF DOSES OF LAIV IN THE SAME NOSTRIL? It is recommended that LAIV be administered as 2 divided sprays (0.1 mL into each nostril) to maximize the vaccine's contact surface area of epithelial cells within the nasopharynx. No clinical trials have been conducted using a single- nostril administration. However, t here is no need to repeat immunization as each half dose (0.1 mL) contains enough viral particl es to induc e an immune response. (14) Complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organi zation. 23. WHAT IF DURING LAIV ADMINISTRATION A CHI LD IS SPRAYED IN THE EYE INSTEAD OF THE NOSTR IL? Immediately flush the area with water or saline; if irritation persists refer to physician to assess for possible conjunctivitis. If at least half of the LAIV dose (0.1 mL) was administered into the nostril the client does not need further vaccine at that time.(15) However, if the 1st half of the vaccine dose went into the eye, the 2nd half of the dose (0.1 mL) should be offered. If at that time the child or the parent/guardian does not want to attempt further administration of LAIV offer TIIV. Complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organization. 24. WHAT IF DURING LAIV ADMINISTRATION A CHI LD REFUSES THE 2ND HALF OF THE DOSE? Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 16 If a child refuses the 2nd half of the LAIV dose, attempt to give the 2nd half (0. 1 mL) of the LAIV dose in the other nostril. If you are unsuccessful there is no need to repeat immunization as each half dose (0.1 mL) of LAIV contains enough viral particl es to induce an immune response.(14) Complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organization. 25. DO I HAVE TO USE PER SONAL PROTECTIVE EQU IPMENT TO ADMINISTER LAIV? The use of personal protective equipment such as gloves and masks are not needed to administer FLUMIST\u00ae. Using routine practices, as when administering any immunization, is adequate in settings w here FLUMIST\u00ae is being given.(16) 26. WHAT ARE THE CONTRAI NDICATIONS TO RECEIP T OF LAIV? History of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine or to any component of FLUMIS T\u00ae. Egg allergy. Such individuals should receive inactivated influenza vaccine. Severe asthma or active wheezing (on high dose inhaled or oral steroids or medically attended wheezing in t he 7 days prior to vaccination) . (see questions 28, 29) Adults and children with immune compromising conditions . (see question 27) HCWs working with immunocompromised individuals . (see questions 27, 33, 34) Individuals less than 2 years of age or 60 years of age. (see questions 4, 14) Pregnancy . (see question 30) Individuals 2- 17 years of age receiving aspirin- containing therapy because of the association of Reye syndrome with aspirin and wild- type influenza infection. It is recommended that aspirin- containing products in children < 18 years of age be delayed for 4 weeks after receipt of FLUMIST\u00ae. History of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 8 weeks of receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine without another cause being identified. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 17 27. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF IMMUNO COMPROMISING CONDITIONS? Examples of i mmunoc ompromising conditions (17) include (but are not limited to): cancer immunodeficiency (including human immunodef iciency virus [HIV] infection) immunosuppression due to underlying disease or therapy (e.g., severe rheumatoid arthritis requiring immunosuppressive therapies) 28. CAN YOU DEFINE SEVER E ASTHMA? According to NAC I severe asthma is \"...defined as currently on oral or high dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids or active wheezing or those with medically -attended wheezing in the 7 days prior to vaccination.\" (3) High dose systemic ste roids interfere with vaccine induced immune responses (i.e., consider persons receiving 2 mg/kg per day or 20 mg daily of prednisone for more than 14 days duration to be immune -suppressed). Topical and locally injected steroids do not have an impact on vaccines unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of immunosuppression from such therapy.(17) According to the British Columbia Medical Ass ociation, high dose inhaled corticosteroids in p ediatric patients are those treated with 200 ug/day fluticasone (or equivalent ) because this high dosage may be associ ated with systemic side effects.(18) In children with asthma, if a parent or guardian of a child cannot identify a child's current dosage of oral or inhaled steroid, TIIV should be offered. 29. CAN A CHILD RECEIVING DAILY INTRANASAL STEROIDS FOR CONDITIONS OTHER THA N ASTHMA RECEIVE LAI V? Yes. Intranasal steroids typically used for treatment of allergic rhinitis are not a contraindication because the effects are local and not systemic. These products do not cause immunosuppression s o they are not a contraindication to LAIV. Topical and locally injected steroids do not have an impact on vaccines unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of immunosuppression from such therapy. (17) Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 18 30. WHAT ABOUT THE USE OF LAI V IN PREGNANT AND BREASTF EEDING WOMEN ? LAIV should not be administered to pregnant women because of the lack of safety data.(3) Although LAIV has not been studied in pregnant women, no unexpected patterns of pregnancy complications or fetal outcomes have been identified after the inadvertent administration of LAI V to pregnant women. In the event of an inadvertent administration of LAIV to a pregnant woman complete the required patient safety/vaccine error (e.g. Patient Safety Learning System) documentation within your organization. AstraZeneca does not maintain a reg istry for inadvertent administration of FLUMIST\u00ae to pregnant women. However, they do have an Adverse Event Reporting phone line ( 1- 800-668-6000) and e- mail ( medinfo.canada@astrazeneca.com ). It is not know n whether LAIV is excreted in human milk; however LAIV is not dicated breastfeeding women.(3) WHAT ARE THE potassium phosphate, monosodium glutamate. 32. SHOULD FAITH -BASED CLIENTS BE CON CERNED ABOUT THE GEL ATIN CONTENT IN LAIV? LAIV (FLUMIST\u00ae) contains porcine- type gelatin. Scholars from the Musl im and Jewish faiths have determined that receipt of gelatin in vaccines is permissible and does not constitute a violation of religious practice. Religious leaders' statements on the use of vaccin es containing porcine gelatin are available from: http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/Porcine- vaccineapproval.htm Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 19 33. ARE THERE PRECAUTION S TO THE RECEIPT OF LAIV? Severe oculo- respiratory syndrome (ORS) after previous r eceipt of an influenza vaccine is a precaution to the administration of LAIV. Also, v accine recipients should be informed that FLUMIST\u00ae is a vaccine that contains a weakened strain of influenza virus and could potentially be transmitted to another person through contact with respiratory secretions. An infection with this weakened virus could cause a serious infection in a small category of patients who are severely immunocompromised and receiving care in hospital in a protected environment (e.g., post bone marrow transplant). Both health care workers and close contacts of such patients should avoid contact with these patients for 2 weeks after getting FLUMIST\u00ae. If such co ntact cannot be avoided, offer TIIV instead of FLUMIST\u00ae. 34. CAN YOU PROVIDE ME W ITH MORE INFORMATION ON LAIV A ND VIRAL SHEDDING? Both children and adults can shed vaccine viruses after LAIV administration and studies have shown that younger children are more likely to shed and shed higher titers than older children and adults . Children may shed for a mean duratio n of 7.6 days and shedding is rare after day 11. (3) Viral shedding is not synonymous with transmission of vaccine virus. Shedding is generally bel ow levels needed to transmit infection, although in rare instances shed vaccine viruses can be transmitted from vaccine recipients to unvaccinated persons. Serious illness has not been reported among unvaccinated persons inadvertently infected with vaccine virus and no transmission of vaccine virus has ever been reported in a health care setting . (3) It is important to note that wild type influenza virus is a community acquired infection readily transmitted person to person through fomites and droplet contact during influenza season, wit h attack rates ranging from 5 to 25% depending on the severity of the season. The attenuated virus contained in the vaccine is a much weakened strain of influenza comp ared to wild influenza viruses. 35. ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL CONSIDER ATIONS FOR CO -ADMINISTRATI ON OF LAIV AND OTHER LIVE VACCINES? Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 20 As for other live vaccines, LAIV can be given concurrently with MMR and varicella vaccines to young children without reducing the immunogenicity or safety of any of the vaccines. If not given at the same visit, administ ration of LAIV and other live vaccines should be separated by at least 4 weeks to reduce or eliminate interference from the vaccine given 1 st on the vaccine given later. 36. ARE THERE ANY SPECIA L CONSIDERATIONS FOR A CHILD TAKING ANTIVIRAL MEDICATION S? LAIV should not be administered when taki ng antiviral agents because these drugs interfere with the immune response to FLUMIST\u00ae. FLUMIST\u00ae should not be administered to individuals while taking antiviral agents active against influenza (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Such individuals should receive inactivated influenza vaccine. If antiviral agents are administered from 48 hours before to 2 weeks after receipt of FLUMIST\u00ae, revaccinate when antiviral agents have been disc ontinued for at least 48 hours. 37. ARE THE RE ANY SPECIAL CONSI DERATIONS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF LAIV AND A TUBERCULO SIS (TB) SKIN TEST? No information on the effect of FLUMIST\u00ae on a tuberculosis ( TB) skin test is available. It is prudent to do TB skin testing on the same day as FLUMIST\u00ae immunization, or delay TB skin testing 4 weeks, to avoid having a false negative TB skin test result. This advice is extrapolated from the ex perience with measles vaccine. (19) 38. WHAT ARE THE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF LAIV? Most people have no reaction to the vaccine. Reactions that do occur are typically mild and last for 1 - 3 days. For children requiring 2 doses of vaccine, symptoms tend to be less frequent following the 2nd dose.(3) As with any immunization, unexpected or unusual side effects can occur, including anaphylaxis. Common Local Side Effec ts: Adults and C hildren - runny nose or nasal congestion. Common Systemic Side Effects : Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 21 Children - decreased appetite, weakness, headache, fever. Adults - headache, sore throat, cough, weakness. Oculo -respiratory syndrome (ORS). Fewer than 1 in 20 people may develop ORS and symptoms include : red eyes, a cough, and/or sore throat and/or hoarseness. 39. IS THERE A LIST OF SC REENING QUESTIONS FO R THE CONTRAINDICATIONS, P RECAUTIONS AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIO NS FOR LAIV ? Yes, a list of LAIV (FLUMIST\u00ae) scre ening questions is available for your use (see APPENDIX A ). However, you are not required to use this checklist as all the contraindications, precautions and special considerations for LAIV, are listed in the BCCDC Communic able Disease Control Manual . Please refer to the BC CDC Manual, Chapter II -Immunization Program, Section VII - Biological Products, Influenza Vaccine (Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV)), August 2013, p ages 33a- c. Available from: http://www.bccdc.ca/dis -cond/comm - manual/CDManualChap2.htm 40. SHOULD I ASK IF THE VACCINE RECIPIENT IS ALLERGIC TO ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THE LA IV BEFORE ADMINISTRA TION? No, it is unnecess ary for immunization providers to list each component of the vaccine to the recipient. Instead, when confirming eligibility for all vaccines, providers must inquire about any allergies that the recipient may have. Providers then must ensure that the recipi ent is not allergic to any component listed as a 'potential allergen' for that product in Section VII of the Immunization Manual . 41. HOW LONG DOES IT TAK E AFTER ADMINISTRATI ON OF LAIV FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO ACQUIRE PROTECTIVE IMMUNIT Y LEVELS? It takes about 2 weeks for the body to acquire full protection. This is why it is best that people get vaccinated before influenza activi ty starts each season. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 22 42. CAN LAIV BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN WHO ARE HOUSEHOLD CONTACTS OF SOMEONE WHO IS IM MUNOCOMPROMISED? Yes. LAIV is contraindicated only for those who are contacts of persons who are severely immunocompromised . Such severe immunocompromise is defined by NACI, \"as hospitalized and requiring care in a protected environment .\" As indicated in the health file, all vaccine recipients should be informed that LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae) is a live attenuated vaccine that contains a weakened strain of influenza virus and has the potential to be transmitted to another person through contact with respiratory secretions. Vaccine recipients should therefore avoid close contact with severely i mmunocompromised individuals for 2 weeks after receiving FLUMIST \u00ae. If such contact cannot be avoided, the injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluvir al\u00ae or Agriflu \u00ae) should be used. 43. CAN I GIVE THE LAIV TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED COMMON LOCAL SID E EFFECTS TO TIIV? Yes. If parents want their 2- 17 year old children to receive LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae), and the child meets the eligibility requirements outlined in Section VII of the BC Immunization Manual, LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae) can be given in place of the TIIV. Thi s would eliminate some potential side effects such as redness, warmth and s welling at the injection site. 44. CAN THE SIDE EFFECTS LISTED FOR LAIV OCCUR LATE? The side effects listed for this product are: Local: runny nose or nasal congestion. Systemic: decr eased appetite, weakness, headache, fever, sore throat, and cough. All of these are non- specific to the vaccine and may occur as a result of other causes such as the common cold. In clinical trials, nasal congestion was identified as the solicited event occurring most commonly. Events were solicited for the first 10 days following vaccine receipt, as this was the period deemed most plausible for such vaccine - associated adverse events. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 23 45. ARE THERE SUGGESTED POSITIONING TECHNIQU ES PARENTS CAN USE WITH CHIL DREN RECEIVING THE L AIV? For administration of the LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae), it is best that the child is seated comfortably, or positioned on a parent's lap if they prefer. They should not lie down nor do they need to tilt their head back. The provider should stabilize the child's chin. Any further restraint, such as of the arms for children expected to cover their nose, should be discussed with the parent and child at the clinic. Some options are that the parent or health care provider may apply slightly more pressure to stabilize the chin, or the forehead. If a child is seated on the parent's lap with their back and head against the parent's chest, this should be enough to avoid the child pulling back. 46. CAN A HCW WHO IS IMM UNOCOMPROMISED STILL ADMINISTER LAIV? Yes. LAIV (FLUMIST \u00ae) contains attenuated (weakened) influenza virus and is to be avoided only by those with such severe immunocompromise that they are \" hospitalized and requiring care in a protected environment .\" Standard precautions such as hand- washing or use of alcohol hand rubs before and after vaccine administration are recommended. Used sprayers should be discarded into a sharps co ntainer with biological waste. 47. CAN A PREGNANT HCW ADMINISTER THE LAIV? Yes. A pregnant woman can administer FLUMIST \u00ae; no special precautions are necessary. T he viruses in the nasal spray vac cine are attenuated or weakened. This means that the vaccine viruses would not cause influenza illness , even if a person inadvertently gets vaccine viruses in their nose. 48. WHAT IF SOM EONE RECEIVES THE LA IV LESS THAN 4 WEEKS AFTER RECEIPT OF ANOTHER L IVE VACCINE? If two live vaccines are not given on the same day and are given less than four weeks apart, consider the vaccine that was given second to be invalid. Repeat the vaccine that was given second a minimum of 28 days after it was given. This guideline is found in Section IV of the Immunization Manual and is applicable to the FLUMIST \u00ae vaccine. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 24 49. WHERE CAN THE PUBLIC ACCES S LAIV ? LAIV ( FLUMIST \u00ae) is available both publicly and privately. For individuals who are eligible for the publicly funded LAIV, it is available through public health units and through some family doctors. For those not eligible, it can be purchased privately at select travel clinics and pharmacies. To help locate a pharmacy that may sell FLUMIST \u00ae please refer to \"Clinic Notes\" within ImmunizeBC's Flu Clinic Locator. Please note that issues regarding access and availability of FLUMIST \u00ae are being addressed at the health authority level. Therefore, consult your local health authority on such related issues.

Do you have a history of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine or to any component of FLUMIST\u00ae ? 2. Do you have an allergy to eggs? 3. Do you have severe asthma (on high dose inhaled or oral steroids) or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days? 4. Are you immunocompromised due to disease or treatment? 5. Are you a health care worker (HCW) working with immunocompromised individuals? 6. Are you less than 2 years of age or older than 17 years of age? 7. Are you pregnant or could become pregnant in the next month? 8. Are you currently/have you received aspirin/containing therapy in the last 4 weeks? 9. Do you have a history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 8 weeks of receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine without anothe r cause being identified? PRECAUTIONS: 10. Do you have a history of severe oculo -respiratory syndrome (ORS) after previous receipt of an influenza vaccine? 11. Are you in contact with someone who is severely immunocompromised and receiving care in hospital in a protected environment? (e.g., post bone marrow transplant) SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: 12. Have you received any live vaccines in the past 4 weeks? 13. Are you currently/have you received anti -viral medications in the past 2 weeks? 14. Have you received a tuberculosi s (TB) skin test in the past 4 weeks? Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Questions and Answers for Health Care Providers 2013 - 2014 Revised November 25, 2013 Page 29 INFORMATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: LIVE ATTENUATED INFLUENZA VACCINE (FLUMIST\u00ae) SCREENING QUESTIONS CONTRAINDICATIONS: 1. LAIV is contraindicated for those with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine or to any component of FLUMIST\u00ae. 2. LAIV is contraindicated for individuals with an egg allergy. They should be offered trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIIV). 3. LAIV is contraindicated for individuals wi th severe asthma (on high dose inhaled or oral steroids) or medically attended wheezing in the 7 days; they should be offered TIIV. High dose inhaled corticosteroids in pediatric patients are those treated with 200 ug/day fluticasone (or equivalent). Hi gh dose oral corticosteroids are those treated with 2 mg/kg per day or 20 mg daily of prednisone for more than 14 days. 4. LAIV is contrain dicated for individuals immunoc ompromised due to disease or treatment. They should be offered TIIV. 5. LAIV is publicly funded for children aged 2 to 17 years old, inclusive and therefore it is unlikely that those eligible for this product will be Health Care Workers (HCWs). They should be offered TIIV. 6. In BC, LAIV is publicly funded for children aged 2 to 17 ye ars old, inclusive and LAIV is not approved for children < 24 months of age. Individuals not eligible for LAIV should be offered TIIV. 7. LAIV is contraindicated for pregnant women because of the lack of safety data. They should be offered TIIV. 8. LAIV is contraindicated for individuals receiving aspirin -containing therapy. They should be offered TIIV. It is recommended that use of aspirin- containing products in children < 18 years of age be delayed for 4 weeks after receipt of LAIV . 9. LAIV is contrai ndicated for individuals with a history of Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 8 weeks of receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine without another cause being identified. PRECAUTIONS: 10. A history of severe oculo -respiratory syndrome (ORS) after previous receipt of an influenza vaccine is a precaution to the receipt of LAIV. 11. LAIV is a vaccine that contains a weakened strain of influenza virus and could potentially be transmitted to another person through contact with respiratory secretions. An infection with this weakened virus could cause a serious infection in a small category of patients who are severely immunocompromised and receiving care in hospital in a protected environment. Both health care workers and close contacts of such patients should avoid contact with these patients for 2 weeks after getting LAIV . If such contact cannot be avoided they should be offered TIIV. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: 12. LAIV can be given concurrently with other live vaccines. If no t given at the same visit, administration of LAIV and other live vaccines should be separated by at least 4 weeks. 13. LAIV should not be administered when taking antiviral agents because they interfere with the immune response to LAIV. They should be offered TIIV. LAIV should not be administered to individuals while taking antiviral agents active against influenza (oseltamivir and zanamivir). If antiviral agents are administered from 48 hours before to 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV, revaccinate when antivira l agents have been discontinued for at least 48 hours. 14. Do tuberculosis (TB) skin testing on the same day as LAIV immunization, or delay tuberculosis (TB) skin testing 4 weeks, to avoid having a false negative TB skin test result. "}
