We are also citizens of the world, for during that rst year of life we try out\u2014at rst ten-tatively and then uproariously\u2014every sound and sound com-bination used anywhere in the world. We experiment with softvowels, necessary for Polynesia; dramatic consonants, ready forthe Czech Republic; sounds that are heard only in furthestMongolia; even, perhaps, tongue-clicking like the Bushmen ofthe Kalahari Desert. None of them gives us any trouble. At thebeginning we are geniuses of language. However, our babbling leads us through syllables to words. We begin to name the beloved, necessary presence that is mama or mami or ma-ma-ma, reaching out to her and to the othersaround us. The world begins to become our world; with our mother tongue we become citizens of a fatherland. Speech hasnow a social character. In our naming there is an immediateunderstanding of word and meaning; sound and object are one.How could our Mama be any other person, or Dog any otherdog? \"Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowls of the airand to every beast of the eld.\" We were still in Adam's paradise. Karl K\u00f6nig tells us, \"At this stage, speech awakens to itself and begins to unfold. . . . The child plays with speech and itswords as if with the most beautiful golden balls that are thrownto him to possess.\" 1 Rudolf Steiner's references to the \"Genius 1. Karl K\u00f6nig, The First Three Years of the Child (Spring Valley, NY: Anthro- posophic Press, 1969), p. 39.front Black 10 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 10 of Language\" in the six lectures contained in this book urge us to realize the transcendent quality of the realm of speech. Adelicate echo sounds through the mysterious phrase: In theBeginning was the Word. In his many lectures on language 2 Rudolf Steiner added a further dimension to the speech process. The rst step of thecontinuing metamorphosis during a child's rst three years, hepointed out, is actually the transformation of the baby's ges-tures and movements of the limbs into the movements of thelarynx, bringing forth sounds of speech. This is a matter ofhard work cheerfully undertaken by those small creatures\u2014even the totally deaf\u2014in their rst year. The next step, duringthe second and third years, is what many child psychologistsnow recognize as the \"internalizing of the language for the pro-cesses of thinking.\" K\u00f6nig gives a remarkable image of this:\"Speech is the plough that works the eld of the soul so thatthe seeds of future thought achievement can be laid into theopen furrows.\" 3 A similar metamorphosis in the development of language belongs to the history of humankind as a whole. Gesture lan-guage came before spoken language. Consonants describinghappenings of nature preceded vowels that gave voice to innerfeelings. Words with a physical meaning (grasp, gather, gure,weigh, for instance) became abstract. We grasp an idea today far more often than we do a hammer or axe. Imaginative phrases(\"glued love,\" \"kingly legs\") have fallen out of use. Rudolf Steiner gave the lectures in this book to the teachers of the rst Waldorf School, which had been established underhis guidance for the children of factory workers in 1919. His 2.

K\u00f6nig, op. cit.front Black 11 Introduction 11 words were not intended merely to give a foundation for the language classes4 in the school\u2014which of course they did\u2014 but more importantly, to encourage every single teacher in thefaculty to work with language, enliven their classes with it,and bring the children to reverence for its place in life. This,certainly, is an ever-increasing task for all Waldorf schools. Gertrude Teutsch, artist and art teacher in San Diego, Cali- fornia, rst translated these lectures for the use of the teachersat Highland Hall, a Waldorf school in Los Angeles. It was agifted labor of love done on the fly and blessed with her ownquirky humor as well as a rm understanding of languagedevelopment. A limited distribution reached the few Waldorfschools in existence in the early 1950s. Now there are over 100Waldorf schools in this country and almost as many in theother English-speaking countries around the world. Manymore are being founded every year, bringing their ideas andinsights into the public schools as well. In this new publicationthe Language Lectures will be of far-reaching importance. The English language, of course, has its deepest roots\u2014its Anglo-Saxon heritage\u2014in the old Germanic languages thatreach back to the runes of the third century and the Gothic ofBishop Ullas of the fourth century. In this book, when RudolfSteiner traces modern German words back to Gothic or OldHigh German, we realize that the same history can be followedback through north Germanic to Scandinavian languages orthrough west Germanic to Modern English and Dutch. Wehave tried to point out these common relationships, so that for 4. In 1919 the Waldorf School inaugurated the new and valuable method of beginning two foreign languages in the rst grade, playfully at rst, withenthusiasm and discipline carrying them through every grade of the elemen-tary school. In high school one language is usually carried on alone. Greekand Latin are given in the fth and sixth grades, but continued several yearsonly in Europe.front Black 12 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 12 our non-German speaking readers Steiner's examples will not seem at all exotic. He refers often to English words and theEnglish language. The rules of the game, we nd, are universal.Whatever has been added by the translators is placed in brackets . Single word or phrase translations are in single quotations. May these printed pages begin to speak forth in ringing tones to every reader! RUTH PUSCH March 1994front Black 13 Introduction 13 A NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR Rudolf Steiner was asked to give these lectures to the Waldorf teachers in Stuttgart while giving the so-called Light-Course(GA 320).* Not only did he teach a scientic course with onlya minimum of equipment, but he was also willing to improvisea course on language, requested by the teachers only on hisarrival in Stuttgart. In fact a third course is hidden in the second one\u2014Steiner gave the secret away only at the end. The course as a whole canbe seen as a demonstration, a practical introduction to teach-ing, a \"Methods\" course. In Steiner's characteristic way, it wasflexible, expandable, alive. I considered it a privilege to be able to make available to the teachers this work on a subject so close to my own heart. It wasa translation \"from the page into the machine.\" If it is nowavailable in a more formal and permanent form, the thanks goto Ruth Pusch who has edited it, formulated the introduction,and has seen it through to completion. Due to her efforts, andskills, it will now be available to every language-lover. Thanksalso are due to Christopher Bamford and Anthroposophic Pressfor seeing the value of this lecture series and undertaking thepublication.

At such short notice and with ourlimited time, this will have to be rather sketchy, certainly moreso than with our scientic course. And you will have to haveeven more forbearance than you did for my remarks on \"light,\"because what I say about language will simply be improvised. AllI can do is to give you a few useful suggestions for your teachinghere in the Waldorf School and also for teaching in general. Perhaps we can nd what we're after by rst looking at some elements of language from an historical standpoint. Whatever Ican bring together somewhat loosely today will be an introduc-tion to further discussion during the rest of the time. We can see especially in German how the development of a people's language expresses also the development of its soullife. We must keep clearly in mind, however, that the rela-tionship of individuals to their own language varies from cen-tury to century. The further we go back in the history of apeople, the more life we nd in everything pertaining to lan-guage, within the forces of the human soul as well as in thepliant forces of the human body. I have often been aware ofthis; you will nd as you go through my books a quite con-scious attempt to use terms of Germanic derivation, even in1lect Black 16 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 16 philosophical matters.1 This is frowned upon by many of my detractors, who condemn exactly what has been done veryconsciously with languages in my books. It is extremely dif-cult nowadays to nd in German the inner, living forces ableto continue forming the language. It is particularly difcultto nd semantic correspondences by picking up some little-used word or extending the forms of a common one, as forinstance I tried to do with the word kraften [The German noun Kraft 'force, strength' and noun das Kraften 'actively working force or strength'.] I tried with this to put action into what is usually expressedmore passively. Other words I have also attempted, but\u2014onlyone century since Goethe\u2014it is already difcult to coin thefar-reaching new words that will express precisely what we aretrying to incorporate into our age as a new kind of thinking. We can hardly remember that the word Bildung 'education, training, formation' goes back no further than the time ofGoethe (1749-1832). Before that, there existed no educated(gebildete ) people in Germany. That is, we did not speak of someone as ein gebildeter Mensch 'a person of culture, well-edu- cated'. Even in the second half of the eighteenth century theGerman language had still kept a strong, sculptural vitality, sothat it was possible to form such words as Bildung or even Weltanschauung 'world view', a term that also appeared after Goethe's time. One is indeed very fortunate to live in a lan-guage milieu that permits such new formations. This good for-tune is evident when one's books are translated into French, 1. In German, we nd two words for many things, as in English: willandtes- tament ,send and transmit , etc., one Germanic (Anglo-Saxon), the other Greco-Latin. In academic writing, the latter is usually preferred.1lect Black 17 Lecture One 17 English, and other languages and one hears about the difcul- ties. T ranslators are working by the sweat of their brow as bestthey can, but always, when a person nishes something,another nds it horrible and no one else nds it any good.When you go into the matter more closely, it's clear that manythings in my books simply can't be said in the same way inanother language. I tell people: In German everything and any-thing is right; you can put the subject rst or in the middle orat the end of the sentence\u2014it will be more or less correct. Thepedantic, dogmatic rule that something absolutely can't be saidin a certain way does not yet exist in German as it does in thewestern languages. Imagine what we have come to when we'relimited to stereotyped expressions! People cannot yet think asindividuals but only in a sort of group spirit about the thingsthey want to communicate to others. That is preeminently thecase with the people of the western civilizations: They think instereotyped phrases. Actually, the German language in particular shows that what I would like to call the GENIUS OF LANGUAGE has gradually become rigid, and that German in our time is also approachingthe state where we can't escape the stereotyped phrases. Thiswas not so in Goethe's time and even less so in earlier ages. It ispart of the picture of the whole language development in Cen-tral Europe. Not so long ago this Central Europe, stretching far to the East, was still inhabited by a primitive people with great spiri-tual gifts but with a relatively simple outward culture, one thatevolved substantially from trade and the economic life. Thenroundabout, by way of the East Germanic tribes at rst, muchof the spiritual culture of Greece was absorbed. Through this, agreat many Greek words entered the Germanic languages ofCentral Europe that later became modern German. During thecenturies when Christianity spread from the South to the1lect Black 18 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 18 North, its concepts, ideas, and images brought along an enor- mous quantity of vocabulary, because the Germanic tribes hadno available expressions in their own languages for suchthings. The word segnen 'to bless', for instance, is one of the words that came with Christianity. The specic concept of \"blessing\"did not exist in northern Germanic heathendom. There wereindeed magic charms and they contained a magic power, butthis was not of the same nature as a blessing. Segnen , the verb from the noun Segen , was taken into the language under the influence of Christianity; the word brought northward wassignum , a 'sign'. Do observe what the genius of language still possessed at that time: language-forming strength! Nowadayswe are no longer able to reconstruct and rework an adoptedword in such a way that signum could become Segen , a bless- ing. We would treat the adopted word as an unchangedimport, because the force and vitality that once transformedand created from the innermost depths simply do not well upany more. Many words we take as completely German are in fact intruders; they appeared with Christianity. Look at the wordpredigen 'preach'. It is none other than the Latin praedicare , which also means 'to preach'. It was still possible to reconstructthis word from inside out. We never had a genuinely Germanword for this Christian activity of preaching. You see, if wewant to get to know the actual force in German that transformsthe language, we must rst pour it through a sieve to sift outeverything that entered our Central European culture fromother cultural streams. In many of our words you will hardlynotice it. You speak about the Christmas festival, feeling astrong attachment to it. Weihnacht 'Holy Night, Christmas' is a genuine German word, but Fest 'festival' is Roman, a Latin word that long ago became a German word. Fest goes back to1lect Black 19 Lecture One 19 the time when, along with Christianity, the most foreign ele- ments found their way into the language, but at the same timewere so transformed that we do not have at all the feeling todaythat they are imports. Who in the world remembers now thatverdammen 'condemn, damn' is a Latin word that has become good German? We have to sift a great deal if we want to get towhat is really the German language proper. Many things came in with Christianity; others have entered because out of Christianity the whole system of educationdeveloped. The subject matter for educating was taken over inexactly the form it had in the South in the Greco-Latin culture.And there were no Germanic words for what had to be com-municated. Along with the concepts, the vocabulary had to beimported. This happened rst in the \"Latin school\" (highschool), then it moved down into the lower school, and sotoday the basis of our education, the Schule 'school', itself is an imported word. Schule is no more a German word than scholas- ticism .Klasse 'class' is obviously a foreign word. cognate, scribe are imports. Everything pertaining to school entered our language from outside; it came\u2014with edu-cation itself\u2014with Latin or the Romance languages from theSouth. All this is one stratum that we have to sift off if we want to study the character of the German language proper. Almost allthe specically foreign words must be lifted off, because they donot express what comes out of the German folk soul but havebeen poured over its real being, forming a kind of varnish on itssurface. We have to look for what lies underneath the surface.For instance, if we look beneath the varnish for things pertain-ing to education; we nd relatively little, but that much is dis-tinctive: Lehrer 'teacher', for one, a genuinely original German word, as is the word Buchstabe 'letter of the alphabet'\u2014 Buch1lect Black 20 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 20 'book' is derived from it. It takes us back to the staves or sticks thrown down in ancient times to form the letters or runes thatmade up the runic words. They were beechwood sticks ( Buche = 'beech'). From this then together', from which comes lesen 'to pick up', well as 'to read' and then the Leser 'reader', which became Lehrer 'teacher'. These are ancient Germanic formulations, but you see that they have atotally different character, leading us back everywhere to the soullife of that time in Central Europe. The old heathen ways andthe Christian ways collided, and with them the two elements oflanguage, the northern and the southern. You can imagine whata strong power of interpenetration must have existed within theGerman language during the rst millennium after the Mysteryof Golgotha, that it could accept Christianity as strongly as itdid and be at the same time able to accept the words thatexpressed the most essential mysteries of Christianity. With this import, however, only one layer has been described, leading us back into the very early times connectedwith the great Germanic migrations, when the rst Romancelanguage stratum worked its way into the German language.Later the Romance languages were again to exert their influ-ence. We can observe a second stratum originating from theRomance languages through various occurrences but this timecoming from the West. Beginning in the twelfth century andcontinuing into the eighteenth, French words were taken overcontinually, French words for which there existed conceptsand feelings, but by means of which the concepts and feelingswere also modied. I have jotted down a number of thesewords but cannot claim any sort of completeness, for theselectures are being improvised from memory. I have tried totake words that seem truly German: for instance, the wordfein 'ne'. You won't nd this word before the twelfth century; it came by way of n from the French. Here you can see how1lect Black 21 Lecture One 21 the language-forming power in the thirteenth century was still strong enough to transform a word so well that it is felt todayto be a genuine German word. Even a word like Kumpan 'fel- low, companion', which has become very popular, is only anadaptation of compagnon , and a word we often hear nowadays, Partei 'political party' also immigrated at that time, as well as T anz 'dance'. All these words have been in the German lan- guage only since the second invasion of the twelfth century,which I would like to call and so forth. It is quite remarkable how many words came into Germany fromthe West, from France, during the twelfth and through thethirteenth, fourteenth, fteenth, and sixteenth centuries, all ofthem contributing to the language an element of lightness, ofeasiness, where the German had a more ponderous quality.Before this time what had been spoken in German areas had afuller, more rounded character. In it one couldn't very well haveexpressed playfulness. It would have been quite easy to say, Du bist ein k\u00fchner Held 'You are a bold hero'\u2014the German lan- guage have managed that\u2014but not, Du bist ein feiner Kerl'You're a ne fellow'. That could not have been said earlier, for one needed the word fein. Other things would have been just as impossible without the invasion of the French elements. From Italy, remarkably little reached the more northern areas until, at the time of the Renaissance, some words relating tomusic came; that was all. However, a third kind of invasion,though not so pervasive, came later by way of a detour throughsouthern Germany and Austria, bringing such words as bizarr 'odd, eccentric', lila 'purple', [obviously related to earlier in German, Neger 'negro', Tomate 'tomato', all imported from Spain. Now the introduction offoreign elements enters a new phase; it is obvious that thegenius of language is no longer as flexible as it had been. These1lect Black 22 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 22 later words are much more similar to their originals. And nally, when the Germans reached the stage of admittingEnglish words, things had become most unfavorable; this wasactually not until the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centu-ries. Words came into the language that related mostly to outeraffairs, but they remained practically the same as in English.The German language genius had by then lost its capacity toadapt and completely absorb into itself something new. I have tried to point out how in early times the ability to accept and transform language was extraordinarily strong,especially within the Germanic languages and early German.Take, for instance, (and I want to emphasize this in particular)a word that is so German that even a person very sensitive todialects can really not doubt as the tongue tastes and pronounces it! And yet this word wasnot part of the German language until the time when Latin-Italian trained architects used the kind of materials that couldconstruct the Riegelw\u00e4nde . Who is aware today that this word Riegel , so typically German, is nothing other than Regel, regula Latin: 'rule'. We would not be capable of such changes in ourpresent language. We also think Keller 'cellar' is an original German word, but no! It is nothing but an adapted loan-wordfrom the Latin cellarium . I can give you another totally Ger- man-looking word to show you how difcult it would havebeen if people had begun to weed out and eliminate all theforeign words, as certain movements some time ago wanted todo. If that had happened, Riegel would have fallen by the way- side, Keller would have fallen\u2014but do you know what other word would have had to go? Schuster 'shoemaker'! As a matter of fact, Schuster came into the German language because peo- ple from the South taught the Germans to sew their foot-cov- erings instead of tying them together. The Latin sutor (cf.1lect Black 23 Lecture One 23 English: suture ) refers to the sewing of footwear and has been assimilated into Schuster , an all-out foreign word. You can see from this that we really have to sift vigorously to arrive at words of true German origin. We can not just acceptwhat is floating nowadays on the surface of language, for thisfollows totally different laws. When we want to go back to thetrue speech-creating forces out of the genius of language, wemust rst of all sift off what is extraneous. The forming of lan-guage takes its course in a peculiar sort of way. You can see thisvery well by observing how things can still be introduced into alanguage\u2014I would like to call it, through a certain kind of tyr-anny, from the bottom up\u2014even when the language-forminggenius no longer possesses its full strength. Not so many yearsago, for instance, the following took place in Central Europe.Close to Raab there is a small town called Kocsi [now Kocs inHungary]. I believe it was in the sixteenth century that aninventive fellow in this small place near Raab got the idea ofbuilding practical wagons that became very popular for peopleto drive and ride in. They made the little town well known.And just as Frankfurt sausages are known as 'frankfurters', thesewagons were called kocsi. Just think how much carrying force was alive in this word, which grew into Kutsche 'coach'; it trav- eled to France and even reached the proud English! Yet thisword is not especially old; it has moved in relatively recenttimes with a certain dynamic power in all directions from thewagonmaker in Kocs. So let us understand this clearly: When we deal with a lan- guage already formed, we must remove many outer layers inorder to reach the kernel proper. If we do reach this innermostpart, we have to say: This kernel shows us without a doubt thatit could develop with inner, language-forming strength only atthe time when thoughts were much deeper and more substan-tive than they are, for instance, in German culture today. For1lect Black 24 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 24 this to happen, thoughts must be much more inherent in the whole human being. At the present time we can no longer feelthat the force we perceive in our thoughts is also present in ourwords. Sometimes we feel this force when we go back to the dialects that are to be found at a deeper, earlier stage of the language. Atpresent, to express quickness we say Blitz 'lightning'. In certain southern German dialects the word is still Himmlizer . When you say that, you have the whole Blitzform 'shape of the light- ning' in it: \u2014 lizer reminds one of licht, 'light']. In this word there is a visualization of what takes onform in nature. In short, dialects still reach back to word-formswithin which there is an echo of the happenings outside us innature. This is always the case in the inmost kernel of a lan-guage, where the conceptual or ideational element is muchcloser to the element of sound. Through the history of the Ger-man language in particular we can observe how in earlier times,before language became abstract, it was still a matter of coursethat the meaning of words was imbedded in their sound. Iwould like to call it a penetration of sense into sound . A sensitive person can still feel it in such words as Ta g'day'; Anglo-Saxon, daeg, a truly original, ancient German word\u2014can feel it in the /t/ and /a:/ (/ah/) sounds, especially through the help ofeurythmy. Words that came later were formed out of abstractideas. Look at the rather modern given name Leberecht 'live- right'. Parents endow a child with such a name in order toguide him or her with certainty along a virtuous path in life.There's also Traugott 'trust-God'. When such words came about, a certain language-forming element still existed but itwas abstract, did not arise from a genuine inner source. I wanted to say all this today as a preparation, so that we can proceed toward more concrete concepts and examples oflanguage.2lect Black 25 Lecture Two 25 LECTURE TWO The Evolution of Language from an Organic Point of View IWOULD like to repeat what I told you yesterday: Please don't expect too much content from this very brief languagestudy. I will make only a few remarks about the development oflanguage in this improvised course. However, it is certainlyworthwhile to stir up some thoughts on the subject, and per-haps from the way I present things, you will discover guide-lines. I won't go into the usual facts, but I will try to show youa number of important ways to look at the life of language witha view to its organic evolving. In my rst lecture I referred to the development of our Ger- man language through \"invasions\" into its word-stock. Wepointed to the signicant one, which coincided with thestreaming in of Christianity into northern cultures, and itsconsequences. Christianity did not simply bring in its owncontent; it brought this content in the form of word images.Considered outwardly, the folk religions of the northern andcentral European peoples were not at all similar to what cameto them as a new religion; nor was it possible for them to graspthe content of Christianity with the words and sounds ofnorthern and central Europe. Therefore, those who broughtChristian concepts and Christian perceptions also broughttheir \"word clothing.\" We have cited a group of such words2lect Black 26 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 26 that were carried northward, we can say, on the wings of Chris- tianity. In the same way, everything connected with schoolingstreamed northward, too, words like Schule 'school' itself, T afel 'blackboard', and so forth, with the exception of a few likeLesen, Buchstabe, Lehrer (see Lecture 1, pages 19-20). The former are of Latin origin, but have been integrated into theGerman language organization so thoroughly that no onetoday would recognize them as loan-words. I also describedhow later, beginning in the twelfth century, a new invasionarrived from the West, bringing in many language elements.After that came a Spanish wave and nally one from England,as late as the nineteenth century. These examples will be elaborated on later, but they indicate that during the time Christianity and everything related to itwere making their way northward, the genius of the languagewas still able to accept and transform it inwardly by means of thefolk sensitivity in that region. I illustrated this unique fact not bya word pertaining to Christianity but by the connection of theword Schuster 'shoemaker', which seems so truly Germanic, with sutor: it is one and the same word (page 22-23). There was still so much speech-forming strength in the genius of the Germanicfolk that it was possible to transform a word like sutor that belongs to the earliest invasion. The further we proceed fromthis to the next invasion, which was concerned with education,the more we nd the sound of the word in German closer to thesound in Latin. And so it continued. Languages flowing in laterfound the German language spirit ever less capable of transform-ing whatever came toward it. Let us keep this in mind. Itremains to be seen whether, in due time, such phrases as ve o'clock tea will be changed; that is, whether the German language genius can develop over a relatively long span of time the powerof more rapid transformation it possessed in early times. We willhave to wait and see. At the moment, it is not important.2lect Black 27 Lecture Two 27 We must ask ourselves what signicance it has for a people that its language-forming power is decreasing, at least tempo-rarily; that in fact it no longer exists as it once was. You do nd itmore strongly today in dialects. For instance, we could search forthe origin of a very strange word in the Austrian dialect: pak- schierli orbakschierli . The Austrians sitting here certainly it. You can quickly sense what pakschierli means: 'a cunning little girl who bobs strangers', a'charming little 'funny little thing of marzipan' that doesn't exactly make you laugh, butcauses an inward state of being ready, if the impression you getgrows a little, to burst out in a loud laugh. ' A funny little thingmade of marzipan'\u2014that's pakschierli . Now what is this word? It is not really connected with the rest of the Austrian dialect, for itis none other than the German word possierlich 'funny, cunning, cute', a word that has been transformed. In a way, then, this language-forming power can be studied in the dialects. It is also a good approach to the active, creative folksoul, and an understanding of the folk soul would contributeimmeasurably toward an understanding of the cultural life of acountry. It would lead back to what I referred to in The Spiritual Guidance of the Individual and Humanity , 1 which was ridiculed by such minds as the all-too well-known Professor Dessoir.2 Spiritual science makes it possible to determine clearly what Idescribed there: that the formation of consonant sounds in lan-guage is connected to an imitation of something externally per-ceptible. Consonants express for us what we have experiencedinwardly of outside events. To put it more graphically: If you are 1.

Max Dessoir (1867-1947). kritischer Betrachtung (Stuttgart, 1917).2lect Black 28 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 28 setting in a fence post, you can feel this action inwardly by bear- ing down ( aufstemmen , as 'stem' for skiers) on your foot. This is the perception of your own act of will. We no longer feel thisinner act of will in the sound [st, pronounced sht] of aufstem- men, but in the early age of language development, you did feel in your acts of will an imitation of what was happening outsideyourself. The consonant element has thus become the imitationof events outside the human being, while the vowel elementexpresses what is truly an inner feeling. 'Ah!' is our astonish-ment, a standing back, in a sense. The relationship of thehuman being to the outer world is expressed in the vowels. It isnecessary to go back a long way in time if one wants to pene-trate to these things, but it is possible to do so; then one arrivesat the insight that such theories as the \"bow-wow\" or \"ding-dong\" theories are horribly wrong. They are incorrect andsupercial. An understanding of the human being, however, canlead us toward discovering inwardly how a speech sound is con-nected with whatever we want to reveal of soul and spirit. Let usconsider this as a question to ask ourselves, in order to ndanswers during the course of this study. In order to look rightlyat the many and varied links in the chain of language, I will tryto nd characteristic examples to help us reach what we are try-ing to understand. Today I should like to take some examples to show how lan- guage proceeds slowly from the concrete to the abstract. If wereally want to study actual facts, turning to dialect again will behelpful. Let me mention one small example: When Austrian peasants get up in the morning, they will say something about their Nachtschlaf 'night sleep' but not at all as you are apt to speak about it. You think of it basically as some-thing quite abstract, for you are educated people. Austrian peas-ants are close to nature. To them, all that surrounds thempartakes of spirit and soul, and they have a strong awareness of2lect Black 29 Lecture Two 29 it. Even for them this is dying out now, but in the seventies and eighties of the last century, it was still very much present for any-one who, like me, wished to observe it. Even though peasantsmay still perceive the elemental forces in everything aroundthem, they will never express it in abstractions but always con-cretely. A peasant will say, 'I have to wipe the night sleep(Nachtschlaf ) out of my eyes!' To peasants the substance excreted from the eyes during the night that can be washed away,is the visible expression of sleep; they call it Nachtschlaf . To understand language that was still quite alive a short time ago,there is this secret: a factual understanding is not at all hinderedby nding spiritual elements linked up with it. Austrian peasantsare in fact thinking of an elemental being, but they express thisby describing its action, that it put an excretion into their eyes.Never would they take this word as the abstraction arrived at byan educated person. However, if peasants have gone to school alittle while or have been exposed to the city, they have a way ofaddressing themselves to an invisible, concrete fact. They willstill say, 'I must wipe the night sleep out of my eyes,' but at thesame time they will make a sort of gesture to imply that for themit is something really supercial and yet concrete. We should be aware that such an observation leads us to realize that an abstract term always points back to somethingmore concrete. Take the following example. In the Scandina-vian countries you still nd the word barn for 'child' [Scotland and northern England, bairn ]; we no longer have it in Ger- man. What is its history? On one hand, it leads us back to theGothic; we will nd it in Ullas's Bible translation, 3 where we nd the expression bairan , meaning 'to bear'. If we know the 3. Ullas or Wulla (Little Wolf) 331-383. Bishop of the Goths. He is said to have invented the alphabet he used in order to translate the Bible. It is ouronly remnant of the Gothic language, which became extinct in 400 A.D.2lect Black 30 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 30 law of consonant shift, discovered by Jakob Grimm,4 for the Germanic languages and for all those related to them [see lec-ture 3, page 41-42], we will go back from the Gothic bairan to phero in Greek and fero in meaning 'to carry' or 'to bear'. A /b/ in Germanic appears in Greek and Latin as /f/ or/ph/. Bairan is simply a Germanic sound-shift from fero; the word widens out into a different direction. There exists theOld High German word beran , 'to carry' [ also the of English 'to bear'. The barrow of 'wheelbarrow' goes back to beran .]. Gradually the verbal aspect of the word receded; in modern German we no longer havethe possibility of thinking back to the original, strongly felt,active meaning. Why is the child called barn in Scandinavia? Because it is being borne or carried before it comes into theworld. A child is something that is carried: we look back at ourorigin. The only word left over from all this in modern Ger-man is geb\u00e4ren 'to bear, give birth'. But we do have something else\u2014we have retained the sufx -bar. fruchtbar and other words. What is kostbar ?\u2014that which car- ries a cost. What is fruchtbar ?\u2014that which bears fruit. It was expressed very graphically, not as an abstraction as it would betoday, for the actual carrying, bearing was visualized. You can imagine this quite vividly when you say something is becoming ruchbar 'known', 'notorious', not always in the most positive sense; literally, 'smell bearing'. When a smell isbeing carried toward you, a matter is becoming ruchbar . For 4. Jakob Grimm (1785--1863), German philologist and creator of Grimm's law. Interested principally in the relationship between the various Germaniclanguages, he was one of the great founders of comparative philology. Hewrote German Grammar, German Mythology and\u2014with his brother Wil- helm\u2014the famous collection of German folk and household tales. TheBrothers Grimm also planned and inaugurated the great German dictionary.2lect Black 31 Lecture Two 31 many words like this we should be able to nd the clear, direct imagery that in ancient times characterized the language-form-ing genius. I will write down for you a phrase from Ullas's Bible trans- lation: jah thus.' [Note qath cwaeth/ quoth .] takes us tomiton , meaning roughly 'to think'. In Old High German it grew into something different: mezz\u00f4n ; related to this is the word mezzan which means messen 'to measure'. Measuring, the outer visible act of measuring, experienced inwardly, simplybecomes thinking. Thus an action carried out outside ourselveshas provided the foundation for the word thinking . 'I am thinking' actually means: 'I am measuring something in mysoul'. This in turn is related to the Latin word meditor and the Greek medomai , which have given us 'meditate'. Whenever we go back in time and observe the genius of lan- guage at work, we nd this presence of imagery, but we mustalso try to observe it with inner understanding. You all knowthe term Hagestolz 'a conrmed bachelor'; you know its approximate meaning today. However, the connection of thisword with what it meant formerly is very interesting. It goesback to the word Hagestalt , in which the word Stalt is embed- ded [modern German retained only the word Gestalt : 'gure, form, stature']. What is Stalt? It is a person who has been put, placed, or 'stood' somewhere. According to medieval custom,the oldest son inherited the farm; the younger son got only thehedged-in eld, the Hag. The younger son, therefore, who only owned the Hag , was placed or 'stood' in this fenced-in eld,2lect Black 32 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 32 and was often not able to marry. The stalt is the owner. The 'hedge' owner is the Hagestalt . As awareness of the word stalt gradually disappeared, people turned staltintostolz (proud). It has no connection with the modern word stolz (proud); there is simply a resemblance of sounds. But an awareness of this stalt 'placed or stood' can be found in other, older examples still inexistence, for instance in the Oberufer Nativity Play. 5 One of the innkeepers says I als ein Wirt von placed here\u2014take full charge in my house]. Peo-ple think he means physical stature, but what he really means is'placed in this respected house, stood here. . . .' With the words that follow, \"Take full charge,\" he means that he attracts hisguests. There is still the consciousness in G'stalt of what origi- nally was in Hagestalt . We should follow with our whole inner being the development of words and sounds in this way, inorder to ponder inwardly the unusual and delicate effects of thegenius of language. In the New Testament, describing how the disciples were astonished at Christ's healing of the man sick of the palsy,Ullas uses a word in his translation related to silda-leik =selt- sam-leich 'seldom-like'. Considering the way Ullas uses this word in the context of his Bible translation, we discover that hemeans here\u2014for what has been accomplished by Christ\u2014 das Seltsamgestaltete 'that which has been formed miraculously'. It is the bodily-physical element that arouses astonishment at thispoint. This is expressed more objectively in silda-leik . In the word leik we must sense: it is the gestalt , the form, but as an image. If the word gestalt were used in the earlier sense, it would be to express 'being placed'. The form (Gestalt today), as 5. A.C. Harwood, Christmas Plays from Oberufer (Bristol, England: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1993).2lect Black 33 Lecture Two 33 it earlier was felt, described the image of a thing and was expressed by leik. We have this word in leichnam 'corpse'. A corpse is the image of what was once there. It is a subtle expres-sion when you sense what lies in this Leich , how the Leich is not a human being but the 'likeness' of one. There are further examples I can bring you for the develop- ment of terms springing from visual imagery to express a qual-ity of soul. We learn from Ullas that in the Gothic language'bride' is br\u00fbths . This bruths in the Bible translation is closely related to 'brood' ( Brut), so that when a marriage is entered upon, the brood is being provided. The \"bride\" is the one who ensures the 'brood'. Well then, what is the Br\u00e4utigam (the 'bridegroom')? Something is added to the bride; this is inGothic , in Old High German gomo [in Anglo-Saxon, guma ], derived by consonant shift from the Latin word homo , 'man', 'the man of the bride', the man who for his part providesfor the brood [the addition of /r/ in the English groom is due to confusion with, or substitution of groom , servant]. You see, we have to look at the unassuming syllables sometimes if we reallywish to follow the genius of language in its active forming oflanguage. Now it is remarkable that in Ullas's translation the sa dumba 'der Dumpfe', 'the dull one', appears, denoting the man unable to speak, the dumb man whom the Christ heals(Matthew 9:32). With this, I would like to remind you thatGoethe has told us how in his youth he existed in a certainkind of Dumpfheit 'dullness'. \"Dullness\" is a state of being unable to see clearly through one's surroundings, to live inshadows, in fogginess; this hinders, for one thing, the capacityfor speech, renders mute. Later this word became dumm , took the meaning of 'dumb' or 'stupid', so that this dumb means nothing more than 'not able to look about freely' or 'to live indullness' or 'in a fog.' It is truly extraordinary, my dear friends,2lect Black 34 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 34 how many changes and transformations of a word can exist.6 These changes and recastings show how the conscious and the unconscious are interwoven in the marvelous being called thegenius of language that expresses itself through the totality of afolk, tribe, or people. There is, for instance, the name of the Nordic god Fj\u00f6gyn . This name appears in a clarifying light through Ullas's use ofthe word fairguni as Gothic for 'mountain', in telling of Christ's \"going up into the mountain\" with his disciples. Its meaningshifted a little but we still nd the word in Old High Germanasforha , or 'r mountain'. Fj\u00f6gyn is the ele- mental god or goddess who resides on the r mountain. This inturn (and we can sense it in fairguni ) is related to the Latin word quercus 'oak tree', which also names the tree. I should like to point out how in earlier ages of language- forming there prevailed\u2014though somewhat subconsciously\u2014aconnection between sound and meaning. Nowadays it is almostimpossible for us with our abstract thinking to reach down tothe speech sounds. We no longer have a feeling for the soundquality of words. People who know many languages are down-right annoyed if they are expected to consider anything aboutspeech sounds. Words in general have the most varied transi-tions of form and meaning, of course; translations followingonly the dictionary are articial and pedantic. First of all, weshould follow the genius of language, which really has some-thing other in mind than what seems obvious at rst glance. In German we say Kopf 'head'; in the Romance languages it istesta, t\u00eate . Why do we say Kopf ? Simply because in German we have a sculptural language genius and we want to express theroundness of the head. Kopf is related to kugelig 'spherical', and 6. See also Rudolf Steiner, Spiritual Relations in the Human Organism , lec- ture 2 (Spring Valley, NY: Mercury Press, 1984).2lect Black 35 Lecture Two 35 whether we speak of Kohlkopf 'cabbage head' or human Kopf, it has originated from the same language-molding process. Kopf expresses what is round. T esta, however, 'head' in Latin, denotes something in our inner being: testifying, ascertaining, deter-mining. We always have to consider that things may be namedfrom various points of view. One can still feel this\u2014though it'spossible to miss the details\u2014if we try to trace our way back toolder forms from which the present word originated. Finally wearrive far back in time when the genius of language was able tosense the spiritual life within the sounds themselves. Who can still sense that meinen 'to mean' and Gemeinde 'community, parish' belong together? perceive. In Old High German Gemeinde isgimeinida . If you look at a further metamorphosis to mean as an English cognate [Anglo-Saxon, maenan general'], it is ida expresses what is 'meant' or 'arrived at' by several people in common; it derives strength from the fact that several peopleare involved. And this act of receiving strength is expressed byadding such a prex asgi-[related to Anglo-Saxon be-, inbedaz- zle,behold , and so forth. In modern German ge- is the prex of most past participles.]. We have to reach back and try to nd the element of feeling in the forming of speech. T oday when we say taufen , an ancient German word, 'to baptize', we no longer have a feeling for whatit really is. We get more of a picture when we go back to Oldand Middle High German, where we n d toufan, toufen ,t\u00f6ufen and nd this related to diups related to daupjands , the Baptist. We have in Old High Ger- man the close cognate tiof, in Modern German tief'deep'\u2014so there we have the relationship taufen ...hineintiefen ...tauchen 'dip in, dive in'. It is simply a dipping into the water.2lect Black 36 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 36 These things should help us to look carefully at the language- forming genius. Observing changes of meaning is especiallyimportant. In the following example there is an interesting shiftof meaning. 'Bread' was in Gothic hlaifs , leiba, Anglo-Saxon, hlaf, modern German das Brot .Hlaifs/hlaf has not retained the meaning 'bread'; it has changed into laib/loaf. It means now only the form in which bread is made; earlier it was the bread itself. You can observe this change of meaning in the metamorpho- sis from Old English hlaford from the earlier hlafweard , 'bread keeper or guard.' The hlaford was the person who wards or guards the bread, the one you had to ask if you wanted bread,who watched over the bread, had the right to plant the eld,make the bread, give the bread to those who were not freemen.And by means of a gradual transformation\u2014the /h/ is lost\u2014theword lord developed; 'lord' is the old hlafweard . The companion word is equally interesting. Whereas hlaifs becomes 'loaf of bread', another word appeared through meta-morphosis: hlaefdige in Old English. The rst part of the word is again 'loaf of bread'; dige developed from an activity. If dough (Anglo-Saxon dag, Modern German T eig) is being kneaded, this activity is expressed in the word dige,digan , to knead dough. If you seek the person who carries out this activ-ity, you will arrive at the wife of the lord. The lord was thebread-warden; his wife was the bread-kneader, bread-giver. Theword 'lady' grew out of hlaefdige . In a mysterious way, 'lord' and 'lady' are related to the loaf of bread and show their originas 'bread-warden' and 'bread-kneader'. We must really try to grasp the difference between our mod- ern abstract attitude toward language and one that was trulyalive in earlier times. People felt then that speech-sounds car-ried in themselves the spirit qualities, the soul qualities, thathuman beings wanted to communicate.3lect Black 37 Lecture Three 37 LECTURE THREE The Transforming Powers of Language in Relation to Spiritual Life T HE experiences of life often lead to apparent contradictions. However, it is just when we carefully examine the contradictionsthat we discover deep and intrinsic relationships. If you pondersomewhat carefully what I explained in my rst talk and restatedin the second, and you compare this with my examples yester-day of the inner connections between European languages, youwill nd such a contradiction. Look at the two series of factsthat were characterized. We nd in modern German many lin-guistic \"immigrants.\" We can feel how many words accompa-nied Christianity from the South and were added to the originaltreasure house of the Germanic languages. These words came tous together with Christian concepts and Christian perceptions;they belong today very much to our language. I spoke, too, ofother immigrant words as signicant because they belong to thewidened range of our language possibilities, those that came infrom the western Romance languages in the twelfth century. Atthat time the genius of the German language still possessed thepower of adaptation; it transformed in its own way what wasreceived from Western Europe, not only as to sound but also asto meaning. Few people suspect, I said before, that the Germanword fein (ne) is really of French origin: n, and that it entered our language only after the twelfth century.3lect Black 38 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 38 I mentioned Spanish elements coming in at a later time, when German no longer had the same strength of transformation\u2014and how this strength was totally at an end when English wordsentered the German language during the last part of the eigh-teenth but particularly during the nineteenth century. Thus wesee words being continually taken over in Central Europe, fromthe Latin or from the Greek through Latin, or from the westernRomance languages. Because of all this, we can say that ourpresent vocabulary has absorbed foreign elements but also thatour language in its very origin is related to the languages thatgave it seemingly foreign components in later times. We can easily establish the fact\u2014not in the widest sense but through characteristic examples\u2014that languages over far-flungareas of the earth have a common origin. Take naus, for instance, the Sanskrit word for 'ship'. In Greek it is also naus, in Latin navis . In areas of Celtic coloring you will nd nau. In Old Norse and the older Scandinavian tongues you have nor. [In English there is nautical ,nautilus, navy, navigate , and so forth]. It is unimportant that this word root has been [German has Schiff , noun, , verb, as English ship, noun and verb]. Despite this, we can observe that there exists a relationship encompassing an exceedingly largearea across Europe and Asia. Take the ancient East Indian word aritras . We nd the word later as eretm\u00f3n in Greek and then, with some consonants dropped, as remus in Latin. We nd it in Celtic areas as rame and in Old High German as ruodar . We still have this word; it is ourRuder 'rudder', 'oar'. In this way one can name many, many words that exist in adaptations, in metamorphoses, across widelanguage sectors; the Friesian, Ger-man, and High German\u2014also in the Baltic tongues, theLithuanian, Latvian, and Prussian. We can also nd such wordsin the Slavic languages, in Armenian, Iranian, Indian, Greek,3lect Black 39 Lecture Three 39 Latin, and Celtic. All across the regions where these languages were spoken, we discover that a primeval relationship exists; wecan easily imagine that at a very ancient time the primordial ori-gins of language-forming were similar right across these territo-ries and only later became differentiated. I did say at the beginning that the two series of facts contra- dict each other, but it is just by observing such contradictionsthat we can penetrate more deeply into certain areas of life.The appearance of such phenomena leads to our discoveringthat human evolution through the course of history has not atall taken place in a continuously even way, but rather in a kindof wave movement. How could you possibly imagine thiswhole process, expressed in two seemingly contradictory bodiesof fact, without supposing that some relationship existedbetween the populations of these far-flung territories? We canimagine that these peoples kept themselves shut off at certaintimes, so that they developed their own unique language idi-oms, and that periods of isolation alternated with periods ofinfluencing or being influenced by another folk. This is asomewhat rough and ready characterization, but only by look-ing at such rising and falling movements can we explain certainfacts. Looking at the development of language in both direc-tions, as I have just indicated, it is possible to gain deeperinsights also into the essential nature of folk development. Consider how certain elements of language develop\u2014and this we will do now for the German language\u2014when a countrycloses itself off from outside influences and at other times takesin foreign components that contribute their part to the spirit-soul elements expressed through language. We can alreadyguess that these two alternating movements evoke quite differ-ent reactions in the spirit and soul life of the peoples. On one hand it is most signicant that a primordial and striking relationship exists between important words in Latin3lect Black 40 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 40 and in the older forms of the Central European languages\u2014for instance, Latin verus 'true', German /w/ pronounced /v/. We have in English verity, very , from Old French veras]. If you take such obvious things as Latin, velle =wollen 'will' or even Gothic thahan [English tacit,taciturn ], you realize that in ancient times there prevailed related, similar-sounding language elements over vast areas of Europe\u2014andthis could be proven also for Asia. On the other hand, it is really remarkable that the inhabit- ants of Central Europe from whom the present German popu-lation originated, accepted foreign elements into theirlanguages relatively early, even earlier than I have described it.There was a time when Europe was much more strongly per-vaded by the Celtic element than in later historic times, but theCelts were subsequently crowded into the western areas ofEurope; then the Germanic tribes moved into Central Europe,quite certainly coming from northern areas. The Germansaccepted foreign word elements from the Celts, who were thentheir western neighbors, much as they later accepted themfrom the Romans coming from the South. This shows that theinhabitants of Central Europe, after their separate, moreclosed-off development, later accepted foreign language ele-ments from the neighbors on their outer boundaries, whoselanguages had been originally closely related to their own. We have a few words in German that are no longer considered very elegant, for instance Schindm\u00e4hre , 'a dead horse'. M\u00e4hre , 'mare', is a word rarely used in German today but it gave us theword Marstall 'royal stables'. M\u00e4hre is of Celtic origin, used after the Celts had been pushed toward the West. [While English mare is in common usage, nightmare has a different origin: Anglo- seems to have been no metamorphosis3lect Black 41 Lecture Three 41 of the word, either in Central Europe or the West; apparently the Germans took over the word later from the Celts. In fact, awhole series of such words was taken over, for some of whichthe power of adaptation could be found. For instance, thename\u2014which is really only partly a name\u2014 Vercingetorix con- tains the word rix.Rix, originally Celtic, was taken up by the Celts to mean 'the ruler,' the person of power (Gothic reiks, Latin rex). It has become the German word reich (Anglo-Saxon, rice, 'powerful', 'rich'), 'to become powerful through riches'. And thuswe nd adaptations not only from Latin but also from the Celticat the time when the Central European genius of language stillpossessed the inner strength of transformation. If the external development of language could be traced back far enough\u2014of course, it can't be\u2014we would ultimately arriveat that primeval language-forming power of ancient timeswhen language came about through what I described yesterdayas a relationship to consonants and vowels , a relationship of sound and meaning. Languages start out with a primitivestructure. What then brings about the differences in them?Variety is due, for instance, to whether a tribe lives in a moun-tainous area or perhaps on the plain. The larynx and its relatedorgans wish to sound forth differently according to whetherpeople live high up in the mountains or in a low-lying area,and so on, even though at the very beginning of speech, whatemerges from the nature of the human being forms itself in thesame way. There exists a remarkable phenomenon in the growth and development of language, which we can look at through exam-ples from the Indo-European languages. Take the word zwei (two), Latin duo. In the older forms of German [also Anglo- Saxon], we have the word twa or 'two'. Duo points to the oldest step of a series of metamorphoses in the course of which duo changes to twa and nally to zwei. It is too complicated to take3lect Black 42 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 42 the vowels into account. Considering only the consonants, we nd that the direction of change runs like this: /d/ becomes /t/and /t/ becomes /z/, exactly in this sequence: We note that as the word moves from one area to another, a transformation of the sound takes place. The correspondingstep to German /z/ is in other languages a step to /th/. This is by no means off-base theorizing. T o describe the pro- cess in detail we should have to collect many examples, yet thissequence corresponds to Grimm's Law in the metamorphosis oflanguage. 1Take, for instance, the Greek word thyra , 'door'. If we take it as an early step, arrested at the rst stage, we mustexpect the next step to use a /d/, and sure enough, we nd it inEnglish: door. The nal change would arrive clockwise at /t/, and there it is: modern German T\u00fcr, 'door'. Therefore we can nd, if we look, the oldest \"language-geo- logical stratum,\" where the metamorphosing word stands onany one of these steps. The next change will stand on the fol-lowing step, and then on the nal step as modern German. If the step expressed in Latin or Greek contains /t/, English (which has remained behind) will have the /th/, and modernGerman (which has progressed beyond English) will have a /d/[cf. Latin tu, Anglo-Saxon thu 'thou', German du 'you']. When modern German has /z/ (corresponding to English /th/ 1. Jakob Grimm in his book on Germanic grammar codied this consonant shift so that it is known as Grimm's Law. See lecture 2, pp. 29-30. (th)3lect Black 43 Lecture Three 43 the previous step would have been /t/, and the original Greco- Latin word would have had a /d/. This can be discovered. We would then expect, following a word with a /t/ in Gothic, to nd as the second step a /z/. Take the word Zimmer 'room', for the relationship of modern German to the next lower, earlierstep in the Gothic or in Old Saxon, both of which stand on thesame level: Zimmer has come from timbar . From /z/ we have to think back to /t/. This is merely the principle; you yourselvescan nd all this in the dictionary. 2 There are many other lively language metamorphoses; as a parallel to the just-mentioned sequence, there is also this one: ifan earlier word has a /b/, this becomes on the next step a /p/,followed on the third step connection /g // k/ /h/ or /ch/ exists. You will nd corresponding examples [cf. Latin ego, Anglo-Saxon ic, Dutch ik, German ich]. We can sum up as fol- lows: Greek and Latin have retained language elements at anearly stage of metamorphosis. Whatever then became Gothicadvanced to a later stage and this second stage still exists today,for instance in Dutch and in English. A last shift of consonantstook place nally around the sixth century A.D., when language advanced one stage further to the level of modern German. Wecan assume that the rst stage will probably be found spread far 2. See also Rudolf Steiner, The Realm of Language and Arnold Wadler, One Language. 3lect Black 44 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 44 into Europe, in time perhaps only up to about 1500 B.C. Then we nd the second stage reigning over vast areas, with the excep-tion of the southern lands where the oldest stage still remained.And nally there crystallizes in the sixth century A.D. the mod- ern German stage. While English and Dutch remain back in theearlier second stage, modern German crystallizes out. I urge you now to take into account the following: The rela- tionship that people have to their surroundings is expressed bythe consonants forming their speech, completely out of a feelingfor the word-sound character. And this can only happen once\u2014 that is, only once in such a way that word and outer surround-ings are in complete attunement. Centuries ago, if the forerun-ners of the Central European languages used, let's say, a /z/ onthe rst step to form certain words, they had the feeling that theconsonant character must be in harmony with the outside phe-nomena. They formed the /z/ according to the outer world. The next stage of change can no longer be brought about according to the outside world. The word now exists; the nextstages are being formed internally, within human beings them-selves and no longer in harmony with their surroundings. Thereshaping is in a way the independent achievement of the folk soul. Speech is rst formed in attunement with the outer world, but then the following stages would be experienced onlyinwardly. An attuning to the external does not take place again. Therefore we can say that Greek and Latin have remained at a stage where in many respects a sensitive attunement of thelanguage-forming element to the outer surroundings has beenbrought to expression. The next stage, forming Gothic, OldHigh German, Old English, and so forth, has proceededbeyond this immediate correspondence and has undergone achange to the element of soul. These languages have thereforea far more soul-lled character. We see that the rst changethat occurs gives language an inner soul coloring. Everything3lect Black 45 Lecture Three 45 that enters our sensing of language on reaching this second stage gives inwardness to our speech and language. Slowly andgradually this has come about since 1500 B.C. This kind of inwardness is characteristic of certain ancient epochs. Carriedover into later ages, however, it changed into a simpler, moreprimitive quality. Where it still exists today, in Dutch andEnglish, it has passed over into a more elemental feeling forwords and sounds. Around the sixth century A.D. modern German reached the third stage.3 Now the distancing from the original close attune- ment to the outside proceeds still further. Through a stronginward process the form of modern German proceeds out of itsearlier stage. It had reached the second stage of its developmentand moved into the realm of soul; the third stage takes the lan-guage a good distance away from ordinary life. Hence thepeculiar, often remote, abstract element in the German lan-guage today, something that presses down on the German souland that many other people in the rest of Europe cannotunderstand at all. Where the High German element has beenwielded to a special degree, by Goethe and Hegel for instance,it really can't be translated into English or into the Romancelanguages. What comes out are merely pseudo-translations.People have to make the attempt, of course, since it is better toreproduce things somehow or other rather than not at all.Works that belong permanently to this German organism arepenetrated by a strong quality of spirit, not merely a quality ofsoul. And spirit cannot be taken over easily into other lan-guages, for they simply have no expressions for it. 3. \"Starting most probably in the southernmost reaches of the German-speak- ing lands, some time in the fth century, a series of sound changes graduallyresulted in restructuring the phonetic systems of all the southern and many ofthe midland dialects, resulting in High German\"\u2014John T. Waterman, A His- tory of the German Language (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1966).3lect Black 46 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 46 The ascent of a language to the second step, then, is not only the ensouling of the language, but also the ensouling of the folk-group's inwardness through the language. The ascent to the thirdstep that you can study especially in modern German [and espe-cially in written German], is more a distancing from life, so thatby means of its words such abstract heights can be reached aswere reached, for instance, by Hegel, or also, in certain cases, byGoethe and Schiller. That is very much dependent on this reach-ing-the-third-step. Here German becomes an example. The lan-guage-forming, the language-development frees itself fromattuning to the external world. It becomes an internal, indepen-dent process. Through this the human-individual soul elementprogresses which, in a sense, develops independently of nature. Thus the Central European language structure passed through stages where from a beginning step of instinctive, ani-mal-like attuning to the outer world, it acquired soul qualitiesand then became spiritual. Other languages, such as Greek andLatin, developed differently in their other circumstances. As westudy these two ancient languages primarily from the stand-point of word formation, we have to conclude that their wordand sound structures are very much attuned to their surround-ings. But the peoples who spoke these languages did not stopwith this primitive attunement to the world around them.Through a variety of foreign influences, from Egypt and fromAsia, whose effects were different from those in Europe, Greekand Latin became the mere outer garment for an alien cultureintroduced to them from outside, essentially a mystery culture.The mysteries of Africa and Asia were carried over to theGreeks and to a certain degree to the Romans; there wasenough power in them to clothe the Asian mysteries and theEgyptian mysteries with the Greek and Latin languages. Theybecame the outer garments of a spiritual content flowing into3lect Black 47 Lecture Three 47 them drop by drop. This was a process that the languages of central and northern Europe did not participate in. Instead,theirs was the course of development I have already described:On the rst step they did not simply take in the spiritual as theGreeks had done but rst formed the second stage; they wereabout to reach the third stage when Christianity with its newvocabulary entered as a foreign, spiritual element. Evidently,too, the second stage had been reached when the Celtic ele-ment made its way in, as I described earlier. With this we seethat the spiritual influence made its entrance only after aninner transforming of the Germanic languages had taken place.In Greek and Latin there was no transforming of this kind butrather an influx of spirituality into the rst stage. To determine the character of a single people, we have to study concrete situations or events, in order to discover thechanges in its language and its relationship to spiritual life.Thus we nd in modern German a language that, on reachingits third stage, removed itself a good distance from ordinarylife. Yet there are in German so many words that entered itthrough those various channels: Christianity from the South,scholasticism from the South, French and Spanish influencesfrom the West. All these influences came later, flowing togethernow in modern German from many different sources. Whatever has been accepted as a foreign element from another language cannot cause in us as sensitive a response as a word, asound combination, that has been formed out of our own folk-cultural relationship to nature or to the world around us. Whatdo we feel when we utter the word Quelle 'spring', 'source', 'foun- tain'; 'cognate, well'? We can sense that this word is so attuned to the being of what it describes, we can hardly imagine calling itanything else if with all our sensitivity we were asked to name it.The word expresses everything we feel about a Quelle . This was the way speech sounds and words were originally formed: conso-3lect Black 48 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 48 nants and vowels conformed totally to the surrounding world. [English speakers can feel the same certainty about spring : Anglo- Saxon springan . Arnold Wadler has pointed out the particularly lively quality of all spr- words, such as sprout, sprig, sprite, spray, sprinkle, surprise , even sport\u2014and of course spirit.] But now listen to such words as Essenz 'essence' or Kategorie 'category' or Rhetorik 'rhetoric'. Can you feel equally the rela- tionship to what the word meant at its beginning? No! As mem-bers of a folk-group we have taken in a particular word-sound,but we have to make an effort to reach the concept carried onthe wings of those sounds. We are not at all able to repeat thatinner experience of harmony between word-sound and conceptor feeling. Deep wisdom lies in the fact that a people acceptedfrom other peoples such words in either their ascending ordescending development, words it has not formed from thebeginning, words in which the sound is experienced but not itsrelationship to what is meant. For the more a people acceptssuch words, the more it needs to call upon very special qualitiesin its own soul life in order to come to terms with such words atall. Just think: In our expletives and exclamations we are stillable today to experience this attuning of the language-formingpower to what is happening 'Hah!','Drat it!']. How close we come to what we want to express withsuch words! And what a difference you nd when you're inschool and take up a subject\u2014it needn't even be logic or philos-ophy\u2014but simply a modern science course. Y ou will immedi-ately be confronted with words that arouse soul forces quitedifferent from those that let you sense, for instance, the feelingyou get from Moo! that echoes in a \"word\" the forming of sounds you hear from a cow. When you say the word Moo, the experience of the cow is still resounding in you.3lect Black 49 Lecture Three 49 When you hear a word in a foreign language, a very differ- ent kind of inner activity is demanded than when you merelyhear from the sound of the word what you are supposed tohear. You have to use your power of abstraction, the purepower of conceptualizing. You have to learn to visualize anidea. Hence a people that has so strongly taken up foreign lan-guage elements, as have the Central Europeans, will have edu-cated in itself\u2014by accepting these foreign elements\u2014itscapacity for thinking in ideas. T wo things come together in Central Europe when we look at modern German: on the one hand the singular inwardness,actually an inner estrangement from life, that results frommoving into the third stage of language development; on theother hand, everything connected with the continuous taking-in of foreign elements. Because these two factors have cometogether, the most powerful ability to form ideas has developedin the German language; there is the possibility to rise up tocompletely clear concepts and to move about freely withinthem. Through these two streams of language development, aprodigious education came about for Central Europe, the edu-cation of INNER WORDLESS THINKING , where we truly can pro- ceed to a thinking without words. This was brought about inabundant measure by means of the phenomena just described. These are the things that have evolved; we will not under- stand the nature of modern German at all if we don't take theminto account. We should observe carefully the sound-metamor-phoses and word-metamorphoses that occur through the appro-priation of foreign words at the various stages of development. This is what I wanted to present to you today, in order to characterize the Central European languages.4lect Black 50 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 50 LECTURE FOUR History of Language in Its Relation to the Folk Souls YOU have seen that the most important concern of this course is to show how the history of language-forming origi-nates in human soul qualities. Indeed, it is impossible to arriveat an understanding of the vocabulary of any modern languagewithout understanding its inner soul nature. So I would like toadd today some examples to show you how the phenomena oflanguage are related to the development of the folk souls. First let me call your attention to two words that belong together: Zuber 'tub' and Eimer 'pail'. They are old German words; when you use them today, you are aware that an Eimer is a vessel with a single handle fastened on top in which some-thing can be carried; Zuber has two handles. That is what they are today when we use the two words, Zuber and Eimer . To investigate the word Eimer we have to go back a thousand years and nd it in Old High German as the word ein-bar . You remember that I introduced you to the sound group bar (lec- ture 2), related to beran Eimer 'pail' came about. We have it clearly expressed, transparently visible in the old form: the carryingwith one handle, for bar is simply something to carry with. Zuber in Old High German is Zwei-bar 'two-carry', a vessel carried by two handles, a tub. [The origin of tub from Middle4lect Black 51 Lecture Four 51 High German tubbe surely has to do also with 'two'.] You see how words today are contractions of what in the older formwere separate pieces or phrases that we no longer distinguish. There are many such examples; we can put our minds to a few typical ones. Take the word Messer 'knife'. It goes back to Old High German mezzi-sahs .Mezzi is related to ezzan , the old form of essen, 'to eat', with an introductory /m/. As for sahs (sax is another pronunciation of the same word), we need toremember that when Christianity spread across southern Ger-many, the monks encountered the worship of three ancientdivinities, one of whom was Sachsnot orZiu, the God of War [still present in , 'Mars-day']. Sachsnot means 'the living sword'; sahs has the same sound conguration. Therefore in the word Messer you have the composite 'eating sword,' the sword with which you eat. Interesting, too, is the word Wimper ['eyelash' today, but seems to describe eyebrow ], which goes back to wint-bra .Bra is the 'brow' and wint is something that 'winds itself around'. You can picture it: the 'curving brow'. In the contraction Wimper we no longer distinguish the single parts. Another word that characterizes such contractions, where originally the relationships were felt perceptively, you know asthe fairly common German word Schulze 'Mayor'. When we look back at Old High German we nd sculd-heizo . That was the man in the village to whom one had to go to nd out whatone's debt ( Schuld ) was. He told a fellow who had been up to some kind of mischief what his ne would be. The person whohad to decide, to say ( heissen ) what debt or ne was due Sculd-heisso ,Schuld-heisser 'debt namer'. This became Schulze . I am giving you these examples so that you can follow me as wetrace the course of language development. Something else can be observed in this direction, something that still often happens in dialects. In Vienna, for instance, a4lect Black 52 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 52 great deal of dialect has been retained in a purer state than in northern Germany, where abstractness came about quite early.The Austrian dialect goes back to a primitive culture, as far backas the tenth century. The language-forming genius with its livelyimage quality was still active in southern German areas but didnot enter the northern German culture. There is a picturesqueword in Vienna: Hallodri . That's 'a rascal, a rowdy', who likes to raise a ruckus, who's a trouble-maker, who's possibly guilty of afew minor offences. The Hallo in the word points to how a per- son shouts [like English Hello! with a touch of holler ]. The ri has to do with the shouting person's behavior; it is a dialect holdoverfrom the Old High German ari, which became aeri in Middle High German, nally becoming weakened in modern Germanto the sufx -er. [This corresponds exactly to -er in English, as in baker, farmer, storyteller. ] If you take the Old High German word wahtari , there at the end of it is the syllable you encountered in the Austrian dialect word Hallodri . It means somehow or other 'being active in life'\u2014that is the syllable ari;waht is 'to watch'. The person who takes on the ofce of watching is the wahtari . In Middle High German it became wachtaere , still with the complete sufx. Now in Modern German it is W\u00e4chter 'watcher, watchman, guard'. The arihas become the syllable -er, in which you perceive very little of the original meaning: handling ormanaging something. This you should feel in words with thesufx - er, retained from ancient times, for example: The person who handles or manages the garden is the gartenaere , the gar- dener . It is an illustration of the way language today makes an effort to adapt sound qualities\u2014everything I would call musi-cal\u2014slowly into abstractness, where the full sense of the soundcan no longer be perceived, especially not in the full sense of theconcept or its feeling quality. The following is an interesting example. You know the pre- x-ur 'original, archetypal' in the words Ursache 'rst forest, jungle', Urgrossvater 'great-grandfather, ancestor', and so on. If we go back almosttwo thousand years in the history of our language, we nd thissame syllable in Gothic as uz. In Old High German, about the year 1000 A.D.we nd the same syllable as ar,ir, orur. Seven hundred years ago it was ur and so it remains today, having changed rather early. As a prex to verbs it has become weak.We say, for instance, to express something being announced,Kunde 'message'; if we want to designate the rst message, the original, the one from which the other messages arise, we sayUrkunde 'document, charter'. In verbs the ur is augment the verb kennen 'to know'; (cognate: ken) we do possible\u2014 Urkennen, but rather erkennen 'to understand, recognize'. Er has exactly the same level of meaning in such a word as ur does in urkunde . If I make it possible for someone to do a certain thing, I erlaube 'allow' him something. If I change this into a noun, in a cer-tain situation, it becomes Urlaub 'vacation', something I give a person through my act of 'allowing'. Another word formationrelated to all this is exceedingly interesting\u2014you know theexpression \"to make land ('to bear'; see lecture 2). Urbar is the 'primordial cause inducing the land to bear'. There is an analogous meaning inthe word ertragen 'ur -bear, to yield, endure'. If you nowa- days something about the Ertrag des Ackers 'the yield of one's land', you are using the same word as in urbar machen des Ack- ers 'making the eld yield its rst crop'. Originally the word urbar was also used to say 'work the land so that it bears enough, for instance, to pay its taxes or rent'. [Note: Englishacre has become a measurement, whereas Acker is the land itself. Arnold Wadler in his One Language takes this word back toAgros (Greek, 'soil'), further back to Ikker (Hebrew, nally to A-K-R (Egyptian, 'earth-god') to show4lect Black 54 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 54 how ancient words with a spiritual meaning descend through the ages to a sense that is more and more physical and abstract.'God' 'human being' 'land' 'measurement'. A similar change occurs from Agni, Hindu god of re, to Ignis (Latin, 're') and nally ignition , 'part engine'.] To study the prexes and sufxes of a language is in every sense most interesting! For instance, there is the prex ge- in numerous words. This goes back to the Gothic ga, in which one truly felt the gathering. [Here the best example is offered in English: Anglo-Saxon gaed, 'fellowship', related to gador in 'together'.] Ga- carries the feeling of assembling, pushing together. In Old High German it became gi, and in modern German ge [Wadler once described the consonant as the musi- cal instrument on which the vowel-melody is played, hence theever-changing vowels in epochs of time and in comparable lan-guages.] When you put ge in front of the word salle orselle 'room, hall', you come to Geselle 'fellow, journeyman' a person who shares a room with another or sleeps in the same lodgingwith him. Genosse 'comrade' is a person who geniesst 'enjoys' something together with another. I want to call your attention to what is characteristic in these examples. Someone who experiences within the sounds of aword the immediate feeling for its meaning surely has a differ-ent relationship to the word than does a person without thatfeeling. If you simply say Geselle because you've known what it means since childhood, it is a different thing than if you have afeeling for the room and the connection within the room oftwo or more people. This element of feeling is being thrownoff; the result is the possibility of abstractness. Another example is part of many of our words, the sufx - lich (English - ly) as in g\u00f6ttlich 'divine, godly', and freundlich 'friendly'. If you look for it two thousand years ago, you will nd4lect Black 55 Lecture Four 55 it in Gothic as leiks. It became lich in Old High German, related originally to leich and also leib 'body'. I told you (see lecture 2, pages 32-33) that leich/leib expresses the 'form' ( Gestalt ) left behind when a person dies. Leichnam 'corpse' is really a some- what redundant expression, a structure such as a child createswhen it combines two similar sounding words like bow-wow or quack-quack , where the meaning arises through repetition. Dis- similar sounding words, however, may also be combined in thisway, and such a combination is the word Leichnam .Leich , as we said, is the form that remains after the soul has left the body.Nam, in turn, derives from ham and ham is the word still pre- served in Hemd 'shirt', meaning shroud or sheath, H\u00fclle .Leich- nam means therefore the 'form-shroud' that we cast off after death. Hence there is a combination of two similar things, 'form'and\u2014somewhat altered\u2014'sheath', put together like bow-wow . Out of this leiks/leich our sufx - lich has developed. When we use the word g\u00f6ttlich 'godly', it points toward a 'form' with its -lich, which is leiks 'form': a form that is godly or divine, 'of the shape or form of God'. This is particularly interesting inthe Old High German word anagilih , which still contains ana from the Gothic; ana means 'nearly', 'almost'. Gilih is means what 'almost has the form'. This is a good example for studying not so much the history as more particularly the psychology of language. It still showshow nuances of feeling, in earlier times, were vividly alive inthe words people used. Later this feeling, this emotional qualityslowly separated from any language experience, so that what-ever unites a mental picture with speech sounds has become atotally abstract element. I have just spoken about the prex ge-, Gothic ga-. Imagine that the 'gathering together' of ga-, which is now ge-, could still be felt and were now applied to the ele- ment of 'form', to the leich, then according to what we could4lect Black 56 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 56 feel historically, it could mean 'agreement of form'. This mean- ing lives in the word like an open secret. Geleich =gleich means 'forms that 'very similar, identical, equal'. Consider for a moment a word that unveils many secrets. Today we will look at it from only one point of view. It isUnget\u00fcm 'monster'. [In German the two dots over an /\u00e4/, /\u00f6/ or /\u00fc/, called an Umlaut , change the quality and sound of the vowel. 1] The /\u00fc/ inUnget\u00fcm was originally /u/ and this tum, if looked at separately, goes back to Old High German tuom , which is related to the verb tun 'to do, bring about, achieve, bring into a relationship'. In every word containing the sufx-tum, the relationship of things working together can still be felt\u2014as in K\u00f6nigtum 'kingdom', Herzogtum 'dukedom, duchy'. The Unget\u00fcm is a creature with whom no real work- ing together is possible. Un, the prex, denotes the 'negative'; getum could be the 'working together'. We have numerous words, as you know, with the sufx - ig (English earthy ] so on. This goes back to Old High Ger- man - ac or -icand to Middle High German -agor -ig. It signi- es approximately what we describe with the adjective eigen 'own, one's own'. Hence, where the sufx - ig appears, it points to a kind of ownership. Feurig isfeuereigen , something whose property is 'ery'. I have told you that it is possible to observehow the genius of a language undergoes increasing abstractness,which is the result of this sort of contracting and what comesabout then as the assimilation of sound elements, such as feurig from feuer-eigen . It could be expressed like this: In very ancient stages of a people's language development, the feelings were guided totally 1. See discussion of the umlaut in lecture 6, page 90.4lect Black 57 Lecture Four 57 by the speech sounds. One could say language was made up only of differentiated, complicated images through the conso-nant sounds, picturing outer processes, and of vowel elements,interjections, expressions of feeling occurring within those con-sonant formations. The language-forming process then movesforward. Human beings pull themselves out, more or less, ofthis direct experience, the direct sensing of sound language.What are they actually doing as they pull themselves out andaway? Well, they are still speaking but as they do so, they arepushing their speech down into a much more unconsciousregion than the one where mental pictures and feelings wereclosely connected with the forming of the sounds. Speech itselfis being pushed down into an unconscious region, while theupper consciousness tries to catch the thought. Look closely atwhat is going on as soul-event. By letting the sound associa-tions fall into unconsciousness, human beings have raised theirconsciousness to mental pictures ( Vorstellen ) and perceptions that no longer are immersed in language sounds and soundassociations. Now people have to try to capture the meaning, ameaning somehow still indicated by the sounds but no longeras intimately connected with them as it had been. We canobserve this process even after the original separating-out of thesound associations has taken place; just as people previouslyhad related to the sounds, now they had to make a connectionto words. By that time there had come into existence wordswith sound associations no one nds any relationship to; theyare words connected through memory to the conceptual.There, on a higher level, words pass through the same processthat sounds and syllables underwent earlier. Suppose you want to say something about the people of a certain area, but you don't want to sound completely abstract.You wouldn't want to say \"the human beings of W\u00fcrttemberg \" [the German state where the lecture was being given]; that4lect Black 58 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 58 would be too abstract. And you probably wouldn't want to reach top level abstraction with \"the inhabitants of W\u00fcrttem-berg.\" If you want to catch something more concrete than\"human beings,\" you might think of \"the city and of W\u00fcrttemberg\" ( die B\u00fcrger und Bauern ). This would denote not actually city people nor country people but some-thing that hovers in between. In order to catch that hoveringsomething, both words are used. This becomes especially clearand interesting when the two words, used to express a concept,approach from two sides and are quite far apart from eachother, for instance when you say Land und Leute 'land and peo- ple'. [Something similar in English: the world and his wife .]. When you use such a phrase, what you want to express is some-thing hanging between the two words that you are trying toapproach. Take Wind und Wetter 'wind and weather': when you say it, you can't use just one word; you mean neither wind norweather, but something that lies between, put into a kind offramework. [In English we have many similar double phrasesfrom earliest times: might and main ;time and tide ;rack and ruin;part and parcel; top to toe ;neither chick nor child \u2014 and many of them are alliterative, that is, repeating the same conso-nant at the beginning of both words.]. It is interesting to note that as language develops, such dou- ble phrases use alliteration, assonance, or the like. This meansthat the feeling for tone and sound is still playing its part; peo-ple who have a lively sense for language are still able, eventoday, to continue using such phrases and with them are able tocapture a mental image or idea for which one specic word isnot immediately available. Suppose I want to describe how a person acts, what his hab- its are, what his essential nature is. I will probably hesitate touse just one word that would make him out to be a living per-son but passive\u2014for I don't want to characterize him as living4lect Black 59 Lecture Four 59 essentially a passive life nor on the other hand an active life; I want to deduce his activity out of his intrinsic nature. I can'tsay, his soul lebt 'exists'; that would be too passive. Nor can I say, his soul webt 'is actively in motion, weaves, wafts'; that would be too active. I need something in between, and todaywe can still say, Die Seele lebt und webt 'Just as he lives and breathes'. Numerous examples of this kind proceed from the lan- guage-forming genius. If you want to express what is neitherSang 'song' nor Klang 'sound', we say Sang und Klang 'with drums drumming and pipes piping'. Or you might want todescribe a medieval poet creating both the melody and thewords of a song\u2014people often wanted to say that the Minne-singers did both. One couldn't say Sie ziehen herum und singen 'they wander ziehen herum und singen und sagen 'they wander about singing and telling'. What they did was a concept for which no single word existed. Yousee, such things are only what I would call latecomers or sub-stitutes for the sound combinations we no longer quite under-stand. Today we form contractions of such phrases as Sang und Klang, singen und sagen , sound-phrases which in earlier times retained the connection between sound-content and the con-ceptual feeling element. To take something very characteristic in this respect, look at the following example. When the ancient Germans convened tohold a court of justice, they called such a day tageding 'day- thing'. What they did on that day was a ding. We still use the expression Ding drehen , literally, 'to turn a thing'; slang, 'to plan something shy'. A ding is what took place when the ancient Germans got together to make legal decisions. They called it atageding . Now take the prex ver-: it always points to the fact that something is beginning to develop (Anglo-Saxon for- used inforbear, forget, forgive , and so forth). Hence, the occurrences at4lect Black 60 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 60 thetageding began to develop further and one could say, they were being vertagedingt . And this word has slowly become our verteidigen 'to defend, to vindicate', with a small change of meaning. You see how the sound combination vertageding began to undergo the same process as the word combinations do later. Thus we nd that little by little the conceptual life digresses ever further from the pure life of language sounds. Considerthe example of the Old High German word alawari .All-wahr , ganz wahr 'completely true, altogether true' was meaning, but it has become today's word albern 'foolish'. Just think what shallowness of the folk soul you are looking intowhen you see that something with the original meaning of'altogether true' has become 'foolish', as we hear and feel theword today. The alawari must have been used by tribes, I would say, who considered the appearance of human all-truthas something stupid and who favored the belief that a cleverperson is not alawari . Hence the feeling that 'one who is com- pletely honest is not very clever', i.e., albern : 'silly, foolish, weak-minded'. It has carried us over to something for whichoriginally we had a quite different feeling. When studying such shifts of meaning, we are able to gaze deeply into the language-forming genius in its connection withqualities of soul. Take our word Quecksilber 'quicksilver, mer- cury', for instance, a lively, fluid metal. Queck is the same word asQuecke 'couch grass', also called 'quick, quitch, twitch, or witch grass', which has to do with movement, the same word asquick contained in the verb sound combina- tion queck and quick , with the small shift to keck 'bold, saucy' originally meant 'to be mobile'. If I said ve hundred years ago'er ist ein kecker Mensch ', I would have meant that he is a 'lively person', not one to loaf around, to let the grass grow under hisfeet, one who 'likes work and gets going'. Through a shift of4lect Black 61 Lecture Four 61 meaning, this keck has become 'bold, saucy'. The path inward toward a soul characteristic led at the same time to an impor-tant change of meaning. Another word frech originally meant k\u00fchn im Kampfe 'bold in battle'. Only two hundred years ago frech 'fresh, impudent, insolent' meant a courageous person, someone not afraid tostand his man in a ght. Note the shift of meaning. Such shiftsallow us to look deeply into the life and development of thehuman soul. Take the Old High German word diomuoti .Deo/dio always meant 'man-servant'; muoti is related to our word Mut 'courage'; cognate, mood , but formerly it had a different meaning, to be explained today by attitude , the way we are attuned to the world or to other people. We can say that dio muoti actually signied the attitude of a servant, the mood a servant should have towardhis master. Then Christianity found its way north. The monkswanted to tell the people something of what their attitudeshould be toward God and toward spiritual beings. What theywanted to express in this regard they could only do in relation tothe feeling they already had for the 'servant's attitude'. And sodiomuoti gradually became Demut 'humility'. The religious feel- ing of humility derives from the attitude of a servant in ancientGermanic times; this is how shifts of meaning occur. To study this process it is especially interesting to look at words, or rather the sound- and syllable-combinations wherethe shift of meaning arose through the introduction of Chris-tianity. When the Roman clergy brought their religion to thenorthern regions of Europe, changes occurred whose funda-mental signicance can be outwardly understood only by look-ing at the shifts of meaning in the language. In earlier timesbefore the advent of Christianity, there existed a well-denedmaster/servant relationship. About a person who had beencaptured in battle, put into service, and made submissive, his4lect Black 62 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 62 master\u2014wishing to imply Der ist mir n\u00fctzlich 'he is useful to me'\u2014would say Der ist fromm, das ist ein frommer Mensch 'he is a pious man'. Only a last remnant of this word fromm exists today where, to put it a bit jokingly, it is only somewhat remi-niscent of its original meaning in the phrase zu Nutz und Frommen 'for use and prot', that is, 'for the greater good'. The verb frommen is combined here with 'usefulness', which originally was its identical meaning, but the idea of ndingsomething useful is pointed out with tongue in cheek. The ser-vant who was fromm was a most useful one. The Roman clergy did nd that some people were more useful to them than oth-ers and these they called fromm 'pious'. And so this word has come about in a peculiar way through the immigration ofChristianity from Rome. With such words as Demut 'humility' and Frommsein 'piety' you can study some of the special impulses carried by Christianity from south to north. To understand language and its development you have to pay attention to its soul element, to the inner experience thatbelongs to it. There exists in the forming of words what I char-acterized as the consonantal element on the one hand, the imi-tation of external processes, and on the other hand, the elementof feeling and sensing, for instance, as interjections., when per-ceptions are expressed in their relationship to the externalworld. (See also expletives, lecture 3, p 48) Let us consider a distinctly consonantal effect one can expe- rience in one's feeling for language, quite far along in itsdevelopment. 4lect Black 63 Lecture Four 63 Suppose that someone is looking at this form I am drawing here. A simple person long ago would have had two kinds offeeling about it. Looking at the form from below, that personperceived it as something pressed inward; the feeling itselfslowly grew into the sound formation we have in our wordBogen 'bow, as in rainbow'. However, looking at the form from above downward and perhaps bending it out as much as possi-ble (drawing it), what I see now, looking down, comes intospeech as Bausch 'hump, bunch, ball'. From below it is a Bogen ; from above, it is a Bausch . The two words still contain some- thing of our perceptive feeling. When you want to express whatis contained in both words together but is no longer attachedto our perception, and goes outward to describe the whole pro-cess, you may say in Bausch und Bogen , 'in bump and bow' ['lock, stock and barrel' is a similar English idiomatic phrase].In Bausch und Bogen would be an imaginative phrase for this (pointing to the drawing), seen from above and below. You canapply these two points of view also in the moral or social realm,in closing a business deal with someone, so that the nal out-come is considered from both inside and outside. Looking at itfrom within, the result is prot; from outside there is the corre-sponding loss. When you close a business deal, whether forprot or loss, you can say it's done in Bausch und Bogen ; you don't have to pay attention to either of the single components(as in the English phrase for better or for worse ). With all this I have wanted to explain to you that by follow- ing the development of speech sound elements as well as wordsand phrases, pictures will arise of the folk soul development assuch. You will be able to discover many things if you tracealong these lines the movement from the concrete life ofspeech sounds to the abstract life of ideas. You need only toopen an ordinary dictionary or pick up words from the talkgoing on around you, and then trace the words as we have4lect Black 64 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 64 done. Especially for our teachers I want to mention that it is extraordinarily stimulating to point out such bits of languagehistory occasionally to the children right in the middle of yourlesson; at times it can truly enlighten a subject and also stimu-late more lively thinking. But you must remember that it's easyto get off on the wrong track; one must be exceedingly careful,for\u2014as we've seen\u2014words pass through a great variety ofmetamorphoses. It is very important to proceed conscien-tiously and not seize on supercial resemblances in order toform some theory or other. You will see from the following example how necessary it is to proceed cautiously. Beiwacht 'keeping watch together' was originally an honest German word, like Zusammenwacht 'together watch', used to describe people sitting together andkeeping watch. It is one of the words that did not wander fromFrance into Germany as so many others did, but it somehowmanaged to wander into France, as did the word guerre (French, 'war') from the German Wirren 'disorder, confusion'. In early times Beiwacht got to France and there became biv- ouac. And then it wandered back again, in one of the numerous treks of western words moving toward German regions afterthe twelfth century. When it returned, it became Biwak 'an encampment for a short stay'. Thus an original German wordwandered into France and then returned. In between it wasused very little. Such things can happen, you see: Words emi-grate, then it gets too stuffy for them in the foreign atmo-sphere\u2014and back home they come again. There are many sortsof relationships like this that you can discover.5lect Black 65 Lecture Five 65 LECTURE FIVE Language and the Sense for Reality or Its Lack O N the basis of what I have given you in these lectures and in order to reafrm it strongly, I want to start out today withthis remark: It is notably in philology that the consequences ofa materialistic approach are the saddest, but perhaps also themost obvious. We can say that materialistic methods probablydo more harm, for instance, in physics, because there it is lessobvious\u2014but it is most saddening in connection with lan-guage. Just here this could have been most easily avoided; justhere it would have been possible to see how spirit and soul areactually at work in the language-forming genius. Now with thisinsight, our task will be to approach the earlier periods of lan-guage-forming by observing rst of all what happens in latertimes. It is easier to survey the more recent happenings; youcan follow language changes by noting how they shine throughthe accompanying changes in the feelings and perceptions ofthe folk soul. The language of the German people around thetime of the Minnesingers\u2014historians call it the age of chiv-alry\u2014lies relatively far back but not so far that one can't traceliterary matters easily enough to clarify this or that shift ofmeaning. By that time you don't nd as many uncomplimen-tary phrases and epithets as in Homer, whose heroes appliednames to each other that we would call insulting. T oday we5lect Black 66 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 66 would hardly call each other 'goat stomachs' or 'donkeys'. In those ancient times, however, a donkey was held in such esteemthat a hero could be called a donkey. Animals then, it is evidentfrom the Homeric epics, were by no means the object of suchnuances of feeling as they are today. We can come to some understanding of these things if we look for characteristic examples from a time close to ours. Inthe Middle Ages we nd the gure of ihrer Feinde Scharen 'They stuck like pitch to the ranks of the enemy'. It sounds laughable today to say of a person whoperseveres bravely in battle, 'He sticks like pitch', but thisexpression was denitely used in the age of the Minnesingers. In Wolfram von Eschenbach 1 you will nd a characteristic gure of speech, showing us rst of all what was consideredimportant at the time: description through vivid images, andsecondly, various nuances of feeling for things or processes thatwould today seem rather contemptuous. When von Eschen-bach describes in a serious manner a duchess coming toward agentleman, he says, Her appearance penetrated his eye andentered his heart, wie eine Nieswurz durch die Nase 'like a sneezewort through the is a vivid metaphor, for thescent of sneezewort penetrates one's nose in a very lively way,one could even say ruchbar 'smellable' (see lecture 2, page 30), but we would certainly not use the phrase today. It shows howthe world of feeling has changed, and this change in the worldof feeling must be studied in order to get at the science of lan-guage in a nonmaterialistic way. A more recent poet, 2 as you know, was still able to say of a dignied woman, Sie blickte wie ein Wolfram von Eschenbach (1170 Ludwig Uhland (1787-1862) in \"Des S\u00e4ngers Fluch.\"5lect 67 Lecture Five 67 was like the full moon'. But this gure of speech, quite usual in the Middle Ages, would be inexcusable today. If you wereprompted by a similar emotion to exclaim in this way to a lady,it would hardly be polite. In the Middle Ages, however, theloveliness and gentleness of the moon were transcendent in thehearts of the people. It was from this point of view that theassociation came about of the full moon with the beloved qual-ities of a lady's glance and countenance. Gottfried von Strassburg speaks in about geleimte Liebe 'glued love' as something that had come apart and then found its way together again. He spoketoo about klebenbleiben 'staying glued down' of wounded men on the battleeld. This would sound insulting today. Whenpeople in the Middle Ages described the kaiserlichen Beine 'imperial legs' of a person in stateliness, ordie kaiserliche Magd Maria 'the imperial maid Mary', it points up essential aspects of change within the world of feeling. In bringing you these examples, I want you to become obser- vant as to how these subtle changes of feeling show up inobscure areas. For instance, one could speak in those early agesofkrankem Schilfrohr 'sick reeds'. What are sick reeds? Krank , 'sick', is here only a descriptive adjective for an exceedingly long,thin reed, and it is not at all far back in time when krank had no other meaning than 'slim'. In those days when you called a per-sonkrank , you would have meant that he was 'tall and slim', cer- tainly not that he was 'ill', in the present sense of the word. Hadyou wished to express sick, you would have used the term s\u00fcchtig ,von einer Sucht befallen , in modern usage, 'chronically or 'addicted'. To be krank was to be 'thin'\u2014just think what has happened to this word! Gradually the feeling developed thatit is 'not quite human' to be 'thin'. The notion been adopted 3.Tristan and Isolde , ca. A.D. 1210.5lect Black 68 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 68 that a normal human being should be a little more substantial. With this detour came about the linking of the sound-connec-tion krank with the meaning 'sick' and the idea of a not-quite normal organism. We see how a word with one distinct shade ofmeaning can take on a clearly different one. Not very long ago an innkeeper could do a good business by advertising elenden 'miserable' wine. He could trumpet forth in his village: \"In my inn you get elenden wine!\" It is exactly the same word that means 'miserable' today. Now, however, only ina dialect will you still nd an echo of the old shade of meaning,where certain villages lying far out toward the border of theland are called the Elend villages. Even in my time in Styria in southern Austria, someone saying Der Mann ist aus dem Elend (the man is from the Elend ) meant that he came from a village on the border. Certain villages have kept the name Elend up to the present day. This term has actually moved in from fartheraway, for elender wine meant So the inn- keeper would have done good business, at least up to 1914, byadvertising, say, French wines as elender wine. We see a shift of meaning similar to the one in Krank . The poet Geiler von Kaisersberg 4 speaks most peculiarly of a h\u00fcbschen 'pretty' God. We couldn't say this today, but if you look it up in his works, you will nd it more understandable.He meant with this a 'benevolent' God. H\u00fcbsch at that time carried the same shade of feeling as 'kind'. [An English exam-ple: when James II (1633-1701) rst saw St. Paul's Cathedral inLondon, he called it amusing ,awful , and articial . He meant that it was (1445-1510), famous preacher.5lect Black 69 Lecture Five 69 You will still nd occasionally today surviving gures of speech, such as the phrase ein ungehobelter Mensch 'an uncouth person', literally 'unplaned' surface not smoothed with a Hobel , a carpenter's plane. You will understand this word on meetingit in Martin Luther's writing, that people are gehobelt 'planed smooth' by the prophets, that is, they are being put to rights,put in order, straightened up by the prophets. We nd therethe visual imagery of the act of planing with the 'makingstraight' in a moral sense. After these examples from so far back in time, we can look at something closer to us. Lessing, 5 who lived more recently, wanted to describe the many things for which we rightfullydevelop great sympathy but which nevertheless cannot be calledbeautiful or be thought of as objects of art. By the way hephrased this, it can easily German uses another 'attractive'.] means that many things of the most attractive naturecannot rightfully be called objects of art; in this word we have areal change on how the word is felt. We use the term nowadaysfor something essentially different. It is interesting to trace the complicated way such shifts of meaning take place. Consider how the word krank , meaning 'slim' at an earlier time, might also be applied to a reed. A reediskrank when it is slim, less useful than a short, thick one. This shade of meaning gradually changed then to its present sense of'sick' , though somewhat modied once again. Adelung, 6 living halfway between that time and ours, speaks about gekr\u00e4nkte 5. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781), critic and dramatist. The quotation is from his play Emilia Galotti , Act I, Scene German philologist and grammar-ian. Court librarian at Dresden.5lect Black 70 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 70 ships that need repair [ gekr\u00e4nkte , the past participle of the verb kr\u00e4nken , introduces still another shade of meaning. T oday it is used to mean 'hurt', in the sense of hurt feelings.] It strikes usas a little comic or at least it characterizes the speaker as a jokerwhen someone talks about a 'hurt clock', but in those years thesense of the word was perfectly clear, with its changed mean-ing, when applied to inorganic objects. Krank originally referred to the shape or form; the present meaning 'sick' creptin only gradually. While the earlier meaning 'slim' was castaside altogether and the totally new one took over, we are stillreminded of the original meaning by the term 'hurt ships'. Theimmediate sensing of the emotional, perceptive quality withinwords disappeared more and more. Even Goethe still had a clear feeling about words; he found feelings in words that nowadays leave us cold, for in manyrespects he went back to the power of the language-forminggenius. The word bitter 'bitter', for instance, has become for us a purely subjective tasting experience; usually we don't connectit in our feeling with what in earlier times was clearly visualizedasbeissen 'to bite', from which it originates. The relationship is there: whatever tastes bitter really 'bites us'. Goethe still felt this and writes about \" the bitter scissors of the Fates \" 7\u2014they are the biting scissors of the Fates! People nowadays are such abstract creatures that they think this is \"mere poetic license.\" But it isnot poetic license at all; it arose directly out of inner experi-ence. T rue, Goethe did not yet live in a time when ninety-ninepercent of poetic writing is superfluous. We should keep inmind while reading his work how within language he felt amuch greater aliveness, a more inward life, than we are able tofeel today as products of modern education. You can sense this,too, from Goethe's words, Ein Ecce Homo geel mir wegen seiner 7. In his poem \"Harzreise im Winter \"(Winter Journey in the Harz).5lect Black 71 Lecture Five 71 erb\u00e4rmlichen Darstellung , 'An Ecce Homo painting pleased me particularly because of its miserable portrayal'. No one todayseems to feel that there is anything more in Goethe's phrasethan the meaning of a poor sort of representation. ButGoethe wants to suggest that our deepest pity is arousedthrough this particular portrayal. We would say, \"Ein Ecce mir wegen seiner Erbarmen heransforderndenDarstellung ,\" 'An Ecce Homo painting pleased me particularly because the portrayal aroused compassion'. Goethe was stillable to put it ' . . . because of its miserable portrayal'. Not so very long ago it was possible to say of a person who liked to speak with children or poor people on the street, whowas not snobbish or conceited, for whom one wished to showone's approval, \" Du bist ein niedertr\u00e4chtiger Mensch! 'You are a low-thinking person, low-minded, vile'.This was possible until the middle of the eighteenth century.Ein niedertr\u00e4chtiger Mensch was until that time an 'affable, ami- able' person. He was being praised, given the highest praisefrom a certain point of view. Again, I do not believe that manypeople can still derive the right meaning from reading in eigh-teenth century literature about an ungef\u00e4hrliche Zahl a 'harm- less number'; ungef\u00e4hr An ungef\u00e4hrliche number was simply an 'approximate' one. Further, what would modern minds connect with the com- mon eighteenth century expression, unartige Pflaumen 'naughty plums'. variety'. Unartige plums are those that do not show the specially typical marks oftheir kind, because they are an unusual variation. Only when we acquire a feeling for the fact that such changes take place will we understand other changes that arenot so obvious. For instance, our word schwierig 'difcult'\u20145lect Black 72 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 72 you know the shade of feeling with which it is spoken. It was formerly used only with the conscious intention of expressingfull of Schw\u00e4ren , full of Geschw\u00fcre if you found something schwierig , you wished to express the feeling that this would 'result in abscesses'. A very pictorial,vigorous expression to connect with our word schwierig . Such things fall totally outside our modern nuances of feel- ing; they prove how wrong it is to judge language in a pedanticway without recognizing the reality of language metamorpho-sis, something also evident in dialects. T oday, when offering aguest a meal with many courses, you might tell him not to eattoo much of this or that because other dishes are coming forwhich he should save some appetite; you might say, \"Pleasedon't eat too much\u2014there's a good dessert coming.\" But in oneregion of the German-speaking lands, it is possible to still something coming inthe rear'. [ Etwas hintenauf in modern German carries the con- notation that a 'spanking is in the ofng'.] In another dialect it is possible to say, \"Oh, these are good children; die schlachten sich ,\" 'they slaughter each other'. This meant that they take after their good parents, are cast in thesame mold [ vom gleichen Schlag sein ]. It is exactly this kind of example that points up the living interchange between innersensitivity and the external image in our feeling for language. Sometimes this shows up in extremely important matters. For instance, you will nd a statement of Goethe, made in his lateryears, characterizing his work on Faust . It has played a most sig- nicant role with the Faust commentators. In Goethe's last letter [March 17, 1832] addressed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, hecharacterized his on as Lecture Five 73 (. . . when for more than sixty years the conception of Faust has been clear to me from the beginning , rst as a young person; the whole sequence, however, less fully developed). Many Faust commentators concluded from this that Goethe already as ayoung man had a plan for the complete Faust that he had con- ceived clearly from the beginning ( von vorn herein ) and that the later work was merely a kind of working out the details.And much that is unnecessary and untrue in their character-ization of his work on Faust has originated from this interpre- tation of the passage, for only since Fresenius 8 published his ndings about the signicance for Goethe of the phrase von vorne herein 'in from the front', that is, 'at the outset' has it been possible to understand Goethe's words. All this had spe-cial meaning for me because I worked with Fresenius 9. When he had found something of importance, it often took decadesbefore he did anything about it. Therefore I pressed him topublish this, for what he had to say was extremely important.You can put together all the passages of Goethe using thephrase von vorne herein and you will nd that he never uses it in any but a spatial sense. If he said he had read a book von vorne herein , he meant that he had read only the beginning pages. It can be clearly shown that he had in his youth a clearconception of the rst scenes of Faust . Here then simply a correct understanding of word usage explains Goethe's work;from this phrase you can see that what he could visualize spa-tially has for us become abstract. Von vorne herein he always used visually, spatially. Much of Goethe's charm and attrac-tion for us is founded on his going back to the original quali-ties of the language-creating genius. You can start out from 8. August Fresenius (b. 1850). See Rudolf Steiner, The Course of My Life (Hud- son, NY: Anthroposophic Press, 1951), pp. 221-223 .9. From 1890 to 1897 in the in Weimar as editor ofGoethe's Scientic Writings .5lect Black 74 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 74 Goethe's language and from there search your way into Goet- he's soul, instead of proceeding only materialistically as mod-ern investigators do, and you will nd there important criteriafor freeing philology from rationalistic materialism. It is goodto look for help from such sources also. In many ways there no longer exists such language that expresses a combination of shades of feeling and sound. Wecan still nd this sometimes in dialects, which also have it inthemselves to bring the visual to expression. For instance, youwill nd here and there in dialect\u2014more often than in phrase 'to reach under his arm'. This simply means tocome to the aid of a person who needs help. Why? Because ayoung person in offering a hand to someone elderly, who can'tget about so easily any more, reaches under the other's arm togive support. This active image was transferred then to anyhelpful act. Exactly as it was with the expression (Lecture 2)\"to wipe the night-sleep out of our eyes,\" so it is with the act of giving help, a single specic procedure chosen to express visu-ally a more abstract generality. Sometimes the genius of lan-guage was no longer able to retain the visual element; then alsofrom time to time imagery was retained in one instance, castoff in the other. There still exists today the word lauschen 'listen with inner attentiveness' for a certain kind of listening. The Austrian dia-lect also has a word related to lauschen :losen. We not only say in Austria when we want to make a person listen, H\u00f6r einmal 'listen', but also Los amol! 'harken!'. Losen is a weaker but still active listening. Educated colloquial German has retained lau- schen .Losen is a cognate with the feeling of a somewhat weak activity, even with a certain sneakiness, pointing to a secretkind of listening. In a sense losen has taken on the meaning of forbidden listening. For instance, when a person puts his ear to5lect Black 75 Lecture Five 75 the keyhole or listens in when two are discussing something not meant for his hearing, then the word losen is used 'harken'. Only after becoming sensitive to the feeling element in such sound sequences can one proceed to develop a sense for thebasic sounds, the vowels and consonants. In the Austrian dialectthere is a word Ahnl for grandmother. Do you perhaps know the word Ahnl ? A more general term is Ahnfrau (der Ahn ,die Ahne , male and female grandparents/progenitors). In Ahnl you have Ahne combined with an /l/. If you want to understand what is happening there in the realm of speech, you must swingup to a heightened feeling of /l/ as a consonant. Feel the /l/ inthe sufx - lich ('-ly', as in friendly . See lecture 2 and lecture 4), in which I have explained that it originated from leik. It is somehow related to the feeling that something is moving about,that this moving about has to be imitated in the language. AnAhnl is a person who is clearly old but who makes the impres- sion of being lively and mobile; you hardly notice the wrinklesin her face! You see the character of /l/ as it is used here. Take the word schwinden 'dwindle, fade': to go away, to make a thing go away so that it can't be seen any more. Nowgure that I don't really want to make it go away, but I want tocheat a little in seeming to make it go away. I want to effectsomething that is not a true, honest disappearance\u2014but Iwould also feel a moving around, an / l/ as in the Ahnl\u2014and there is the word schwindeln 'to swindle'. The /l/ makes the dif- ference. You feel exactly the subtly nuanced /l/ bygoing from schwinden be tramp-trample, side-sidle, tread-treadle .] If you dwell on these thoughts, eurythmy 10 will become completely natural. You will feel that eurythmy springs from 10. See Rudolf Steiner, Eurythmy as Visible Speech , GA 279, lecture 4 (New York: Anthroposophic Press, 1931).5lect Black 76 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 76 our ancient, original relationship to the sound elements of words, which without the sound elements only movement canbring to expression. If you can feel such a thing, then you willbe able to sense precisely how, for instance, in the vowel /u/(ooh) there is an element of moving close together, snuggling close together. Look at how you do the /u/ in eurythmy [Armsand hands are brought close and parallel to each other, as in thewritten letter]. You have the moving together, the closeness ofthe gesture, so that you can say, in the word Mutter 'mother'\u2014 someone you usually come close to\u2014it would be impossible tohave an /a/ (ah) or /e/ (ay) as the strong vowel in the word.[The /o/ of 'mother' is a gesture of affection.] You can't imaginesaying Metter orMatter .Mater shows that the language in which it occurs, Latin, was already a weakened one; the originalword was Mutter . I have shown you, with all this, the path of the genius of lan- guage, a path on which a barrier was erected, I have said,between the sound element of a word and its meaning. Theywere originally closely united with each other in subjectivehuman perception. They have separated. The sound-contentdescends into the subconscious; the mental picture ascends intoour consciousness [see lecture 4, page 59, 60]. Much has beencast off that can be perceived just there where human beingsoriginally lived closely connected with the things and activitiesaround them. When we go back to earlier times in languagedevelopment, we nd the altogether remarkable fact that theoriginal forms of language take us completely out into factualreality, that there exists on the primitive levels of language for-mation a ne sense for actual facts, and that the people who liveat this level live closely connected with things and with every-thing that goes on with things. The moment this living connec-tion is broken, the sense for reality becomes hazy and people livein an unreality that expresses itself in abstract language.5lect Black 77 Lecture Five 77 In the original Indo-European language there were three genders, as in Latin. We still have three genders in German.You can feel three different qualities expressed as masculine,feminine, and neuter. In French there are only two genders left,in English only one. This shows us that the English languagehas divested itself with a grand gesture, one could say, of thesense for reality, that it now merely hovers over things but nolonger lives in actualities. On that early step of human develop-ment when the gender of words was being formed, there stillexisted a primitive clairvoyance; a living, spiritual quality wasperceived within things. Der Sonne 'sun', masculine and die Mond 'moon', feminine which later were reversed to die Sonne andder Mond [in modern German sun is feminine, moon is masculine] could never have come about in the older Indo-European languages had the elemental beings living in the sunand moon not been experienced as brothers and sisters. Inantiquity the sun was felt to be the brother, the moon the sister.Today in German it has been turned around. The day was per-ceived as the son and the night as the daughter of the giantNorwi. This denitely originates from primitive clairvoyantvision. The feeling for the earth at that time was very differentfrom the geologists' perception of it today, when they wouldactually have good reason to use the neuter gender and speak ofdas Erde [the correct form in modern German is die Erde , femi- nine]. People nowadays no longer sense that the earth in fact isGaia, for whom the masculine god is Uranos. People still had aperception of this in the areas where the Germanic languagewas originally formed. In any case there were shades of feeling arising out of the close connection with the world outside and these were the source fordetermining gender, for deciding characteristic gender. The ele-phant ( der Elefant ) was considered strong, the mouse ( die Maus ) weak. Since a man was perceived as strong and a woman weak,5lect Black 78 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 78 the elephant was given the masculine gender, the mouse the feminine. The trees of the forest are usually feminine because forthe original perception, they were the dwelling places of femaledivinities. Of immense importance because it points to a deepaspect of the language genius is the fact that alongside the mas-culine and feminine genders there exists a neuter gender. We sayder Mann [the German language uses the sameword Geschlecht for both] is not yet articulated, has not yet reached complete denition, is in the process of becoming.When the neuter gender arose, it came up out of a certain moodin the folk-genius, a feeling that anything given a neuter genderwould only later become what it was to be. Gold does not yet have the special characteristic it will have someday. It is stillyoung in the cosmos; it is not yet what it is destined to be.Hence it is not der Gold ordie Gold butdas Gold . On the other hand we can look at what comes about when the visualizing power that could characterize gender disappears.We say today die Mitgift (dowry, literally 'with-gift'), which shows a clear connection to an earlier word die Gift . We also say today der Abscheu ('aversion', literally 'away-shyness') which is clear evidence of an earlier word der Scheu . Both these deduc- tions are correct. Der Scheu and die Gift have gone through a subtle change in connotation. Die Gift in early times simply meant 'the noncommittal act of giving'. But because of whatsome people have given and what was, also in Faust's opinion,harmful to others, the word has changed its meaning and hasbeen applied to gifts that are objectionable, losing the connec-tion with the original gender characteristic. The result is das Gift 'poison', neuter gender. When a person once was called scheu , he was considered as having strong feelings, as being rm in himself. When the word became weak, it became die Scheu 'shyness', feminine.5lect Black 79 Lecture Five 79 That our language has become more abstract, that it has released itself from its interweaving with outer reality, can bestbe understood from the fact that the ancient Indo-Europeanlanguages cases: hasretained the rst four. English has one case form for nouns,except for possessives\u2014usually adding /s/\u2014and two forms you, your or three forms they,them,their for pronouns]. This means that not only was the position of a thing expressed as it is donetoday with the rst four cases, but people were also able to fol-low other relationships with their feelings. For instance, to do athing at a certain time, we can express as diesen T ag 'on this day', accusative, or dieses T ages 'of this day', genitive. No longer do we experience the active helpfulness of the day, of the timeof day, or of a special day in particular. No longer do we havethe experience that whatever is done on the second of January,1920, for instance, could not be accomplished later, that timeis a helpful element, that time is involved in something thathelps us. There existed a sense for all this in earlier ages whenthe instrumental case was used, hiu tagu . We would have to say something like durch diesen T ag 'through this day', vermittelst 'by means of day'. Hiu tagu has become the word heute 'today'; the old instrumental case is buried in the word, just as hiu jaru has become heuer 'this year'. But German has retained only four cases and cast off the others. You willunderstand from this how continuously language becomesmore and more abstract, and how the capacity for abstractthought with its denite lack of a sense for reality has been tak-ing the place of an earlier connection with the real world. Thisis what language reveals.6lect Black 80 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 80 LECTURE SIX The Inner Path of the Genius of Language IHAVE shown you a few characteristic examples of language development and believe that now you should be able to visu-alize the inner journeying of the language-forming genius. Ifyou hope to nd your way through the phenomena of lan-guage and its evolution, you will have to understand theguidelines such phenomena reveal. Of course, I have been ableto show you only a few things; today I will point out only oneimportant guideline, summarizing these basic thoughts. Ihope we will be able very soon to continue this study. 1 Cer- tainly the main thing you will have understood is how thehuman beings in a primitive stage of language developmentwere receptive, inwardly alive, to the consonance of sound andobject. Whether this object is an inner feeling, an externalevent, an external thing, or an external fact doesn't matter.Whenever it is essential to form sounds that will express innerfeelings or perceptions about whatever is outside us, then thesounds will be of vowel quality in the broadest sense. Vowelcharacter in language denotes everything formed inwardly, 1. While it never came to another course on language, there is much material given by Rudolf Steiner from 1920 to 1924 in the Conferences with the T eachers of the Waldorf School in Stuttgart (4 Vols). See also page 131.6lect Black 81 Lecture Six 81 everything that is being felt inwardly and that presses itself into the sound out of what we are experiencing in our feelingand will. Hence we will nd in all the vowels and vowel forms the feelings and will-impulses that are called forth in us by theouter world and in a way are thrust into our larynx. In every-thing to do with consonants we will nd gestures modeled onwhat we perceive in the outer world. Let us suppose we would like to speak about an angle. First, we have an image of a certain angle in mind. T o describe thesides of the angle with our hand, we would do this [RudolfSteiner makes a gesture]. What we do like this with our hand,we actually do with our organs of speech in forming certainconsonants. Language is in this respect only the audible expres-sion of gestures that are not being made externally with thelimbs but with much ner parts of the human organism, ourbenecent air-organism. If you think about these inner laws,you will gradually develop the insight that language imitateseither the outer world directly or imitates what we experiencein the outer world through our feelings and sense perceptions. Let us imagine ourselves facing two possibilities: We could do either one thing or the other. Instinctively we begin to turnover in our thoughts whether we should do this or that. If weare still more or less an \"imitating animal,\" as of course every-one is on a primitive level of language development, relation-ship to the outer world still transmits itself into an externalgesture; we do this [gesture to the right and to the left]. Wehave to decide between our right side and our left side. That is,we are expressing the phenomenon that internally we are splitin two, because two different, external facts are confronting us.We split ourselves into two parts in order to determine towardwhich side the stronger weight in our thinking tends. So we dothis [repeats the gesture]. We separate, we decide, and alsodivide. But of course, if we are to come to a favorable decision6lect Black 82 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 82 we have to go back to the past as far as possible. Hence we not only divide ourselves ( teilen , 'to divide') but we divide ourselves far back to the beginning ( ur-teilen ); we make an archetypal, original division. [See Lecture 4, page 52,53.] The word Urteil 'judgment' should denitely be understood as a gesture trans-formed inwardly into sound. All consonant-forming is gesture-forming that has simply been transformed into speech sounds. When we search for the basis of this metamorphosis, we can trace it throughout the whole course of language development.At rst human beings lived more fully outside themselves intheir surroundings. Only gradually did they become inwardbeings. To begin with, they lived in the outer world, closelyconnected to the things around them, especially in the veryancient times when an original, primitive clairvoyance stillexisted. At this time human beings thought very little aboutthemselves nor did they have any denite ideas about them-selves. They knew, however, that there were all sorts of ghosts,all kinds of elemental spirits, which they perceived in what wenow call external objects. Even in himself a person still saw anelemental being. \"You,\" he said to himself, \"have come throughyour father and mother into this world.\" He objectied him-self. We nd that on the rst level of language-formation thelanguage-forming genius, to begin with, brings about mainlyconsonant sounds. The primitive languages on the whole musthave had consonantal character, because the primitive peopleswere still without inwardness. Primitive peoples today, at leastthe ones who have remained at this original level, have richconsonant formations in their language; the consonant soundsshow clearly the imitation of external events: for instance,Schnalzer ['tongue-clickers', both words good examples of an accumulation of consonants. Laurens van der Post, in The Lost World of the Kalahari , has described the Bushman's language: \"the sound of natural relish that the word ghwai Xkhwe makes6lect Black 83 Lecture Six 83 on his lips is a joy to hear, and the click of the complex conso- nants flashes on his tongue as he utters them like a sparkle ofsun on a burst of flower from our somber mountain gorse.\"].Certain African tribes are able to use the human organs ofspeech to produce sounds like the sharp snapping of a whip.'Tongue clicking' disappears when human beings begin toexpress more of their inner feelings through sound structure.Consonant formations must be considered the rst step. Thenthe second step will be the vowel formations, but the inward-ness found in vowel formations is actually a stage of transition.Finally signs of aging in the genius of language appear: thevowel-forming power recedes and the consonant-formingpower comes to the fore again. Our human language journey involving the development of language proceeds essentially from outward to inward and thenfrom inward to outward. We can observe this proceduredirectly in the sound-structure; it is the intrinsic essential factthroughout the whole forming of language. It is the intrinsic,essential fact to such a degree that we encounter it in everyaspect of language. That rst step of language development wemeet everywhere: human beings, still selfless, unaware of them-selves, create language. We are continually impelled to bring aword designating one thing towards another word in an exter-nal manner [as in early English: sea-horse, meaning 'ship']. On this level, human beings are altogether very lively in them-selves. Later, when they become more inward and spiritual, abit of this primitive liveliness is lost to them. They becomemore enclosed, more rigid, more abstract, and no longer havethe strength to pour into the word itself what they see exter-nally; instead, they add onto it [that is, using combining forms:prexes and sufxes]. To study such phenomena, we should nd the following characteristic examples exceedingly interesting. There is, for6lect Black 84 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 84 instance, in Old High German the verb salbom , in modern German ich salbe 'I am anointing'; cognate, salve). You can take this you always have salbo as the verb proper, denoting the activity. What is added creates the designated person of the word, for I them, foryou in the singular the s, forhe orshe thet, forwe the mes, for you in the plural the t, for they the nt. The fact that these sufxal forms are still contained within the verb is under-standable in the following sense: The contrasts of ' I, you, he, we, you, they ' appear at this primitive step because human beings looked at them very much from the outside. Theyadded the person-sounds directly to the sounds that expressactivity. They were still inwardly lively enough to connect theperson-sounds in a living way with the verbal form for theaction. We should consider this twofoldness: rst, the earlyattention directed toward the outer world, and second, theaddition of the main word itself to the inward, lively, transfor-mative force. This 'I, you, he, she, it ' was not originally felt to be an organic part of the verb or to be something of inwardness.You can observe this in the related Sanskrit language where theperson-designation is simply stuck onto the most importantword; it is to be found as an independent designation for ' I, you, he, she, it '. The ' m' in Old High German is simply the metamorphosis of mi 'I' of Sanskrit; the s, the metamorphosis ofsi 'you', singular, of Sanskrit; t, the ti'he, she, masi 'we'; the transformed tasi ('you', plural); nt is the sufx6lect Black 85 Lecture Six 85 -anti 'they', spoken somewhat hastily. You can still observe in Sanskrit that it is not at all a question of conjugating the centralpart of the main verb and then perceiving the change of form asa designation of person. No, at that time human beings wereinwardly so alive that with their perception of the outer world,they were able to organize the grammar of personal pronounsinto a sound-sequence expressing the main idea. That is animportant difference. You might easily believe that at this prim-itive level there would be mainly an inward modulating ofwords. No, there is not. An inner aliveness in the people letsthem connect the two components of a word together. This is aconsonantal activity, not a vowel-forming one. When later a language like Latin reaches the next level, with the perception that the personal pronouns should be withinthe inner organism of the sound sequence, the language hasarrived at a level corresponding to a greater inwardness of thatparticular language genius. Toward inwardness it has workedits way from outwardness where it has simply attached to theend of a word what it perceived as a primitive level peo- ple don't say Karl Meyer but the Meyer-Karl [peasant dialect], so it is with such verbs; whatever makes them specic is addedat the end. Here, too, the specic pronoun is put at the end ofthe word. Repositioning the pronoun from the end of the word to the beginning and making it an independent word was the path tothe greatest inwardness, the kind of inwardness that perceiveshow spiritually abstract our inner nature really is. Now theperson is separated off and placed ahead of the verb. You canlearn something important from this procedure if you go backto the primitive constructions of the language-forming geniusthat does not really know anything about an I or a you sepa- rated from external things, and that still presses into the word6lect Black 86 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 86 whatever has to be said about Ioryou. Later, the genius nds the pronouns within the word itself\u2014Latin is a language atthis level\u2014and plucks them out, comes to a mirror image ofitself, comes to ego consciousness, and then puts the I and the you up ahead of the verb. This growing sense of egoism, this arrival at self-visualization is reflected quite clearly in languagedevelopment. One can say that becoming aware of oneself at acertain unconscious level has been achieved as the result of theancient Apollonian precept \"know thou thyself\"; this was fol-lowed everywhere in the languages of the western world bytaking the personal pronouns out of the verb forms. Theseforms could still express human inwardness; they had not yetseparated themselves completely away from it. You really willnot be able to study languages unless you do what I suggestedyesterday: consider them as the expression of human souldevelopment. You see, from language that is still alive it is quite possible to trace the \"remnants\" of the vowel-forming and consonant-forming powers. There is a quality in the verbs, the words ofaction, that gives them a vowel-forming character and makesthe vowel in them the main element. With a little reflectionyou will realize that the verbs in which the vowel element\u2014expressing inner sensitivity\u2014is more important than the con-sonants are those that describe an activity we can connect our-selves with inwardly and wholeheartedly. Now observe that there is a difference between the state of your soul right now and how it was a little while ago. You aresitting here and you have been sitting quite a while. Whateveris expressed by this sitting is something you have connectedyourself with; it is connected quite inwardly with you. Youhave come to sit here by setting yourself down. With the set-ting yourself down you are connected much less inwardly; it ismore external. You can't continue to 'set' yourself down for any6lect Black 87 Lecture Six 87 length of time because you can't connect yourself so closely with the act of dropping onto a chair, but you can sit for halfan hour and even longer, because it is possible to connect your-self inwardly with sitting. It is really the case that you shouldexperience the sound-sequence for sitting as vowel-articulated, and the one for setting as more external, more consonantal. If you are sensitive to vowel articulation, you will have thepower\u2014through the language-forming genius\u2014to be creativewith vowels; you will do this by adapting the word in variousways: sit, sat, sat [the German sitzen, sass, gesessen has With the consonantal activity, expressedinsetting , you keep the emphasis on the consonants instead of forming a vowel change to satting or similar [the German set', has no vowel change]. You are depicting something external with this by saying set. If you want to express the fact that this took place some time ago, youwill say set-did (setzen tat ). [The English verb to set is irregular and does not follow the German rule. We have substituted theverb to place in this discussion.] You will say place-did . You do place yourself, you did place yourself; in metamorphosis thisbecomes placed , for the - ed is the transformed did. People who still today have kept something of this language- forming strength in themselves will emphasize consonants justas happened in earlier times. If they belong to a more primitivelevel of culture, they have an unusual capacity to imitate outerlife and activity with their consonantal sound-structures, usingas few vowels as possible. You can hear something of this join-ing together of sound and outer action in the words of a some-what simple peasant who had considered it an honor to havehis son study at the university. He was asked what his son wasdoing at the university. For the time being, the son was usinghis inheritance not so much for steeping himself in the abstractand mental side of academic life but rather for giving himself6lect Black 88 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 88 over to more external aspects. And so the father, when asked what his son was doing, said, \"Strolling around he does, loangaround he does, beer guzzling he does, whooping it up he does,but doing something he doesn't do ( aber tun tut er nichts! ).\" A strong feeling of inwardness streams into the language- forming verb. In the sound structures that have retained theircharacter, especially their conceptual character, you will alwayscome to feel that the vowel change in verbal conjugations (anablaut , as 'come, came') expresses something we are more inwardly connected with. On the other hand, we will not beable to develop the ablaut with verbs for which we have aninner mental image but with which we cannot connect our-selves inwardly, verbs that do not become something we feelbut remain something merely observed. When you say, I sing ,I sang, you have the ablaut. It is quite different when you say, I singe, 'I burn something'. The word singe because re sings.I singe =I am making something 'sing'. If you are singing, you are connecting yourself inwardly withwhat you want to express through the sound-sequence. If yousinge, you are not connecting yourself with it inwardly; you arelooking at it by looking at yourself from outside\u2014hence thereis no vowel change: I singe ,I 'sing', and sengen , 'singe']. Whenever we fail to notice such things today it is because the words havechanged so strongly that nothing of the kind is evident. Wehave to go back then to earlier forms of the sound structure. Itis extremely important for us to follow these three steps: theconnection of our life rst with the outer world, then withgrowing inwardness, and nally the next step of inwardnesswhere a human being explains his or her own inner world withwords such as the personal pronouns. You will come to under-stand language formation much more easily for yourself if youfollow this process. It seems that language is a flowing together6lect Black 89 Lecture Six 89 of the thought element and the will element in the human being; it appears that on its rst primitive level wherever thespeech sound is still strongly connected with the mental image,it is even difcult to distinguish the thought element from thewill element. T oday our speaking, particularly in Modern Ger-man, is already bound to our will to an extraordinary degree. InGerman we speak with our will and learn to use our will as amatter of course when we learn to speak. We also accompanyour speech with the ideas and images we have become used tobringing together with expressions of will. It is totally different in English. For someone who is impar- tial and can observe such things, it is an entirely differenthuman activity to speak German than it is to speak English,though low German dialects have remained closer to English.In speaking English it is much more the case that thinkinggoes into the speaking, that is, into the development of thesounds. In German, thinking does not take place in theunfolding of the sounds but proceeds as a parallel phenome-non to the sound development. In general, the western lan-guages have preserved themselves much more from thisinstinctive bringing together of sound and mental image thanhave the Central European languages. Therefore, the westernEuropean languages have taken on such a rigid structure. Inthem hardly anything can be formulated without someone say-ing, \"You can't say it like that, you have to change it around.\"This doesn't happen in German, where it's possible to say it inalmost any way. You can put the subject anywhere, at thebeginning or at the end, for the thought goes somewhat sepa-rately from the sound-structure, parallel with it, furtherremoved than in the Western languages. Only by turning backto the earlier stages of our German language development dowe arrive at an increasingly strict connection between mentalimage and sound. Therefore the quality still present in the6lect Black 90 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 90 western languages is an atavistic throwback that can be studied by means of the earlier steps in German and in our dialects. If you feel your way vividly into language from this point of view, you will be led at the same time into the essential natureof the folk souls. Suppose you are looking at an object in frontof you. As primitive people we have formed a sound sequencefor this object out of consonant and vowel elements. So we sayWagen ['wagon', 'car'; Anglo-Saxon, wain ] for something that can be put in motion. If we have in front of us the same objectin the plural, that is, a number of such objects, we form theplural by saying die W\u00e4gen , by forming the 'Umlaut'. It is true, die Wagen is also correct, but it belongs to literary language and was not really formed within the organism of the language.[The difference of pronunciation in English would be parallelto the vowels of far and vague. ] Why do we form the umlaut? It was for the singular object that we put the sounds together, and in doing so our con-sciousness was sparked, lit up, enlivened; at that moment wewere awake and attentive. When we formed the plural, we hadless overview and therefore had the need to express it in a morenebulous way. We dimmed the pure /a:/ sound [as in 'ah'] to amurky /e:/ (as in c are). The original sound sequence is always formed by consciously observing the actual facts or sensations.Whatever attracts less attention or cannot be closely observedreveals itself as dulled. 2The important thing here is to see how something changes within the human being. The dialect ofmany German areas does not say der Wagen but der Wogn . Since the normal attention to sound sequence brought aboutan answering /o/, the dimming in the plural is expressed by die Woagen . You can follow this in many examples. 3 2. See Rudolf Steiner, Eurythmy as Visible Speech , GA 279, lecture 7 (London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1984).6lect Black 91 Lecture Six 91 One more thing I should like to call to your attention. As you know, lively mental images were the source of the conso-nantal forming of language in earlier times, and much of whatwas felt in the soul of ancient peoples flowed into this lan-guage forming; it can still be studied in what has been retainedin primitive minds and feelings today. These perceptions,lled with an immense vitality at that time, were not onlyalive to the outer world through the senses but were also com-pletely bound up with a kind of primitive clairvoyance. Oth-erwise there would not be all our sturdy, image-lled wordsthat are happily still in existence. Here is an example: A personstill living within the sphere of atavistic clairvoyance\u2014nomatter how weak\u2014and possessing the ancient kind of percep-tion was certainly able to perceive that the physical body of anordinary human being contained something we call today theetheric body. Such a primitive person perceived the head [thisand the following were illustrated on the blackboard] and,projecting beyond it, a second, etheric head. He felt that thehead was the expression of thinking. Thus we can say thatprimitive human beings with their original clairvoyancenamed the human being from the standpoint of thinking\u2014with a word very much related to ours\u2014by the word Manas , forMensch 'human is the same as manas , of course, this is the human being we usually come across. But that early, atavistically clairvoyant person knewthat it's also possible to encounter other, somewhat different,people\u2014here I'm joking about something one ought not to 3. Old English had many ways of forming noun plurals. The most com- mon was the addition of - an, but - as (later - es, -s) gained ground and nally carried the day. However, we still have oxen,children ,kine,breth- ren. The mutation plural (changing the vowel) we nd in geese,feet,mice, lice, men, and women. None of these are changes to a dipthong, as in German.6lect Black 92 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 92 make too trivial\u2014who do not have the supersensible 'person' closely connected to the physical person so snugly and prosai-cally. In cases where the supersensible does not quite t intothe rest of the human being, people felt: the etheric body isverr\u00fcckt ['shifted', literally 'moved off that means today 'deranged', 'insane', 'crazy'] . This was then trans- Der Mensch ist verr\u00fcckt 'that per- son is shifted', i.e., 'crazy'. A purely external fact is described,the displacing of the etheric body. Just this sort of picture-making, going back to the time when pictures of the spiritualworld could still be observed, is exceedingly interesting. Ifpeople would only recognize this, if learned philologists werenot so sound asleep, proceeding as they do quite superciallyon their materialistic tracks! If they would enter instead intothe inward soul element that nds its expression in externallanguage-forming, philology would turn of itself into a scienceof the soul and then into spiritual science. For this reason it isa shame that philology has become so materialistic; youngpeople actually have no opportunity to observe the effects ofsoul and spirit on the forming of language. I believe that in some way now what I've wanted to give you in the way of guidelines and examples can be useful to those ofyou who are teachers at the Waldorf School. Take them intoyour mind and soul; they will serve as a stimulus to observe themany elements of language that you can make use of in yourteaching. If you have taken into yourself the spirit of looking atthings in this way, it will denitely benet your classes; speechwill always be the connecting link between you and your stu-dents. It would be of enormous help to try on your own tobring back into words some of the original strength of feelingand image-making in language. Through this you will trainyourself to a more lively perception than one otherwise is ableto develop. Actually we modern people walk around much like6lect Black 93 Lecture Six 93 living corpses, largely because our language has plunged so drastically out of our hearts and has fallen down somewherebelow. It has become an unconscious element of will. We canno longer feel how our soul qualities are alive within the spo-ken /e/ and /u/ and /a/ and /m/. We no longer train ourselvesto imbue the words that sound alike with the very same inwardfeelings. We are abstract not only in our understanding, in ourthinking, but abstract also in our speaking. For a person whoreally has a lively feeling for language, much of what we speaktoday sounds like a record on a record-player, but the recordhad already been produced in ancient times. We must try tomake a connection with our language again. However, for thisa kind of self-education will be necessary, so that we learn tolisten inwardly. Let us listen to the word rauh 'rough' and feel the sound combination inwardly. If we say on perceiving this gure [afour-sided gure drawn on the board], \"That is a Raute 'rhomboid',\" then we can sense rough in such a way that we feel roughness in the perception of the corners. We can still makethe effort today, when looking at such a gure, to experiencethe corners as related to rough , and the /t/ of Raute we will feel astut 'does'. Whatever does rough is the Raute . [We can approach this try-trisangle; hole-hold; flow-flower, etc.] Developing suchimponderables would be an element of strength in teaching, ifwe tried not to allow sound-structure and mental image todiverge. I beg you to consider just what kind of a subtle back-ground can we possibly sense when we talk to a child about thisgeometrical gure and say only, \"This is a rhomboid\"? We our-selves don't feel anything if we simply say, \"This is arhomboid.\" How strong a foundation we could establish forthe attentiveness of the students that we need in our class if wewill re-educate ourselves through an understanding of the6lect Black 94 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 94 sounds of speech, and then feel the need to educate our chil- dren in the same direction! You can gain ideas for your self-education from just this view of language I have been talking about. But I've also wanted toshow you something of method, my dear friends. My aim hasbeen to guide you toward important ideas by means of charac-teristic, concrete examples. I believe that a truly modern uni-versity professor would probably expound in three volumeswhat I have developed in this short time. He would of coursetry for completeness, but it would be less possible for him todevelop the guidelines to stimulate our thinking, our mentalpictures, and our perceptions. If you proceed in the elementaryschool as we have proceeded in this language course, you willevolve a good basic method of your own. You will try at everypoint to look for thoroughly characteristic examples for whatyou are going to present to your students, and you will be ableto combine what you see and feel in these characteristic exam-ples with the perception of their spiritual quality. There is truly no better method of pushing children into materialism than by giving them abstract instruction. A spiri-tual way of teaching is through concrete examples, but youmust not forget to allow qualities of soul and spirit to revealthemselves in these very concrete examples. Therefore I believethat what I have given you in this course can be a practical,methodological extension of the course I gave before the Wal-dorf School began. 4 And I believe that you can accomplish a great deal by pondering, \"How should I organize my classteaching, translating all this into what is right for children\u2014forit is possible to adapt it in every subject\u2014so that it follows this 4. See Rudolf Steiner, The Study of Man (London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1975); Practical Advice to T eachers (London: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1976); Discussions with T eachers (Bristol, England: Rudolf Steiner Press, 1992).6lect Black 95 Lecture Six 95 process of drawing in a spiritual quality by means of concrete examples?\" If you do this, you will not easily run the riskalmost all teaching does of not getting nished with the load ofsubject matter. It is only when subject matter is shredded intoatoms and systematized that you don't get nished with it,because it is so tempting to take up the single, atomized partsthat are uncharacteristic and pile them up, trying to show whatis characteristic. Of course, there are uncharacteristic examplesin all the school subjects; using these means that a great dealhas to be strung together. If you make the effort, however, tochoose characteristic examples and develop what is spiritualthrough your examples, you will achieve a certain necessaryeconomy in your teaching. I would be happy, my dear friends\u2014and let it be said in all friendship, especially to those who are teachers here at the Wal-dorf School\u2014I would be happy if two things have been notedin these improvised talks: First, the stimulus toward educatingyourselves in a kind of brotherly-sisterly alliance with the lan-guage genius; on the other hand, that the method of teaching isinfluenced to some extent by what I have just pointed out toyou. It is to be hoped that when I come back, possibly very soon, we will continue this exploration into language.6lect Black 96 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 96 Publisher's Note Regarding Rudolf Steiner's Lectures The lectures contained in this volume have been translated from the German edition, which is based on stenographicand other recorded texts that were in most cases never seen orrevised by the lecturer. Hence, due to human errors in hear-ing and transcription, they may contain mistakes and faultypassages. We have made every effort to ensure that this is notthe case. Some of the lectures were given to audiences morefamiliar with anthroposophy; these are the so-called \"private\"or \"members\" lectures. Other lectures, like the written works,were intended for the general public. The difference betweenthese, as Rudolf Steiner indicates in his Autobiography , is two- fold. On the one hand, the members' lectures take for granteda background in and commitment to anthroposophy; in thepublic lectures this was not the case. At the same time, themembers' lectures address the concerns and dilemmas of themembers, while the public work speaks directly out of Stein-er's own understanding of universal needs. Nevertheless, asRudolf Steiner stresses: \"Nothing was ever said that was notsolely the result of my direct experience of the growing con-tent of anthroposophy. There was never any question of con-cessions to the prejudices and preferences of the members.Whoever reads these privately printed lectures can take themto represent anthroposophy in the fullest sense. Thus it waspossible without hesitation\u2014when the complaints in thisdirection became too persistent\u2014to depart from the customof circulating this material 'for members only.' But it must beborn in mind that faulty passages do occur in these reportsnot revised by myself.\" Earlier in the same chapter, he states:\"Had I been able to correct them [the private lectures] therestriction for members only would have been unnecessary from the beginning.\"STEINER2 Black 97 Afterword 97 AFTERWORD Rudolf Steiner on Language: A View from Modern Linguistics I THE SPIRIT OF RUDOLF STEINER'S VIEWS ON LANGUAGE VERSUS THE GHOST OF MODERN LINGUISTICS The present book will be understandable in a general way to readers familiar with anthroposophy. They will read it as anextension of what they know of anthroposophy, the folk soul,and certain principles of Waldorf education. Such readers maybe suspicious of the technical remarks that I, a linguist-anthroposophist, must make to bring anthroposophy into anequilibrium with linguistics. I can promise, however, thatwhatever footnotes or minor corrections I may have to add toSteiner's thought these do not detract in any way from thevalue of his insights. At the same time, of course, general read-ers, interested either in language or Waldorf education, shouldeasily be able to nd their own way through the shoals of thesetwo somewhat specialized elds on the basis of commonsense. To someone familiar with the eld of linguistics and unfa- miliar with anthroposophy, on the other hand, some of RudolfSteiner's remarks may ring as strange half-truths. An historicallinguist will be impressed with Steiner's awareness of phoneticchange, Grimm's Law, and most of the accurate and very inter-esting etymologies he brings out, particularly in Lecture 5.(Though there may be some raising of scholarly eyebrows at aSTEINER2 Black 98 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 98 few of the possibly false etymologies.) But the non-anthroposo- phist linguist will not know what to make of concepts like thatof the folk soul, the ether body, the \"Genius of Language,\" orthe underlying assumption of \"thinking-feeling-willing\" andthe idea that the written word is dead in comparison to spokenlanguage. Generally, modern, scientic linguists dismiss the Bible as a reliable source of information and pay little, if any, attentioneither to the Creative Word of God in Genesis or to the task ofAdam in the Garden of Eden of giving every creature a name.They view the story of the Tower of Babel as a quaint, old-fash-ioned allegory to explain why there are about 5,000 languageson Planet Earth, and tend to associate the story of Pentecostand the Apostles' ability to \"speak in tongues\" either with med-ical hysteria or with modern people experiencing glossolaliawhen in a trance under mass hypnosis or some drug. Yet modern linguists would not be unanimous in their bewilderment upon reading Steiner and some may feel moreupset (or threatened) by some of Steiner's statements than byothers. In fact, many linguists are showing signs of becomingtired of treating language as an abstract algebra\u2014which hasbeen the prevailing mode in the USA since 1957\u2014and arewilling at least to admit that there is such a thing as poetry.Some linguists even write good poems, but when asked howthey achieved what they did, they cannot give an answer conso-nant with their beliefs about their discipline. They would prob-ably say that their writing ability is a special sort of\"performance\" or some unconscious talent they accidentallydeveloped. Why do we have this glaring gap? Is there a way to bridge it?To lay the ground for answers to these questions, I shall briefly characterize modern linguistics for the general readerunfamiliar with modern, academic linguistics.STEINER2 Black 99 Afterword 99 The eld of linguistics has become extremely technical dur- ing the second half of the twentieth century. Many majorstatements in the eld, such as Edward Sapir's Language and Leonard Bloomeld's similarly entitled book, appeared inAmerica only after Rudolf Steiner's death in 1925. The domi-nant philosophy behind such language analysis was behavior-ism, a mode of thinking imported from Russia, where IvanPavlov worked with the conditioned reflexes of dogs. 1 The stronghold of this movement in the USA was Johns HopkinsUniversity; Yale and other leading schools followed it. The development of the eld of linguistics took an even fur- ther, more drastic turn after 1957, when work on T ransforma-tional-Generative Grammar was begun at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology. 2 T ransformational-Generative Grammar [or TGG as it is called] deserves a brief characterization here as it is the prevail-ing mode of doing linguistics, not only in America but in othercountries as well. The basic idea of TGG is that underlying all sentences in all languages is an abstract calculus or propositional logic\u2014knownas \"deep structure\"\u2014from which various languages, by usingvarious actual sentences. These realsentences are called \"surface structures.\" How words are pro-nounced is a secondary matter. Chomsky, the inventor ofTGG, considers phonology \"interpretive.\" Actual meaning,too, used to be considered \"interpretive\" in TGG\u2014what mat-tered more than anything else was the abstract, set-theory base, 1. See Edward Sapir , Language (New York: Harcourt Brace and World, 1926); and Leonard Bloomeld , Language ( New York: Henry Holt & Co., See Noam A.Chomsky, Syntactic Structures (The Hague: Mouton, 1957); also Noam A. Chomsky, Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (Cambridge, MA.: MIT Press, 1965).STEINER2 Black 100 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 100 and heavily math-like \"deep structure\" of the sentences, the so- called \"deep syntax.\" Such a theory cannot account, forinstance, for a speaker's tone of voice\u2014whether what was saidwas said in jest or seriously. Facial gestures and hand motionsare considered irrelevant: they belong to \"performance.\" Thereal essence, according to the TGG view of language, is \"deepsyntax\"\u2014everything must be written. And yet sentences areviewed in isolation and not in paragraphs or chapters. They arenot seen as the steps in an unfolding story. Linguists embraced TGG for two reasons. First, because it was \"explicit,\" and second, because Chomsky's political atti-tude appealed to them during the War in Vietnam. TGG is very far removed from the anthroposophical view of language and makes sense only to those who, after a year ofintroductory courses in a graduate school, devote their atten-tion to T ransformational-Generative Grammar and its variousoffshoots. I have always considered it most removed from actual reality and have been arguing against it throughout my professionalcareer as a linguist. Reducing language to math-like logicalpropositions amounts to a lifeless, abstract atomization ofmeaning and must be seen as a result of the age of computer-ization that we inhabit. Nor is it the best way to computerizelanguage, as Chomsky used the early IBM models of the late'fties and the 'sixties at MIT . These by a number ofinternational developments, some of them actually a bit earlierthan Chomsky, some coeval, and some subsequent to itsappearance. In the United States, there is Tagmemics, a brand of linguis- tics actually antedating Chomsky and practiced by ProtestantSTEINER2 Black 101 Afterword 101 missionaries.3 Straticational Grammar, invented by Sydney M. Lamb, who united the philosophy of the Danish scholarLouis Hjelmslev with American structuralism, also deservesmention. 4 In the British Commonwealth, linguistics had been and con- tinues to be practiced along different lines. Following the leadof J.R. Firth, the main mover of linguistics in the Common-wealth has been Michael A.K. Halliday. 5 A powerful brand of Soviet mathematical linguistics grew up in Moscow under the leadership of Sebastian K. Shaumyan,who moved to the United States in 1975 and taught at YaleUniversity for ten years before his retirement. 6 The eld, then, is quite vast and complex\u2014comparing it to modern medicine, replete with general practitioners, pediatri-cians, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, gynecologists and psy-chiatrists, is not too great an exaggeration. None of thiswidely spread international scholarship, offering Ph.D. andM.A. degrees all over the United States and most other partsof the civilized world, existed at the time Steiner gave his sixlectures on language to the assembled Waldorf teachers inStuttgart\u2014although Indo-European studies were already a 3.

We must also bear in mind that Steiner's own formal educa- tion was not in the eld of linguistics .When he spoke about language, then, he did so both out of his general education\u2014which was exceptionally wide and rich and covered ancient his-tory, world literature, world philosophy\u2014and his own personalspiritual investigations. Unfortunately, the latter are not yet thekind of research avenue with whose results one can easily comeout and confront the international academic establishment. It is unarguable, however, that Steiner correctly identied language as that area of human consciousness which, if prop-erly understood and studied without the prejudices of the pre-vailing materialistic Weltanschauung, can lead to extremely valuable insights into the essential nature of human beings. Steiner viewed language as the expression of our THINKING, FEELING, and WILLING, the familiar trichotomy that runs through the entire edice of anthroposophical thought. It wasinconceivable to Rudolf Steiner to view language as an arbi-trary convention of consciously created symbols. Steiner wasafter something quite different. He sought the spiritual capac-ity of human beings to use their thinking, feeling, and willingthrough their voices to transmit contents of consciousness andto use their words as live entities that can eventually elevate usto the status of being co-creators with the spiritual world. I think it must be obvious at this point that the \"science of linguistics\" as we know it today, cannot even approximate thesegoals. Linguistics, in its various modes, is nevertheless one of the most important disciplines that human beings have devel-oped throughout the course of evolution because\u2014as I willsuggest in the concluding section of this afterword\u2014it is theprototypical consciousness soul discipline for our time which,STEINER2 Black 103 Afterword 103 if it is properly cultivated, will lead us to the ability to \"think about thinking,\" which is a spiritual activity of consciousnessin freedom. 7 I will now turn to the various aspects of language that Steiner mentions in his six lectures, in a somewhat topical order. II. PHONETIC CHANGE AND THE ETYMOLOGICAL MERRY-GO-ROUND Nothing can be more telling about Rudolf Steiner's depth of insight into widely disparate subjects, than the number of trou- vailles or \"hits\" he achieves in what is\u2014admittedly\u2014a merely improvised series of hastily arranged lectures at the request of anumber of friends. Few, if any, during the course of the pasttwo thousand years were able to do what Steiner did, day inand day out, during the entire course of his life. Language was no exception in this regard. Steiner's intui- tions, as seen from the vantage point of what we today consider 7. For \"Consciousness soul\" ( 1. Steiner describes there how the physical body is built up out ofphysical substances to meet the requirements of the thinking I. T o this end,the physical body is permeated by life forces, which constitute a \"life body\"or \"body of formative forces.\" As such, the living body opens to the senses,becoming a \"soul body.\" As \"sentient soul,\" it is open both to impressionsfrom the outer world and to thinking. Through this, it becomes \"mind\"soul. And when this \"mind soul\" opens to intuitions from above (as well assensations from below), it becomes the \"consciousness soul, the \"soul withinthe soul.\"The \"age of the consciousness soul\"\u2014when the I becomes active inhumanity\u2014is Rudolf Steiner's designation for the evolutionary state of con-sciousness entered by humanity around the end of the fteenth century.Georg K\u00fchlewind (see note 21) has suggested that the three prototypicalconsciousness soul disciplines are linguistics, psychology, and epistemology.STEINER2 Black 104 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 104 scientic linguistics were all on the right track, even if the sci- entic research of one hundred years has come up with somedetails that a non-specialist could not have been aware of in thenineteen twenties. One of the purposes of this Afterword is to indicate both the limitations of scientic linguistics and some of the inevitablegaps in the technical knowledge of this eld in anthroposophicalliterature in order that the outlines of a future synthesis may beattempted in a concluding section. T oday we know for certainthat a language cannot possibly be just a huge collection of data,whether stored on the magnetic tape of some recording device ortranscribed by hand using the International Phonetic Alpha-bet\u2014the IPA. We know that dening language as it was denedin the late forties by Bernard Bloch and George L. T rager, whileworking sufciently well for the eld anthropologist after WorldWar II in exotic places, is no longer really tenable in 1994. 8 Bloch and T rager wrote: \"A language is an arbitrary set of vocalnoises by means of which members of a speech communityinteract.\" Generations of structuralists were brought up with thisdenition of language, and people seldom challenged it. It is immediately noticeable that this denition is couched in terms of behaviorist psychology and that, as such, it is amaterialistic view of humankind's most precious possession,language. Whereas it is true that we all make \"vocal noises\" when we speak, language consists of far more than just speech sounds.We have ve thousand years of world literature to back up thisclaim: writing is an essential part of language. So is hand signingby the deaf and the use of Braille by the blind. Without gestures 8. Bernard Bloch and George L. T rager, Outline of Linguistic Analysis, Lin- guistic Society of America (Baltimore, MD: Waverley Press, 1942), reprintedin 1948.STEINER2 Black 105 Afterword 105 and facial expressions we would communicate like lifeless robots. Anybody who has ever watched an infant acquire lan-guage knows that gesturing, pointing, and making facial gri-maces can be highly communicative in a large number of highlyspecic situations. 9 If it is true\u2014as generally agreed upon by anthroposophists\u2014 that individual evolution or \"ontogenesis\" tends to recapitulategeneral human evolution or \"philogenesis,\" a point rst made bythe German biologist-philosopher Ernst Haeckel, it makes senseto imagine that ancient humanity communicated as much withgestures as it did with \"vocal noises\"\u2014that is, with the spokenword. Nor did this possibility go unnoticed. The great eighteenth century philosopher and professor of jurisprudence, Giambat-tista Vico, Italy's Goethe, expressly suggested that early humancommunication in the Divine Age was gestural .(Vico spoke \"Divine Age\" ofChaos\" which tend to repeat themselves cyclically.) 10 This view shows an awareness of the great yugas of Indian philosophy\u2014 also acknowledged by the early theosophists and later byanthroposophy, mutatis mutandis. If human communication was indeed originally gestural, then what gesture one made in order to say something couldnot have been a matter of an \"arbitrary choice\" in today's sense. Think of the beckoning motion, \"come toward me;\" the halting 9. See Michael A.K. Halliday , Learning How to Eugen B\u00e4r trans. (Cornell University Press, 1983). This is not the right placeto go into Vico's philosophy in depth, although numerous fruitful compari-sons exist between Vico's thought, Goethe's philosophy of life, and manyinsights offered by Rudolf Steiner in the anthroposophical literature. This is a subject which deserves detailed investigation in the not too distant future.STEINER2 Black 106 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 106 motion, \"stop;\" the waving motion, \"let us go;\" the kneeling position in prayer; the posture of hands extended upward togreet the rising sun; the hands held out in a gesture of healing orblessing .We may think of nature, too, as communicating through what we may call \"gestures\"\u2014lightning as an expressionof the \"wrath of heaven\" and a rainbow as a sign of peace. In thissense, Egyptian tomb painting and the comparatively staticnature of Egyptian art may also be thought of as gestural andsymbolic. But once modern language had developed, gesturingremained only as a secondary means of communication, includ-ing all the familiar gestures we may make ranging from the sub-lime\u2014as in church, for instance\u2014to the mundane. At a stage of development closer to our own, however, humanity learned to call actions, things and notions by NAMES (sounds) formed by the vocal chords and the articulatoryorgans inside the oral cavity. The \"arbitrariness\" of the relationship between CONCEPT and SOUND SEQUENCE is commonplace to anyone who has ever learned a foreign language. Is the concept of a 'dog' betterexpressed as dog(as in English) or better as Hund (as in Ger- man), or perhaps better yet as sobaka in Russian or chien in French? Perhaps, as Steiner suggests, the difference between dif-ferent words describing the same object in different languages isascribable to the fact that different aspects of the object are beingstressed. Nevertheless, the moment you do not call a dog 'bow-wow' or some other sound that tries to imitate a dog's barking,you have accepted the inescapable fact that today, 2,000 yearsafter Christ walked the earth, the relationship between conceptsand sound sequences certainly seems \"arbitrary.\" This was not always so. The phenomenon of ONOMATOPOEIA proves, internationally, that certain sounds express certain ideasbetter than others. The sounds nyam-nyam, due to the palatal nature of /y/ and the bilabial nature of /m/ stand in a closerSTEINER2 Black 107 Afterword 107 relation to 'eating' and 'that tastes good' than to 'anger' and 'kill- ing'; hit, strike, on the other hand, due to the voiceless /t/,/s/, and /k/ sounds imitate better the harshness of a violent blow. But just as a child outgrows the available sounds to embed its sensations in sound, so humanity, too, outgrew the availablesound inventory for its more abstract notions. Languages havetherefore evolved an ABSTRACT VOCABULARY. We use words as nouns such as situation, likelihood, plausibility, inventory, circum- navigation, apprehension, modus operandi andserendipity along with verbs such as approximate, rationalize, quantify, relinquish and the like alongside the older monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon onessuch as sit, run, swim, eat, love, die, etc. The science of linguistics in the West is commonly thought of as being coeval with the brothers Wilhelm and Jakob Grimmwho, starting in 1812 and 1820, began to collect and comparefairy tales in the Germanic languages and found that theyresembled each other a great deal. When Jakob Grimm extended this nding to the Germanic languages as a group, comparing it with Latin and Greek, hefound that the Germanic family, in its entirety, differed fromGreek and Latin (and also Sanskrit which was studied later) ina systematic way. Thus where Germanic had /f/, / / and /h/ (from an earlier /x/), Latin and Greek had /p/, and /k/, as in these Lat. per <IE *pereSTEINER2 Black 108 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 108 ve, f\u00fcnf : Gk. penta(gon), [Lat. quinque goes back to an : Lat. /k/) <IE *kmt\u00f3m This has become known as Grimm's Law. Steiner was, of course, very much aware of it, and draws many of his examplesfrom it. Indeed, in a most interesting and insightful way, heeven extends Grimm's two-step process to include a three stepprocess. Unfortunately, however, the technical complexitiesrequired to explain and comment upon this from the perspec-tive of contemporary linguistics would take us too far afieldand extend this Afterword beyond its reasonable bounds. In Grimm's Law, as depicted above, what Sets A/1, A/2 and A/3 indicate is called FRICATIVIZATION, i.e. the fact that Greek and Latin /p/, /t/, and /k/ correspond to the Germanic frica-tives /f/, // and /h/ (from an earlier /x/). At the same time Grimm noticed that Indo-European must have had a separate set of sounds, known as VOICED ASPIRATE STOPS which, in turn, became voiced but unaspirated stops in Germanic.\u00b0STEINER2 Black 109 Afterword 109 Thus B/1. brother, Bruder : Lat.

(g)noscere <IE*gno- Linguistics teaches that \"sounds change.\" It traces as closely as possible the way language sounds or phonemes change, butlinguists do not comment on the reason or the \"feeling\" thiscreates. Unlike Steiner's approach to language, linguistics is in no position to ask WHY THESE CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED and to what, if any, soul or consciousness qualities they correspond.Linguistics can trace the WHAT of language change, but hardly the WHY of it. It seems to linguists that Germanic hasn't lost very reconstructed soundsbased on the extant evidence of Greek, Latin and Sanskrit) withGermanic having received back /f/, / / and /h/ from the rst set; /p/, /k/ and from thelast. In other words *IE had a voiceless stop series, which wasfricativized in Germanic, but instead Germanic got a voicelessstop series back from the *IE voiced series, and, whereas the *IEaspirated series loses its /h/ and deaspirates in Germanic, such'aspiration' is regained in Germanic by the rst shift, in whichthe voiceless stops fricativize, that is, receive an /h/-like quality.\u00b0eSTEINER2 Black 111 Afterword 111 It is a systematic turn-around of three separate changes occur- ring at three separate times, since if the changes had alloccurred at the same time, we would have no words today suchasbrother, daughter andgoose; they would have to be *prother, *taughter, * koose, respectively, since /b/, /d/, \"Here proof,\" linguists words come /*dh/, and /*gh/!\" By the same Holmesian reasoning, our words today that have /p/, /t/, and /k/ in them, cannot possibly come from orig-inal *IE /*p/, /*t/ and /*k/ sounds, for if they had, they wouldhave changed into /f/, / / and /h/ and tooth andten.Another way of putting this is that these changes could have eaten each other up, if they had occurred inthe wrong order in time\u2014from our point of view, that is. Linguistics calls this RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY and must sat- isfy itself with a statement of facts as they are available by logi-cal reconstructions and calculus. Steiner characterizes German as having \"metamorphosed beyond\" English and Dutch. From Indo-European /d/ (as inLatin decem 'ten') the German language (by the second High German consonant shift) formed the word zehn which has an initial /ts/ affricate in place of the English /t/. Thus we have *IE/d/ > English /t/ > German /z/ = [ts]. In Steiner's view of the situation this further consonant change is viewable as a \"metamorphosis\" beyond English andDutch. Steiner also says that the additional changes thatoccurred made German more, as it were \"spiritualized\"; moreable to describe spiritual realities, and eventually more abstract.He says that, a hundred years before his time, the \"languagegenius\" of German was still more creative but that by the twen-tieth century it became abstract. He says that German wordSTEINER2 Black 112 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 112 order is quite free and that, in comparison, \"Western languages\" speak in stereotypes. It seems to me that whereas French, forinstance, is hard to play with, the English language, by virtue ofits vast vocabulary, has remained remarkably elastic and proneto innovation. (It is interesting to note that the ability ofEnglish to renew itself and always come up with new terms isheavily tied to the industrial civilization of the United Statesand to the innumerable brand names and technical terms thatlow and high tech industry has created. We are not coiningAnglo-Saxon words of the snow, man, woman, child type, but Latinate and Hellenistic ones such as transceiver, transduct, [or EVA], Lunar Orbit Rendezvous It is as if a second, computer-oriented \"language genius\"were at work at NASA and in the ofces of the Madison Avenuemotivational researchers.) Steiner's remark about the abstractness of German already in the 19th century rings true\u2014certainly, the language of the mostcomplicated modern philosophy has been German. Also, Ger-man, by borrowing far fewer Romance loan words than English,had to express its abstract ideas by combining Germanic mor-phemes. Thus we have Begriff from greifen from 'together' and 'hang' for 'connection', and so on. I will turn to Steiner's view on semantic change below. Before I do so, however, I must make one last comment.Steiner considers German Mutter 'mother' to be somehow more \"ancient\" than Latin mater, Greek meter, or Sanskrit mata. This is because, in his own spiritual investigation, Steiner perceives the sound /u/ as more primordial. As stated above, linguistics cannot agree or disagree with this. All one can say is that Steiner is talking about something else,something on a different plane which is not fathomable by dia-lectical consciousness. If it had anything to say at all, linguisticswould have to say that modern German Mutter and EnglishSTEINER2 Black 113 Afterword 113 mother are both considerably \"younger\" formations than either the Greek, Latin or Sanskrit, and that the Indo-European recon-struction for 'mother' was *mater. Out of the thirty Indo-Euro- pean languages cited by Buck only Old High German andMiddle High German have an /u/ sound in muodar andmuoder, respectively. 11 The logic-based linguistic evidence would seem to indicate, then, that any German form with an /u/ is a rela-tively recent Germanic innovation not shared by the othercoeval languages and by none of the attested ancient ones. Whence this feeling on Steiner's part, then, that German is the closest to the true sound for 'mother' because of the /u/ sound? As the creator of the new art of Eurythmy, Steiner used his clairvoyant capabilities to perceive how the gestures and move-ments of the human being could express the living reality ofvowels and consonants. A spiritual scientist, he had investigatedthe supersensible nature underlying language as we know it.And as a consequence of such researches, he was able to speak inways inaccessible to one without his developed faculties. These may be entirely valid in their own right. In other words, the German word Mutter, due to its /u/ sound, may be \"truer\" to the spiritual reality than any other Indo-Europeanword for 'mother.' What this, however, does NOT mean is that other female speakers of Indo-European languages had some-how less love for their children or that German is older or inany sense \"purer\" than Persian, Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, etc., noris Steiner suggesting anything of the kind. This needs to be made absolutely clear above all because one of anthroposophy's most vulnerable points is a certain Germano-centrism. Well-read anthroposophists are aware, of course, that 11. Carl Darling Buck, A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages (University of Chicago Press, 1949), paperback edition 1988.STEINER2 Black 114 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 114 Steiner maintains in several places that whereas the initiation language of antiquity was Classical Greek, the modern languageof initiation is German. There is a certain justication for such aview, if we look at the extant body of philosophy in antiquityand in modern times. From Thales and Anaximandros to Platoand Aristotle and beyond, ancient philosophy\u2014in the West\u2014was indeed written in Greek, and in German. Nor can we, as linguists, have the least idea what language might have been like in most ancient times, before historicalrecords. Linguistics can go no farther than 2000 B.C. at best. The oldest Vedic texts are dated 1200 B.C., and only after World War II did Ventris and Chadwick succeed in England in breaking thecode of 'Linear B' found on Crete, which is a few hundred yearsolder and is considered as imported from peninsular Mycae-naean Greek to the island of Crete. III. STEINER ON SEMANTIC CHANGE It is in the area of semantic change\u2014the changes that occur in the meaning of a word throughout time\u2014that Steiner'singenuity reveals itself at its best. He has correctly anticipatedone of the most important insights of twentieth century schol-arship and that is the observation of the fact that meaningchange progresses from the concrete towards the abstract withpractically no exceptions .12 (This is, alas, not to say that all practicing linguists understand or appreciate this point. If theydid, we would be closer to closing the gap between academiclinguistics and spiritual science.)STEINER2 Black 115 Afterword 115 All of Steiner's examples on this subject are brilliant and true, with just a couple of minor unchecked improvisations which Iwill point out below. The English lorddoes indeed derive from 'loaf-ward' [he who guards the bread or livelihood of a group] and ladydoes indeed derive from 'loaf-kneader' [she who prepares 'proud' does expression Hagestalt 'conrmed bachelor' does indeed mean 'he who has been stood in the hedge [havinginherited nothing else as the younger brother and who is there-fore too poor to marry]'. Indeed, even entirely abstract motions,such as the word abstract itself, derive from physical images such as ab-'away' and traho, trahere, which has been pulled fur- ther away, carried off to a distance'. What was perhaps somewhat less clear in 1920 and 1925 than today is the enormously increased role of the English lan-guage in the ever accelerating spread and scope of world events. Everything that Steiner said to the assembled Waldorf teach- ers about language, using German as his example, would seemto t English even more. The translators are, of course, aware ofthis and many helpful remarks as interjections in parenthesesprove their awareness. If any language in the history of the world shows the organic amalgamation of formerly separate \"national geniuses\"\u2014lin-guists would say \"semantic and grammatical structures\"\u2014it isEnglish. Whatever amount of Southern European, Christian-ity-based expressions\u2014from Latin via French\u2014German may 12. der Semasiologie (Heidelberg: Akademis- cher Verlag, 1952). same subject see Adam Makkai Idiom Struc- ture in English (The Hague: Mouton, 1972) in which the development from the concrete to the abstract is documented in great detail.STEINER2 Black 116 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 116 have assimilated (e.g. predigen 'to of these is dwarfed by the massive onslaught that English had to assimi-late in the wake of the Norman conquest of 1066. It has often been remarked that if an extra-terrestrial visitor had to make a report on the English language by scanning theprinted literature, the report would state that Great Britain,Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, plus alarge number of countries from India to Kenya where Englishis a second joint ofcial language due to the colonial past,speak a neo-Romance language closely related to Spanish,French, Italian, Portuguese and Rumanian with some sort of anarchaic residue that distantly resembles German and the otherGermanic languages. This is no exaggeration. The reader is encouraged to try to translate into \"pure Germanic English\" common expressionssuch as anthroposophy, anthropology, geology, geography, gynecology, podiatrist, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, lunation, situation, aban-don\u2014 to mention just a few. It can be done, but the results look funny. The fact of the matter is that the Graeco-Latin-Romancelayer of English lexis carries the notions of \"professionalism\" and\"reliability,\" while the Anglo-Saxon-Germanic of amateurism and of a rough-hewn, home-spun nature. Steiner's general insight that the abstract vocabulary of today evolved out of concrete experiences of the past can perhaps bebest illustrated with the Indo-European root *wed. Its extant cognates wit'intelligence' and witness 'some one who knows something because he or she has seen it'.The second Germanic consonant shift changed the /t/ presentin English and the /d/ present in Sanskrit and into /s/ or 'science'.STEINER2 Black 117 Afterword 117 Why is this such a telling example? Because if 'to see' and 'to know' are cognate\u2014and they demonstrably are\u2014the modern English saying I see what you mean meaning \"I understand your point\" makes perfect sense, even if it is said by a blind person. The original faculty of \"sight\"need not have been purely physical, as it is today for mosthuman beings in the waking state of logical consciousness.Originally, perhaps, one also \"saw\" things in clairvoyance, astate of consciousness distantly and distortedly related to today'sdream-consciousness. The contemporary, purely descriptive semantic spread of this etymon proves Steiner's point in a way that even the mostsceptical, behavioristic-materialistic linguist would have toconcede the point . Insight has precious little to do with the physical ability to look into a hidden place with some sort ofa mechanical device such as a telescope \u2014it much ratherrefers to \"sudden comprehension,\" to the \"ability to perceive apreviously hidden connection between two things or ideas.\" We also say seeing is believing. The task facing the scientic linguist is to believe that the ancients saw things such as thehuman aura. Anthropologically interested linguists may toleratethe concept of a 'human aura,' for instance among the YaquiIndians of the Sonora desert, but much less in the class room ofa North American University. IV. IDIOMATICITY AS THE BEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND RUDOLF STEINER'S VIEW OF LANGUAGE An idiom is a xed expression whose meaning does not logically derive from the sum of its parts and which projects a particularSTEINER2 Black 118 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 118 image. I have written a major book on the subject, based on a Yale Ph.D., and have edited several dictionaries of idioms.13 As anybody fluent in English will agree, idiomatic expres- sions are livelier and more popular than the pedantic para-phrases one can assign to them in a dictionary. The Englishlanguage is perhaps one of the very richest in idioms. The recentedition of the Dictionary of American English Idioms mentioned in the above footnote has well over 8,000 entries in it. As speakers of English, we much prefer saying he gave up to 'he ceased trying'; we rather say John always gives in instead of 'he tends to surrender his will'. My car gave out on me is much preferred to the pedantic 'it stopped functioning' and we rathersaywhy bring up that unpleasant subject to 'why mention it'. Each of the idioms involved is the result of a semantic forcealive in English today to say with short Anglo-Saxon wordswhat would otherwise require a lengthy, poly-syllabic Franco-Latin or Hellenistic paraphrase. The short Anglo-Saxon wordsinvariably create an image. He threw in the towel allows you to see how someone quits a ght\u2014you can see the gesture of thewet towel hitting the floor and the defeated boxer or wrestlerleaving in disgust. All of these were live imaginations in the not-too-distant past of English. Yet it is unfortunately true that, as Steinerimplies throughout, these idioms tend to rigidify into schematathat eventually stand in the way of original thought. T oo manypeople use idiomatic speech without realizing what the under-lying image is or was. One can see this in fluent English lan-guage users who weren't born in the United States. They caneasily say he'll never get to rst base andhe's got two strikes against 13. See Makkai Idiom Structure in English, op. cit., as well as A Dictionary of American English Idioms, 3rd revised and updated edition (Hauppauge, N.Y.: Barron's Educational Series, 1995).STEINER2 Black 119 Afterword 'he'll never succeed in getting anywhere' and 'he is out if he makes one more mistake' without realizing whatthese expressions refer to in the game of baseball. People apeexpressions such as that will put the icing on the cake meaning 'that will put the nishing touch or crown on a given job' whilehaving never iced a cake in a kitchen themselves. Thus for human consciousness the idiom is a double-edged sword. In positive terms, it is an image, still alive in manyplaces, that replaces a Latinate or Hellenistic abstraction. Onthe negative side, it can become a lifeless clich\u00e9, mimed andaped by people under peer pressure who actually do not havean image in mind at all. Steiner shows great insight into what linguistics calls IRRE- VERSIBLE BINOMIALS. These include expressions such as part and parcel, drawn and quartered, nip and tuck, touch and go, and lit- erally hundreds of others. Steiner is correct in pointing out thatsuch doublets arise because speakers were not satised eitherwith the rst word or with the second by itself, so they soughtan interim solution and came up with the doublet. (The reasonlinguists call them 'irreversible' is that they always go in theorder given. We do not say parcel and part, for instance.) One more remark about the development of the 'Ego' and verb conjugation: Steiner writes that loves, we love, you(pl.) love, they love' indicates a period in our development whenthe sense of individuality was less developed. Since it was stillweak, people did not express it as the separate word 'I', 'You','He/She', etc., but added it as a sufx to the verb. Later, when the'I' became stronger, more \"incarnated\" in humans, the inflec-tional endings gradually dropped off and people began express-ing the person that was meant. Thus today in English we have I love, YOU love, HE/SHE loves, WE love, YOU love, THEY love.STEINER2 Black 120 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 120 This is certainly well worth considering. Standard linguistics does not consider the Ego or I in anthro- posophical terms\u2014most linguists would at best think of Sig-mund trichotomy of the Super-Ego, the Ego and the Idand most would probably even regard these as inessential for ascientic linguistics. [In fact, the eld of psycholinguistics hasnot yet even begun to look at the unconscious. Very few lin-guists are concerned with phenomena such as the so-calledFreudian slip. However, certain permutations of the three Freud-ian ego-states have shown up in T ransactional Psychoanalysis inwhich we speak of a Parental, and Adult, and Child-like Ego-state. 14 These can, at least, offer some explanation as to why some people act superior and judgmental (parental), adequateand matter-of-fact (adult) or submissive and playful, or creative(child-like). But grammar has no explanation for the \"tones ofvoice\" carried by these emotional states.] T o say, then, that the Iwas less incarnated in ancient humanity than in modern people,goes far beyond the most daring statement that even Carl Jungmight have made, whose idea of the 'collective unconscious' isstill ridiculed by many. Standard linguistics explains\u2014or tries to explain\u2014the grad- ual loss of personal endings on verbs due to phonological con-ditioning. The accent moved to the front; the last syllable wasmurmured and, eventually, forgotten. French still writes manyof them but doesn't pronounce them. 14. See Eric Berne Games People Play (New York: Grove Press, 1966). Also compare T.A. Harris, I'm OK\u2014You're OK (New York: Harper & Row, 1967). In my book Ecolinguistics (London: Pinter Publishers and Budapest: Akad\u00e9miai kiad\u00f3, 1993), I devoted a separate chapter to the distortions oflogic (Chapter #4) preceded by a chapter (Chapter #2) on the relationshipof linguistics to its mother discipline, anthropology, which, if properlyexpanded, might be able to absorb individual as well as social psychologywhich would be a healthy step toward an understanding of real speech.STEINER2 Black 121 Afterword 121 Generally, everything Steiner posits an inner reason for, materialistic modern scholarship seeks to explain by offeringsome exterior reason. Steiner views 'Umlaut' [the changing ofsingular into plural by vowel the pure sound to a murky one\u2014a movement paralleling the shift in attention from aconcretely observed fact or sensation to something that can-not be so closely observed. Standard linguistics, once more,offers an external explanation and insists that in pre-OldEnglish, for instance, the dative of goose wasgosiand that it was this nal /i/ sound that affected the long /e/ and caused itto change into a long /o/ written -ee-which, then, after the Great Vowel Shift [between 1,400 and 1,500] became pro-nounced /iy/ as in today's pronunciation /giys/. V. LINGUISTICS AS THE \"CONSCIOUSNESS SOUL\" DISCIPLINE PAR EXCELLENCE Speculation about language is as old as humanity itself. Plato discussed it; Dante wrote about it. In ancient India, the grammarian Panini wrote the world's most completegrammar to this day on Sanskrit in 500 B.C. Unfortunately, the West only discovered it in the nineteenth century. In ancient China there were many excellent dictionaries, far antedating the thesaurus concept that was invented in the Westin England in the nineteenth century by Roget. The subject isso complex and so multifarious that a comprehensive history oflinguistics, in spite of many valiant attempts, is still missing.STEINER2 Black 122 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 122 Modern linguistics, as we know it, was a German invention and it started, as indicated above, with the Brothers Grimmaround 1812. The eld was quite understandably, somewhatGerman-centered. Indo-European itself was known as Indo-Germanic. Scholars were unaware of the fact that the Compar-ative Method was, in fact, invented by a Hungarian Jesuit inthe later eighteenth century who compared Hungarian (orMagyar) to Lappish. 15 The German linguistics of the nineteenth century was a pri- marily philologically based enterprise. Its practitioners wereconcerned primarily with Latin and Greek; readings and inter-pretations of the Iliad and the Odyssey were normal fare besides the Latin classics. Neither should we forget that the excavationof T roy and Mycenae were German contributions to archeol-ogy and to our understanding of our common European andNear Eastern heritage. 16 Yet the discovery of Sanskrit as an integral part of Indo-European was Hungarian Language with languages of FinnishOrigin], G\u00f6ttingen, 1799; this was actually preceded by the work of J\u00e1nosSajnovics (1753-1785) who published his book on a similar 1770:Demonstratio Idioma Ungarorum et Lapponum idem esse [A Demonstration that the Language of the Hungarians and the Lapps is the Same].16. Heinrich N. Schliemann (1822-1890) was the excavator of T roy and ofMycaenae. J. Hermann, Heinrich Schliemann, Wegbereiter einer neuen Wissenschaft , 1974. 17. Sir William Jones (1746-1794) read his famous statement in the Royal Asiatic Society about the striking relationship between Greek, Latin andSanskrit many years before the Brothers Grimm started their comparativework in Germany. The actual relevance of Sanskrit, however, was not fullyappreciated until the middle of the nineteenth century, when some of themost outstanding Indo-Europeanists who also knew Themost Sanskritist in the English speaking world during this periodwas William Dwight Whitney (1827-1894)STEINER2 Black 123 Afterword 123 The French, too, have been prominent in Indo-European studies. The names of Ferdinand De Saussure (1857-1913),and Antoine Meillet (1866-1936) must be mentioned in thisregard (with De Saussure having been a Francophone Swiss). It is generally held that De Saussure is the father of modern linguistics. What do we mean by this? It is in the collected lec-tures by De Saussure entitled Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [A Course in General Linguistics] (several English translations exist;the standard one by Wade Baskin is now supplanted by that ofRoy Harris) that the famous principle of the arbitrariness of therelationship between the 'signier' and the 'signied' is expressedfor the rst time. Whereas Plato had already considered the mat-ter in antiquity and decided that words came by their soundsand their meanings more by convention or nomos than by their nature or physis , 18 no scientic statement of world-wide accep- tance was made on this matter before De Saussure. In De Saussure's view the LINGUISTIC SIGN is a double-bodied entity consisting of a 'concept' or the 'signied' (in French le sig- ni\u00e9) and a 'sound sequence' as the 'signier' ( in French le signiant .) The two form an inseparable entity: You can take away the one only at the expense of removing the other as well. Ifyou imagine a 'cat' as the concept and think of the various namesvarious languages call the same animal from German Katze 17. Whitney was an advanced graduate student still in his early twenties, was sent from Yale to Germany to study with B\u00f6htlingk in G\u00f6ttingen by ProfessorEdward Salisbury who, upon Whitney's return to Yale, resigned his chair andendowed a chair for Indo-European studies at Yale with Whitney as its rstholder. Yale University has been one the world's leading centers for Indo-European studies internationally and in the USA in particular, with as century.18. See Francis P . Dinneen An Introduction to General Linguistics (New York: Holt Rinehart & Winston, 1967) ,in which he carefully explains the ancient \"physis-nomos\" controversy in Plato's days.STEINER2 Black 124 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 124 through English catto French chatand Russian koska, you will readily see that it is futile to think that the one sound sequence issomewhat more \"feline\" or cat-like than any one of the others. We are, therefore, in the twentieth century and beyond, in the state of consciousness where arbitrariness prevails as the pri-mary force that holds a concept and its expression together. We live in a daytime, waking, logical mode of object-con- sciousness but, since we are in contact with foreign languages,we may have all had experiences of nding out what words canstand for in a language we do not know. Let us consider a brief set of words from Indonesian or 'Bahasa Indonesia' the ofcial language of over 200 millionpeople in the Republic of Indonesia, a country of thousands ofislands. (If you know the language skip this paragraph; if youdo not, try to guess what the words mean and DO NOT rush to an Indonesian dictionary): 1. anjing 2. kuching 3. kerbau belum 23. didalam 24. apa 25. daripada From this set of words you can construct the following sen- tences (in the right order, of course): (1) Have you had yourmeal (eaten yet), Sir? (2) I will not drink milk. (3) Please have aseat. (4) Good morning, Sir! (5) Good evening, Sir! (6) Are youmarried yet, Sir? (7) Yes, I am already (married). (8) No, I amnot yet (married). (9) I will/want to drink coffee. Black 125 Afterword 125 What are the odds that, without knowing which word means what, a person not knowing Indonesian will be able to producethese sentences? You will agree, I believe, that they are innitesi-mally small. Why were certain words on this twenty-ve wordlist not used in the making of the nine Indonesian sentences?What is the meaning of the words anjing, kuching andkerbau? 20 As this short exercise of looking at an unfamiliar language will indicate, arbitrariness stares us in the face rst and foremostwhen we are dealing with a language we do not know. Once theinstructor or our new neighbors have told us what certain wordsmean, the arbitrariness of the new words gradually fades awayand we develop a feeling of naturalness for them. After a year ortwo in Indonesia, if some one tries to tell us that kuching means 'water buffalo', we will probably vigorously defend the meaning'cat' with as much passion as if some one were trying to tell usthatsassafras means 'gold bullion'. Arbitrariness in the concept- sound relationship is part and parcel of the human condition inthe fth culture of the fth post-Atlantian epoch. But, as anthroposophy tells us, this was not always the case.Rudolf Steiner reminds us that the spoken word used to have creative power .When God said 'let there be light', light came into being by the power of this word. And, certainly, the Elo-him, mentioned in the Old Testament, could use the power oftheir creative words. Similarly, when Christ Jesus says to theparalyzed man \"gather up thy bed and walk\" He uses the Powerof the Word as no one alive today can, but He does so in accor-dance with the destiny of each specic person He chooses tocure. The words of the Elohim and of Christ Jesus had a specialpower all their own, but this power was not used out of con-text\u2014quite the contrary. The Elohim and Christ Jesus usedtheir Words carefully. 20. They are 'dog', 'cat' and 'water buffalo', respectively.STEINER2 Black 126 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 126 This situation resembles, if only vaguely, the \"arbitrariness\" of a foreign word. The context of Indonesian society creates aclimate on the Indonesian islands in which kuching means 'cat' and not 'dog' or 'water buffalo'. The foreigner who can dis-cover this fact and use these words in wise accordance withtheir use by the Indonesians, in a sense accepts the 'karma' ofthese words and inwardly agrees to accept them as they areused by the native speakers. If this were not so, nobody couldever become fluent in a second language and speak it with anymanner of believability. In writing these lines in English, a sec-ond language to me, I no longer ght the battle of the \"arbi-trariness\" issue that English words used to confront me withwhen I rst came to the United States from Hungary at theage of twenty-one. The once very real arbitrariness of apple, pear, spoon andforkis now replaced by condence that these sounds are right for these concepts \u2014in other words they havebecome second nature to me, just as are their Hungarianequivalents alma, k\u00f6rte, kan\u00e1l andvilla which will undoubt- edly sound arbitrary to someone who knows no Hungarian.But something downright magical has occurred by my con-quering my own resistance to the words that were once foreignto me\u2014whether in Indonesian or in English\u2014and this abilityto overcome the resistance to what seemed \"arbitrary\" hasenabled me to gain membership in the new speech communityof English speakers. It is as if a bit of the karma of the English language had rubbed off on me, a newcomer to this great tongue. But this is still mini-magic and rather mundane. We still cannot make water flow out of a rock like Moses or SaintLadislas of Hungary in the early thirteenth century, and wecannot heal the sick by commanding them to \"gather up thybed and walk!\" We linguists, no matter how many languageswe manage to learn poorly or well, are still captives of daytimeSTEINER2 Black 127 Afterword 127 waking logical consciousness and our words miserably fail when we want them to work magic. In fact, the situation is far worse than I have indicated.Let us consider the problem of pollution for a moment.We think of the Exxon-Valdez oil spill in Alaska as a major natural disaster, and the Green Movement is actively trying tosave the environment in many places the world over. Yet thearea of language has sustained pollution levels that far exceedanything in the natural world. Seven decades of Soviet Com-munism created lies and distortions of mega-Orwellian propor-tions, not to mention Hitlerian Nazi propaganda and what itdid to language. When the Park Service of Yellowstone Park has to kill hun- dreds of elk, they talk about \"direct reduction.\" The word 'kill'or 'shoot' sounds too tangible, too bloody. These euphemisms ofofcialese abound in every sector of modern American society. In an allegedly free society, such as the United States, three decades after the assassination of President John F . Kennedy westill do not really know what took place. It is possible in 1994to write thousands of pages in Pentagonese and State Depart-mentese with very little common sense shining through thepages. We talk about gun control and universal health cover-age, but very little actual meaning seeps through the rhetoricand the verbiage. At the same time, we have become creators of articial lan- guages. No self-respecting college student likes to admit ifthey are computer-illiterate and cannot write a term paper ona personal computer. Supermarket check-out personnel movethe merchandise past an electric lens that reads the price codedin bars\u2014no words or gures are used any more. We havedeveloped the intelligence to alter reality around us. Theindustry brags of this and calls it the long awaited advent ofthe \"information highway\" and \"virtual reality.\"STEINER2 Black 128 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 128 If this trend continues, and the wares become cheaper, gen- erations of young people will grow up who not only will notknow what it is like to pick an apple from a tree\u2014chances arethey won't even go to a supermarket any more to buy one.Instead, they will touch a place on their television screen andnext day some device will deliver some canned apple juice totheir door for which they will pay no real cash but punch in acode in their interactive television set and pay with some pointsthat are kept track of by yet another computer. We have come a dreadfully long way from the time when some one with the power to do so could say \"gather up thy bedand walk!\" And yet this is the time in the history of humanity when lin- guistics became possible on a level of consciousness where we are beginning to think about thinking .And that, as Georg K\u00fchlewind would remind us, is a prototypical consciousnesssoul activity of our time. 21 Modern linguistics will eventually have to give up its abstract, set-theoretical orientation which claims that it is a great 'men-talist revolution' against the 'Bloomeldian mechanists' asChomsky and his followers have been doing. We must learn notto see some kind of real conscious intelligence in computers; wemust start using them against Ahrimanic thinking. Linguistics will have to move closer and closer to an under- standing of where our verbal signs come from: The auditoryworld, the visual-imaginative world, the tactile world, theabstract world of reasoning, or from the forgotten past of ata-vistic imaginative clairvoyance. Linguistics must stop being amaterialistic, abstract enterprise. 21. See the following books by Georg K\u00fchlewind: Stages of Consciousness, 1984; Becoming Aware of the Logos, 1985; and The Life of the Soul, 1990 (Hudson, N.Y.: Lindisfarne Press).STEINER2 Black 129 Afterword 129 and speech-formation training,\u2014and indeed everyone\u2014would dowell to learn a bit of articulatory and acoustic phonetics andphonology for the practical transcription of spoken languages.The study of comparative linguistics [Indo-European or oth-erwise] can only help in telling apart false cognates that hap-pen to sound right, from the ones that are harder to ferret outand justify. Terms such as 'Umlaut' and 'Ablaut' have a vastand impressive scholarly literature going back to nineteenthcentury Germany, and people should be aware of the generallayout of the eld of linguistics. I sincerely hope that these remarks will kindle at least a minimal interest in Linguistics among anthroposophists anda similar interest in Rudolf Steiner's immensely interestingphilosophy in the general public and among linguists whotend to be far too entrenched in the narrow connes of theirlogic-bound daily discipline.

Das Doppel THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 132bio Black 133 Lecture One 133 THE FOUNDATIONS OF WALDORF EDUCATION THE FIRST FREE WALDORF SCHOOL opened its doors in Stuttgart, Germany, in September, 1919, under the auspices ofEmil Molt, the Director of the Waldorf Astoria Cigarette Com-pany and a student of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual science and partic-ularly of Steiner's call for social renewal. It was only the previous year\u2014amid the social chaos following the end of World War I\u2014that Emil Molt, responding to Steiner'sprognosis that truly human change would not be possible unless asufcient number of people received an education that developedthe whole human being, decided to create a school for his workers'children. Conversations with the Minister of Education and withRudolf Steiner, in early 1919, then led rapidly to the forming ofthe rst school. Since that time, more than six hundred schools have opened around the globe\u2014from Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Holland,Belgium, Great Britain, Norway, Finland and Sweden to Russia,Georgia, Poland, Hungary, Rumania, Israel, South Africa, Austra-lia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Japan etc.\u2014making the Wal-dorf School Movement the largest independent school movementin the world. The United States, Canada, and Mexico alone nowhave more than 120 schools. Although each Waldorf school is independent, and although there is a healthy oral tradition going back to the rst Waldorfteachers and to Steiner himself, as well as a growing body of sec-ondary literature, the true foundations of the Waldorf methodand spirit remain the many lectures that Rudolf Steiner gave onthe subject. For ve years (1919-24), Rudolf Steiner, while simul-taneously working on many other fronts, tirelessly dedicated him-self to the dissemination of the idea of Waldorf education. Hegave manifold lectures to teachers, parents, the general public, andeven the children themselves. New schools were founded. TheMovement grew.bio Black 134 THE GENIUS OF LANGUAGE 134 While many of Steiner's foundational lectures have been trans- lated and published in the past, some have never appeared inEnglish, and many have been virtually unobtainable for years. Toremedy this situation and to establish a coherent basis for WaldorfEducation, Anthroposophic Press has decided to publish the com-plete series of Steiner lectures and writings on education in a uni-form series. This series will thus constitute an authoritativefoundation for work in educational renewal, for Waldorf teachers,parents, and educators generally. .......
