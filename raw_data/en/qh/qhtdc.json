In America, this is sometimes associated with \"hippie culture\" or even witchcraft, but when you dig deeper into the history of crystal healing, its roots go back much further than western society. Admittedly, there is not much concrete evidence to support crystal healing as a form of medicine; that being said, this concept has been central to many cultures around the world for centuries. [Egyptian culture](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&context=honorstheses) especially is known for its use of amulets and talismans as a form of medicine, and kings in [Ancient India](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1283&context=honorstheses) were known to adorn certain jewels to ward off evil. The [original idea](https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html) behind crystal healing was that each different type of crystal corresponded to a specific type of energy or chakra, and holding that crystal would effect your body's energy in a specific way. This practice is largely based on concepts like [chi from Chinese culture or chakras from Hinduism](https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html), which both are intended to connect the spiritual with the physical body. For thousands of years, crystal healing has had an impact on holistic medicine, especially in eastern cultures, but as it has made its way into western society, it has not found the same popularity. [Scientists around the world](https://www.livescience.com/40347-crystal-healing.html) have declared it as a pseudoscience or suggesting that it is a placebo treatment. This concept is difficult to prove either way, since evidence is difficult to obtain experimentally. Most studies have been conducted based on anecdotal evidence or study of crystal therapy's influence on unique cultures. In western society, particularly America, crystal therapy has evolved into a new age trend with different intentions. Small \"hippie\" shops across the country have begun selling these crystals with info cards, describing their energy and possible benefits to eager buyers. This practice is disconnected from the original purpose, as it has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. Now, crystal jewelry and \"beginner training\" pamphlets line most gift shops in tourist hot spots in the US. However, there is one instance where it is used medicinally that is worth mentioning. A few years ago, [two Buzzfeed employees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV67v0XqGPg), both of which deal with chronic pain, tried crystal therapy to help with their debilitating pain. One (Lara) has severe [endometriosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354656#:~:text=Endometriosis%20(en%2Ddoe%2Dme,the%20tissue%20lining%20your%20pelvis.), or abnormal growth of endometrium tissue, and the other (Kelsey) has Trigeminal Neuralgia, which is characterized by severe pain of the face and jaw (it is nicknamed the Suicide Disease for a reason). The healer that they visited used crystals and deep meditation to combat their chronic pain, and Lara reported feeling relief after just one session. Given that endometriosis comes with a lot of muscle cramping, the relief could very well have come from the deep meditation, which Lara mentioned in the video, but after dealing with her condition for so long, it was a welcome break for her. Kelsey unfortunately did not have the same result, which is expected considering that her pain comes from a surgical complication (severed trigeminal nerve). If you haven't seen Lara and Kelsey's series on chronic pain, I would highly recommend watching it! Obviously, we cannot confirm whether or not crystal healing is a legitimate form of medicine with positive experimental results, but if patients who undergo crystal therapy feel relief from their pain, there is truly no harm to this therapy. As long as it is done with respect to the cultures from which it originated, then bring on "}
