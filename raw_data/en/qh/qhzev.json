Pignatelli of Lenox in the 188th General Court (and submitted as H.B. 930 in the 189th General Court), to the Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) for review.1 Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 3, section 38C requires CHIA to review and evaluate the potential fiscal impact of each mandated benefit bill referred to the agency by a legislative committee. WHAT DOES THE BILL PROPOSE? H.B. 3972 requires health insurance plans to \"provide benefits for acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment in the areas of pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse treatment, and nausea.\" Further, the bill states that \"no third party payer of health care services shall differentiate reimbursement rates for acupuncture services by provider type. Only licensed acupuncturists or medical doctors shall be reimbursed for acupuncture services.\" MEDICAL EFFICACY OF ACUPUNCTURE FOR SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES While there are thousands of published studies on the efficacy of acupuncture, high-quality controlled clinical trials are still needed to evaluate its value for treatment of many symptoms and conditions. However, there is sufficient evidence drawn solely from peer-reviewed western-based research publications to conclude that acupuncture is an effective treatment for a variety of diagnoses included in the bill, including certain pain management conditions, certain cases of nausea and vomiting, and certain substance abuse conditions. There is also evidence acupuncture is an effective treatment when used in conjunction with traditional therapies for certain types of pain management, nausea and vomiting, and substance abuse treatment. Finally, there is little evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for PTSD, although preliminary studies have suggested that acupuncture may be effective for this condition; additional studies are currently underway to confirm these outcomes. This review found no published studies comparing the relative quality of these services when provided by licensed acupuncturists and by licensed physicians. CURRENT COVERAGE According to responses to a carrier survey, acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment are generally not covered. However, two large carriers, together covering over sixty percent of the commercially covered lives in Massachusetts, allow self-insured employer groups to cover acupuncture benefits, and some carriers cover acupuncture under certain exceptional circumstances with pre-authorization. One large carrier began offering acupuncture as a standard medical benefit in most of its fully-insured policies as of January 2015. 1 The 188th General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, House Bill 3972, \"An Act relative to the practice of acupuncture\". Accessed 16 December 2014: https://malegislature.gov/Bills/188/House/H3972. In the 189th General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, House Bill 930; accessed 16 March 2015: https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H930.2 Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of Acupuncture center for health information and analysisCOST OF IMPLEMENTING THE BILL If enacted, H.B. 3972 will require all fully-insured commercial health insurance policies in Massachusetts to include coverage for acupuncture services in the areas of pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nausea, and substance abuse. H.B. 3972 does not limit carriers' ability to apply medical necessity criteria or set coverage limits. Requiring coverage for this benefit by fully-insured health plans would result in an average annual increase, over five years, to the typical member's monthly health insurance premiums of between $0.38 (0.08%) and $0.76 (0.16%) per year. The Massachusetts Division of Insurance in consultation with the Health Connector will need to be consulted to provide an analysis of estimated state liability associated with a given proposed mandated benefit bill. PLANS AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED BENEFIT MANDATE Individual and group accident and sickness insurance policies, corporate group insurance policies, and HMO coverage issued pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws would be subject to this proposed mandate. Based on input from the bill sponsor, this review assumes self-insured and fully-insured plans operated by the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) for the benefit of public employees and their dependents would also be subject to the mandate. The proposed benefit mandate would apply to members covered under the relevant plans, regardless of whether they reside within the Commonwealth or merely have their principal place of employment in the Commonwealth. PLANS NOT AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED BENEFIT MANDATE Self-insured plans (i.e., where the employer or policyholder retains the risk for medical expenses and uses a third-party administrator or insurer only to provide administrative functions) are subject to federal law and not to state-level health insurance benefit mandates. State health benefit mandates do not apply to Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans, the benefits of which are qualified by Medicare. These mandates also do not apply to federally-funded plans including TRICARE (covering military personnel and dependents), the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Employee's Health Benefit Plan. Finally, this bill does not apply to Medicaid/MassHealth.3 center for health information and analysis Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of AcupunctureMEDICAL EFFICACY ASSESSMENT: ACUPUNCTURE Massachusetts House Bill (H.B.) 3972, submitted in the 188th General Court (and submitted as H.B. 930 in the 189th General Court), requires health insurance plans to \"provide benefits for acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment in the areas of pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse treatment, and nausea.... [N]o third party payer of health care services shall differentiate reimbursement rates for acupuncture services by provider type. Only licensed acupuncturists or medical doctors shall be reimbursed for acupuncture services.\" 1 M.G.L. c. 3 \u00a738C charges the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) with r eviewing the medical efficacy of proposed mandated health insurance benefits. Medical efficacy reviews summarize current literature on the effectiveness and use of the mandated treatment or service and describe the potential impact of a mandated benefit on the quality of patient care and the health status of the population. ACUPUNCTURE AND RELATED TREATMENTS Oriental medicine is defined by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) 2 as a \"comprehensive health care system encompassing a variety of traditional healthcare therapies that have been used for more than 3,000 years to diagnose and treat illness, prevent disease and improve well-being.\" 3 Based in part on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)4 while incorporating methods from other Asian cultures, oriental medicine focuses on balancing the body's energy flow to restore and maintain health. In the United States, the NCCAOM defines oriental medicine to include acupuncture, Chinese herbology, and Asian bodywork therapy (ABT). 5 Acupuncture is a group of practices in which the skin is stimulated to regulate and remove obstructions to the flow of qi (energy) and blood throughout the body. 6,7 A consensus development conference statement from the National Institutes of Health described acupuncture as: [A] component of the health care system of China that can be traced back for at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Acupuncture may correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin.\" 8 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines acupuncture to include traditional body needling (puncturing the skin with a needle), moxibustion (the burning on or over the skin of selected herbs), electric acupuncture (electro-acupuncture, or \"the application of a pulsating electrical current to acupuncture needles as a means of stimulating the acupoints\"), 9 laser acupuncture (photoacupuncture; the use of low energy lasers in place of needles to stimulate acupuncture points), microsystem acupuncture such as ear (auricular), face, hand and scalp acupuncture, and acupressure (the application of pressure at selected sites). 10 Massachusetts state regulations that define acupuncture reflect and expand this definition as \"the practice of medicine based upon traditional oriental medical theories...in an attempt to relieve pain or improve bodily function.\" 11,12 Chinese herbology, or Chinese herbal medicine, is another of the main components of oriental medicine and TCM. 13 As acupuncture is used to rebalance the body, herbology uses combinations of plant materials formulated for individual patients to restore balance and maintain health.14,154 Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of Acupuncture center for health information and analysisPHYSICIANS AND LICENSED ACUPUNCTURISTS H.B. 3972 provides that insurers shall reimburse only licensed acupuncturists or medical doctors for acupuncture services. All fully-licensed physicians in Massachusetts may provide acupuncture treatments, as it is within their legal scope of practice. 16 To be eligible for licensure as a non- physician acupuncturist in Massachusetts, new licensees (as of 2009) must fulfill certain academic requirements, and pass examinations to obtain certification from the NCCAOM in either acupuncture or oriental medicine, the latter of which includes both the practices of acupuncture and Chinese herbology. 17,18 This certification requires at least a master's degree from a program certified by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), the only accrediting body recognized by the United States Department of Education. 19 Applicants educated in foreign countries must be approved by the state's Committee on Acupuncture of the Board of Registration in Medicine. 20 In 2012, there were 1053 fully-active licensed acupuncturists in Massachusetts.21 To practice herbal therapy in Massachusetts, providers must further obtain NCCAOM certification in herbology, considered a therapy adjunctive to acupuncture. 22 Massachusetts is one of eleven states that include Chinese herbs in the scope of practice for pr operly certified acupuncturists.23 Of the licensed acupuncturists in Massachusetts, 529 are certified to use herbology as part of their acupuncture practice. Although these licensed acupuncturists also certified to use herbal medicines are permitted to recommend the use of these substances as part of treatment, the substances themselves are not FDA-approved or regulated by the state. Therefore, the herbal products would not be reimbursed under commercial insurance policies, as they would not meet medical necessity criteria set forth by insurers. Because as a practical matter herbal treatments would not be covered under this proposed mandate, a review of the effectiveness of herbology is not included in this review. Manual stimulation techniques are within the scope of practice for acupuncturists in Massachusetts. Some of these treatments are also included in the practice scope of other providers licensed in the state, including physical therapists 24 and chiropractors,25 and are already reimbursed as treatments by at least some insurers when provided by these practitioner types. According to its sponsors, H.B. 3972 is not mandating payment for manual stimulation as a new treatment not otherwise reimbursed; instead, the proposed mandate is intended to expand the payment to licensed acupuncturists for this treatment. This review found no studies quantifying the efficacy of the provision of manual stimulation techniques by acupuncturists specifically or compared to other provider types.5 center for health information and analysis Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of AcupunctureEFFICACY OF ACUPUNCTURE In its 2002 review of controlled clinical trials for acupuncture treatments, the WHO wrote: [A]cupuncture is widely used in health care systems in the countries of [Asia]; it is officially recognized by governments and well received by the general public....[However], scepticism about its effectiveness continues to exist in countries where modern Western medicine is the foundation of health care, especially in those where acupuncture has not yet been widely practised. People question whether acupuncture has a true therapeutic effect, or whether it works merely through the placebo effect, the power of suggestion, or the enthusiasm with which patients wish for a cure. There is therefore a need for scientific studies that evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture under controlled clinical conditions. 26 The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) further states that: [i]n spite of the widespread use of TCM [Traditional Chinese Medicine] in China and its use in the West, rigorous scientific evidence of its effectiveness is limited. TCM can be difficult for researchers to study because its treatments are often complex and are based on ideas very different from those of modern Western medicine. According to the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, \"Western allopathic medicine treats diagnoses, and diagnoses are often established by fairly objective...standards. [In contrast, oriental medicine] is based not only on diagnostic evaluations derived fr om subjective signs and symptoms but on an accurate assessment of a patient's nature/constitution.\" 27 Western studies There are thousands of clinical reviews on the efficacy of the various practices of acupuncture and its impact on specific diseases or symptoms. Many of these, especially older studies, are of low quality, or rely on samples too small to allow generalizable conclusions. However, over time, efforts to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture and related treatments using the same scientific techniques employed to assess western medical treatments have expanded and improved. This review, therefore, focuses on such evidence-based guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized control trials, and systematic reviews. While acupuncture encompasses a broad set of techniques, the studies included here are focused specifically on needling. The research included generally compares acupuncture to: 1. No tr eatment. 2. Simulated or so-called \"sham acupunctur e\"28 which mimics acupuncture but does not pierce the skin or use traditional29 points. This comparison is often used to determine if the effect of treatment is due to acupuncture itself, or to a placebo effect, in which a patient experiences a benefit attributable not to the treatment, but to the patient's belief that the intervention will be beneficial. 30 3. Other medical tr eatments. 4. Acupunctur e in addition to other medical treatments, versus other medical treatments alone (acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment).6 Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of Acupuncture center for health information and analysisThe following table summarizes a selection of studies focused on the four diagnostic categories in the bill (pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse treatment, and nausea). The table's symbols indicate that research has concluded that, for some conditions: + Acupunctur e is more effective than the comparative treatment or no treatment as defined in the table columns. For example, for the treatment of TMJ, acupuncture is more effective than sham acupuncture and more effective than other therapies used for the condition. = Acupunctur e and sham acupuncture are effective treatments, but neither is more effective than the other (e.g. for neck pain). \u00fc Acupuncture may be an effective adjunctive treatment when used in conjunction with more traditional therapies (e.g., for chronic pain management). ? Research is not yet conclusive or the reviewed studies may be contradictory (e.g., for lateral elbow pain). - Acupunctur e has not been shown to be an effective treatment.

If this review is expanded to include research conducted outside of western medicine journals, the list of conditions for which acupuncture has been shown to be effective is considerably longer. For example, in 2002, the World Health Organization published a significant report on acupuncture that reviewed almost 300 studies. It included studies from around the world, focusing specifically on controlled clinical trials published up to 1999. 60 With regard to pain management, the WHO report concluded that acupuncture has been proven as an effective treatment for facial pain (including craniomandibular disorders), headache, knee pain, low back pain, neck pain, dental and temporomandibular dysfunction, shoulder periarthritis, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, sprains, and tennis elbow. 61 In some cases, according to this report, \"the proportion of chronic pain relieved by acupuncture is generally in the range 55-85%, which compares favourably with that of potent drugs (morphine helps in 70% of cases) and far outweighs the placebo effect (30-35%).\" 62 The WHO also concluded that acupuncture has shown a \"therapeutic effect\" but further proof is needed in the areas of abdominal pain (in acute gastroenteritis or due to gastrointestinal spasm), eye pain (due to subconjunctival injection), fibromyalgia and fasciitis, labor pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, osteoarthritis, pain due to endoscopic examination, thromboangiitis obliterans pain, postextubation pain in children, acute spine pain, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ). The WHO report stated that acupuncture has been proven effective in treating nausea and vomiting, as well as morning sickness. It concluded acupuncture has shown a \"therapeutic effect\" in treating substance abuse disorders, but further proof is needed regarding its effectiveness for alcohol dependence and detoxification and opium, cocaine, heroin, and tobacco dependence. Treatment for PTSD This review found only one systematic review of the use of acupuncture for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as \"the research evaluating acupuncture for PTSD is still in its infancy.\" 63 This study concluded that acupuncture may be effective for the treatment of PTSD, but that further studies are needed to confirm these outcomes. 64 To this end, the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs are currently conducting comparative research on the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of PTSD, as well as for pain and quality of life in veterans with PTSD. 65 Additionally, education and training programs are currently being offered to military health care providers, and the U.S. Air Force operates the Air Force Acupuncture Center at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. 66,67 There is some evidence from small studies that the treatment has been shown to be effective, including one study which found acupuncture to have a \"large treatment effect\" compared to no treatment (using patients on treatment wait-lists as comparison), and equal to the results of patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy. 688 Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of Acupuncture center for health information and analysisSummary of the efficacy of acupuncture The treatment and techniques of acupuncture forming the basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine stem from a philosophy, culture, and history very different from those of the western system of medicine.69 All of the treatments within this system have not yet been evaluated with the methods or approach used in the western system. A comprehensive and conclusive review of the efficacy of acupuncture is not possible in the scope of this analysis. While there are thousands of published studies on acupuncture, high-quality controlled clinical trials are still needed to evaluate its value for treatment of many symptoms and conditions. However, there is sufficient evidence drawn solely from peer-reviewed western-based research publications to conclude that acupuncture is an effective treatment for a variety of diagnoses included in H.B. 3972, including certain pain management conditions, certain cases of nausea and vomiting, and certain substance abuse conditions. And while some of the evidence is contradictory and some researchers have called for additional studies, the balance of research has shown acupuncture to be an effective treatment when used in conjunction with traditional therapies for certain types of pain management, nausea and vomiting, and substance abuse treatment. Finally, there is little evidence about the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for PTSD, although preliminary studies have suggested that acupuncture may be effective for this condition; additional studies are currently underway to confirm these outcomes. This review found no published studies comparing the relative quality of these services when provided by licensed acupuncturists and by licensed physicians.9 center for health information and analysis Mandated Benefit Review of H.B. 3972: An Act Relative to the Practice of AcupunctureENDNOTES 1 The 188th General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, House Bill 3972, \"An Act relative to the practice of acupuncture\".

Western Medicine is closely linked to the scientific method and emphasizes empirically measurable biochemical processes that drive disease, its treatment, and health. WM is primarily concerned with the material aspect of the body and views all medical phenomena as cause-effect sequences, relying on rigorous scientific studies and research that seek empirical proof to all phenomena. To remedy disease, Western Medicine relies on drugs, radiation, and/or surgery to treat symptoms and disease. TCM favors a holistic approach, views the universe and body philosophically and develops inductive tools and methods with such principles to guide restoring the total balance of the body. The Chinese approach is based on a philosophic-scientific approach as compared to WM's cause-and-effect approach. In TCM theory, the correct balance between Yin and Yang make up the vital energy, 'Qi', an essential life-sustaining substance of which all things are made. Disease or illness is caused by the imbalance of Y in and Y ang, which may be brought about by external agents and internal dysfunctions. T o remedy disease or illness, TCM practitioners prescribe harmony-restoration treatments in the form of herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and other treatments.APPENDIXCENTER FOR HEALTH INFORMATION AND ANALYSIScompass Health Analytics April 2015 Actuarial Assessment of House Bill 3972 Submi tted to the 188th General Court : \"An act relative to the practice of acupuncture \" Prepared for Commonwealth of Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis April 2015 Prepared by Compass Health Analytics, Inc. compass Health Analytics April 2015 Actuarial Assessment of House Bill 3972 Submitted to the 188th General Court : \"An act relative to the practice of acupuncture \" Table of Contents Executive Summary ................................ ................................ ................................ ...................... 1 the proposed mandate ................................ ................................ ......................... 1 2.2.

Only licensed acupuncturists or medical doctors shall be reimbursed for acupuncture services.\"2 Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c.3 \u00a738C charges the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) with , among other duties, reviewing the potential impact of proposed mandated health care insurance benefits on the premiums paid by business es and consumers. CHIA has engaged Compass Health Analytics, Inc. (Compass) to provide an actuarial estimate of the effect enactment of the bill would have on the cost of health insurance in Massachusetts. Background Oriental medicine is defined b y the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)3 as a \" comprehensive health care system encompassing a variety of traditional healthcare therapies that have been used for more than 3,000 years to diagnose and treat il lness, prevent disease and improve well -\u00adbeing. \"4 Based in part on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)5 while incorporating methods and theories from other Asian cultures, o riental medicine focuses on optimizing and balancing a body's energy flow to restore and maintain health. In the United States, the NCCAOM defines o riental medicine to include acupuncture, Chinese herbology, and Asian bodywork therapy (ABT).6 Acupuncture is a group of practices in which the skin is stimulated in order to regulate and rem ove obstructions to the flow of qi (energy) and blood throughout the body.7,8 A consensus development conference statement from the National Institutes of Health described acupuncture as \" a component of the health care system of China that can be traced b ack for at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Acupun cture may correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin. \" 9 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines acupuncture to include traditional body needling, moxibustion (the burning on or over the skin of selected herbs), electric acupun cture (electro -\u00adacupuncture), laser acupuncture (photoacupuncture), microsystem acupuncture such as compass Health Analytics ii April 2015 ear (auricular), face, hand , and scalp acupuncture, and acupressure (the application of pressure at selected sites).10 This definition is reflected and expan ded in the Massachusetts state regulations that define acupuncture as \" the practice of medicine based upon traditional oriental medical theories ...in an attempt to relieve p ain or improve bodily function.\"11,12 According to survey responses from ten of the largest commercial health insurance carriers in Massachusetts, acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment ( OMBDT ) are generally not covered medical benefits . If enacted, H.B. 3972 will req uire all fully -\u00adinsured commercial health insurance coverage in Massachusetts to include coverage for these services in the areas of pain management, post -\u00adtraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), nausea, and substance abuse when performed by a licensed acupuncturi st or physician . H.B. 3972 does not restrict carriers' ability to apply medical necessity criteria or set coverage limits. Analysis Compass estimated the impact of H.B. 3972 with the following steps: Estimate the base year (calendar 2012) cost per user p er year of acupuncture services in Massachusetts. Apply an estimated patient cost sharing factor based on carrier claim experience. Estimate the number of fully commercially insured acupuncture users per year during the base year. Adjust the estimated use rs per year for the proportion of acupuncture services comprised by the four specific areas of treatment covered by the mandate. Calculate the proposed mandate's incremental effect on carrier medical expenses. Estimate the impact of insurer's retention (ad ministrative costs and profit). Estimate the fully -\u00adinsured Massachusetts population under age 65, projected for the next five years (2016 to 2020). Project the estimated cost over the next five years. The analysis requires assumptions about the services covered by the bill, current and future levels of demand for acupuncture services, provider fee effects, and the extent and effect of carrier coverage limits. To adjust for these sources of uncertainty, the analysis produces a range of incremental impact estimates base d on varying these parameters. Summary results Table ES -\u00ad1 summarizes the estimated effect of H.B. 3972 on premium s for fully-\u00ad insured plans over five years . This analysis estimates that the mandate, if enacted as drafted for the 188th General Court , would increase fully -\u00adinsured premiums by as much as 0.16 percent on average over the next five years; a more likely increase is in the range of 0.12 percent , equivalent to an average annual expenditure of $ 15.5 million over the period 201 6 to 2020. compass Health Analytics iii April 2015 The impact of the bill on any one individual, employer -\u00adgroup, or carrier may vary from the overall results depending on the current level of benefits each receives or provides and on how th ose benefits would change under the proposed mandate.

Introduction Massachusetts House Bill (H.B.) 3972, submitted in the 188th General Court (and submitted as H.B. 930 in the 189th General Court), requires health insurance plans to \"provide benefits for acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment in the areas of pain management, post -\u00adtraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse treatment, and nausea .\"1 Further, the bill states that \"no third party payer of health care services shall differentiate reimbursement rates for acupuncture service s by provider type. Only licensed acupuncturists or medical doctors shall be reimbursed for acupuncture services.\"2 Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.) c.3 \u00a738C charges the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA) with , among othe r duties, reviewing the potential impact of proposed mandated health care insurance benefits on the premiums paid by business es and consumers. CHIA has engaged Compass Health Analytics, Inc. (Compass) to provide an actuarial estimate of the effect enactme nt of the bill would have on the cost of health insurance in Massachusetts . Assessing the impact of this bill on premiums entails analyzing its incremental effect on spending by insurance plans. This in turn requires comparing spending under the provision s of the proposed law to spending under current statutes and current benefit plans for the relevant services. Section 2 of this analysis outlines the relevant provisions of the bill. Section 3 summarizes the methodology used for the estimate. Section 4 describes the calculations ; results are presented in Section 5 . 2. Interpretation of H .B. 3972 The following subsections describe the relevant provisions of H .B. 3972, as drafted for the 18 8th General Court. 2.1. Plans affected by the proposed mandate The bill amends the statutes that regulate insurers providing health insura nce in Massachusetts. The bill include s six relevant sections, five of which address statutes dealing with a particular type of health insurance policy: Section 2: Accident and sicknes s insurance policies ( creating M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 47EE ) Section 3: Medicare supplement policies ( creating M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7205 A) compass Health Analytics 2 April 2015 Section 4: Contracts with non -\u00adprofit hospital service corporations ( creating M.G.L. c. 176A, \u00a7 8GG) Section 5: Certificates creating M.G.L. c. 176B, \u00a7 \u00a7 4Y) Based on the sponsor's responses to questions about the scope of the bill, this analysis assumes the bill was intended to apply also to all plans, fully-\u00ad insured and self-\u00ad insured, offered by the Group Insurance Commission (GIC) for the benefit of state and local employees and their dependents. Section 7 of the bill limits the third -\u00adparty reimbursement of acupuncture services to services provided by licensed acupuncturists or physicians, and requires insurers to reimburse licensed acupuncturists and physicians at the same rate for acupuncture services. It does not modify a particular section of the Massachusetts stat utes, but based on the sponsor's response to questions about the intent of the bill, this analysis assumes Section 7 applies to the insurance types addressed in the other sections and to GIC plans. The bill requires coverage for members under the relevant Massachuse tts-\u00adlicensed plans, regardless of whether they reside within the Commonwealth or merely have their principal place of employment in the Commonwealth. Self-\u00adinsured plans, except for those managed by the GIC, are not subject to state -\u00adlevel health insurance b enefit mandates. State mandates do not apply to Medicare or Medicare Advantage plans, the benefits of which are qualified by Medicare; this analysis excludes members of fully -\u00ad insured commercial plans over 64 years of age and does not addr ess any potential effect on Medicare supplement plans even to the extent they are regulated by state law. This analysis does not apply to Medicaid/MassHealth. 2.2. Covered services Acupuncture is a group of practices in which the skin is stimulated in order to regulate an d remove obstructions to the flow of qi (energy) and blood throughout the body.3,4 A consensus development conference statement from the National Institutes of Health described acupuncture as \"a component of the health care system of China that can be tra ced back for at least 2,500 years. The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease. Acupuncture may correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to the skin. \" 5 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines acupuncture to include traditional body needling, moxibustion (the burning on or over the skin of selected herbs), electric acupuncture (electro -\u00adacupuncture), laser acupuncture (photoacupuncture), microsystem acupuncture such as ear (auricular), face, hand , and scalp acupuncture, and acupressure (the application of pressure at selected sites).6 This definition is reflected and expanded in the Massachusetts state regulations that define acupuncture as \" the practice of medicine based upon traditional oriental medical theories ...in an attempt to relieve p ain or improve bodily function.\"7,8 compass Health Analytics 3 April 2015 Oriental medicine is defined by the Nationa l Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)9 as a \" comprehensive health care system encompassing a variety of traditional healthcare therapies that have been used for more than 3,000 years to diagnose and treat illness, prevent disease and improve well -\u00adbeing. \"10 Based in part on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)11 while incorporating methods and theor ies from other Asian cultures, o riental medicine focuses on optimizing and balancing a body's energy flow to restore and ma intain health. In the Uni ted States, the NCCAOM defines o riental medicine to include acupuncture, Chinese herbology , and Asian bodywork therapy (ABT).12 Chinese herbology, or Chinese herbal medicine, is another of the main components of oriental medicine and TCM.13 To practice herbal therapy in Massachusetts, providers must obtain an additional NCCAOM certification in herbology, which is considered an adjunctive therapy to acupuncture in the state.14 Those licensed acupuncturists certified to practice her bology are permitted to recommend the use of these substances as part of treatment, but the substances themselves are not FDA -\u00adapproved or regulated by the state of Massachusetts. Therefore, the costs of herbal products are not reimbursed unde r commercial insurance policies as they do not meet current medical necessity criteria, resulting in a zero dollar incremental cost for purposes of this analysis. All fully -\u00adlicensed physicians in Massachusetts are able to provide acupuncture treatments, as it is contai ned within their defined scope of practice.15 As noted above, Section 7 of H.B. 3972 requires third party payers of health care claims to reimburse all providers of acupuncture at the same rate and limits the practice of acupuncture to licensed acupuncturi sts and physicians, thus requiring fee parity for physicians and licensed acupuncturists. This analysis defines the services mandated by H.B. 3972 as acupuncture services (as defined above), additional manual stimulation techniques ( e.g., tui na and scrapi ng techniques such as gua sha), and office visits for patient evaluation and management within the Massachusetts scope o f practice for acupuncturists. The analysis estimates incremental cost to the Massachusetts fully -\u00ad insured commercial health care market for mandated coverage of these services when performed by licensed acupuncturists and physicians for pain management, nausea, substance abuse, or post -\u00ad traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2.3. Existing laws affecting the cost of H.B. 3972 This analysis has uncovered no current Massachusetts insurance mandates regarding insurance coverage for acupuncture or related treatments or services provided specifically by licensed acupuncturists . In addition , no existing federal mandates related to the specific subject matter of this bill have been identified. compass Health Analytics 4 April 2015 3. Methodology 3.1. Steps in the analysis Compass estimated the impact of H.B. 3972 with the following steps: Estimate the base year (calendar 2012) cost per user per year of acupuncture services in Massachusetts. Apply an estimated patient cost -\u00adsharing factor based on carrier claim experience. Estimate the number of fully commercially insured acupuncture users per year during the base year. Adjust the estimated users per year for the proportion of acupuncture s ervices comprised by the four specific areas of treatment covered by the mandate. Calculate the proposed mandate's incremental effect on carrier medical expenses. Estimate the impact of insurer's retention (administrative costs and profit). Estimate the fully -\u00adinsured Massachusetts population under age 65, projected for the next five years (2016 to 2020). Project the estimated cost over the next five years. 3.2. Data sources The primary data sources used in the analysis were: Responses from the bill's spon sors or legislative staff to written questions regarding legislative intent Information from providers , cited as appropriate Information from a survey of private health insurance carriers in Massachusetts Academic literature and government reports , including population data, cited as appropriate Massachusetts insurer claim dat a from CHIA's Massachusetts All Payer Claim Database (APCD) for calendar years 20 09 to 2012, for plans covering the majority of the under -\u00ad65 insured population16 The following subsection and the step-\u00adby-\u00adstep description of the estimation process address limitations in some of these sources and the uncertainties they contribute to the cost estimate. 3.3. Limitations This analysis relies primarily on a careful assessment of the demand for and cost of acupuncture services described in H.B. 3972. The estimates draw on 2012 statewide data on cost and utilization of privately insured acupuncture services and national survey data regarding demand for compass Health Analytics 5 April 2015 acupuncture and other complementary a nd alternative medical services . The estimates of incremental costs for the proposed mandate for 2016 to 2020 require assumptions about : The scope of services covered by the bill The current level of demand for acupuncture services for the four specific a reas of treatment included in the bill and the expected change in that demand attributable to mandated coverage Current carrier contracting practices The extent of coverage for these services in the absence of the proposed mandate The extent and effect of carrier medical necessity criteria, cost sharing, and coverage limits These uncertainties are addressed by modeling a reasonable range of assumptions based on informed judgment. 4. Analysis To estimate the impact of the proposed legislation, the following calculations were executed . The analysis includes development of a best estimate \"middle-\u00ad cost\" scenario, as well as a low -\u00adcost scenario using assumptions that produced a lower estimate, and a high -\u00adcost scenario using more conservative assumptions that pro duced a higher estimated impact. This analysis estimates the potential increase in medical expense due to the proposed mand ate for a baseline period of calendar 2012 . Simplified somewhat, th at baseline cost calculation is: Average cost per user per year of acupuncture treatment for commercially-\u00ad insured individuals in Massachusetts with coverage in 2012 x Cost sharing factor x Number of incremental users per year x Proportion of users using services falling within H.B. 3972's covered areas of treatment = Estimated total incremental 2012 carrier claim expense The components are multiplied together to estimate a total 2012 incremental carrier claim expense which is then divided by the 2012 fully -\u00adinsured commercial enrollment (member months), yielding a per -\u00admember per -\u00admonth (PMPM) cost estimate. That baseline PMPM cost estimate is the starting point for the calculations for the final fo rward -\u00adlooking projections (2016 to 2020). 4.1. Average cost per user per year According to s urvey responses from ten of the largest commercial health insurance carriers in Massachusetts, acupuncture and oriental medicine based diagnosis and treatment ( OMBDT ) are generally not covered medical benefits. However, t wo large carriers, together coveri ng over sixty percent of the commercially covered lives in Massachusetts, allow self -\u00adinsured employer groups to compass Health Analytics 6 April 2015 cover acupuncture benefits , and s ome carriers cover acupuncture under certain exceptional circumstances with pre -\u00adauthorization .i Data for one c arrier in the latter group with significant acupuncture claim volume w ere used in this analysis. T o estimate average cost per user per year of acupuncture services, Compass analyzed calendar 2012 Massachusetts APCD claims for services provided by acupuncturists and specific acupuncture servicesii provided by physicians for that carrier and the two large carriers allowing the coverage for self -\u00adinsured groups . Table 1 summarizes the results: Table 1: 2012 Allowed Cost per User per Year of Acupuncture Treatment for Three Major Carriers Cost Per User Per Year Carrier #1 $522 Carrier #2 $777 Carrier #3 $1,354 Translating these raw empirical results into a reasonable cost per user per year range for modeling the proposed mandate cost required an upward adjustment to Carrier #1's result and a downward adjustment to Carrier #3's, resulting in a slight narrowing of the range used for the analysis. Carrier #1's claim activity showed that only the needling services component of acupuncture was covered in most cases. As noted in Section 2, this analysis assumes coverage for needling services, additional manual techniques, and office visits is required by the provisions of H.B. 3972. To adjust Carrier #1's cost per user per year to reflect coverage of non-\u00ad needling manual therapies and office visits, Compass multiplied Carrier #1's user counts for needling services by the ratio of Carrier #3's user counts for non-\u00ad needling manual therapies and office visits to Carrier #3's user cou nt for needling services. That is, if Carrier #3 had 120 allowed users of non -\u00adneedling codes in 2012 and i As discussed below, one large carrier began including acupuncture services as a core medical benefit in most fully -\u00adinsured plans as of January 1, 2015. No data are available for the new coverage. ii There are four Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) professional procedure codes specific to the practice of acupuncture: 97810: Acupuncture, 1 or more needles; without electrical stimulation, initial 15 minutes of personal one -\u00adon-\u00ad one contact with the patient 97811: without electrical stimulation, each additional 15 minutes of personal one -\u00adon-\u00adone contact with the patient, with re -\u00adinsertion of needle(s) 97813: with electrical stimulation, initial 15 minutes of personal one -\u00adon-\u00adone contact with the patient 97814: with electrical stimulation, each additional 15 minutes of personal one -\u00adon-\u00adone contact with the patient, with re -\u00adinsertion o f needle(s) (Source: Abraham M, Ahlman J, et al. CPT: Current Procedural Terminology, 2014. American Medical Association, Chicago, IL, 2013; p. 601.) These procedures are referred to as the \"needling\" services or procedures throughout. While other proce dures are within the scope of practice for acupuncturists in the state of Massachusetts, the procedure codes for those services are not specific to the practice of acupuncture. Therefore, those services can only reliably be attributed to the practice of a cupuncture, and identified as potential incremental costs of H.B. 3972, when performed by licensed acupuncturists. Those services are referred to throughout as the \"non -\u00ad needling\" services or procedures and office visits. compass Health Analytics 7 April 2015 100 users of needling codes, Compass multiplied Carrier #1's needling services user count by 1.2 to derive an adjusted non -\u00adneedling services user count. The adjusted Carrier #1 user counts were then multiplied by Carrier #1's actual cost per user per year for non -\u00adneedling acupuncture services to derive an all -\u00adservices cost per user of $612. As is clear in Table 1, Carrier #3's 2012 acupuncture benefit cost significantly more per user than Carrier #1's and Carrier #2's. Both Carrier #3's allowed unit cost (approximately $40 vs. approximately $25 -\u00ad$30), and units per user were significantly higher. Noting that Carrier #3 only covers acupuncture for self-\u00adinsured contracts at the client's request suggests a downward adjustment to Carrier #3's cost per user per year as the high -\u00adend cost scenario , as the coverage carriers will offer under the mandate to their fully -\u00adinsured customers will likely be more constrained. Assuming that smaller carriers entering the acupuncture market will likely face the higher of the two fee levels , Compass adjusted Carrier #3's cost per user by applying Carrier #3's observed unit cost to the lower units per user observed for Carrier #2. This calculation resulted in an estimated cost per user per year of $1206. These results were translated into the low, medium, and high cost scenario cost per user per year assumptions appear ing in Table 2. Table 2: Estimate d Allowed Cost per User pe r Year of Acupuncture Treatment for Com mercially Fully -\u00adInsured Members Cost Per User Per Year Low Scenario $600 Medium Scenario $900 High Scenario $1200 4.2. Cost sharing The vast majority of acupuncture claims in the APCD were covered by two of the largest commercial carriers in Massachusetts. Self-\u00adinsured large employer contracts comprised substantially all of this volume. Over the period 2009 to 2012, cost sharing for acupuncture claims was approximately 20 percent for one carrie r and 30 p ercent for the other. A 2012 analysis by Compass of 2010 Massachusetts carrier data for chiropractic services under fully -\u00adinsured contracts provided a benchmark cost -\u00adsharing factor for fully -\u00adinsured plans covering similar services of 34 percent (vs. 24 per cent for self -\u00adinsured contracts) , suggesting the above results for acupuncture services are not anomalous . Large employer contracts, such as those most likely to self -\u00adinsure, typically have lower levels of cost sharing than average, suggesting 30 percent, the higher of the two observed acupuncture cost-\u00ad sharing rates , as a reasonable cost sharing factor when coverage is expanded across the entire market. compass Health Analytics 8 April 2015 4.3. Penetration : Users per year In 2007, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistic's (NCHS) National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) gathered data on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) , including acupuncture services.17 In a National Health Statistics Report published in December 2008, NCHS reported an annual prevalence rate for acupuncture services for adults 18 years of age and older of 1.4 percent18 and a child annual prevalence rate of 0.2 percent.19 A weighted average of the two results yields an all -\u00adages prevalence rate for acupuncture services of 1.1 percent. NCHS additionally reported that for adults under 65 years of age, prevalence rates for acupuncture and a group of other CAM servicesiii were effectively the same for privately -\u00adinsured and uninsured individuals (3.9 percent for the p rivately insured vs. 4.0 percent for the uninsured),20 suggesting the utilization increase effects of acupuncture coverage are small. A 2012 acupuncture penetration rate (unique users per year divided by average monthly membership) was calculated from Massa chusetts APCD data for a single carrier that provided member months for contracts with acupuncture coverage to Compass. The resulting penetration rate was significantly smaller than the 2007 NHIS result (0.6 percent). However, because this carrier accoun ted for only four percent of the 2012 acupuncture claim volume, this analysis proceeds using a penetration rate based on the 2007 NHIS results of one percent, or 25,325 fully -\u00ad insured users under age 65 in 2012. One carrier comprising approximately 18 pe rcent of the fully commercially insured Massachusetts health insurance membership began offering acupuncture coverage in most of its fully -\u00adinsured plans as of January 1, 2015. Based on the carrier's survey response regarding plans excluding th is coverage, Compass estimated that approximately 85 percent of the carrier's fully -\u00adinsured membership receives the acupuncture coverage. Utilization by th ese members, therefore, is not an incremental cost of the proposed mandate. Applying this adjustment decreases the estimated number of incremental users to 21,428. 4.4. Adjust ment for services within the defined areas of treatment While H.B. 3972 mandates acupuncture coverage for \"treatment in the areas of pain management, post-\u00adtraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse treatment, and nausea,\" 21 the acupuncture coverage offered in 2012 by the carriers included in this analysis was not limited based on defined areas of treatment. To adjust for services in other areas of treatment, Compass reviewed the princi pal diagnosis codes reported for APCD claims for acupuncture needling services during the period 2009 to 2012. Based on the results, summarized in Table 3, Compass applied a downward adjustment of 20 percent to the incremental user count to account for cases not covered under the language of the bill. iii \"Alternative medical systems\", defined to include acupuncture, ayurveda, homeopathic treatment, naturopathy, and traditional healers. The 1.1 percent prevalence rate reported above is for acupuncture services specifically. The private insurance vs. uninsured result was only reported for more aggregated categories of service, including alternative medical systems. compass Health Analytics 9 April 2015 Table 3: 2009-\u00ad 2012 APCD Needling Codes Allowed Expenses by Principal Diagnosis Type Service Dates in 2012 Service Dates 2009-\u00ad 2012 Pain, SA, & Nauseaiv 81% 79% Other Diagnoses 19% 21% 4.5. Fee parity Section 7 of H.B. 3972 states that \"no third party payer of health care services shall differentiate reimbursement rates for acupuncture services by provider type\", and further provides that licensed acupuncturists and physicians will be the only reimbursa ble provider types under the mandate. 22 Only the provider networks of the two carriers offering acupuncture coverage to self -\u00adinsured groups in the base year are subject to incremental costs resulting from this provision, as other carriers would be credenti aling and contracting with acupuncture providers with the fee parity provision of H.B. 3972 already in place. Of the two affected carriers, one stated in its response to the carrier survey that all acupuncture providers are contracted individually by an outside vendor. Massachusetts 2012 APCD data for this carrier showed no material acupuncture services volume for physicians . As the best information available indicates any acupuncture credentialing and contracting with physician s would take place after th e implementation of the fee parity provision of H.B. 3972 , this analysis assumes the incremental impact of fee parity on this carrier is immaterial . The other affected carrier stated in its response to the carrier survey that acupuncture services fees are the same for physicians and licensed acupuncturists in their network. Therefore, the incremental cost of the fee parity provision for this carrier is zero. 4.6. Net increase in base year carrier medical expense For each scenario, multiplying the estimated cost per user per year by estimated incremental users per year in the four covered treatment areas and the cost sharing factor , and dividing the result by the projected fully -\u00adinsured membership yields the medica l expense per member per month (PMPM) displayed in Table 4. Table 4: Estimate of Increase in Base -\u00adYear Carrier Medical Expense PMPM Low Scenario $0.24 Middle Scenario $0.36 High Scenario $0.47 iv There were no paid claims with a principal diagnosis of PTSD. compass Health Analytics 10 April 2015 The base -\u00adyear middle scenario PMPM of $0. 36 is equivalent to annual medical claim spending of approximately $10. 8 million. 4.7. Net increase in base year premium Assuming an average retention rate of 9.7 percent, based on CHIA's analysis of administrative costs and profit in Massachusetts,23 the increase in medical expense was adjusted upward to approximate the total impact on premiums. Table 5 shows the result. Table 5: Estimate of Increase in Base -\u00adYear Carrier Medical Expense PMPM Low Scenario $0.26 Middle Scenario $0.39 High Scenario $0.52 The middle scenario baseline (2012) PMPM of $ 0.39 is equivalent to annual spending of approximately $ 12 million. 4.8. Projected fully -\u00adinsured population in Massachusetts Table 6 shows the fully -\u00adinsured population in Massachusetts ages 0 -\u00ad64 projected for the next five years. Appendix A describes the sources of these values. Table 6: Projected Fully -\u00adInsured Population in Massachusetts, Ages 0 -\u00ad64 Year Total (0-\u00ad64) 2,329,040 2017 2,304,658 2018 2,279,367 2019 2,253,405 2020 2,226,328 4.9. Projection The calculated incremental premium PMPMs from Section 4.7 were adjusted for medical inflation and multiplied by the member months from Section 4.8 to derive projected incremental costs. The results of these calculations are presented in the next section. 5. Results The results of the estimated impact of the mandate are outlined below. The analysis includes development of a best estimate \" middle -\u00adcost\" scenario, as well as a low -\u00adcost scenario using compass Health Analytics 11 April 2015 assumptions that produced a lower estimate, and a high -\u00adcost scenario using more conservative assumptions that produced a higher estimated impact. 5.1. Five -\u00adyear estimated impact For each year in the five -\u00adyear analysis period, Table 7 displays the projected net impact of the proposed mandate on medical expense and premiums using a projection of Massachusetts fully -\u00ad insured membership . The baseline (2012) PMPM cost for the incremental acupuncture services was pro jected forward to the study period of 2016 to 2020 using the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) projected annual privately -\u00adinsured physician services cost trends for the period.24 The 2016 estimate is pro -\u00adrated to account for contract renewal dates after January 1. This analysis estimates that the mandate, if enacted, would increase fully -\u00adinsured premiums by as much as 0.16 percent on average over the next five years; a more likely increase is in the range of 0.12 percent . The five-\u00adyear aver age annual impact on premium spending is $ 15.5 million. The impact of the bill on any one individual, employer -\u00adgroup, or carrier may vary from the overall results depending on the current level of benefits each receives or provides and on how the benefits would change under the proposed mandate.

Impact on the GIC Because the benefit offerings of GIC plans are similar to most other commercial plans in Massachusetts, and cover acupuncture treatment similarly to other carriers, the estimated PMPM effect of the proposed mandate on GIC coverage is not expected to differ from that calculated for the other fully -\u00adinsured plans in Massachusetts. To calculate the medical expense separately for the self -\u00ad insured portion of the GIC, the medical expense per member per month was applied to the GIC self -\u00adcompass Health Analytics 12 April 2015 insured membership; Table 8 displays the r esults . Note that the total medical expense and premium numbers displayed in Table 7 include the GIC fully -\u00adinsured membership . Table 8: GIC Self -\u00adInsured Summary Results 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Average 5 Yr Total Members (000s) 263 263 263 262 262 Medical April 2015 Appendix A: Membership Affected by the Proposed Mandate Membership potentially affected by a proposed mandate may include Massachusetts residents with fully -\u00adinsured employer -\u00adsponsored health insurance issued by a Massachusetts licensed company (including through the GIC), non -\u00adresidents with fully -\u00adinsured employer -\u00adsponsored insurance issued in Massachusetts, Massachusetts residents with individual (direct) health insurance coverage, and, in some cases, lives covered by GIC self -\u00adinsured coverage. Membership projections for 2016 to 2020 are derived from the following sources. Total Massachusetts population estimates for 2012, 2013 , and 2014 from U. S. Census Bureau data25 form the base for the projections. Distributions by gender and age, also from the Census Bureau,26 were applied to these totals. Projected growth rates for each gender/age category were estimated from Census Bureau population projections to 2030.27 The resulting growth rates were then applied to the base amounts to project the tota l Massachusetts population for 2016 to 2020. The number of Massachusetts residents with employer -\u00adsponsored or individual (direct) health insurance coverage was estimated using Census Bureau data on health insurance coverage status and type of coverage28 applied to the population projections. To estimate the number of Massachusetts residents with fully -\u00adinsured employer -\u00adsponsored coverage, projected estimates of the percentage of employer -\u00adbased coverage that is fully -\u00adinsured were developed using historical dat a from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component Tables.29 To estimate the number of non -\u00adresidents covered by a Massachusetts policy - typically cases in which a non -\u00adresident works for a Massachusetts employer offering employer -\u00adsponsored coverage - the number of lives with fully -\u00adinsured employer -\u00adsponsored coverage was increased by the ratio of the total number of individual tax returns filed in Massachusetts by residents30 and non -\u00adresidents31 to the total number of individual tax returns filed i n Massachusetts by residents. The number of residents with individual (direct) coverage was adjusted further to subtract the estimated number of people previous ly covered by Commonwealth Care who moved into MassHealth due t o expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act.32 Projections for the GIC self -\u00adinsured lives were developed using GIC base data for 201233, 2013 ,34 and 201435 and the same projected growth rates from the Census Bureau that were used for the Massachusetts population. Breakdowns of the GIC self -\u00adinsured lives by gender and age were based on the Census Bureau distributions . compass Health Analytics 14 April 2015 Endnotes 1 The 188th General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, House Bill 3972, \"An Act relative to the practice of acupuncture\".
