The Glen Ivy Experience Our Services Hear from our visitors This place is always relaxing. Whether I go alone or with a group I have a great time. I had the best facial of my life by Sage in the salon. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Glen Ivy. Enjoyable, relaxing and inviting oasis. Highly recommended during the winter months. Feels like you're on an island of your own. The mani/pedi services are wonderful. Went here and loved it had a wonderful time for a family friend's birthday celebration. The staff was warm and all essentials were great. Definitely enjoyed all the amenities. Penny and I had a great time today. Partaking in the hot medicinal springs, cold tub, swimming pool, showers, and just the great vistas. I recommend it to everyone who wants to get away for a relaxing day. Beautiful place to spend Mother's Day! My daughter took me and we enjoyed a 50 minute massage, a Grotto, and had a wonderful lunch with our own personal service and really enjoyed the various pools. Beautiful! Can't wait to return! A Tradition of Excellence In 2023, Glen Ivy Hot Springs celebrated 163 years of healing waters and extraordinary service.
