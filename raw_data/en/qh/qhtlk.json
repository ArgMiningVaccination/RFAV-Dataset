Consciousness is key in the spiritual lifestyle, especially when it comes to being aware of what you put in your body. Eating with intention\u2014knowing the source of your food as well as how it can positively or negatively have an impact on your immune system and your body's other defenses\u2014is commonly referred to as holistic eating, and it's a vital part of practicing mindfulness and living a more connected life. Those who consume holistic foods may even uncover benefits that can potentially aid them in dealing with serious ailments and conditions. The term holistic is slightly elastic even among those who practice such a diet, but several essential guidelines tend to stay intact across the variations. Some see it as an attractive trend with elements they can pick and choose from, while others stick to a long list of dos and don'ts. Whatever your chosen path, adhering to these basic food fundamentals will get you on track to leading a holistic life. Purified Water: Eight glasses of water a day is an age-old health recommendation, but ensuring your water is purified will better protect against dehydration. Raw: The raw diet is making waves in the food world as more people seek to consume unprocessed foods. Raw ingredients are known to contain enriched enzymes and nutrients. Local: Being connected with the source in the dietary sense means knowing where your food comes from. Farmers' markets are an easy way to guarantee the locality of your food. Organic: Perhaps the most prominently popular aspect of a holistic diet, eating organic ensures the avoidance of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics and other unhealthy yet common components of foods. Whole Grains: Processing proves problematic for most foods but particularly grains, which lose many nutrients along the way. To retain the natural nutrients, seek breads, rices and pastas labeled as whole grain. Essential Fatty Acids: While anything dubbed \"fatty\" may seem like it should be avoided, good fats are necessary for overall nutrition. The likes of organic coconut or canola oil can be used as healthy substitutes to cook with. Variety: Mixing it up is a surefire way to gather a strong range of nutrients. Try combining raw veggies with local meats, cooked together in an organic oil, for example. With a plan of action in place, holistic eaters can attempt to target varying conditions that may be hindering their lives. Prescribed medicine and treatments may very well be the best route for sufferers of severe conditions, but taking small steps of their own can prove beneficial. Serious illnesses may not be cured by holistic foods, but their potential for further harm can at least be mitigated.
