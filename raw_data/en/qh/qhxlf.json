Indice all'interno dell'articolo But what is metabolism? Metabolism is the set of biochemical processes that our body uses to derive energy from food and nutrients that we introduce daily to meet the energy and structural demands of our cells. It is important to regulate the introduction of nutrients and therefore to provide the right amount of energy that meets our metabolic needs. So many calories we burn and so many we should introduce. To speed up the metabolism we need to increase energy expenditure, which is influenced by 3 factors: - Basal metabolism (60-70% of daily calorie consumption). The basal metabolic rate (BM), or BMR, corresponds to the energy expenditure of a living organism at rest, thus including the energy necessary for vital metabolic functions (respiration, digestion, nervous system activity, etc.); - Diet-induced thermogenesis (10-15%). DIT is a metabolic process linked to calorie expenditure each time food is ingested; - Physical activity (15-30%). Increasing lean mass and exercising is a strong stimulus for metabolic activities. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn throughout the day. A good muscle tone helps to burn more calories even during physical activity since while playing sports the metabolism increases significantly and remains high even for several hours after training. Slowed metabolism We talk about slow metabolism when the processes necessary for the sustenance of our organism undergo a slowdown. Symptoms related to slow metabolism can be: - The tendency to increase body weight - Asthenia - Low pressure - Sensitivity to cold - Hyperhidrosis - Constipation - Dry skin Some elements that influence the metabolism are instead: - Sedentary lifestyle - Gender and age - Stress - Hormonal profile How to stimulate the metabolism Lean mass plays a fundamental role in regulating metabolism, as exercise stimulates the metabolic activities of our body. The more we can increase muscle mass, the more calories we can consume. Muscle tissue represents that component of our organism that is metabolically active and as such has different metabolic demands compared to adipose tissue. For this reason, in order to speed up the metabolism, it is recommended to exercise at a good heart rate (running, swimming, cycling, weight training or bodyweight exercises, etc.). 8 herbal remedies to help speed up metabolism Bitter orange Synephrine, the active ingredient of Citrus Aurantium, specifically stimulates certain tissues such as adipose. Synephrine encourages thermogenesis, increases calorie consumption and therefore activates rather important lipolysis. This active ingredient, therefore, increases the basal metabolic rate and also reduces appetite. Guaran\u00e0 The caffeine contained in Guarana seeds helps to release fatty acids from body fat reserves, with the possibility of increasing the body's ability to burn fat. The properties of Guarana are useful for increasing strength and concentration during a workout, so this plant is often used in the context of sports supplementation. White willow White willow acts as an inhibitor of prostaglandins that hinder the release of norepinephrine, reducing the energy available to the lipolysis processes. Garcinia cambogia Garcinia cambogia has a triple action: it reduces appetite and increases metabolism, making sure that the fat mass stored in the body is also burned more quickly. The hydroxycitric acid contained in Garcinia inhibits the reduction of the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides, thus helping to lower bad cholesterol levels and normalizing blood glucose levels Guggul This gum-resin has a lipid-lowering action capable of reducing LDL cholesterol values and simultaneously increasing HDL values, thanks to an increase in hepatic metabolism of LDL-cholesterol. It also has a stimulating effect on the thyroid. Coleus The forskolin contained in Coleus has lipolytic properties and induces an increase in the activity of the enzyme that activates the thyroid hormone T3, with a thermogenic effect. Furthermore, forskolin causes an increase in some metabolic activities, with the development of lean mass: phosphorylase in skeletal muscles, the release of insulin and the synthesis of anabolic hormones are activated. Black pepper The piperine contained in this extract acts as a thermonutrient because it can stimulate thermogenesis. Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B12 B vitamins are cofactors of metabolic reactions and have energizing and detoxifying properties: they are involved in the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and vitamins. The right supplement to stimulate the metabolism [PromoPharma\u00ae](https://www.promopharma.it/en/) offers [XanaBurn\u00ae Brucia](https://www.promopharma.it/en/xanaburn-brucia/), the food supplement useful for stimulating metabolism thanks to its thermogenic action (fat burner) obtained from specific phytocomplexes: synephrine, caffeine and salicin. In addition, Bitter Orange and Guarana are useful for the balance of body weight and lipid metabolism; Garcinia represents an adjuvant in the control of the sense of hunger. With just one tablet a day, in the middle of the morning, XanaBurn\u00ae Brucia acts in a targeted way on our body. When to use it? - Even if you follow a correct diet, you cannot lose weight - Slow basal metabolism - Excessive appetite - High-fat diet Bibliographical references 1. Lewis Y.S., Neelakantan S.
