Establishing which of the claims of so-called alternative medicine are true would have clear benefits. But the Office of Alternative Medicine, the American government's attempt to do so, is in danger of turning the search into a farce PLACE a hot plaster on to the skin to raise blisters and then pierce to let them drain. Or wrap a patient in layers of cold, wet sheets and a wool blanket until he begins sweating, then remove the blanket and douse him in cold water. Nobody believes in these 19th-century cures for cholera and mental illness any more. But why not? The short answer to that question is \"science\". Such remedies have been tested and found wanting while others have proved their worth and have thus been accepted into the mainstream of medical practice. Despite this, there is still a lively market for \"alternative\" medicines and \"unconventional\" treatments\u2014potions and practices that have not been given a scientific seal of approval. As long ago as 1990 (the last time anybody looked) America's citizens spent about $13.7 billion a year on such medicines and treatments. The same study suggested that one American in three was using some sort of alternative therapy at least once a year. Not surprisingly, America now supports at least 15,000 acupuncturists and 45,000 chiropractors. Unfortunately, there is\u2014by definition\u2014no scientific evidence that any of the hotch-potch of remedies which travel together under the \"alternative\" label actually does any good. This is partly because few respectable scientists are willing to risk their reputations to do the testing required, and partly because few firms would be willing to pay for it if they were. Herbal medicines, not being new inventions, cannot be patented, though drug companies sometimes sponsor investigations into them in the hope that patentable drugs will emerge. (One such study, published in October, suggests that an infusion of leaves from the ginkgo tree helps delay the progress of Alzheimer's disease.) But no commercial organisation is likely to stump up for, say, acupuncture. A few years ago, the American government made a stab at correcting this state of affairs by setting up an Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) as a part of the country's National Institutes of Health (NIH). The OAM's remit was to evaluate research into alternative treatments and to provide information on unconventional health-care services. Now its supporters want to lift the organisation from its junior status as an \"office\" of the NIH and turn it into a \"centre\", the next grade up. In September, an attempt to push the elevation through the Senate failed, but the proposal is now being revamped as part of this year's NIH reauthorisation bill and also, in case that fails, as part of the NIH appropriations bill. Touchy, healy Peter DeFazio, a congressman who is proposing one of these amendments, says his move is intended to give the OAM greater independence to conduct research on alternative medicine unhindered by Harold Varmus, the director of the NIH. Dr Varmus, Mr DeFazio claims, \"hates the idea of the OAM\". And therein lies the rub. For the OAM is widely perceived by those in the medical mainstream as an unscientific organisation that has been captured by the alternative-medicine lobby. Its critics say the office's mission is not to winnow the good alternatives from the bad, but to proselytise indiscriminately on behalf of all of them. The OAM's supporters deny this, of course. The office has been operating since 1992. In that time, they point out, it has helped to sustain ten specialist research centres. These centres study alternative therapies for AIDS, cancer, drug addiction and the diseases of ageing. The office also awards grants to individuals to identify promising areas for future research and has sponsored such research directly. At the beginning of October, for example, it collaborated with another part of the NIH, the National Institute of Mental Health, to launch a study of St John's wort\u2014a herb that is widely employed to treat mild cases of depression. Also, since late 1996, it has acted as a clearing-house to provide information to the public on the various forms of alternative therapy that are available. This all sounds terribly worthy and unexceptional. But it is more what the OAM has not done that has infuriated its critics. It is, in their view, too uncritical. It has, for example, never identifed a single alternative therapy that does not look promising. Nor has it exactly developed a reputation for scientific rigour. In the dubious alternative practice of therapeutic touch, which purports to cure a patient by manipulating the \"biofield\" of \"energy\" that exudes from a human body, the OAM has not even bothered to ask the question of whether this \"field\" actually exists. An attempt to study alternative treatments for AIDS also calls the office's scientific bona fides into question. This study\u2014which is being carried out by the Bastyr University AIDS Research Centre, in Seattle, and has received a three-year, $840,000 grant from the OAM\u2014uses a methodology that seems incapable of yielding any useful information. It will simply track the health of some 1,500 HIV-positive patients who are using any of 80 non-conventional treatments for AIDS. There are no proper control groups with whom those receiving treatment can be compared. Nor is a single therapy being tested, so if any \"alternative\" palliative is effective, that effect is likely to get lost in the noise from the rest. Also, the study will include patients who are taking mainstream drugs of proven efficacy, making it impossible to decide if any changes in their health are due to the alternative treatment or the approved drug. A similar problem of lumping unrelated treatments together bedevils one of the office's recent \"successes\"\u2014a review of homeopathy which it helped to run. Homeopathic medicines are made of substances that have been diluted with water to such an extent that there is often no trace of the original in the solution. Unlike herbal medicines, therefore, it is difficult to see how homeopathic potions could possibly work, even in principle. The review (published in the Lancet in September) sifted more than 180 trials of homeopathy that have been carried out over the years, and pronounced 26 of them to be of \"good quality\". These trials were of a variety of treatments for a variety of diseases. None showed homeopathy to be effective for any particular illness. However, by applying a technique called meta-analysis to the results of all 26, the review's authors claimed to have found that homeopathy does have some sort of overall positive effect. But meta-analysis, though a respectable technique for extracting information from multiple trials of particular treatments too small to be of individual significance, is being stretched to the limit here. Using it to draw a conclusion (and a highly controversial one, at that) from a set of diverse treatments for diverse ills requires, at the least, some heroic assumptions. Quacks against the wall The OAM is, in other words, behaving in ways that would provoke severely raised eyebrows if they happened in any other part of the NIH. But the office has powerful friends besides Mr DeFazio. Its original sponsor was Senator Tom Harkin. He created it by adding a suitable clause to the 1992 NIH appropriations bill. And Senator Harkin, a strong supporter of alternative medicine, was not content to leave things at that. The advisory panel appointed to make sure that the OAM stuck to its mission was widely perceived to consist only of advocates of alternative medicine. Indeed, Joseph Jacobs, the office's first director, claims that he felt compelled to resign because of political pressure to fund unscientific, simplistic research on alternative cures, instead of rigorous controlled trials. These are arguments enough against the OAM's existence, let alone its elevation. But there is also the question of why alternative treatments should have their own, special outfit\u2014of whatever status\u2014within the NIH, even if it were doing good work. Other NIH groups are responsible for particular types of disease (such as the National Institute of Mental Health), rather than particular sorts of treatment. Mainstream doctors with ideas they would like to test have to apply to the appropriate one of these. And it is not as if alternative medicine is automatically shunned by the rest of the NIH. On November 3rd an NIH-sponsored conference on the possible virtues of acupuncture is due to start. Although the OAM is the leading sponsor of this, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and several other bits of the NIH are also involved. So should alternative cures get special treatment? Mr DeFazio argues that they should\u2014that the financial and social barriers to testing alternative treatments are serious enough to justify not only the existence of the OAM, but also the enhancement of its status. Those barriers are undoubtedly real (some people argue that things like the acupuncture conference would not be happening without the OAM's influence), and they need to be removed. It would be scandalous to reject a therapy just because it is unconventional. But the OAM, at least as currently constituted, seems not to be the vehicle to sponsor the necessary research. Maintaining the office, let alone upgrading it on the whim of a few enthusiastic politicians, is not the proper way to advance medical knowledge.
