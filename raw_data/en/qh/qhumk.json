Please note that this communication only applies to Naturopathic Doctors offering front line care in the Vancouver Coastal Health region: Vancouver Coastal Health continues to implement the provincial COVID-19 Immunization Plan. Beginning this week, we have enough vaccine supply and capacity in our clinics to expand eligibility to include naturopaths [naturopathic doctors] providing direct patient care in acute and community health care settings who have not yet received their first dose of vaccine. We understand everyone is eager to book their vaccination appointment as soon as they hear they are eligible. New appointments are released on a week-to-week basis, typically on Friday afternoon, and more appointments are added throughout the week as clinic capacity and vaccine supply allows. The links below are valid and are functioning. If you are unable to secure an appointment immediately, please check back often. Please do not call the central booking line for the general public or any other phone numbers with Vancouver Coastal Health. We are committed to ensuring you get vaccinated. We appreciate your cooperation, patience, and understanding as we roll out an immunization campaign of an unprecedented scale. Please note: second doses will now be offered 16 weeks from the first dose based on provincial and national recommendations, including for those who have already received their first dose. Data from jurisdictions around the world shows one dose of vaccine provides a high level of protection. When it's time to receive your second dose, you will be invited to receive it just as you were for your first. Please retain your paper record of immunization to bring back to the clinic with you at that time. You may book your appointment using the links provided below. Please do not forward these links to others who are not naturopaths [naturopathic doctors], as they will be turned away at the clinic if they are not eligible. Please note: if you have a professional Jane account you cannot use it to book a vaccination appointment. You must create a personal user account first.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: - Anyone booking or arriving who is not eligible will be turned away. - If you contracted and recovered from COVID-19 more than three months ago, you may now attend a clinic for your first dose of vaccine. - If you contracted and recovered from COVID-19 within the past three months, you are not eligible for vaccine at this time. You will be immunized at a later date. - Please do not attend the clinic if you are feeling unwell, experiencing COVID-like symptoms, or if you have been asked by Public Health to self-isolate. - Come alone, to assist with COVID-19 safety protocols. Physical distancing measures will be in place throughout, including while waiting in line. - Bring your driver's license (or other photo ID) and Personal Health Number/CareCard. For those not affiliated with a health authority, please bring confirmation of your professional affiliation (an online listing you can display on your phone will suffice). - You will be provided with a medical mask and reminded to maintain physical distancing guidelines while at the clinic. - After you receive your vaccination, please plan to stay on site for 15 minutes to ensure you experience no adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction. Important reminder: Provincial orders and guidelines remain in place for everyone, even if you have received the vaccine. "}
