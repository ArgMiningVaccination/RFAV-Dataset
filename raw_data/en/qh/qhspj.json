Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing ULTRACET, and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P)]. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of ULTRACET. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of ULTRACET or following a dose increase [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P)]. Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ULTRACET, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of tramadol [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P)]. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged us e of ULTRACET during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P)]. Interactions with Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes The effects of concomitant use or cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or with ULTRACET requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, and the active metabolite, M1 and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver trans plant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P)]. Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#P) and [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/ultracet-drug.htm#DI)]. - Reserve concomitant prescribing of ULTRACET and benzodiazepines or other CNS depress ants for us e in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. - Limit dos ages and durations to the minimum required. - Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. DESCRIPTION ULTRACET (tramadol hydrochloride/ [agonist](https://www.rxlist.com/agonist/definition.htm), and acetaminophen. for tramadol hydrochloride is (\u00b1)cis-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3- methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride. Its structural formula is: The molecular weight of tramadol hydrochloride is 299.84. Tramadol hydrochloride is a white, bitter, crystalline, and odorless powder. The chemical name for acetaminophen is N-acetyl-p-aminophenol. Its structural formula is: The molecular weight of acetaminophen is 151.17. Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic agent which occurs as a white, odorless, crystalline powder, possessing a slightly bitter taste. ULTRACET tablets contain 37.5 mg of tramadol hydrochloride and 325 mg acetaminophen and are light yellow in color. Inactive ingredients in the tablet are carnauba wax, corn starch, hypromellose, iron oxide, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, powdered cellulose, pregelatinized corn starch, sodium starch glycolate, and titanium dioxide. Meets USP Dissolution Test 2. INDICATIONS ULTRACET tablets are indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Limitations Of Use ULTRACET tablets are indicated for short-term use of five days or less. Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS], reserve ULTRACET for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]: - Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, - Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Important Dosage And Administration Instructions - ULTRACET is not approved for use for more than 5 days. - Do not exceed the recommended dose of ULTRACET. Do not co-administer ULTRACET with other tramadol or acetaminophen containing products [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with ULTRACET and adjust the dosage accordingly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Patient Access To Naloxone For The Emergency Treatment Of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with ULTRACET [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, PATIENT INFORMATION]. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. However, the presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental exposure or overdose. Initial Dosage The initial dose of ULTRACET is 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain relief up to a maximum of 8 tablets per day. Dosage Modification In Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, do not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours. Safe Reduction Or Discontinuation Of ULTRACET Do not abruptly discontinue ULTRACET in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking ULTRACET, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the dose of ULTRACET the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on opioids who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and use a gradual downward taper. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, monitor patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for a long duration and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Drug Abuse And Dependence].

Manufactured by: Janssen Ortho LLC, Gurabo, Puerto Rico 00778. Revised: Apr 2022 SIDE EFFECTS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed, or described in greater detail, in other sections: - Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Ultra-Rapid Metabolism of Tramadol and Other Risk Factors for Life-threatening Respiratory Depression in Children [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome AND PRECAUTIONS] Hepatotoxicity [see WARNINGS AND Interactions Depressants [see AND PRECAUTIONS] Syndrome AND PRECAUTIONS] - Seizures [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Suicide [see AND PRECAUTIONS] PRECAUTIONS] - Gastrointestinal Reactions [see AND PRECAUTIONS] - Hypersensitivity Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - Withdrawal [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (3.0%) in subjects from clinical trials was constipation, diarrhea, nausea, somnolence, anorexia, dizziness, and sweating increased. Table 1 shows the incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 2.0% of subjects over five days of ULTRACET use in clinical trials (subjects took an average of at least 6 tablets per day). Table 1: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (2.0%) |Body System | Preferred 62| Incidence At Least 1%, Causal Relationship At Least Possible Or Greater The following lists adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of at least 1% in single-dose or repeated-dose clinical trials of ULTRACET. Body as a Whole - Asthenia, fatigue, hot flushes Central and Peripheral Nervous System - Dizziness, headache, tremor Gastrointestinal System - Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting Psychiatric Disorders - Anorexia, anxiety, confusion, euphoria, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence Skin and Appendages - Pruritus, rash, increased sweating Selected Adverse Events Occurring At Less Than 1% The following lists clinically relevant adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of less than 1% in ULTRACET clinical trials. Body as a Whole - Chest pain, rigors, syncope, withdrawal syndrome Cardiovascular Disorders - Hypertension, aggravated hypertension, hypotension Central and Peripheral Nervous System - Ataxia, convulsions, hypertonia, aggravated migraine, and Vestibular Disorders - Tinnitus Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders - Arrhythmia, palpitation, tachycardia Liver and Biliary System - Hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders - Weight decrease Psychiatric Disorders - Amnesia, depersonalization, depression, drug abuse, emotional lability, hallucination, impotence, paroniria, abnormal thinking Red Blood Cell Disorders - Anemia Respiratory System - Dyspnea Urinary System - Albuminuria, micturition disorder, oliguria, urinary retention Vision Disorders - Abnormal vision Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tramadol-containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in ULTRACET. Androgen Deficiency Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. QT Prolongation/Torsade De Pointes Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported with tramadol use. Many of these cases were reported in patients taking another drug labeled for QT prolongation, in patients with a risk factor for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia), or in the overdose setting. Eye disorders - miosis, mydriasis Metabolism and nutrition disorders - Hyponatremia: Cases of severe hyponatremia and/or SIADH have been reported in patients taking tramadol, most often in females over the age of 65, and within the first week of therapy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Hypoglycemia Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking tramadol. Most reports were in patients with predisposing risk factors, including diabetes or renal insufficiency, or in elderly patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Nervous system disorders - movement disorder, speech disorder Psychiatric disorders - delirium Other clinically significant adverse experiences previously reported with tramadol hydrochloride: Other events which have been reported with the use of tramadol products and for which a causal association has not been determined include: vasodilation, orthostatic hypotension, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TENS), cognitive dysfunction, difficulty concentrating, depression, suicidal tendency, hepatitis, liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Reported laboratory abnormalities included elevated creatinine and liver function tests. Serotonin syndrome (whose symptoms may include mental status change, hyperreflexia, fever, shivering, tremor, agitation, diaphoresis, seizures, and coma) has been reported with tramadol when used concomitantly with other serotonergic agents such as SSRIs and MAOIs. DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 includes clinically significant interactions with ULTRACET. Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with ULTRACET |Inhibitors of CYP2D6| |Clinical Impact:||The concomitant use of ULTRACET and CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in the plasma concentration of tramadol and a decrease in the plasma concentration of M1, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of ULTRACET is achieved. Since M1 is a more potent -opioid agonist, decreased M1 exposure could result in decreased therapeutic effects, and may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol. Increased tramadol exposure can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome.| |After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease and the M1 plasma concentration will increase which could increase or prolong therapeutic effects but also increase adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].| |Intervention:||If concomitant use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, follow patients closely for adverse reactions including opioid withdrawal, seizures and serotonin syndrome.| |If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, consider lowering ULTRACET dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients closely for adverse events including respiratory depression and sedation.| of ULTRACET and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of tramadol and may result in a greater amount of metabolism via CYP2D6 and greater levels of M1. Follow patients closely for increased risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity including potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of ULTRACET is achieved.| |After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy and possibly signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol.| |Intervention:||If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of ULTRACET until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients closely for seizures and serotonin syndrome, and signs of respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.| |If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the ULTRACET dosage until stable drug effects are achieved and follow patients for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.| |Examples:||Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., ULTRACET decrease the plasma concentration of tramadol [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol.| |After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will increase [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression, seizures and serotonin syndrome.| |Intervention:||If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the ULTRACET dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Follow patients for signs of opioid withdrawal.| |If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider ULTRACET dosage reduction and monitor for seizures and serotonin syndrome, and signs of sedation and respiratory depression.| |Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of ULTRACET and carbamazepine is not recommended.| to additive pharmacologic of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.| |Intervention:||Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS concomitant other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.| |Intervention:||If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue ULTRACET if serotonin syndrome neurotransmitter metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid serotonin syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].| |Intervention:||Do not use ULTRACET in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.| |Intervention:||Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of ULTRACET and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS].| |Diuretics| |Clinical Impact:||Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.| |Intervention:||Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.| |Anticholinergic Drugs| |Clinical Impact:||The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.| |Intervention:||Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when ULTRACET is used with anticholinergic drugs.| |Digoxin| |Clinical Impact:||Postmarketing of digoxin toxicity.| |Intervention:||Follow patients for signs of digoxin toxicity dosage of digoxin as needed.| |Warfarin| |Clinical Impact:||Postmarketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times.| |Intervention:||Monitor the prothrombin time of patients on warfarin for signs of an interaction and adjust the dosage of warfarin as needed.| WARNINGS Included as part of the \"PRECAUTIONS\" Section PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse And Misuse ULTRACET contains tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, ULTRACET exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse And Dependence]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed ULTRACET. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing ULTRACET, and monitor all patients receiving ULTRACET for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of [substance abuse](https://www.rxlist.com/substance_abuse/definition.htm) (including drug or [alcohol abuse](https://www.rxlist.com/alcohol_abuse/definition.htm) or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., [major depression](https://www.rxlist.com/major_depression/definition.htm)). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as ULTRACET, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of ULTRACET along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing [naloxone](https://www.rxlist.com/naloxone/definition.htm) for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing ULTRACET. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation And Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid [analgesic](https://www.rxlist.com/analgesic/definition.htm) products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: - Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. - Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. - Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. - Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS [CME](https://www.rxlist.com/cme/definition.htm)/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal [respiratory depression](https://www.rxlist.com/respiratory_depression/definition.htm) has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see OVERDOSE]. [Carbon dioxide](https://www.rxlist.com/carbon_dioxide/definition.htm) (CO2) retention from respiratory depression exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of ULTRACET, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24- 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of ULTRACET. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of ULTRACET are [essential](https://www.rxlist.com/essential/definition.htm) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Overestimating the ULTRACET dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of ULTRACET, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of tramadol. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. Opioids can cause (CSA) and sleep-related [hypoxemia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoxemia/definition.htm). Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Patient Access To Naloxone For The Emergency Treatment Of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for [access](https://www.rxlist.com/access/definition.htm) to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with ULTRACET. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. However, the presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental exposure or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone. [see Addiction, Abuse and Misuse, Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants, PATIENT INFORMATION]. Ultra-Rapid Metabolism Of Tramadol And Other Risk Factors For Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression In Children Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in [metabolism](https://www.rxlist.com/metabolism/definition.htm) based upon CYP2D6 [genotype](https://www.rxlist.com/genotype/definition.htm) (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite. Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with [obstructive sleep apnea](https://www.rxlist.com/obstructive_sleep_apnea/definition.htm) who are treated with opioids for posttonsillectomy and/or [adenoidectomy](https://www.rxlist.com/adenoidectomy/definition.htm) pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death: - ULTRACET is contraindicated for all children younger than 12 years of age [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. - ULTRACET is contraindicated for [postoperative](https://www.rxlist.com/postoperative/definition.htm)management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following [tonsillectomy](https://www.rxlist.com/tonsillectomy/definition.htm)and/or adenoidectomy [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. - Avoid the use of ULTRACET in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with [hypoventilation](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoventilation/definition.htm)such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep [apnea](https://www.rxlist.com/apnea/definition.htm), [obesity](https://www.rxlist.com/obesity/definition.htm), severe pulmonary disease, [neuromuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/neuromuscular/definition.htm)disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. - As with adults, when prescribing opioids for adolescents, healthcare providers should choose the lowest [effective dose](https://www.rxlist.com/effective_dose/definition.htm)for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of opioid overdose [see Use In Specific Populations, OVERDOSE]. Nursing Mothers Tramadol is subject to the same [polymorphic](https://www.rxlist.com/polymorphic/definition.htm) metabolism as codeine, with ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates being potentially exposed to life-threatening levels of O-desmethyltramadol (M1). At least one death was reported in a nursing infant who was exposed to high levels of [morphine](https://www.rxlist.com/morphine/definition.htm) in breast milk because the mother was an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine. A baby nursing from an ultra-rapid metabolizer mother taking ULTRACET could potentially be exposed to high levels of M1, and experience life-threatening respiratory depression. For this reason, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRACET [see Use In Specific Population]. CYP2D6 Some individuals because a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN). The [prevalence](https://www.rxlist.com/prevalence/definition.htm) of this CYP2D6 [phenotype](https://www.rxlist.com/phenotype/definition.htm) varies widely and has been estimated at 1 to 10% for Whites (European, North American), 3 to 4% for Blacks (African Americans), 1 to 2% for East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), and may be greater than 10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (i.e., Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). These individuals convert tramadol into its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), more rapidly and completely than other people. This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum M1 levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing) [see OVERDOSE]. Therefore, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers should not use ULTRACET. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of ULTRACET during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the [neonate](https://www.rxlist.com/neonate/definition.htm). [Neonatal](https://www.rxlist.com/neonatal/definition.htm) opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by [neonatology](https://www.rxlist.com/neonatology/definition.htm) experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use In Specific Populations and PATIENT INFORMATION]. Risks Of Interactions With Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes The effects of concomitant use or cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors on levels of tramadol and M1 from ULTRACET are complex. Use of cytochrome 3A4 inducers, 3A4 inhibitors, or 2D6 inhibitors with ULTRACET requires careful consideration of the effects on the parent drug, tramadol, which is a weak [serotonin](https://www.rxlist.com/serotonin/definition.htm) and norepinephrine [reuptake](https://www.rxlist.com/reuptake/definition.htm) inhibitor and -opioid agonist, and the active metabolite, M1, which is more potent than tramadol in -opioid receptor binding [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Risks Of Concomitant Use Or Discontinuation Of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Inhibitors The concomitant use of cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine) may result in an increase in tramadol plasma levels and a decrease in the levels of the active metabolite, M1. A decrease in M1 exposure in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reduced efficacy. The effect of increased tramadol levels may be an increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome. Discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibitor may result in a decrease in tramadol plasma levels and an increase in active metabolite M1 levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. Follow patients receiving ULTRACET and any CYP2D6 inhibitor for the risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity, and opioid withdrawal when ULTRACET is used in conjunction with inhibitors of CYP2D6 [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and inducer such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, may result in an increase in tramadol plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions, increase the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. The concomitant use of ULTRACET with all cytochrome P450 inhibitor may result in lower tramadol levels. This may be associated with a decrease in efficacy, and in some patients, may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Follow patients receiving ULTRACET and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer for the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal when ULTRACET is used in conjunction with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 [see and has been associated with cases of acute [liver failure](https://www.rxlist.com/liver_failure/definition.htm), at times resulting in [liver transplant](https://www.rxlist.com/liver_transplant/definition.htm) and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products. The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying [liver disease](https://www.rxlist.com/liver_disease/definition.htm) and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen. Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well. Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of ULTRACET with [benzodiazepines](https://www.rxlist.com/benzodiazepines/definition.htm) or antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression]. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when ULTRACET is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see DRUG INTERACTIONS, PATIENT INFORMATION]. Serotonin Syndrome Risk Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported with the use of tramadol, including ULTRACET, during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic [neurotransmitter](https://www.rxlist.com/neurotransmitter/definition.htm) mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. This may occur within the recommended dosage range. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., [tachycardia](https://www.rxlist.com/tachycardia/definition.htm), [labile](https://www.rxlist.com/labile/definition.htm) blood hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or [gastrointestinal](https://www.rxlist.com/gastrointestinal/definition.htm) symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue ULTRACET if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increased Risk Of Seizures Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous postmarketing reports indicate that [seizure](https://www.rxlist.com/seizure/definition.htm) risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking: [see (e.g., cyclobenzaprine, promethazine, etc.), - Other opioids, - MAO inhibitors [see Serotonin Syndrome Risk, DRUG INTERACTIONS] - Neuroleptics, or - Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. Risk of seizures may also increase in patients with [epilepsy](https://www.rxlist.com/epilepsy/definition.htm), those with a history of seizures, or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head [trauma](https://www.rxlist.com/trauma/definition.htm), metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections). In tramadol overdose, naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure. Suicide Risk - Do not prescribe ULTRACET for patients who are suicidal or addiction- [prone](https://www.rxlist.com/prone/definition.htm). Consideration should be given to the use of non- [narcotic](https://www.rxlist.com/narcotic/definition.htm)analgesics in patients who are suicidal or depressed [see Drug Abuse And Dependence]. - Prescribe ULTRACET with caution for patients with a history of misuse and/or are currently taking CNS-active drugs including tranquilizers, or [antidepressant](https://www.rxlist.com/antidepressant/definition.htm)drugs, or alcohol in excess, and patients who suffer from emotional disturbance or depression [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. - Inform patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Hepatotoxicity, Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants]. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, [anorexia](https://www.rxlist.com/anorexia/definition.htm), fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and [low blood pressure](https://www.rxlist.com/low_blood_pressure/definition.htm). If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with [physiologic](https://www.rxlist.com/physiologic/definition.htm) replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue [corticosteroid](https://www.rxlist.com/corticosteroid/definition.htm) treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression In Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease Or In Elderly, Cachectic, Or Debilitated Patients The use of ULTRACET in patients with acute or severe bronchial [asthma](https://www.rxlist.com/asthma/definition.htm) in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. Patients With Chronic Pulmonary Disease ULTRACET-treated patients with significant [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease](https://www.rxlist.com/chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease/definition.htm) or [cor pulmonale](https://www.rxlist.com/cor_pulmonale/definition.htm), and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, [hypoxia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoxia/definition.htm), [hypercapnia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypercapnia/definition.htm), or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of ULTRACET [see Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ]. Elderly, Cachectic, Or Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, [cachectic](https://www.rxlist.com/cachectic/definition.htm), or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics, or altered clearance, compared to younger, healthier patients [see Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating ULTRACET and when ULTRACET is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress [respiration](https://www.rxlist.com/respiration/definition.htm) [see Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants, DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Severe Hypotension ULTRACET may cause severe [hypotension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypotension/definition.htm) including [orthostatic hypotension](https://www.rxlist.com/orthostatic_hypotension/definition.htm) and [syncope](https://www.rxlist.com/syncope/definition.htm) in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of ULTRACET. In patients with [circulatory](https://www.rxlist.com/circulatory/definition.htm) [shock](https://www.rxlist.com/shock/definition.htm), ULTRACET may cause [vasodilation](https://www.rxlist.com/vasodilation/definition.htm) that can further reduce [cardiac output](https://www.rxlist.com/cardiac_output/definition.htm) and blood pressure. Avoid the use of ULTRACET in patients with circulatory shock. Risk Of Use In Patients With Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, Or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), ULTRACET may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with ULTRACET. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a [head injury](https://www.rxlist.com/head_injury/definition.htm). Avoid the use of ULTRACET in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. Serious Skin Reactions Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Risk Of Use In Patients With Gastrointestinal Conditions ULTRACET is contraindicated in patients with known or gastrointestinal including [paralytic ileus](https://www.rxlist.com/paralytic_ileus/definition.htm) [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum [amylase](https://www.rxlist.com/amylase/definition.htm). Monitor patients with [biliary](https://www.rxlist.com/biliary/definition.htm) tract disease, including [acute pancreatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/acute_pancreatitis/definition.htm), for worsening symptoms. Anaphylaxis And Other Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol. When these events do occur it is often following the first dose. Other reported allergic reactions include [pruritus](https://www.rxlist.com/pruritus/definition.htm), hives, bronchospasm, [angioedema](https://www.rxlist.com/angioedema/definition.htm), toxic [epidermal](https://www.rxlist.com/epidermal/definition.htm) necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to tramadol and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive ULTRACET. If [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm) or other hypersensitivity occurs, stop administration of ULTRACET immediately, discontinue ULTRACET permanently, and do not rechallenge with any formulation of tramadol. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction [see CONTRAINDICATIONS, PATIENT INFORMATION]. There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, [urticaria](https://www.rxlist.com/urticaria/definition.htm), rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue ULTRACET immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe ULTRACET for patients with acetaminophen [allergy](https://www.rxlist.com/allergy/definition.htm). Increased Risk Of Hepatotoxicity With Concomitant Use Of Other Acetaminophen-Containing Products Due to the potential for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity at doses higher than the recommended dose, ULTRACET should not be used concomitantly with other acetaminophen containing products. Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue ULTRACET in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing ULTRACET in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of tramadol and acetaminophen in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Drug Abuse And Dependence]. Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/ [antagonist](https://www.rxlist.com/antagonist/definition.htm) (e.g., nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., [buprenorphine](https://www.rxlist.com/buprenorphine/definition.htm)) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including ULTRACET. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate [withdrawal symptoms](https://www.rxlist.com/withdrawal_symptoms/definition.htm) [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Driving And Operating Machinery ULTRACET may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of ULTRACET and know how they will react to the medication [see PATIENT INFORMATION]. Hyponatremia [Hyponatremia](https://www.rxlist.com/hyponatremia/definition.htm) (serum sodium < 135 mmol/L) has been reported with the use of tramadol, and many cases are severe (sodium level < 120 mmol/L). Most cases of hyponatremia occurred in females over the age of 65 and within the first week of therapy. In some reports, hyponatremia resulted from the [syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone](https://www.rxlist.com/syndrome_of_inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone/definition.htm) secretion (SIADH). Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia (e.g., confusion, disorientation), during treatment with ULTRACET, especially during initiation of therapy. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are present, initiate appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction) and discontinue ULTRACET [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Safe Reduction Or Discontinuation Of ULTRACET]. Hypoglycemia Cases of tramadol-associated [hypoglycemia](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoglycemia/definition.htm) have been reported, some resulting in hospitalization. In most cases, patients had predisposing risk factors (e.g. [diabetes](https://www.rxlist.com/diabetes/definition.htm)). If hypoglycemia is suspected, monitor [blood glucose](https://www.rxlist.com/blood_glucose/definition.htm) levels and consider drug discontinuation as appropriate [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Safe Reduction Or Discontinuation Of ULTRACET]. Patient Counseling Information Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Storage And Disposal Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store ULTRACET securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Drug Abuse And Dependence]. Inform patients that leaving ULTRACET unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home. Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Inform patients that medicine take-back options are the preferred way to safely dispose of most types of unneeded medicines. If no take back programs or [Drug Enforcement Administration](https://www.rxlist.com/drug_enforcement_administration_dea/definition.htm) ( [DEA](https://www.rxlist.com/dea/definition.htm))-registered collectors are available, instruct patients to dispose of ULTRACET by following these four steps: - Mix ULTRACET (do not crush) with an unpalatable substance such as dirt, cat litter, or used [coffee](https://www.rxlist.com/coffee/supplements.htm)grounds; - Place the mixture in a container such as a sealed plastic bag; - Throw the container in the household trash; - Delete all personal information on the prescription label of the empty bottle. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for additional information on disposal of unused medicines. Addiction, Abuse, And Misuse Inform patients that the use of ULTRACET, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Instruct patients not to share ULTRACET with others and to take steps to protect ULTRACET from theft or misuse. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting ULTRACET or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Patient Access To Naloxone For The Emergency Treatment Of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with ULTRACET. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone's effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see OVERDOSE]. If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: - How to treat with naloxone, in the event of an opioid overdose - To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency - To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Ultra-Rapid Metabolism Of Tramadol And Other Risk Factors For Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression In Children Advise caregivers that ULTRACET is contraindicated in children younger than 12 years of age and in children younger than 18 years of age f o l l o w i n g tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Advise caregivers of children 12 to 18 years of age receiving ULTRACET to monitor for signs of respiratory depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Interactions With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if ULTRACET is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that tramadol could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, particularly during concomitant use with serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms and signs of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. MAOI Interaction Inform patients not to take ULTRACET while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking ULTRACET [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Seizures Inform patients that ULTRACET may cause seizures with concomitant use of serotonergic agents (including SSRIs, SNRIs, and triptans) or drugs that significantly reduce the clearance of tramadol [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients how to properly take ULTRACET [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. - Do not adjust the dose of ULTRACET without consulting with a physician or other healthcare provider. - Do not take more than 4000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day and to call their healthcare provider if they took more than the recommended dose. Important Discontinuation Instructions In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue ULTRACET without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Hypotension Inform cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Anaphylaxis Inform patients that anaphylaxis have been reported with ingredients contained in ULTRACET. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Pregnancy Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Inform female patients of reproductive potential that ULTRACET should not be used for more than 5 days and that prolonged use of opioids such as ULTRACET, during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and Use In Specific Populations]. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Inform female patients of reproductive potential that ULTRACET can cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Use In Specific Populations]. Lactation Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRACET [see Use In Specific Populations]. Infertility Inform patients that chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [Use In Specific Populations]. Driving Or Operating Heavy Machinery Inform patients that ULTRACET may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Constipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Maximum Daily Acetaminophen Use Advise patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day and call their doctor if they have taken more than the recommended dose [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Use With Other Acetaminophen Containing Products Advise patients not to take ULTRACET in combination with other tramadol or acetaminophen-containing products, including preparations [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility There are no animal or laboratory studies on the combination product (tramadol and acetaminophen) to evaluate carcinogenesis, [mutagenesis](https://www.rxlist.com/mutagenesis/definition.htm), or impairment of fertility. Data on the individual components are described below. Carcinogenesis A slight but statistically significant increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in an NMRI mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (0.5 times the maximum recommended daily human dosage or MRHD) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in a rat 2-year carcinogenicity study testing oral doses of up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (1 times the MRHD). Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National [Toxicology](https://www.rxlist.com/toxicology/definition.htm) Program to evaluate the [carcinogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/carcinogenic/definition.htm) potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell [leukemia](https://www.rxlist.com/leukemia/definition.htm) at 1.2 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 2.6 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats (1.1 times) or mice (1.9-2.2 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). Mutagenesis Tramadol was mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse [lymphoma](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphoma/definition.htm) assay. Tramadol was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay using Salmonella and E. coli (Ames), the mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of metabolic activation, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay, marrow](https://www.rxlist.com/bone_marrow/definition.htm). assay ( [Ames test](https://www.rxlist.com/ames_test/definition.htm)). In contrast, acetaminophen tested of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in in vitro assays using Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (2.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect. Impairment Of Fertility No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 75 mg/kg in female rats. These dosages are 1.6 and 2.4 times the MRHD [see Use In Specific Populations]. In studies of acetaminophen conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments have been completed in Swiss mice via a continuous breeding study. There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on [sperm motility](https://www.rxlist.com/sperm_motility/definition.htm) or [sperm](https://www.rxlist.com/sperm/definition.htm) density in the [epididymis](https://www.rxlist.com/epididymis/definition.htm), there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.7 times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing. Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface area comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced [spermatogenesis](https://www.rxlist.com/spermatogenesis/definition.htm), reduced fertility, and reduced [implantation](https://www.rxlist.com/implantation/definition.htm) sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Available data with ULTRACET in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm). In animal reproduction studies, the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen decreased fetal weights and increased [supernumerary](https://www.rxlist.com/supernumerary/definition.htm) ribs at 1.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD). In separate animal reproduction studies, tramadol administration alone during organogenesis decreased fetal weights and reduced [ossification](https://www.rxlist.com/ossification/definition.htm) in mice, rats, and rabbits at 1.4, 0.6, and 3.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD). Tramadol decreased pup body weight and increased pup mortality at 1.2 and 1.9 times the MRHD. Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and mice from the published literature identified adverse events at clinically relevant doses with acetaminophen. Treatment of pregnant rats with doses of acetaminophen approximately 1.3 times the maximum human daily dose (MRHD) showed evidence of fetotoxicity and increases in bone variations in the fetuses. In another study, [necrosis](https://www.rxlist.com/necrosis/definition.htm) was observed in the liver and kidney of both pregnant rats and fetuses at doses approximately 1.9 times the MHDD. In mice treated with acetaminophen at doses within the clinical dosing range, cumulative adverse effects on reproduction were seen in a continuous breeding study. A reduction in number of litters of the parental mating pair was observed as well as retarded growth and abnormal sperm in their offspring and reduced birth weight in the next generation [see Data]. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of [birth defect](https://www.rxlist.com/birth_defect/definition.htm), loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in respiratory depression and physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, [hyperactivity](https://www.rxlist.com/hyperactivity/definition.htm) and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, [tremor](https://www.rxlist.com/tremor/definition.htm), vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms and signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and stillbirth have been reported with tramadol hydrochloride during postmarketing. Labor Or Delivery ULTRACET is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate. ULTRACET is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including ULTRACET, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of [cervical](https://www.rxlist.com/cervical/definition.htm) [dilation](https://www.rxlist.com/dilation/definition.htm), which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor. The effect of ULTRACET, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown. Data Animal Data No drug-related [teratogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/teratogenic/definition.htm) effects were observed in the [progeny](https://www.rxlist.com/progeny/definition.htm) of rats treated orally with tramadol and acetaminophen. The tramadol/acetaminophen combination product was shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats at a maternally toxic dose, 50/434 mg/kg tramadol/acetaminophen (1.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol/acetaminophen dosage), but was not teratogenic at this dose level. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted of decreased fetal weights and increased supernumerary ribs. Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg), rats (25 mg/kg) and rabbits (75 mg/kg) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These doses on a mg/m2 basis are 1.9, 0.8, and 4.9 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively. No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg), rats (up to 80 mg/kg) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg, a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 2.3, 2.6, and 19 times the MRHD, respectively. Tramadol alone was evaluated in peri- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m2 or 1.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (480 mg/m2 or 2.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage). Studies in pregnant rats that received oral acetaminophen during organogenesis at doses up to 1.3 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD = 2.6 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison) showed evidence of fetotoxicity (reduced fetal weight and length) and a doserelated increase in bone variations (reduced ossification and rudimentary [rib](https://www.rxlist.com/rib/definition.htm) changes). Offspring had no evidence of external, [visceral](https://www.rxlist.com/visceral/definition.htm), or skeletal malformations. When pregnant rats received oral acetaminophen throughout gestation at doses of 1.9-times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison), areas of necrosis occurred in both the liver and kidney of pregnant rats and fetuses. These effects did not occur in animals that received oral acetaminophen at doses 0.5-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison. In a continuous breeding study, pregnant mice received 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0% acetaminophen via the diet (357, 715, or 1430 mg/kg/day). These doses are approximately 0.7, 1.3, and 2.7 times the MHDD, respectively, based on a body surface area comparison. A dose-related reduction in body weights of fourth and fifth litter offspring of the treated mating pair occurred during lactation and post-weaning at all doses. Animals in the high dose group had a reduced number of litters per mating pair, male offspring with an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, and reduced birth weights in the next generation pups. Lactation Risk Summary ULTRACET is not recommended for obstetrical [preoperative](https://www.rxlist.com/preoperative/definition.htm) medication or for post-delivery [analgesia](https://www.rxlist.com/analgesia/definition.htm) in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied. Tramadol and its metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The M1 metabolite is more potent than tramadol in mu opioid receptor binding [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. Published studies have reported tramadol and M1 in [colostrum](https://www.rxlist.com/colostrum/definition.htm) with administration of tramadol to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol may have higher than expected serum levels of M1, potentially leading to higher levels of M1 in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal tramadol metabolism, the amount of tramadol secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ULTRACET. Clinical Considerations If infants are exposed to ULTRACET through breast milk, they should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. Data Following a single IV 100 mg dose of tramadol, the cumulative excretion in breast milk within 16 hours post dose was 100 mcg of tramadol (0.1% of the maternal dose) and 27 mcg of M1. Females And Males Of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ADVERSE REACTIONS, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Nonclinical Toxicology]. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ULTRACET in pediatric patients have not been established. Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. In some of the reported cases, these events followed tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, and one of the children had evidence of being an ultra-rapid metabolizer of tramadol (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6). Children with sleep apnea may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death: - ULTRACET is contraindicated for all children younger than age 12 years of age [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. - ULTRACET is contraindicated for postoperative management in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [see CONTRAINDICATIONS]. - Avoid the use of ULTRACET in adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have other risk factors that may increase their sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Risk factors include conditions associated with hypoventilation such as postoperative status, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, severe pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, and concomitant use of other medications that cause respiratory depression. Geriatric Use Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of ULTRACET slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of [central nervous system](https://www.rxlist.com/central_nervous_system_cns/definition.htm) and respiratory depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ULTRACET in patients with impaired hepatic function have not been studied. Based on information using tramadol immediate-release tablets in subjects with advanced [cirrhosis](https://www.rxlist.com/cirrhosis/definition.htm) of the liver, tramadol exposure was higher and half-lives of tramadol and active metabolite M1 were longer than in subjects with normal hepatic function [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY]. As tramadol and acetaminophen are both extensively metabolized by the liver, the use of ULTRACET in patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of ULTRACET in patients with renal impairment has not been studied. Based on studies using tramadol extended-release tablets, the excretion of tramadol and metabolite M1 is reduced in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearances of less than 30 mL/min, it is recommended that the dosage of ULTRACET not exceed 2 tablets every 12 hours. [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 hour [dialysis](https://www.rxlist.com/dialysis/definition.htm) period is less than 7% of the administered dose based on studies using tramadol alone. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Sex Tramadol clearance was 20% higher in female subjects compared to males in four Phase 1 studies of ULTRACET in 50 male and 34 female healthy subjects. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown. OVERDOSE Clinical Presentation ULTRACET is a combination drug. The clinical presentation of overdose may include the signs and symptoms of tramadol toxicity, acetaminophen toxicity or both. The initial symptoms of tramadol overdosage may include respiratory depression and/or seizures. The initial symptoms seen within the first 24 hours following an acetaminophen overdose are: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, [malaise](https://www.rxlist.com/malaise/definition.htm), pallor and diaphoresis. Tramadol Acute overdosage with tramadol can be manifested by respiratory depression, [somnolence](https://www.rxlist.com/somnolence/definition.htm) progressing to stupor or coma, [skeletal muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/skeletal_muscle/definition.htm) flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, pupils, some cases, [pulmonary edema](https://www.rxlist.com/pulmonary_edema/definition.htm), hypotension, partial or snoring, seizures, and death. Marked [mydriasis](https://www.rxlist.com/mydriasis/definition.htm) rather than [miosis](https://www.rxlist.com/miosis/definition.htm) may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations. Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of tramadol [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when tramadol is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants, including other opioids. Acetaminophen In acute acetaminophen overdosage, fatal hepatic necrosis is the most serious [adverse effect](https://www.rxlist.com/adverse_effect/definition.htm). Renal tubular necrosis, [hypoglycemic](https://www.rxlist.com/hypoglycemic/definition.htm) coma, and [thrombocytopenia](https://www.rxlist.com/thrombocytopenia/definition.htm) also occur. Plasma acetaminophen levels >300 mcg/mL at 4 hours after oral ingestion were associated with hepatic damage in 90% of patients; minimal hepatic damage is anticipated if plasma levels at 4 hours are <150 mcg/mL or <37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours after ingestion. Early symptoms following a potentially [hepatotoxic](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatotoxic/definition.htm) overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion. Treatment Of Overdose A single or multiple drug overdose with tramadol and acetaminophen is a potentially [lethal](https://www.rxlist.com/lethal/definition.htm) polydrug overdose, and consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, assisted [ventilation](https://www.rxlist.com/ventilation/definition.htm), and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Tramadol In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a [patent](https://www.rxlist.com/patent_adjective/definition.htm) and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced [life-support](https://www.rxlist.com/life-support/definition.htm) techniques. Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals, convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of ULTRACET could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. [Hemodialysis](https://www.rxlist.com/hemodialysis/definition.htm) is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period. Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tramadol in ULTRACET, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. Acetaminophen If an acetaminophen overdose is suspected, obtain a serum acetaminophen assay as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following oral ingestion. Obtain liver function studies initially and repeat at 24-hour intervals. Administer the [antidote](https://www.rxlist.com/antidote/definition.htm) N- [acetylcysteine](https://www.rxlist.com/acetylcysteine/definition.htm) (NAC) as early as possible. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since oral ingestion on a nomogram Rumack-Matthew). The lower toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours and 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, administer the entire course of NAC treatment. Withhold NAC therapy if the acetaminophen level is below the lower line. [Gastric](https://www.rxlist.com/gastric/definition.htm) decontamination with [activated charcoal](https://www.rxlist.com/activated_charcoal/supplements.htm) should be administered just prior to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to decrease systemic absorption if acetaminophen ingestion is known or suspected to have occurred within a few hours of presentation. Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration. Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication. CONTRAINDICATIONS ULTRACET is contraindicated for: - all children younger than 12 years of age [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS] - post-operative management in children younger than 18 years of age following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. ULTRACET is also contraindicated in patients with: - Significant respiratory depression [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic [ileus](https://www.rxlist.com/ileus/definition.htm)[see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Previous hypersensitivity to tramadol, acetaminophen, any other component of this product, or opioids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. - Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or use within the last 14 days [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The following information is based on studies of tramadol alone or acetaminophen alone, except where otherwise noted: Mechanism Of Action ULTRACET contains tramadol, serotonin and acetaminophen. Although the mode of action of tramadol is not completely understood, the analgesic effect of tramadol is believed to be due to both binding to -opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low [affinity](https://www.rxlist.com/affinity/definition.htm) binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O-demethylated metabolite M1 to -opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in -opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the [opiate](https://www.rxlist.com/opiate/definition.htm) antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound [see Pharmacokinetics]. Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol. Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined but is thought to primarily involve central actions. Pharmacodynamics Effects On The Central Nervous System Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on [brain stem](https://www.rxlist.com/brain_stem/definition.htm) respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not [pathognomonic](https://www.rxlist.com/pathognomonic/definition.htm) (e.g., pontine lesions of [hemorrhagic](https://www.rxlist.com/hemorrhagic/definition.htm) or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations. Effects On The Gastrointestinal Tract And Other Smooth Muscle Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in [smooth muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/smooth_muscle/definition.htm) tone in the [antrum](https://www.rxlist.com/antrum/definition.htm) of the stomach and [duodenum](https://www.rxlist.com/duodenum/definition.htm). Digestion of food in the [small intestine](https://www.rxlist.com/small_intestine/definition.htm) is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the [colon](https://www.rxlist.com/colon/definition.htm) are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioidinduced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. Effects On The Cardiovascular System Tramadol produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of [histamine](https://www.rxlist.com/histamine/definition.htm) release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension. The effect of oral tramadol on the QTcF was evaluated four-way crossover, placebo- and positive- (moxifloxacin) controlled study in 68 adult male and female healthy subjects. At a 600 mg/day dose (1.5-fold the maximum immediate-release daily dose), the study demonstrated no significant effect on the QTcF interval. Effects On The Endocrine System Opioids inhibit humans stimulate influence the hypothalamic- [pituitary](https://www.rxlist.com/pituitary/definition.htm)-gonadal [axis](https://www.rxlist.com/axis/definition.htm), leading to [androgen](https://www.rxlist.com/androgen/definition.htm) [libido](https://www.rxlist.com/libido/definition.htm), [impotence](https://www.rxlist.com/impotence/definition.htm), [erectile dysfunction](https://www.rxlist.com/erectile_dysfunction/definition.htm), [amenorrhea](https://www.rxlist.com/amenorrhea/definition.htm), or [infertility](https://www.rxlist.com/infertility/definition.htm). The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of [hypogonadism](https://www.rxlist.com/hypogonadism/definition.htm) is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see ADVERSE REACTIONS]. Effects On The Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly [immunosuppressive](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppressive/definition.htm). Concentration Efficacy Relationships The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with potent opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of tramadol for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Concentration Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing tramadol plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Pharmacokinetics Tramadol is administered as a racemate and both the [-] and [+] forms of both tramadol and M1 are detected in the [circulation](https://www.rxlist.com/circulation/definition.htm). Absorption The absolute bioavailability of tramadol from ULTRACET tablets has not been determined. Tramadol has a mean absolute bioavailability of approximately 75% following administration of a single 100 mg oral dose of ULTRAM tablets. The mean peak plasma concentration of racemic tramadol and M1 after administration of two ULTRACET tablets occurs at approximately two and three hours, respectively, post-dose. The pharmacokinetics of plasma tramadol and acetaminophen following oral administration of one ULTRACET tablet are shown in Table 3. Tramadol has a slower absorption and longer half-life when compared to acetaminophen. Table 3: Summary of Mean (\u00b1SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of the (+)- and (-) Enantiomers of Tramadol and M1 and Acetaminophen Following A Single Oral Dose Of One Tramadol/Acetaminophen Combination Tablet (37.5 mg/325 single-dose pharmacokinetic study of ULTRACET in volunteers showed no drug interactions between tramadol and acetaminophen. Upon multiple oral dosing to steady state, however, the bioavailability of tramadol and metabolite M1 was lower for the combination tablets compared to tramadol administered alone. The decrease in AUC was 14% for (-)-M1. The cause of this reduced bioavailability is not clear. Peak plasma concentrations of acetaminophen occur within one hour and are not affected by co-administration with tramadol. Following single- or multiple-dose administration of ULTRACET, no significant change in acetaminophen pharmacokinetics was observed when compared to acetaminophen given alone. Food Effect When ULTRACET was administered with food, the time to peak plasma concentration was delayed for approximately 35 minutes for tramadol and almost one hour for acetaminophen. However, peak plasma concentrations, and the extents of absorption, of tramadol and acetaminophen were not affected. The clinical significance of this difference is unknown. Distribution The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2.6 and 2.9 L/kg in male and female subjects, respectively, following a 100 mg intravenous dose. The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20% and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 mcg/mL. Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range. Acetaminophen appears to be widely distributed throughout most body tissues except fat. Its apparent volume of distribution is about 0.9 L/kg. A relative small portion (~20%) of acetaminophen is bound to plasma protein. Elimination Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean (SD) apparent total clearance of tramadol after a single 37.5 mg dose is 588 (226) mL/min for the (+) isomer and 736 (244) mL/min for the (-) isomer. The plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and M1 are approximately 5-6 and 7 hours, respectively, after administration of ULTRACET. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased to 7-9 hours upon multiple dosing of ULTRACET. The half-life of acetaminophen is about 2 to 3 hours in adults. It is somewhat shorter in children and somewhat longer in neonates and in cirrhotic patients. Acetaminophen is eliminated from the body primarily by formation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in a dose dependent manner. Metabolism Following oral administration, tramadol is extensively metabolized by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent and metabolites. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. Metabolite M1 (O-desmethyltramadol) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response [see DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P450. [dextromethorphan](https://www.rxlist.com/dextromethorphan/definition.htm), and tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in \"poor metabolizers\" versus \"extensive metabolizers,\" while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, [amitriptyline](https://www.rxlist.com/amitriptyline/definition.htm), and quinidine inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees. The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order [kinetics](https://www.rxlist.com/kinetics/definition.htm) and involves three principal separate pathways: - conjugation with glucuronide; - conjugation with [glutathione](https://www.rxlist.com/glutathione/supplements.htm)and is thenfurther conjugates. principal P450 be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways. In adults, the majority of acetaminophen is conjugated with glucuronic acid and, to a lesser extent, with sulfate. These glucuronide-, sulfate-, and glutathione-derived metabolites lack biologic activity. In premature infants, newborns, and young infants, the sulfate conjugate predominates. Excretion Approximately 30% of the tramadol dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. Less than 9% of acetaminophen is excreted unchanged in the urine. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol extended-release 100 mg. The exposure of (+)-and (-) -tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of (+)- and (-)-M1 decreased ~50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration of tramadol extended-release has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use In Specific Populations]. Renal Impairment Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. The pharmacokinetics of tramadol were studied in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol extended-release 100 mg. There is no consistent trend observed for tramadol exposure related to renal function in patients with mild (CLcr: 50-80 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr: 30-50 mL/min) renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function. However, exposure of M1 increased 20-40% with increased severity of the renal impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). tramadol extended-release has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Use In Specific Populations]. Geriatric Population A population pharmacokinetic analysis of data obtained from a clinical trial in patients with [chronic pain](https://www.rxlist.com/chronic_pain/definition.htm) treated with ULTRACET, which included 55 patients between 65 and 75 years of age and 19 patients over 75 years of age, showed no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and acetaminophen in elderly patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Use In Specific Populations] Sex Tramadol clearance was 20% higher in female subjects compared to males on four Phase 1 studies of ULTRACET in 50 male and 34 female healthy subjects. Poor / Extensive Metabolizers, CYP2D6 The formation of the active metabolite, M1, is mediated by CYP2D6. Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P-450. dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase 1 studies with immediate-release tablets in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in \"poor metabolizers\" versus \"extensive metabolizers,\" while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. Drug Interaction Studies CYP2D6 Inhibitors In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 (fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, amitriptyline, and quinidine) inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees, suggesting that concomitant administration of these compounds could result in increases in tramadol concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1. The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown. Quinidine Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6. A study was conducted to examine the effect of quinidine, a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6, on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol by administering 200 mg quinidine two hours before the administration of 100 mg tramadol extended release tablet. The results demonstrated that the exposure of tramadol increased 50- 60% and the exposure of M1 decreased 50-60%. In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Cimetidine Concomitant administration of tramadol and cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics. Therefore, no alteration of the ULTRACET dosage regimen is recommended. CYP3A4 Inhibitors And Inducers Tramadol is metabolized by CYP3A4. Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, or CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and St. John's Wort, with tramadol may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS DRUG INTERACTIONS]. Carbamazepine a CYP3A4 inducer, increases tramadol metabolism. Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Concomitant administration of tramadol and carbamazepine is not recommended. Potential For Tramadol To Affect Other Drugs In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of other drugs when tramadol is administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses. Tramadol does not appear to induce its own metabolism in humans, since observed maximal plasma concentrations after multiple oral doses are higher than expected based on single dose data. Clinical Studies Single-Dose Studies For Treatment Of Acute Pain In single-dose studies in [acute pain](https://www.rxlist.com/acute_pain/definition.htm), two tablets of ULTRACET administered to patients with pain following oral surgical procedures provided greater relief than placebo or either of the individual components given at the same dose. The onset of pain relief after ULTRACET was faster than tramadol alone. Onset of analgesia occurred in less than one hour. The duration of pain relief after ULTRACET was longer than acetaminophen alone. Analgesia was generally comparable to that of the comparator, ibuprofen. PATIENT INFORMATION ULTRACET\u00ae [UHL-truh-set] (tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen) Tablets ULTRACET is: - A strong prescription pain medicine that contains an opioid (narcotic) that is used for the short-term (five days or less) management of acute pain, when other pain treatments such as non-opioid pain medicines do not treat your pain well enough or you cannot tolerate them. - An opioid pain medicine that can put you at risk for overdose and death.
