Also they have a lot of books and other herbal supplements for non traditional treatment to offer so definitely check them out. Another good thing is that they have two stores and if something is available in the other store they can get you the required item next day. you could also visit their website and order if going to the store isn't feasible. Very interesting store with almost anything you can think of. I like the Italian mints. Quality merchandise, just opened an accompanying store next door with men's toiletries and women's fragrances, etc. reminds me of an old fashioned pharmacy but with much more. Try Daileys Grill a block or two down for delicious burgers and fries. Metz is a unique pharmacy. They are not like the big box stores. The feature service and a super variety of quality items. The one in Lincoln Square expanded November 2014 to more than double in size. The main expansion i for men's item with a grand variety of shaving items. I popped into Merz for a little holiday shopping as my wife and daughters love fancy soaps, lotions and lip balms and scents. Merz is not large, but they have an incredible selection. Even their men's items caught my attention. I was able to pick up some nice things during my visit. Lastly, the staff were great. I was immediately asked if I needed help, and when I said \"no\" they let me browse uninterrupted by sales patter. But when I had a request, they were ready to help (and friendly, too). Merz has most anything you might want in a natural health store. Toiletries, homeopathic remedies, etc. So much to look at, it's hard to tear yourself away! Merz Apothecary offers the widest selection of toiletries of any store I have ever visited.The staff is well informed and helpful, and they have a great online shop as well. "}
