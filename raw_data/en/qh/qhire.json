The center integrates functional medicine, mind-body medicine and nutritional medicine. \"We're the first really proactive generation using our dollars to support the prevention of disease,\" says Blum, 56. \"What is that? The way you eat, the way you manage stress and exercise: Those are the classic big three lifestyle factors that determine our health.\" When people consider their health in a more well-rounded way, different kinds of health care treatments make more sense, medical professionals say. More than 33 percent of U.S. adults use complementary health approaches, according to a 2012 study by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Stress has a huge influence in all aspects of wellness and that's where complementary medicine can especially help, Blum says. Many places such as the Blum Center offer meditation classes, consultations and workshops, but for those who can't, or don't want to, sit still for traditional mediation, there all different kinds of techniques. [HEALTH: Baby Boomers need to hit the gym ](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2016/11/09/baby-boomers-need-hit-gym/92506852/) [CRYOTHERAPY: Freezing out what ails you?](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2016/11/10/cryotherapy-boomer-health/93535594/) [ALZHEIMER'S: Facing down the threat](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2016/11/09/facing-down-alzheimers-threat/93181142/) Yoga, tai chi, acupuncture, massage, breathing, biofeedback, reiki, nature walks, knitting, praying and cellphone apps such as Calm and Headspace are a few other ways to find balance and reduce stress. \"As doctors, it's our job to help people understand the connection between their stress and their health and to give them tools to do something about it,\" Blum says. You can do it yourself or find a professional for guidance. Jodie Tassello, co-founder of Sundala Center for Wellness with locations in Orangeburg and New York City, helps patients with acupuncture, advanced allergy therapeutics, trigger point dry needling, cancer support and weight management. Before starting Sundala with co-founder Bianca Beldini, Tassello worked for 17 years in Western medicine, starting as a research scientist in virology and infectious diseases. She then researched alternatives to chemotherapy radiation such as immunology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, delving into acupuncture and integrative medicine before ending up with Sundala. \"There has been a huge shift in the last couple years, which has been wonderful. We get patients who come to us and say, 'My doctor said I should really try acupuncture.' Doctors are recognizing that acupuncture can be complementary to what they're doing in speeding up the healing process,\" Tassello says. Maybe the rising confidence has to do with the increase in published clinical trials showing the mechanisms of action in acupuncture, she says. Their Sundala method style of treatment kind of modernizes ancient Chinese medicine, Tassello says. It used to be the last resort for people who exhausted more traditional Western options. Now more than 50 percent of her patients are baby boomers. \"I think people are seeing a lot of problems and side effects and addiction with medications and they want to try something different before they go down that road, something more holistic,\" Tassello says. Dr. Susanne Saltzman has been practicing homeopathic medicine for 25 years with an office called Hartsdale Homeopathy. She began in conventional medicine. A graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Saltzman interned in psychiatry and internal medicine at Jacobi and Montefiore hospitals in the Bronx. \"At Jacobi 25 years ago, I saw so many people prescribed drugs that were not helping them,\" Saltzman recalls. \"Pharmaceuticals were merely suppressing symptoms, not getting at the root cause. And the side effects of the drugs were sometimes worse than the disease itself. With homeopathic and functional medicine, people get better without the harmful effects of medications.\" More than ever, Saltzman sees boomers coming in with chronic fatigue, irritable bowel issues, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders, high blood pressure and menopausal problems. Many women also come because they can't lose weight. Saltzman attributes many of these health issues to leaky gut syndrome, toxins, hormone imbalances and overuse of antibiotics. There isn't a cure-all for any illness because of all the other facets of the person that must be considered. \"The same disease in five different people may have five different remedies,\" she says. Besides seeing patients these days, Saltzman is also vice president of The American Institute of Homeopathy and editor in chief of the American Journal of Homeopathic Medicine. \"With homeopathy, you're treating the whole person \u2014 the mental, emotional states as well as physical,\" Saltzman says. \"Integrative-alternative medicine is the future.\" HOSPITALS EMBRACING ALTERNATIVES At White Plains Hospital, patients are increasingly seeing alternatives to traditional forms of treatment, such a reiki. Northern Westchester has a suite of intergrative medicine services including acupuncture, clinical aromatherapy, reflexology and Reiki. "}
