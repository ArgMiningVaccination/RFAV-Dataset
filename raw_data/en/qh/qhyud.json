Availability to Testify before the He alth Research Advisory Committee - Copies of the written testimony will be provided to the Health Research A dvisory Committee. Committee members will review the testimony and determine which persons should be invite d to attend the Committee's fall meeting. During the Committee meeting those persons who were invited to test ify will be asked to summarize the critical research questions related to their written testimony and then answer Committee me mbers' questions. If invited by the Department to do so, would you be willing to presen t testimony and answer questions about your proposed research priority at the Committee meeting to be held in Philadelphia on October 8th? Yes No - 7 - Process Used by the CURE Program to Establish Research Priorities and Select Health Research Projects for Funding Act 2001-77, the Tobacco Settlement Act, authorized the Pennsylvania Depart ment of Health to establish the Health Research Program, known as the Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement (CURE) Program. Each year, CURE awards two types of hea lth research grants: (1) health research formula grants, which are awarded only to hospitals, universities and non-profit organizations that have received three consecutive years of funding from the National Institutes of Health; and (2) nonformula grants, which are awarded competitively in response to a Request for Application (RFA) that is issued once a year. Any person or organization located in Pennsylvania is eligible to apply fo r the nonformula health research gr ants in response to the RFA. The nonformula health research grants fund biomedical, clinical and health se rvices research projects that are consistent with specific research priorities. Once a year , the research priorities for both formula and nonformula grants are reviewed and revised as needed. The resear ch priorities are established by the Department in conjunction with a Health Research Advisory Committee, which is chai red by the Secretary of Health. Prior to establishing the research prio rities, the public is invited to subm it written testimony on research needs. Copies of the written testimony are provided to the H ealth Research Advisory Committee. Committee members review the testimony and determine which persons should be invited to attend the Committee's fall meeting. During the fall meeting those persons w ho were invited to testify are asked to summarize the critical research questions related to their writt en testimony and then answer Committee members' questions. After the research priorities are finalized for the year, a RFA is issued to solicit research projects that address the priorities. Typically, the RFA is issu ed during late summer or early fall. The research priorities for the competitive nonformula h ealth research grants have changed each year. They were: bioinformatics related to cance r or infectious diseases (2001-02) and reducing disparities related to cardiovascular disease and mental disorders (2002-03), lung disease and pregnancy outcomes (2003-04), neurodegenerative disease and tobacco use and cessa tion vaccine prevention regenera tive autism spectrum disorders and antibio tic resistance (2008-09), and cancer v accines and blindness and visual impairment (2009-10). Current and pa st state fiscal year priorities for both formula-funded and nonformula- funded health research are posted on the Department of Health's CURE website (http://www.health.state.pa.us/cure ). See CURE Health Research Priorities for a complete description of the priorities. The Health Research Program mainta ins: (1) a public testimony mailing lis t of persons who want to receive invitations to submit testimony on health research needs; and (2) an RFA mailing list of persons who want to receive copies of the RFA electronically when released. If you would like to be placed on either or both of these lists (public testimony mailing li st or RFA mailing list), please email the following information to ra-healthresearch@state.pa.us : your name and professional degree(s ), organization, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. - 8 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) James E. Burgess DEGREE(S) MD Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Associate Professor Neuros urgery Drexel Univesity NAME OF ORGANIZATION MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 420 East North Avenue STE 302 Allegheny General Hosital Pittsburgh, PA 15202 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 412-359-6297 E-MAIL ADDRESS: jburgess@wpahs.org Health Research Priority Title and Description Geriatric Trauma The state of Pennsylvania has one of the oldest populations of all of th e U.S. Of the preventable causes of disability, loss of independe nce and death in this group of people, tr auma ranks as number one. The type of trauma most common within this age group is injury due to falls from standing due to loss of balance, overmedication, gait disturbances, fatigue, joint failure, etc. Falls that might be innocuous in a younger person can result in catastrophic injury in the elderly. Means of preventing falls or abrogating their effect s hould be a health care prio rity in Pennsylvania. By stressing prevention and intervention, we would not only elevate the qualit y of life for our seniors but save millions of dollars in extended hospitalizations that arise due to these accidents. Falls in the elderly should be attacked in a number of ways: 1. technological advances in secure living environments, 2. smart drug di spensation systems to avoid senior polypharmacy, 3. advances in assistive ga it technology, 4. frequent gait analys is to predict impeding posture or gait failure. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1. Development of a \"falls archivin g device\" to monitor in terventions in posture and gait in the elderly. 2. Develop inexpensive balance measuring devices that can be installed in persona l care residences, nursing homes, and group homes that can detect wo rsening balance or gait disturbances. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. How can polypharmacy gait deterioration be detected earl y and does it decrease the incidence of falls in the elderly? 2. Can frequent (or regular) gait analysis in the elderly diminish th e incidence of falls in the elderly? 3. Analysis of medications frequently used in the elde rly for the unintented effect of causing gait abnormalities or balance degradation. Balance th e benefit of the medi cation with that risk of that effect - 9 -Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The elderly population of Pennsylvania in large and growing. Out of the 12 million people in Pennsylvania, 1.5 million are over the age of 65. Alt hough the percentages of elderly people with disabilities is known, the numbers of people over 65 with pr eventable disabilities is not. The elderly are hospitalized at a rate of three times th at of the population as a whol e. What is not known is the rate at which the elderly are hospitali zed for preventable injuries. Preventabl e injuries cost the elderly and the taxpayer too much money when a smaller investment in prevention could alleviate them. Gait and balance testing for the el derly is not currently compensated a nd, hence, is not performed. A pilot program to prove the value of such interventions should be undertaken. - 10 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Paul M.

New viruses continuously emerge through rapid evolution a nd by facilitated modes of transmission. In addition, previously unknown viruses are being discovered and li nked to human disease thr ough improved methods of detection, sequencing, and genomic analysis. Advances in human health will require improvements in methods for detection, prevention and treatment of chronic viral infections, as well as a more complete understanding of the viral pathogenesis and host-immune response. We propose a new State In itiative to focus on the role of chronic and latent infections in human disease. This initiative would suppor t the identification of novel viruses in cancer and autoimmune diseases in clinical samples and support basic research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of long-term viral persistence, latency, and reactivation, including the role of life-rela ted stress in the viral reactivation process and th e host-immune response. Finally, the initiative would support efforts directed at the eradication of latent infection either through development of small molecule inhibitors or novel vaccine strategies. The overall goal w ill be to reduce the burden of persistent viral infection on human health. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B/C, human papillomavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus lead to a number of cancers that are highly elevated in ageing and immunocompromised populations. Evidence suggests that immune cell function is compromised in viral-associated cancers due to environmental cofactors, genetic predisposition, T-cell exhaustion, or viral-induced immune dysfunction. We propose a study of virus biology, immunological responses to viral infec tion, and tumor-microenvironment inter actions in the context of chronic infection. The hypotheses to be tested include (1) whethe r chronic exposure to vira l antigens induces exhaustion of viral-specific T- cells response, (2) whether virus encoded factors promot e immune tolerance through negative T-cell regulatory pathways including Tregs, HVEM, and PD1, and (3) whether environmental cofactors associated with local infl ammatory response alter imm une regulation of viral infected pre-cancerous cells. We also propose to develop anti viral strategies, including small mol ecule inhibitors of key viral and cellular regulatory pathways, and the development of an ti-viral therapeutic vaccines designed to overcome the negative regulatory arms of the immune response. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Chronic viral infections are known to cause several human cancers and are suspected of causing a variety of immunological disorders. Ne w methods of virus identifi cation, detection, and charac terization have enhanced our ability to connect viruses to spec ific disease states. We hypothesize th at previously uncharacterized virus- associated diseases exist and will be identified using high-throughput sequencing methods. We propose to - 11 -establish a network of clinical and basic researcher s who will use human tissue samples to identify viral markers associated with specific diseases using th e most sophisticated gene sequencing and genomic technologies. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Chronic viral infections are responsib le for a large number of cancers in humans, including cervical and head and neck cancers (HPV); liver cance r (Hepatitis B and C); lymphoma, and Hodgkins lymphoma (Epste in-Barr virus). In addition, chronic viral infections are suspected of causing immunological disorders such as rheumatoid ar thritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. As with many diseases, minorities are disproportionately a ffected by these diseases. Although a vaccine against HPV is now available, there are many women who were exposed to the virus prior to the development of the vaccine; and it will be many decades be fore HPV infection will be largely eliminated in the population. It is essential that we continue to search for therapies to treat HPV. Evidence suggests that normal immune cell function is co mpromised in viral-associat ed cancers due to genetic predisposition (e.g., X-linked lymphoproliferative di seases), environmental cofactors (e.g., chronic inflammation, alcohol, tobacco), T-cell exhaustion (e .g., HIV/AIDS), or viral-i nduced immune e.g., Castleman's disease). Elucidating the molecular mech anisms by which latent viral infections induce cancer and compromise the human immune system will lead to the development of new therapies, including small molecules (drugs) and immune-based therapies (vaccines and antibodies), for the treatment of chronic viral infections. The development of new therapies to eradicate latent viral infection in humans w ill serve the needs of all Pennsylvanians; these infections strike regardless of socio-economic status. - 12 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) David S.

This is a serious problem that strains the Pennsylvania healthcare syst em and burdens the State's economy. Substance abuse is a leading cause of death and serious physical injuries , acute and chronic health problems, criminal behavior and incarceration, and a host of other impairments. Regardless of its pervasiveness and deleterious effects, only a small percentage of substance abusers actually engage in tr eatment. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities to successfully encourage these individuals to enter treatment. One such occasi on is when they enter the criminal justice system. Not only does this offer a \"teachable moment\" during which individuals may actually consider the negative consequences of their drug use, but it provi des diversionary programs su ch as drug courts, through the promise of non-conviction or reduced sentences, with the leverage necessary to engage client s and facilitate compliance. Moreover, research indicates that nearly 60% of adult arrestees are either arrested on a drug-related offense, are intoxicated at the time of the offense, engage in regular use, or have a history of drug or alcohol treatment. As such, drug courts may serve as a perf ect opportunity to address a large proportion of substance abuse throughout the State. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses None Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Since its genesis in 1989, the drug court model has evol ved as among the most effective models for reducing drug use and criminal recidivism, with unmatched empirical support from nu merous evaluations, and experimental and meta-analytic studies. Nevertheless, there are still important issues that need to be addressed to improve drug court's efficacy and utility. Specificall y, these issues include (1) reliably determining who is and who is not likely to benefit from this model, (2) pr oviding standardized training to judges and court staff on empirically-based behavioral techniques, (3) increasing the acceptance and use of th erapeutic medications (e.g., Naltrexone), (4) developing adaptive strategies for adjus ting the intensity of judicial supervision and treatment in response to client progress thr oughout the program, and (5) developi ng a standard process and outcomes database to efficiently manage the above initiatives. We hypothesize that if drug courts were enhanced in this manner, they would lead to substantial decreases in drug use, criminal recidivism a nd other associated negative - 13 -effects. If supported this could se rve as a core set of elements to improve and tailor the drug court model throughout the State. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Between 1990 and 2006, drug violations increased by more than 100% in the Commonwealth, from 6% to 12% of all reported arrests (P CCD Center for Research, Evaluation a nd Statistical Analysis, 2006). Between 1990 and 2000, the number of reported senten ces in the Commonwealth for drivi ng under the influence of alcohol increased by 22% (Ibid 2003). Data from Healthy People 2010 show how alcohol related sentences translate into societal impacts in Pennsylvania: although injury rates for alcohol-related ve hicular accidents improved between 2001 to 2005, death rates in creased (4.31 to 4.68 per 100,000) over the same period (Healthy People 2010). In fact, in 1998, 14% of the Pennsylvania budget, ($3.4 billion), was spent dealing with the consequences of substance abuse and addiction, and 4.7%,($1.14 billion) was spen t on criminal justice expenditures for drug-involved offenders (CASA, 2005). Drug involvment and addiction also have substa ntial negative impacts on women, children, and families. Up to 80% of child abuse and neglec t cases (Child Welf are League, 2001) and nearly 50% of domestic violence cases are substance-abuse related (C atalano, 2006). Moreover, drug and alc ohol abuse contribute to higher rates of domestic violence and sexual violence (NIJ, 2007), and women who are drug addicts are more likely to be victims of abuse. Drug treatment costs, hospitaliz ation for long-term drug-related disease, and treatment resulting from family violence burden our already strapp ed health care system. In 2000, th ere were more than 600,000 hospital emergency department drug episodes in the United Stat es. Health care costs for dr ug abuse alone were about $15 billion. (DEA, 2005). To make matters worse, drug ab use has been shown to be inextricably linked with homelessness (exceeding 50% of the homeless population), chronic mental illness (in Philadelphia, nearly half of the VA's patients with psychiatric disorders also a buse drugs), and new HIV cases (with the CDC estimating that 36% of new HIV cases ar e linked to IV drug use). The negative effects of substance abuse and addict ion are not entirely equal oppor tunity problems, and have been shown to impact certain demographic groups more than others. Although national rates of illicit drug use and abuse do not appear to vary by gender or among raci al sub-populations, serious he alth and social problems related to drug abuse and addiction have been shown to affect minority populat ions at substantially higher rates than whites. African-Americans accounted for 50% of total diagnosed AIDS cases in 2003. African-Americans account for 50% of HIV infected inj ecting drug users and Hispanics account for 23%; yet each of these groups represents an estimated 12% of the U.S. population. Mi nority drug abusers also have disproportionately higher rates of other illnesses associated with injection drug abuse, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis, (NIDA, 2005). The benefits of drug courts as a means for e ffectively reducing drug use and crime is exceptionally well documented and as such can go a long way toward reduci ng the negative impacts disc ussed above. Further, the drug court model has substant ial economic benefits, over the ineffectiv e, disproven alternatives such as incarceration. For example, the cost to incarcerate drug-using offenders is between $20,000 and $50,000 per person per year, and it can cost as much as $80,000 to build a prison cell (NADCP, 2002). C onversely, it costs less than $2,500 per person per year to sentence drug-us ing offenders to a comprehensive drug court program. Improving the effectiveness of drug courts by integr ating and standardizing th erapeutic processes and procedures can have far reaching benefits for the Commonwealth and serv e as a national model. - 14 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) John S. Cacciola DEGREE(S) Ph.D. Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Senior Scientist NAME OF ORGANIZATION The Treatment Research Institute (TRI) MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 600 Public Ledger Building, 150 South Independence Mall West Philadelphia, PA 19106 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 215-399-0980 x183 E-MAIL ADDRESS: jcacciola@tresearch.org Health Research Priority Title and Description Prescription drug-abuse by children and adolescents is on the rise (Monitori ng the Future, 2006) and their abuse of prescription painkillers has ranked second only to mar ijuana since 2002 (U.S. Depart ment of Justice, 2005). This rise in prescription drug abus e comes at a time when prescripti on drugs and pro-drug propaganda are increasingly available on the Internet. The Internet has been cited by various organiza tions as a reliable source of prescription drugs such as narco tics, sedatives, and anabolic ster oids (GAO, 2004; United Nations, 2005). Research conducted by our group and ot hers has identified an alarmi ng number of Internet-based no- prescription pharmacies that offer to sell medications, including controlled narcot ics such as hydrocodone and oxycodone, without a prescription or even a medical cons ultation. In addition, this research has identified numerous websites that promote illicit drug use, provide information on how to cultivate or manufacture illicit substances, and outline ways to presumably use these subs tances safely and/or to a void detection. Given that 87% of children age 12 to 17 use th e Internet (Lenhart, Madden, & Hit lin, 2005), there is a clear need for prevention and intervention programs to protect our youth from these online threats. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses None Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses In response to internet drug threats, TRI developed and p ilot-tested a parent workshop to 1) increase awareness of the availability of illicit drugs and drug propaganda on the internet, 2) provide parents with practical prevention strategies to monitor their children's computer use, and 3) teac h parents how to intervene with their children if problems occur. Findings showed that the wo rkshop increased parents' awareness of internet drug threats and use of the monitoring and prevention stra tegies; parents reported hi gh satisfaction with the workshop. Advances in online learning offer advantag es, and reviews/studies (e .g., Cook et al., 2008) have found these methods to be superior in transferring info rmation and increasing access/ utilization. The aims are: to develop and conduct surveys of adolescents to determin e the extent of internet drug acquisition; to enhance the parent awareness and action workshop to mitigate inte rnet drug threats; and to develop and test an online interactive version of the workshop. We hypothesize that we will document meaningf ul rates of adolescent internet drug acquisition, and that a targeted parent wo rkshop will be widely accessed, particularly online, and can reduce adolescent internet drug searches. - 15 -Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Drug abuse affects all Pennsylvanians especially the young, under-privileged and minorities. While PA has developed several Healthy People 2010 targets for reduc ed mortality and morbidity from drugs, performance indicates that these markers have no t gotten better. Drug abuse affects our young disproportionately more than 50,000 Pennsylvania adolescents and young a dults have died from alcohol or drug related causes since 2002. These rates are again, disproportionately higher among African and Hispanic Pennsylvanians. Young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 dying from drug overdoses has nearly tripled between 1999 and 2005; from 849 to 2,355 as reported by the CDC. Mortal ity is the worst and fina l outcome of alcohol and drug addiction - there are other widespread and costly he alth and social effects as well. High rates of auto accidents and emergency room visits due to alcohol or drug involvement are well known. Drug-related crimes account for over 65% of all incarcera tions in state prisons in Pennsyl vania; and over 50% of all re- incarcerations due to parole viola tions. The UN WHO-commissioned study of chronic illnesses showed that addiction to alcohol was the 2nd and a ddiction to other drugs the 4th most disabling conditions. These ranked as so disabling because of their gr eater prevalence, early origins (i.e ., adolescence and early adulthood), and because untreated addiction reduces productivity and quali ty of life for the addict and those around him/her. These figures suggest that effectiv e prevention strategies are crucial. Also, given the recalcitrant nature of addiction once established, primar y prevention strategies have the potential for the greatest impact. - 16 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Jack Kemp DEGREE(S) MS Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Senior Policy Associate NAME OF ORGANIZATION Treatment Research Institute MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 600 Public Ledger Building 150 South Independence Mall West Philadelphia, PA 19103 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) (215) 399-0980 E-MAIL ADDRESS: jkemp@tresearch.org Health Research Priority Title and Description How Do Financing Arrangements Affect Adoptio n of EBP's in Addiction Treatment Settings The medical, economic, and social impacts of untreated or poorly treated substan ce abuse are well-known and daunting at the state, community, and family levels. Although there are gaps in knowledge, research suggests that government practices (insurance, purchasing, regulatory, ie) may be inhi biting (or not foster ing) widespread adoption of empirically proven approach es - in general health care settin gs, for example. Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a fe derally-sponsored program ba sed on research indicating that identification of substance use in healthcare settings, early interven tion and referral to treatment can improve outcomes for individuals with unhealthy use of alcohol and drugs, and for patients who need further treatment, yet more research is n eeded to understand and overcome organi zational and financial barriers that impede its implementation. Ample research suggests that medication assisted treatme nt can improve recovery and lower recidivism rates among some types of pa tients (alcohol and opiod dependent, ie) yet use of pharmaceuticals in primary medical care is not widesprea d, possibly due to organizati onal, financing and other government barriers. Finally, findings from a study of a performance based contracti ng experiment suggest that paying financial incentives to substa nce abuse treatment providers may le ad to improved quality of care (McLellan et al, 2008). Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses None Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Do financial incentives built into contracts with treatment providers achieve the results desired by the purchaser at the client and the organizational level; do these incentives foster use of evidence-based clinical and/or administrative practices; how do different models of pur chasing (i.e. bundling of serv ices at a single rate, performance-based contracts, case rates) affect costs of treatment episodes? What variables in medical settings associated with SBIRT correlate with entry into treatment; how does implementation of SBIRT differ by setting, e.g. primary car e clinic, nurse managed se ttings, etc, and are there differential impacts on access, enga gement or other variables? - 17 -How are patients assessed for potential medication-assist ed treatments; what models are used to link primary care with specialty treatment providers; are models diffe rent for office-based medicat ion-assisted treatment of opioid dependence (buprenorphine) and alcohol dependence (oral and depot naltrexone)? Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Drug abuse and addiction are major public health challe nges with ripple effects th at are serious, sometimes devastating and most certainly expensive - nationally and in Pennsylvania. In 2002, an estimated 22 million Americans aged 12 and older were cla ssified as having a substance use diso rder (9.4 percent of the population) yet only 3.5 million (1.5 percent of the population) received some kind of care for a problem related to the use of alcohol or illicit drugs (OAS, 2003). In 2001 estimates of the nationa l costs of substance abuse were approximately $484 million annually - in health care expend itures, lost earnings, costs for crime and accidents (CASA, 2001). In Pennsylvania, tr acking data from Healthy People 2010 pa int only a small snapshot of the pervasive and cross-cutting consequen ces of alcohol and drug abuse. A lthough rates of cirrhosis deaths and injuries from alcohol-related auto ac cidents have improved, the State is st ill far from attaining the 2010 goals on these objectives. There has been statistically insignifican t change in the pe rcentage of adults engaged in binge drinking the past month, and the State' s rates for drug-induced death and al cohol-related auto fatalities have actually increased. (H ealthy People 2010). Drug abuse and addiction create heal th disparities among vulnerable populat ions. Nationally, while rates of illicit drug use and abuse do not vary by gender or am ong racial sub-populations, se rious health and social problems related to drug abuse and a ddiction affect minority populations at far higher rates than whites. African-Americans accounted for 50 percent of total dia gnosed AIDS cases in 2003, yet this group represents an estimated 12 percent of the U.S. population. Minority drug a busers also have disproportionately higher rates of other illnesses associated with in jection drug abuse, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. (NIDA, 2005) The burden of financing substance abuse treatment has sh ifted to the public sector. Recent estimates suggest that payment for roughly 77% of substance abuse trea tment is made by public sources (Mark et al., 2007); estimates suggest that by 2014 payment by public sources will rise to 83% (Levit et al., 2008). While there are serious fiscal consequences of this shift, it also s uggests governments have enormous potential to use their purchasing power and other administrativ e authorities to foster improvement s in the quality of the treatment they fund. In Pennsylvania, of the facilities responding to SAMHSA's most recent N-SSATS survey (over a 96% response rate), the large majori ty of public sector funding came from the State: more than 79% reported receiving Medicaid funding and more than 30% other fo rms of State funding (SAMHSA, 2006). Like in most states, in the Commonwea lth, grant- and contract-based financing arrangements that ra rely change from year to year have tended to inhibit change. However, introduci ng performance incentives into an environment in which there are significant budget constraints (as there are in many States) may be possible with more study of the confounding policy, political, economic , organizational, and regulator y issues in the State. There is evidence of a nascent movement toward SBIR T among Pennsylvania jurisd ictions. Several Counties have experimented with SBIRT and the Philadelphia region continues to work on creating a system to support coordinated care between primary care and specialty substance abuse treatm ent. Similarly, pharmacotherapies have taken hold in Pennsylvania but more research is needed to nourish their use as part of comprehensive treatment strategy. Sixty-two of the N-SSATS re spondents offer Naltrexone; and 39 (both Buprenorphine derivativ es); and there are 63 Methadone clinics operating as of 2006 in Pennsylvania.

While sick le cell disease is caused by a genetic abnormality in hemoglobin that results in hemoglobin polymerization and red blood cell \"s ickling,\" the major cause of death is a progressive vasculopathy (damage to blood vessels). This vasculopathy can lead to an elevation of the pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs in a full 1/3 of adults with sickle cell disease. These patients are at 10 times greater risk of death than the general populati on of SCD patients (Gladwin; New England Journal of Medicine 2005). In fact, 40% of th ese patients will die within 40 mont hs if not identified and treated. Advances in our understanding of vascul ar biology have revealed that imba lances in vasodilator molecules and vasoconstrictor molecules in the endo thelium (the cells lining the blood vess el) lead to abnormal constriction of the blood vessel, abnormal growth of the endothelium and smooth muscle , and blood vessel inflammation and thrombosis (clot development). The development of new treatments that target this at-risk and underserved population requires advances in our understanding of fundamental vascul ar biology using novel transgenic animal models and translational resear ch tools, coupled with comprehensiv e outreach and screening protocols to identify the at-risk pediatric and adul t sickle cell populati on of Pennsylvania. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses A central molecule that regulates no rmal vascular health is nitric oxi de (NO), which is normally produced by the endothelium and regulates basal reduces supe roxide levels by radical- radical scavenging. A central biomedi cal research question is how this important NO signaling pathway is impaired in SCD? Two vascular injury paradigms ar e hypothesized to contribute to the low NO levels and vascular injury: 1) During SCD related hemolysis, hem oglobin is released from the red blood cell into plasma, where it generates reactive oxygen speci es and directly reacts with a nd NO. 2) Microvascular entrapment of sickle erythrocytes and leukocytes acute ly obstructs blood flow, producing cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, activating vascular oxidases and leading to inflammatory stress, increased expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules a nd inflammatory cytokines, and leu kocytosis. Studies using transgenic mouse models of sickle cell disease and human blood flow studies will provide insights into the mechanisms of disease and facilitate the identificat ion of novel molecular therapeutics. - 19 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses The development of vascular disease, and specifically high blood pressure in the lungs in patients with SCD, is associated with heart failure, reduced exercise tolera nce, and increased risk of sudden death. Well-designed population screening and therapeutics re search projects can increase the di agnosis, access to care, and therapies available for this complication. Aim 1. Develop a commun ity-based screening program that will identify sickle cell patients at high risk of devel oping pulmonary hypertension. For exampl e, plasma samples can be screened using a novel biomarker called N-termin al brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BN P), which is released by the heart during pressure overload. Patients with NT-BNP levels greater than the 75 th percentile can be screened for renal dysfunction and undergo cardia c ultrasound testing. Patients identif ied with pulmonary hypertension can then be referred to clinical research centers for right heart ca theterization for definitiv e diagnosis. These studies will define a novel population based-screening and risk assessment paradigm. Aim 2. Population-based studies and trials can be used to evalua te novel vasodilator ag ents (NO, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, eNOS recoupling agents). Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses We hypothesize that community-based screening and central referral to SCD treatment centers that use individualized pain management plans; dedicated areas within the hospital fo r the care of sickle cell related vasocclusive pain crisis; and collaborative hematologi cal, pulmonary and cardiol ogy services will improve patient quality of life, outcomes, and health care utiliza tion. Endpoints to follow include patient pain scores and symptom diaries, a decrease in patients requiring hos pitalization for pain manage ment, a decreased average length of stay, a decrease in the ra te of readmission, and ultimate increase s in life expectancy. We hypothesize that the provision of high quality multidisciplinary pr ograms designed to facilitate transition of pediatric patients to adult health care will improve access to co mprehensive care and decrease utilization of emergency room services, reduce rates of hospi talization, and ultimately improve surv ival. We hypothesize that a statewide web-based secure sickle cell registry, linked to card iopulmonary screening programs, will provide critical population data that can be used to benchmark state-wi de health quality improvements, target populations and regions at risk, and improve region al health education. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Delivery of health care services to pa tients with SCD is frequently fragmented and of poor quality. Examples of this systematic problem: 1) Many SCD patients receiv e episodic care in the emergency room as opposed to comprehensive care in the clinic outpatient setting. An emergency room treatment model limits access to trained experts in SCD and has been shown to limit access to proven therapies, such as hydroxyurea. This model adversely impacts the quality of care, quality of life, health care costs, and, ultimately, patient survival. 2) Approximately 10% of children with SCD account for ove r 50% of total health car e expenditures for the SCD populations. 3) About a third of adul t patients without access to comprehe nsive care programs constitute more than 70% of visits to the emergency rooms and 40% of hospitalizations. 4) Appr oximately 50% of patients admitted for acute painful episodes are readmitted within one month after discharge, and 16% within one week after discharge. These rebound admissions occur seconda ry to premature discharg e, drug withdrawal, and recurrence of pain crises, and represent a major opport unity to reduce health care utilization and patient suffering. 5) Inadequate pain management results in a prolonged course of pa in crises and prolonged duration of hospitalization. 6) Poor management of va soclusive pain crises is a major cause of patient distrust of the health care system and may adversely impact access to compre hensive or emergency care services, thus further increasing morbidity as well as utili zation of health care resources. Despite considerable advances in the treatment of SCD, most patients have poorly controlled pain and require recurrent hospitalization. The mean age of death of SCD patients is 38 years. - 20 -There exists a statewide and national failure to tr ansition care of the agin g pediatric population to comprehensive adult care programs. This transition gap pushes large populations to the emergency room setting and dramatically reduces ac cess to drugs, such as hydroxyurea, that are necessary to reduce end-organ injury. As a result, adult patients begin to develop end-organ complications such as pulmonary hypertension and kidney failure. End-organ complica tions that develop in the absence of comprehensive therapy include: 1) Stroke: 10% of children develop stro ke and 22% have silent strokes on MRI, which are associated with neurocognitive sequelae and increased ri sk of overt clinical stroke. This complication is preventable with transfusion and hydroxyurea therapy. 2) Pulmonary hypertension is a dead ly complication that affects over 30% of adolescents and adults, and 40% of all patients by the age of 40. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with a 10-fold increase in risk of premature mortality and accounts for over 35% of all deaths in patients with SCD. Transfusion therapy and hydr oxyurea can prevent this complication, and more than seven FDA approved medications to treat this complication are now available. 3) Kidney and liver failure: With increased age there is an accumulation of sickle cell-related organ damage, w ith more than 50% of patients developing irreversible organ damage by the time they enter the fifth decade of lif e. 4) The first decade afte r transition to adult care represents a very high risk peri od for patients with SCD: approxima tely 6-20% of young adults die of complications related to SCD between age 20 and 30 years. The proposed initiatives to understand the biological underp innings of vasculopathy in sickle cell disease linked to community screening and referral for novel treatment studies will have a great im pact on these devastating complications of the most common genetic disease affecting African Americans. - 21 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Larry W.

Over 40% of these indi viduals report arthritis-attributable activity limitation and over 30% report arthritis-attributab le work limitation. These numbers are only expected to increase with the aging of the US population. In addition, arthritis is the single greatest caus e of chronic pain and disability. Although there are over 100 types of arth ritis, the most common ones, oste oarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), mainly account for the increased morbidity and health care costs. OA is the most prevalent form of arthritis and is among the most prevalent chronic conditions in the US. OA of the hip and knee is the most common cause of difficulty in walking or climbing stairs. Th e challenge in osteoarthritis is to identify patients earlier in the disease course to fac ilitate prevention and treatment of the disease. RA is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis and affects 1% of the adu lt population. The cause of RA is unknown, but most likely there are various subsets of rheuma toid arthritis defined by abnormalities in the immune response. A major challenge in RA is to determine which subsets of pa tients with RA will benefit the most from the newer, specific targeted, expensive biologic therapies. There ar e now 8 biological therapies on the market. Research is urgently needed that addresses the co mparative and cost effectiveness of these expensive agents compared to costs of traditional less expensive drugs. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Although targeted expensive biologic therapy has revolutio nized the treatment of rh eumatoid arthritis (RA), only 50% of patients have a reasonable response. Urgent research is needed to determine the specific immune/ inflammatory abnormalities that characterize the RA phenotype/genot ype and treatment response. We hypothesize that specific biomarkers (i.e., DNA, RNA, serum and imag ing biomarkers) will differ among subsets of patients with RA and will determine individual responses to different therapies. To address this question and fulfill the promise of \"personalized medici ne,\" prospective, longit udinal cohort studies with extensive biospecimen assessment, combined with detailed clinical information, will be necessary. Advances in imaging have allowed the detailed morphologic characte rization of the abnormalities present in osteoarthritis (OA) before the end-stage manifestations seen on x-ray. To better understand the pathophysiology of OA, studies are needed to examine change s in cartilage and meniscus composition as well as morphologic changes. We hypothesize that newer imaging techniques will iden tify changes in collagen/proteoglycans that precede loss of cartilage and meniscal degeneration in OA. - 22 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Only a limited number of patients with RA have benefited from newer therapies. Will aggressive treatment of patients early in the disease course or those with more established disease lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced disease activity? Will newer imaging techniques lead to better assessment of disease activity? We hypothesize that frequent monitoring of disease activity with tailored comb ination anti-rheumatic and biologic drugs will lead to decreased pain, im proved function, better health-related qua lity of life and more clinical remissions. Emerging data suggests that smoking may be a risk factor for developing at least one disease subset of RA. Will smoking cessation decrease the risk of RA or improve outcomes in RA in this disease subset? Are there specifc biomarkers that ch aracterize this disease subset? Because the cause of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) is unknown, studies are needed to better characterize OA- related pain and identify potential causes of pain in OA . We hypothesize that ne wer assessments of pain frequency, intensity, pattern and locati on in combination with state-of-the-art imaging techniques will help to identify the etiology of pain in OA. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Prior joint injury is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis and there is an epidemic of joint injuries among female athletes. Can individuals at high risk of injury be id entified and will a targeted injury prevention program directed at these individuals be effe ctive in preventing injury? We hypothesize that specific risk factors for joint injury in female athletes can be recognized and that a targeted injury prevention program will help to prevent joint injuries and their physic al and psychological sequelae. Racial disparities in total joint re placement (TJR) utilization have been demonstrated and prior research indicates that African-American patien ts' preferences related to TJR may underlie this disparity. Reduction or elimination of racial disparities has been designated as high priority by the National In stitutes of Health (NIH). Investigations are needed to test in terventions designed to redu ce or eliminate disparitie s in TJR utilization. biobehavioral willi ngness consider TJR and patients' outcome expectations related to TJR will help increase African-American patients' willingness to consider TJR and ultimately, reduce racial di sparities in TJR utilization. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Given the aging of the US population, the Centers fo r Disease Control (CDC) estimate that the number of Americans with arthritis is expect ed to increase from over 46 million in 2006 to over 67 million in 2030. Data from the 2005 Pennsylvania Behavioral Health Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) show that 32% of Pennsylvania adults (nearly three million) have been diagnosed with arthritis and that almost 60% of Pennsylvanians over age 65 have arthritis. According to th e CDC, only two other states in the US have a higher percentage of the population affected by ar thritis. The economic impact of arthri tis in the US is significant, with a total cost of over $65 billion that includes an esti mated medical bill of $15 billion per year, 35 million physician visits and more than 744,000 hospitalizations. Co st increases are projected to increase by 54% to $100 billion by 2020. Specifically, arthritis accounts for over 4100 hospitalizatio ns in Pennsylvania, with the median charges exceeding $13,000 per hospitalization. Among Pennsylvanians of working age (18 to 64), twice as many of those with arthritis, 28% vs. 14%, reported they were not work ing. Pennsylvania vi tal statistics for 2000 indicated that diseases of the musculoskeletal syst em and connective tissue disease were responsible for 5.1 deaths per 100,000 population. Thus arth ritis is major public health problem in the US, and particularly in Pennsylvania. The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthrit is (OA), a degenerative diseas e of cartilage and bone which causes changes in underlying bone and s upporting tissue. OA most frequently occurs in weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips. and knee and hip OA can result in significant loss of function with pain and suffering and work disability. Total joint replacement of the knee or hip is an e ffective therapy for end-stage osteoarthritis, relieving pain, reversing joint deformity and improving quality of life. Between 2000 to 2002, over 80,000 knee and hip - 23 -replacements were performed for oste oarthritis in Pennsylvania hospitals. Indeed, the rate of total joint replacements for osteoarthritis incr eased by 15% over this th ree-year period. With the aging of the population and the growing obesity epidemic, the rate of total joint replacement is expected to in crease dramatically in the coming years. Unfortunately, despite the well -documented efficacy of total joint re placement, not all segments of the population have benefited from these procedures. Numer ous reports have documented racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of tota l knee or hip replacement. African-America ns are much less likely than whites to undergo total joint replacement and recent investigations s uggest that this disparity is increasing. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that African-Americans may be at ri sk of worse outcomes after total joint replacement as compared to whites. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is th e most common type of inflammatory ar thritis and affects 1% of the adult population. It is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic pain, swelli ng and stiffness in multiple joints, most commonly the small joints of the hands and feet. Th ere is inflammation of th e joint lining that casues destruction of bone, cartilag e and surrounding soft tissues. RA is associ ated with major activity limitations, and work disability, and may shorten the lifespan by 10 year s. RA is accompanied by systemic inflammation and immune suppression. The major cause of death is premat ure atherosclerosis. Patients with RA are also at increased risk of developing serious inf ections and certain types of cancer. In summary, the impact of arthritis on the health of Pennsylvanians is enor mous. Not only is it highly prevalent, arthritis is also the leading cause of disability and is associated with major economic costs. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis is accomp anied by premature mortality. Furthermor e, there are racial disparities in the utilization of total joint replacement for OA. - 24 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Leann L.

The fe tal and infant periods play critical roles in the development of obesity, but there has been little focus on preventing obesity dur ing these periods. The need for early intervention is obvious: 24.4% of US children aged 2- 5 years are already overweight, wh ile the prevalence of obesity among infants 6 to 23 months has increased 60% in the last 3 decades. Early interv ention is critical because overweight infants and toddlers have elevated risk for obesity, di abetes, and cardiovascular di sease later in life when attempts to prevent and treat obesity have had limited success. In contrast , the prenatal period and infancy are opportune times to begin obesity prevention; they are pe riods of rapid growth, deve lopmental plasticity, and learning, which can have both immediat e and long-lasting metabolic and beha vioral consequences. Recognizing that early obesity increases risk for obesity and the metabolic syndrome later in life, the Institu te of Medicine's expert committee wrote \"the prenat al period, infancy, and early childhoo d may be stages of particular vulnerability to obesity development because they are unique periods for cellular differentiation and development. This unique vulnerability might make it possible for actions take n at these stages to determine the future course of adiposity.\" Fortunately, basic research findings suggest numerous pe rinatal interventions with great potential for providing lifelong benefit. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1) Can childhood obesity be prevented or moderated by delivering interventions to pregnant women? We hypothesize that maternal characteristi cs that are associated with obesity in offspring are modifiable and can be moderated through intervention. Such characteristics include maternal obesity, diabetes, pregnancy weight gain, and diet during pregnancy. Each of these ca n be positively influenced through evidence-based interventions that include educat ion, healthy diet , and exercise. 2) Can childhood obesity be prevented through interventions delivered during infancy? We hypothesize that various asp ects of an infant's life are ripe for inte rventions that can prevent obesity in the long term. Such areas include prom oting breastfeeding, promoting health y sleep habits, promoting other - 25 -methods to soothe infants instead of feeding, establis hing healthy food preferences early in life, and improving parental understanding of healthy growth patterns when their children are infants. Each of these can be improved by evidence-based interventions shown to impr ove parent-infant interact ions surrounding feeding and weight gain early in life. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Acknowledging the high prevalence of overweight and obe sity in the United States, Healthy People 2010 sought to improve the proportion of Amer icans that have healthy weights. A target of 60% of Americans living at healthy weights was established, but unfortunately, as of 2006 only 37% of adults in Pennsylvania were not overweight or obese. Stated another way, 63% of Pennsylvanians are livi ng at an unhealthy weight. This problem disproportionately affects minorities as 69% of Black adults and 73% of Hispanic adults in Pennsylvania are overweight or obese. Because maternal health and weight st atus during pregnancy are key factors in determining the health and future weight status of their offspring, it is particularly concerning th at nearly half (46%) of women between the ages of 20 and 39 are overweight. This fact puts the next generation of Pennsylvani ans at risk for even worse health than our current generation where obes ity has reached epidemic proportions. Given the prevalence of overweight a nd obesity among adults, it is not surpri sing, but still quite concerning that 32% of children aged 2-19 are overwei ght or obese in the U.S. Minorities are again disproportionately affected with 35% of Black and 38% of Mexican American children characterized as overweight or obese. These data are particularly troubling given the known associations of obes ity with conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes as well as poor emoti onal health. As a result, the Institute of Medicine has estimated that nearly 10% of all medical costs in the U. S. currently can be attributed to overweight and obesity. Further, between the late 1970s and the late 1990s, the costs rela ted to obesity related hos pital care for children tripled. Since few strategies have proven eff ective in treating obese children, thes e troubling figures point toward an alternate solution - prevention. Prev ention through early intervention to reduce weight gain and childhood obesity can make an essential cont ribution to addressing the health car e problems arising from obesity by stemming the rising prevalence of childhood obesity, wh ich tracks from infancy to childhood to adulthood. Further, since there is evidence that becoming obese as a child leads to more se rious complications during adutlhood, probably due to longer exposure to obesity's a dverse metabolic effects, the cumulative effect of obesity plus its comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, hyperc holesterolemia, and sede ntary life style will likely overwhelm the healthcare system in Pennsylvania a nd the United States in the n ear future. In fact, it is estimated now that one out of every three children born in the U.S. will have diabetes during their lifetime. Therefore, before another generation exceeds its predecessor and escalates the obesity epidemic, evidence-based prevention efforts must be devel oped, tested, and implemented. - 26 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Martin W.

It affects not only the individual, but that person's family, their community, and out state. Nico tine abuse is clearly casual ly linked to lung and other cancers as well as to compromised neonatal health. Alcohol abuse is linked to loss of judgment that has a major impact on society via increased violence and automob ile accidents. Misuse of opioids, both heroin and prescription pain killers, can lead to addiction that has devastating conseque nces for life style, and frequently leads to criminal behavior. Similarly, use of cocaine, methamphetamines, and marijuana, as well as other abused substances, can lead to addiction and drug-seeking behaviors that comp romise the capacity of the user to function at maximal capacity. We know very little a bout the biological basis fo r why people use drugs, the addictive state, and how to interrupt the cycle of drug cr aving. Current theory suggest s that all of these drugs function by stimulating basic reward pa thways in the brain. Further, addic tion is thought to permanently alter brain chemistry, but the actua l process is incompletely understood. Basic research is needed to illuminate the biological processes that lead to and su stain abuse in order to design interven tions that will cure or prevent this affliction. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Question I: What are the neur al circuits, cells, and me diators in the brain involve d in drug and alcohol abuse and how can they be disrupted to break the cycle of addiction? Hypothesis: That a new class of sma ll proteins, called chemokines, first di scovered in the immune system, and now shown to be present and to have a functional role in the brain, are important in inhibiting drug craving, reducing development of drug dependence, and reducing sy mptoms of withdrawal. It is proposed that altering brain chemokine levels can modulate pathways that lead to addiction. Question II: How do multiple drugs interact in regard to drug cr aving and dependency? Hypothesis: That neuronal ci rcuits, cells and mediators are differentially altered in subjects addicted to a single drug (e.g., alcohol, opioids or cocaine) as compared to thos e addicted to or abusing multiple drugs in addition to their drug of primary dependence. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Questions: What are the neural circu its and brain regions activated durin g critical phases of drug abuse and addiction, including active drug use, drug craving and drug withdrawal? Ca n potential therapeutics for the management of addictive disorders be identified by thei r ability to alter these patt erns of brain activation? - 27 -Hypotheses: 1. That specific brain regions and ne ural pathways are differentially activat ed during the critical phases of drug addiction and that these can be identi fied using fMRI in human drug abuser s compared with appropriate control subjects 2. That therapeutics used to 1) reduce craving for drugs of abuse or 2) reduce drug withdrawal symptoms associated with discontinuation of drug use will normali ze brain activity found to be disregulated during drug addiction critical phases. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Questions: -- What are the barriers that prev ent individuals from obtaining treatmen t for substance abuse disorders? -- How can access to appropriate health care for addictive disease be improved? -- What strategies should be employed at the elemen tary and high school levels to reduce or prevent drug abuse? --How can treatment of medi cal professionals with addi ctive disease be improved? Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy estimated that the national cost of drug abuse n 2002 was $180.9 billion. In ranking annual causes of death in the US in 2000, tob acco was #1, alcohol was #3, a nd all illicit drug use was #12. In 2006 in Pennsylvania, the drug-indu ced death rate was 13,000/100,000 population. In 2004-2005, in Pennsylvania, 36.4% of residents 12 or ol der reported using an illici t drug in their lifetimes, 10.6% reported use in the past ye ar, and 7.9% reported use in the past month (823,000 residents). The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse estimates that Penns ylvania spent over $3.5 billion in 1998 on substance abuse and programs, which was 14.5% of the state budget. Hospital admissions for all drug abuse in Pennsylvani a in 2000 were close to 66,000. The Treatment Episode Data Set for 2005, which tracks admission to State-licensed or certified facilities for s ubstance abuse treatment, shows that in Pennsylvania there were 15,830 total admi ssions, of which 5% were 14.4% for marijuana, and 0.7% fo r methamphetamine and other stimulants. In 1999, statistics for arrests for drug abuse violations in the state totaled 46,632. Of those arrested and tested for drugs in one major city in the state, >70% tested positive. State money was spent for criminal justice, education, health, child-f amily assistance, mental health-development di sabilities, public safety, and state work force programs, because substance abuse has myriad c onsequences impacting every aspect of our state. Among the detrimental outcomes of subs tance abuse are infecti ons such as HIV, hepatitis, and pneumonia; violence, motor-vehicle injury, suicid e, homicide, and mental illness. Clearly substance abuse is an all-pervasive problem fo r out state. Yet, of the $3 billion states spent on prevention, treatment, and research nationally in 1998, only 0.1% was on research. The vast majority, - 28 -approximately $2.5 billion, was spent on treatment. Given the magnitude of the substance abuse problem, and its global impact on society, the lack of spending on research into how drugs hijack the brain is difficult to justify. With other biomedical problems, like heart disease and cancer, funds di rected to unraveling the biological basis for the disease have led to enormous stri des in treatment and preventi on. It is anticipated that research into the biology of substance abuse will iden tify novel targets leading to new pharmaceuticals to treat the user and the addict, and possibly to prevent addiction. Investment in s ubstance abuse research is important for the State of Pennsylvania. It wi ll allow partnerships with biotech and pharmaceutical industries, which are prominent in the state. It will hold out the promise of new and better treatments for citizens whose lives are driven by cravings for drugs, which they cannot control. - 29 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Gerald F.

Despite its overwhelming public health impact, pain is an \"orphan disease\" in terms of federal funding, accounting for over 20% of visits to physicians and 10% of prescriptions but less than 0.5% of federal funds. The meager funding is even more anomalous in light of evidence that the sp ecialized anatomy and chemistry of brain structures involved in pain make it amenable to dissection and study. Scientists have made ra pid progress in identifying pain mechanisms in animals, and with clinical scie ntists, have developed new treatments that are highly effective in limited niches, such as migraine and ma jor surgery. Pennsylvania he alth science institutions comprise a large share of the leading pain researchers in the US. Selection of pain research as a CURE topic could assure that the state' s health science schools and companies will be dominant in the expansion of pain research and products as the population ages and health care costs make treat ment of symptoms more important than more expensive palliative treatments. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Our overarching hypothesis is that pain is so fundamen tal a process in adaptati on, physiological regulation, development, and motor function that an integrated study of pain on the molecular, physiological, and clinical levels can significantly improve our ab ility to treat most diseases; favorably influence the development of children and adolescents with pain ; and improve the adaptation, cogniti on, mood and disability of any individual with pain once these insights are disseminated into pract ice. Pain is an opportune target for therapeutic attack because the first few cells signaling pain from the periphery are highly specialized for pain and grouped with other pain cells in ne rve ganglia and spinal cord. Further, most types of pain share many of the same molecular mediators. We hypothesize that re searchers can discover new th erapeutic target molecules whose manipulation will have fewer side effects than current pain treat ments (opioids, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants, proteomic studies in these specialized pain-mediating neural cells with ge nome-wide genetic associati on studies in animals and humans. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses We have accumulated evidence that chronic nonmalignant pain in cognitively intact older adults impairs brain function (i.e., neuropsychologica l performance) and that this impaired function may be a key link between pain and physical disability. As an exte nsion of these findings, we hypothesize that chronic pain may accelerate the - 30 -rate of decline in cognitive function among cognitively in tact older adults as well as those with Alzheimer's disease. We predict that intens ive pain treatment with safe m odalities (e.g., acupuncture, meditation, acetaminophen) may ameliorate physical and cognitive decline. Methodological research can multiply the yield of pain c linical trials. We predict that standard methods of clinical epidemiology--an eclectic exam ination of contributors to variance in the outcome--can be applied to pain clinical trials in a way to at least halve the vari ance, or make their yield of information equivalent to a doubling of sample size. Plausible va riables not yet thoroughly applied to pain trials include patient genotype, style of using pain scales, pain catastrophizing, use of \"res cue\" analgesic, and gender. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses We hypothesize that undertreatment of pain in African-Americans, well-documented in ambulatory, inpatient and long-term care setttings, is caused by (1) clinicians' bi ases that these patients are at higher risk of addiction and (2) patients' overestimate of the risk of opioid addi ction (even when used appr opriately). Comprehensive interventions that address both of these factors will reduce the undertr eatment of pain.We predict that documented high-yield interventions to reduce the costs and disabi lity in pain patients can be translated to health systems in Pennsylvania, incl uding: (a) a back-to-work cognitive-b ehavioral intervention in individuals with back pain that reduced disab ility costs across Nova Scotia; (b) a post- operative anesthesiological intervention in older patients with se vere pain after limb trauma that reduced disability, pain levels, and analgesic use 6 months later in a New York City hos pital system. We hypothesize that the dissemination of individualized management plans for Pennsylvania's 4,000 sickle cell patients will lead to decreased hospitalization for uncomplicated pain crises, decreased length of hospita l stay, and improved school attendance and psychosocial development. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Pain is the reason for more than 20% of visits to physicians and pain drugs make up about 10% of prescriptions, so we can estimate that the medical costs of treating pain are 10-20% of health care co sts, or $200-400 billion/year in the US. In addition, lost/reduced productivity at work a nd disability payments cost the US another $100 billion/year. Prorated to the size of the Pennsylvania population, 4% of the US total, the cost estimate of pain in Pennsylvania is $12 - 20 billion/year. Pain is the most common symptom of serious physical illness. In the SUPPORT study of 10,000 hospitalized patients with critical illnesses including cancer, heart, liver, lung, or multiorgan system failure, over 50% of patients reported pain and almost 20% re ported persistent and severe pain. Pain has an especially severe impact in the two million Penns ylvania residents who are age 65 or older. Half experience daily pain, most commonly from osteoarthritis and low back pain. Unfortunately, many older adults are unable to benefit from the most common pain drugs b ecause of drug toxicity in this group. When pain is chronic, many older adults develop depression and anxi ety, loss of cognitive and physical function, social isolation, loss of appetite and impaired sleep. These de bilitating complications may l ead to loss of ability for self-care, with enormous financial co sts. Despite these costs, there has been rather little study of painful disorders in older patients. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that older adu lts with chronic pain are not simply a chronologically older version of yo ung chronic pain patients. For exam ple, \"chronic widespread pain\" or \"fibromyalgia\" in younger patients appears to be a di sorder in which the central nervous system amplifies painful inputs, and is associated with greatly elevated prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders. \"Chronic widespread pain\" is also common in ol der adults. Geriatic pain experts su ggest that it is less influenced by emotional disorders, and may be caused by a greater burde n of degenerative changes, but rigorous studies are needed to guide treatment - 31 -Pain also causes a disproportiona te burden on ethnic minorities. Mu ltiple studies show consistent undertreatment of African Americans and other minorities for cancer pain, acute postoperative pain, chest pain, acute pain in the emergency department, and low back pain. Elderly cancer patien ts in nursing homes were found to be particularly at risk. African American patients in nursing homes had a 63% greater probability of no pain treatment than non-Hispanic white patients. African Americans were less likely to have pain documented in their charts. African American children a nd adolescents are frequently undertreated for the pain of sickle cell disease, which aff ects 50,000 individuals in the US and 4,000 in Pennsylvania. There are no large clinical trials on the optimal manageme nt of painful vasoocclus ive crisis, the hallmark of the disease. Poor management of this pain causes poor school attendance, loss of work, and abnormal psychosocial development. The distrust caused by poor pain management leads some patients to avoid followup care to prevent end organ damage, which may cause premature mortality. - 32 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Lawrence Sinoway DEGREE(S) MD Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Professor of Medicine, Director, Penn State Heart & Vascular Institute NAME OF ORGANIZATION Penn State College of Medicine at the Milton S.

We believe an important and as yet u nderstudied area of investigation is the effect atherosclerosis has on the ability of the autonomic nervous system to regulate hear t rate, blood pressure and orga n blood flow. It is clear that altered autonomic regulation ca n raise heart rate, blood pressure and reduce organ blood flow. These effects can worsen the impact of disease. We believe a better understanding of the imp act of the atherosclerosis on autonomic control will lead to new therapies and approaches to disease. In turn, this knowledge will have a major impact on the health of Pennsylvania residents. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. What are the effects of atherosclerosis on the autonomic responses to physical activity? 2. What are the effects of smoking on the autonomic responses to physical activity? 3. What are the effects of hypertension on th e autonomic responses to physical activity? 4. What are the effects of diabetes mellitus on the autonomic responses to physical activity? 5. What are the effects of obesity on the autonomic responses to physical activity? Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1. Will treatments for atherosclerosis such as stenting procedures, medication, and exercise therapy reverse the alterations in autonomic responses seen with physical activity? 2. Will smoking cessation reverse the alterations in autonomic responses to physical activity? 3. If treatment is successful in controlling hypertension, will it revers e the alterations in hemodynamic responses to physical activity? 4. If diabetes mellitus is controlled, will it reverse the alterations in autonomic res ponses to physical activity? 5.

Will significant weight loss reve rse the alterations in the autonomic responses to physical activity? Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None - 33 -Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Atherosclerosis and its modifiable risk factors have a profound impact both di rectly and indirectly on the health of Pennsylvanians. From 2002-2006, close to 4% of deat hs in Pennsylvania were attributed directly to atherosclerosis, diabetes, and hypertensi on. This excludes deaths directly at tributed to diseases of the heart (~28%), that is exacerbated by all three stressors. In a ddition, smoking is implicated in those disease states as well, and the estimated percentage of smoking-related deaths in Pennsylvania in 2002-2003 was 16%. These are sobering statistics, especially wh en treaments and interventions are av ailable to treat these conditions. In addition to mortality, health care co sts for treatment related to atherosc lerosis, diabetes, hypertension obesity, and smoking are staggering. In 2007, 7.8% of adults in Pennsylvania had been dia gnosed with diabetes and 29% of adults had been told they ha d high blood pressure. Both of these risk factors can be reduced by proper diet and exercise, however, only about a a fourth of the adults consumed the recommended daily servings of fruit and vegetables and only about half engaged in moderate to vigorous physic al activity. As a result, only about a third of the population maintains a healthy wei ght. Despite the extensive education programs on the effects of smoking, approximately 23% of a dults in Pennsylvania continue to smoke. It is likely that a high percentage of Pennsylvanians will continue to be at risk for atherersclerosis, diabetes, obesity and hypertension in the future, and their ability to perform physical activity will be affected by these diseases. Therefore, we feel it is important to not only study these diseas es from a treatment standpoint, but also from the standpoint of the changes in nor mal reflex responses that lead to disease. We need to plan for an ever increasing el derly population as more live into their 8 th and 9th decade of life. Focusing on modifiable risks factors of atherosclerosis may improve the quality of life for the patients and decrease health care costs. - 34 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Seogchan Kang DEGREE(S) Ph.D. Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Professor NAME OF ORGANIZATION Pennsylvania State University MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 311 Buckhout Laboratory Penn State University University Park, PA 16802 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 814-863-3846 E-MAIL ADDRESS: sxk55@psu.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description An integrated forensic and monitoring system supporti ng the response to microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistance Infectious diseases pose a continuous gr ave threat to the health of Pennsylva nians. Due to the frequent travels and trades, microbial pathogens (bot h novel and variants of known pathoge ns) rapidly migrate from one region to another. Rapid evolution of resi stance to antimicrobials limits our options for control. After the September 11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax release, it also became apparent that threats from de liberate releases of microbial agents cannot be overlooked. Thus, an effective and rapid response system should be in place to prevent and quickly respond to microbial disease outbr eaks and to mitigate the economic and social impacts resulting from such outbreaks. Cons idering the diversity and rapid evolu tion of pathogens and their frequent genetic changes, it is critical to ba se our countermeasures based on an accu rate and rapid diagnosis and a clear understanding of their biology and ecology. We also n eed a well-established mech anism that supports the communication among experts and policy makers and with th e general public to rapi dly implement intervention strategies based on best available sc ientific knowledge. We should also ar chive biological materials, lessons, and experiences from past and current outbreaks in a format that can help us better manage similar outbreaks in the future. We propose to develop a sy stem that addresses these needs via a combined use of molecular tools, genomics and informatics using zoono tic microbial agents as a model. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Within each of infectious agents, dise ase is often caused by a specific subset of strains, referred to as epidemic clones. In order to develop effec tive intervention strategi es that reduce disease burden, new methods for accurately identifying and tracking bot h existing and newly emerged epidemic clones must be developed. A combination of recent advances in the field of geno mics and informatics will permit the development of a comprehensive genetic forensic database that supports th e identification and tracking the spread of epidemic clones and antibiotic-resistan t populations of diverse microbial pathoge ns and the archiving of key pathogen isolates and associated information. This genetic information also suppo rts the development and validation of diagnosis tools that allow the rapid detection of multiple pathogen species and their variants simultaneously. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses One problem in our current preparedne ss against infectious agents is that the main focus is on detecting and responding to specific known and anticipated agents. A ccordingly, we are ill prepared for dealing with the resulting unanticipated threat s. Pathogens that are pres ently unknown to us can be devastating, as exemplified by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza. Va riants of known pathogens, through genetic changes, with enhanced viru lence and antibiotic resistance are co nstantly emerging too. Advances in genomics and molecular biology facilita te high-resolution genetic fingerprin ting of historic and contemporary - 35 -clinic isolates to build a comprehens ive forensic database. A pathogen monitoring system should be based on such a forensic database so that we can monitor how pathogen communities are structured and have changed. This database accompanied by a state-wide monitoring netw ork will help define the routes of transmission of microbial pathogens, which will permit the implementation of intervention strategies th at prevent further spread and future outbreaks. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses The exponential increase of scientif ic knowledge presents vast opportu nities for advancing fundamental knowledge about biological, environmental, and ecological factors affecting infect ious disease outbreaks and translating the resulting knowledge into enhancing public health. However, at the same time, the information overload slows down the integration of existing knowledge to build big pi ctures. Because of the need for multifaceted approaches to understand and manage infectio us diseases and antibiotic resistance, the need for proactively creating mechanisms suppor ting knowledge sharing and integrati on is greater than many other areas of science. To effectively support c oordination of intervention strategies in cases of disease outbreaks by novel pathogens, a communication mechanism that closely netw ork major stakeholders in decision making is also needed. Information technology can e ffectively address these needs. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians All Pennsylvanians are increasingly expos ed to dangerous zoonotic microbial agents, which are defined as those disease-causing microbial agents that are transmitted from animals to humans. Zoonotic microbial agents include bacteria such as E. coli O 157:H7, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Bordet ella, and Listeria, and also viruses such as Avian Influenza and West Nile. Spread of these microbial agents to the human population can result anywhere in the entire food system when food and wate r come in contact with infected animals or animal products. Spread also occurs by direct contact of humans with animals and the farm environment. Examples of bacterial zoonotic diseases are: i) E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks in 2006 that had a hug e economic impact within the California produce industry, ii) a large outbreak in 2002 that was tr aced to Listeria monocytogenes contamination in a large turkey pr ocessing plant in Pennsylvania, and iii) ongoing outbreaks due to Salmonella enteritidis in eggs produced in Pennsyl vania. Avian Influenza and West Nile viruses are also of great concern in Pennsylvania, which has a large p opulation of wild birds and poultry a nd a history of contamination with these microbial agents. The Pennsylvania Department of Health website reports statistics for only a small subset of zoonoses, and indicates that approximately 1500 cas es of Campylobacter, 70 cases of E. coli O157:H7, and 2000 cases of Salmonella illness were reported from foodborne contamin ation in 2004. These specific agents are of great concern to Pennsylvania's pediatric and minority populations. For example, E. coli O157:H7 is the leading cause of kidney failure among the Un ited State's pediatric population. Ca mpylobacter is a leading bacterial cause of diarrhea among infants, and the incidence of Salmonella illne ss is approximately 30% higher for Pennsylvania's Black population than it is for the Wh ite population. Additionally Listeria, for which data concerning the incidence of disease is not present on th e Department of Health's website, primarily attacks infants and children and also causes s pontaneous abortion in pregnant women. These statistics highlight a number of areas of concern. First, because experts genera lly agree that the actual incidence of foodborne diseases is 30-fold higher than repo rted statistics, these three (E. coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, and Salmonella) microbial agents likely si ckened about 100,000 Pennsylvania citizens per year. Secondly, statistics for other foodborne inf ectious agents such as Listeria ar e lacking, even though this microbe causes severe disease in infants and pregnant women. Third, data are l acking for the spread of zoonoses to humans through routes other than food products. Lastly, statistics are lack ing for \"evolving\" microbial agents, which are defined as newly recognized zoonoses that ar e increasing isolated from farm and food sources. The importance of recognizing and tracking these evolving agen ts is illustrated by the ex ample of E. coli O157:H7, which has progressed from being an unrecognized cause of human disease in 1982, to an organism that today is carried by approximately 10% of cattle within the United States, and caus es nearly 3,000 cases of reported human illness yearly in this country. - 36 - In order to develop eff ective intervention strategies that re duce the disease burden of zoonoses, new mechanisms for accurately identifying and tracking both existing and newly emerged zoonotic microbial agents and coordinating our intervention strategies must be developed. We propose that the development of such mechanisms would ultimately have a great impact on th e health of Pennsylvania's populations especially pediatric and minority. In addition to contributing to the public he alth burden of Pennsylvania citizens, zoonotic agents also threaten the huge economy of Pennsylvania. Animal husbandry is a large portion of the Commonwealth's agricultural infrastruc ture. Also at stake is the Penns ylvania food processing industry, which ranks 4th nationally, employs hundreds of thousands of wo rkers, and contributes $20 billion annually to the Pennsylvania economy. - 37 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Richard Behr Mark Sciegaj Noel Ballentine Martin Sliwinski DEGREE(S) PhD PhD, MPH MD PhD Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Matts Professor of Architectural Engineering Director of the Smart Spaces Center for Adaptive Aging in Place (Behr) Associate Professor of Hea lth Policy and Administration Associate Director of the Smart Spaces Center for Adaptive Aging in Place (Sciegaj) Associate Professor of Medicine Director of Geriatric Health Division of General Internal Medicine (Ballentine) Professor of Human Development and Family Studies Director of the Gerontology Center (Sliwinski) NAME OF ORGANIZATION The Pennsylvania State University MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 114 G Henderson Building The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802 114 E Henderson Building The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802 The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Hershey, PA 17033 118 Henderson Building The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 814 -863-8903 (Behr) E-MAIL ADDRESS: behr@engr.psu.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Adaptive Aging in Place Aging of the American population is the most dramatic demographic trend of our time, bringing with it a host of challenges including runaway health care costs and pre ssures on geographically dispersed families to monitor and care for their elders. Th e situation is particularly severe in Pennsylvania, where, by the year 2020, an estimated 25% of PA's population will be age 60 or over. The situation will be exacerbated as members of the 'baby boom generation' become seniors and as nuclear familie s shrink in size. Most seniors prefer to remain in their own homes and avoid placement in assisted living fa cilities for as long as possi ble. Devising effective interventions that allow seniors to 'age in place' would also reduce the subs tantial health care costs associated with building, staffing, and overs eeing assisted living facilities in PA. Challenges related to physical frailty, cognitive decline, health behaviors and geographic isolation can make inde pendent living risky and insecure for seniors. Overcoming these challenges requires interdisciplinar y and translational resear ch to optimize existing home environments to enable adaptive aging in place for PA residents from all economic brackets. It will be necessary, at a minimum, to coordinate research effo rts in architecture, business, engineering, geriatric medicine, gerontology, health and human development, information sciences and technology, psychology, and sociology. Adaptive aging in place is a preventive me dicine challenge of unprecedented proportion for our commonwealth. - 38 -Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses (1) How can interventions that modify (a) home living envi ronments and (b) the roles of professionals such as visiting nurses and health care techni cians promote important health be haviors and minimize risk factors associated with loss of functional independence? The hypothesis is that a coordinated set of low cost environmental, educati onal and behavioral interventions can promote important health behaviors th at enhance and prolong aging in pla ce. Targeted health behaviors will include sleep hygiene, healt hy eating, physical activity, social engagement and intellectual engagement, all of which contribute to functional independe nce in seniors. This hypothesis can be evaluated effectively in a two step approach: first, examine proxi mal biobehavioral outcomes, including cholesterol, weight, blood pressure, well-being and cognitive function; second, examine how change s to these proximal meas ures of biobehavioral health predict longer-term outcomes, such as postpone ment of disability and maintenance of functional independence. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses (1) Can aging in place be improved or extended by co st-effective interventions or modifications in the home living environments of PA seniors? The hypothesis is that low-cost interv entions in indoor environmental attr ibutes such as lighting, acoustics, indoor air quality, energy efficiency, thermal comfort and interior design can have significant, measurable effects on enhanced and prolonged aging in place. Such effects include mental heal th, immune system health, accident rate, medication management, emergency room vis it rate, etc. While ultimately targeted to aging citizens who remain functionally independent, these hypothese s can be tested initially in more controlled elder populations residing in continuing care retirement communities in PA, prio r to translating proven successes to the broader PA elder population. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses (1) Can aging in place be improve d or extended by training and expandi ng the roles of emergency medical technicians and visiting nurses to pe rform in-home assessments, using mobile data acquisition devices, of elderly persons in rural settings w ith respect to accident risk, neur ocognition, immunization,and home energy use? Hypotheses related to the above research question can be te sted with elderly subjects residing in selected rural PA communities, where appropr iate emphases can be placed on addressing the needs of low- to middle-income PA seniors who are at risk of is olation and poor access to enabling serv ices. This research will address preservation of independent living status, improved delivery of health ca re services to rural elders, and direct transfer of research pilot st udy results to rural elders in PA. Pilot st udies are now addressi ng these questions on a small scale. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The so-called \"Senior Tsunami \" of baby boomers who are just now starti ng to reach retirement age and draw social security benefits is beginning to wash upon the shores of the U.S. he alth care system. Pennsylvania is particularly vulnerable: it is one of nine states to have more than 1 million elderly, and has the second highest proportion of elderly living in the stat e (2000 census), many living in rural PA . Managing the geriatric health care of these elders in the 'business as usual' mode will sure ly not be affordable. In fact, the health care costs of the Senior Tsunami could make some of the se rious economic problems of 2008 - 2009 look modest by contrast. Constructing enough assist ed living facilities to accommodate the burgeoning number of baby boom elders is neither economically feasible nor desired by the vast number of our elders who wish to remain in their - 39 -own homes. Thus, enabling our elder popul ation to age in place with an accep table quality of life for as long as possible is a major preventive health care challenge now facing Pennsylvania, th e United States and many countries throughout the world. For the small proportion of the general population who can afford to purchase quality health care in continuing care retirement communities and the like, adaptive aging in place is less of a concern. However, for the vast majority of our population who cannot afford such continuing care, they must be able to age in place adaptively for as long as possible. The obstacles are particular ly strong for elders in ru ral PA, where logistics and infrastructure issues are challenging a nd personal incomes are relatively low. The increasing number of elders who require strategies and services to keep them safe in their own homes, living with an optimal quality of life will require sust ained and widespread interventions. Understanding the needs of elders, particularly those living in rural areas with less access to services, will be necessary in determining appropriate interventions and allowing assessment of thes e interventions. The creation of systematic methods for evaluating h ealth issues such as home safet y, appropriate use of medications, vaccinations, assistive devices, health care follow-up and nutrition will lead to diminished overall health care costs, delayed or avoided transfer to long term care institutions, and impr oved quality of life for elders. Many elders who are at risk may not request available servic es that could potentially allow them to successfully remain independent in their homes. Often the result is avoidable injury or il lness that requires acute intervention and often leads to loss of independence through institutionaliz ation. The cost implications are enormous and will be non-sustainable. Loss of independence turns out to be an expensive outcome that often could be prevented by earlier interv ention. Accompanying this scenario is the rapid spend-down of personal resources since institutionalization is expensive compar ed to independent living in one's home, which often results in the need for Medicaid services. Elders are an extremely heterogeneous population, which creates additional need for careful evaluation and individualized interventions. Specific needs may relate to cognitive decline, mobility issues, substance abuse, depression, polypharmacy, pain management or frailty. Many, if not most, elders will have multiple chronic conditions that could interact with each other, increasing the complexity of their management. - 40 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Michael J Hall DEGREE(S) MD, MS (Health Outcomes) Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Director, Gastrointestinal Tumor Risk Assessment Program NAME OF ORGANIZATION Fox Chase Cancer Center MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 333 Cottman Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 215 728 2861 E-MAIL ADDRESS: michael.hall@fccc.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Risk in Minority and Underserved Populations A substantial number of incident cancers of the gastrointestinal tract have an identifiable genetic risk or strong hereditary component. Diagnosis of cancer at a young age remains one of the most powerful markers of hereditary cancer risk. Early-onset ca ncers (< 50 years) of the upper gastrointestinal tract (pancreas, stomach, liver and bile duct) are rapidly in creasing across Pennsylvania, with youn g black men and women bearing the greatest burden of these increases. Knowledge of genetic/hereditary cancer risk is remarkably poor among physician and minority/underser ved populations. Equally, can cer risk assessment services are underutilized, and large racial/ethnic disparities in access and uptake have been documented. Improved identification of individuals and families with a hereditary risk of cancer allows early targeting of appropriate and often costly screening and prevention services to the highest ri sk groups. Improved awareness and access to cancer risk assessment services for minority/underserved men and wo men in Pennsylvania at ri sk for gastrointestinal cancers is desperately needed. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1) Providing tailored education a nd low-cost community-based access to cancer risk assessment services among young men and women from minority a nd underserved populations will impr ove awareness and identification of individuals at high-risk for he reditary gastrointestinal cancers. Hypothesis: Knowledge, access (geographic, lack of primary care physician, poor knowledge among community physicians) and cost represent the most impor tant barriers to awarene ss of cancer risk, genetic testing, and screening efforts in the minority and underserved populations of Pennsylvania. 2) The prevalence of common hereditary gastrointest inal cancer syndromes is largely unknown in underserved and minority populations. Hypotheses: A) Hereditary gastro intestinal cancer syndromes explain a significant portion of the early-onset cancers of the gastrointestinal tract in Pennsylvania. B) Community-bas ed cancer risk assessment (pedigree analysis, low-cost counseling and ge netic testing) can improve identifi cation of high-risk individuals. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Individual and community-wide barriers to gastrointestinal cancer risk assessment, risk factor management, and prevention services exist among mino rity and underserved populations. - 41 - Hypotheses: A) Perceived cancer ri sk, perceived benefits and barriers to cancer risk assessment services, preferences for genetic testing, access/ cost, and fears of discrimination significantly impact utilization of gastrointestinal cancer risk assessm ent services. B) Individual and co mmunity-wide barriers are surmountable through tailored education and low-cost, community-bas ed cancer risk assessment services. C) Widening disparities in gastrointes tinal cancer incidence may be reduced though education, gastrointestinal cancer risk assessment, and risk factor modification. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Recent data from the National Cancer Institute's Surv eillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) Program and the American Cancer Society de monstrate that Pennsylvania (PA) is experiencing a cr isis of upper and lower gastrointestinal (G I) cancers of remarkable proportions. Upda ted SEER (2001-2005) data demonstrate a dramatic rise in the incidence of uppe r gastrointestinal (GI) tumors in PA (pancreas, stomach, and hepatobiliary cancers). Incidence rates surp ass national figures as well as those reco rded in neighboring, demographically and socioeconomically comparable states (e.g., New York, Ne w Jersey, Ohio). These changes are highlighted by a striking 25.2 (p<0.05) annual percenta ge change (APC) increase in th e rate of stomach cancer among young (<50) black men, a 48.1 (p<0.05) APC INCREASE in th e rate of hepatobiliar y cancers among young black women, and a 14.1 APC increase for pancreatic can cer among young black men and women (compared to a 0.9 APC DECREASE in pancreatic cancer among young bl ack men and women nationwide). Compounding this crisis, the incidence of lower gastrointestinal cancer (col orectal) in Pennsylvania is th e fifth highest in the nation for both men (68.4 cases/100,000) and women (49.6 cas es/100,000) (American Cancer Society, 2009). Individuals with early -onset cancer are at markedly increased ri sk of having an underlying hereditary cancer risk. Through cancer risk assessment services and cancer predisposition genetic testing technology, high-risk individuals may be identified, counsel ed about cancer risks and risk re duction strategies (e.g., screening, prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention), and offered ge netic testing to better quantify cancer risks for themselves and family members. Disparities in knowledge of hereditary cancer risk and awareness of genetic testing have been well documented, as have access to and utilization of ca ncer risk assessment services (Hall 2005, Hall 2006). Furthermore, striking r acial disparities in modifiable en vironmental and behavioral risk factors (e.g., obesity rates, physical activity levels, smoking rates) exis t nationally and in the state of Pennsylvania. Barriers to cancer risk assessment servic es and genetic testing include awareness, access to general healthcare, cost, and fears of social stigma and discriminati on (Armstrong 2005). Pilot programs have shown low-cost, community-based cancer risk asse ssment services can lead to reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in services access, high follow-up/return rates among underserved and minority individuals, and improved identifica tion of high-risk individuals and fa mily members through genetic testing (Ricker 2006). Strategies to reduce ba rriers to cancer risk assessment serv ices through targeted education and outreach programs, low-cost community-based servic es, and low-cost genetic testing will benefit all Pennsylvania residents by reducing th e incidence of and improving the early diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers, especially in the young black population.

Box 1139 Kennett Square, PA MSHMC Neurology 500 University Drive Hershey, PA Research Priority Title and Description Addiction and Violence Addiction research, and specifically rese arch into the relationship between addiction and violence, should be the priority of the CURE program. Recent brain imaging studies have revealed that the same reward centers of the brain activated by drugs, alcohol, gamb ling and sex also activate when pe ople are wronged by others and crave revenge. That is, when perceived wrongdoers are puni shed, reward centers in the brains of punishers significantly activate, produc ing physiological and psychol ogical effects similar to those associated with powerful drugs of abuse. This brain vul nerability is now suspected of bei ng a root cause of destructive anti- social behaviors including vi olent crime, which is epidemic across Penns ylvania in the form of high rates of child abuse, school violence, domestic violence, workplace conflicts, gang violence, interpersonal violence and murder, prison incarcera tion and recidivism. Public health research aimed at addiction now promises to yield va luable insights not only into substance abuse--which also has become a major intractible public health problem in Pennsylvania--but also violence and criminality. With these insights comes the potential for developing tools to identify those most vulnerable and interventions and treatments to cont rol these addictive behaviors and im pulses and improve public health and welfare. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Do individuals with poor frontal brain function (as indexed by re sting activity, gray matte r density, and activity in inhibition paradigms), hyper-responsive amygdala (to threat and/or to reward probes), and hyper-responsive striatum/pallidum (to reward and to retaliation probes) have increased desi re/likelihood of re venge-gratification behavior and aggression, as measured in laboratory paradigms, conviction history, and structur ed inventories? Hypothesis: Yes. Rationale: Singer, et al. 2006, showed that antic ipated retaliation in ma les activates the same powerful brain reward circuitry (the st riatum) as sex and powerful drugs of abuse. In these laboratory tasks, activation in the reward ci rcuitry was proportionate to the desire to punish (deQue rvain et al., 2004). Along with the desire to punish/increased activity in brain reward circuits, act ivation in empathy-related regions (anterior insula) is reduced in males but not females (Sin ger, et al.). Dreber et al . 2008, showed that inflicting costly punishments (revenge gratification) is maladaptive and agai nst the punisher's interest, indicating compulsive behavior. Rresearch in th is area may offer powerful new insi ghts into predicting and preventing destructive anti-social beha viors and violent crime. - 43 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1) Can revenge-gratification (inflic ting punishments on others) manifest for some individuals into an addictive/impulse control disorder (\" justice addiction\") with a neurobiol ogical substrate, highlighted by an uncontrollable urge to inflict pa in and suffering upon those perceive d as wrongdoers (compulsive anti- social/destructive behavior)? 2) If so, what are the risk factors for these indi viduals? 3) Is \"jus tice addiction\" a root cause of destructive, anti-socia l behavior, including violent crime? 4) Is there a brain-be havioral connection between drug addiction and \"justice a ddiction\"? Hypotheses: Yes to all. Rationale: The U.S. Department of Justice NDIC (2007) has found that violen t crime is the principa l threat to public health and safety in the Philadelphia area and that most violent crime and murder is the result of interp ersonal disputes (revenge gratification). FBI 2002-2006 crime stat istics confirm that arguments ar e the primary cause of murder nationwide. Yet homicide perpetration and victimization across Pennsylvani a is distributed unequally by race and gender (CDC WISQARS), with in cidence significantly higher among bl ack males, coincident with drug abuse, suggesting a co-existan t justice-addicted population. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Can the characteristic fMRI \"brain print\" of justice s eeking/revenge gratification be reversed or modified through the use of pharmacological and/or behavior modification interventions ? In other words, can compulsive revenge-gratification/justice ad diction be treated and/or prevented, and, if so, what intervention strategies would be useful? Hypothesis/rati onale: The foregoing studies sh ow that revenge gratifica tion/justice addiction is physiologically similar to substance abuse and other addictive/impulse c ontrol disorders. It follows that interventions and treatments shown to be effective in combating substa nce abuse and other impulse control disorders could also be effective for revenge gratifica tion/justice addiction. These interventions may include addiction treatment medications and/ or addiction treatment behavioral modification therapies (counseling, 12 step programs, psychotherapy) ta ilored to justice addiction. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Medical research targeting addiction and violence presents an unpa ralleled opportunity to make dramatic improvements in the health and welfare of all Penn sylvanians because the human and economic costs of compulsive revenge-gratification beha vior within the Commonwealth are widespread and enormous, preying upon vulnerable sections of the population and reflecting significant racial a nd gender disparities, demonstrated by the following statistics: PRISON INCARCERATION: 44,450 peopl e were incarcerated in Pennsy lvania in 2006, a disproportionate 95% of whom were male and 61% of whom were black and Hispanic, as compared to 38% white (PA Dep't of Corrections, 2006). By contrast, th e total prison population in Pennsyl vania in 1980 was only 8,582, reflecting an increase of greater than 500% and costing Pennsylvania taxpaye rs $1,500,000,000 annually--more than is spent by the Commonwealth on higher education. RECIDIVISM: 46.3% of all inmates released from Penns ylvania prisons are re-incar cerated within three years (PA Dep't of Corrections, 2004). VIOLENT CRIME: In 2006, 52,432 violent crime offenses were reported to Pennsylvania police departments, up 12% from 2002 (Pennsylvania State Police, 2006). Blacks constituted a dispr oportionate 38.1% of all violent crime victims. Males constitu ted a disproportionate 81.2% of all pe rsons arrested for committing violent crimes, with blacks constituting a disproporti onate 52% of all violent crime arrests.. MURDER: There were 721 murders in Pennsylvania in 2006 (Pennsylvania State Police, 2006). Of these, 235 known cases (32.6%) were the result of arguments and in 254 cases the vi ctims knew their a ssailant (in 241 cases (33.4%), the circumstan ces of the murder and victim knowledge of the assailant was unknown, indicating that the proportion related to revenge-gratification/just ice addiction could be signi ficantly higher). Blacks constituted a disproportionate 66.4% of all murder victims in Pennsylvani a and 64.9% of all murder suspects arrested. Males constitute d a disproportionate 92.1% of all suspects arrested. - 44 - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: 39,371 Protection From Abuse or ders were filed in 2005 in Pennsylvania courts (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence). In that year, 64 wome n and 5 children were murdered in Pennsylvania as a result of domestic violence. WORKPLACE VIOLENCE: In 2006, ho micides (not accidents) were th e most common fatal occupational injury in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, with wor kplace deaths attributable to homicides accounting for 24.7% of the city's fatality count--t he highest percentage among the 12 la rgest metropolitan areas in the United States (U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta tistics, 2007). Fifty per cent of all establishmen ts with more than 1,000 employees, and 5% of total business and government esta blishments, reported at least one instance of work place violence in 2005 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2005). CHILD ABUSE: 4,390 children were abused or ne glected in Pennsylvania in 2005, producing 175 future violent criminals and costing Pennsylvania taxpayers $1.7 billion (F ight Crime: Invest in Kids PA, 2006). BULLYING: 3 out of 10 children are either bullies, victims, or both, lead ing to increased rates of depression, suicide, criminality and violence, including school shootin gs (Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, 2003; U.S. Secret Service, 2002). - 45 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Anna Rose Childress, Ph.D DEGREE(S) Ph.D. Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Research Assoc.

Annual costs to Pennsylvania of th e addictions, in health care, in lost productivity, and in crime ex ceed 15 billion dollars. The rates of relapse in addi ction are very high -- desp ite our best current treatment options. And the number of youths who proceed to drug addiction is also unaccep tably high -- despite conventional prevention efforts. We believe that addiction outcome -- and addiction prev ention -- can be dramatically improved by application of research tools that have only beco me widely available in the past deca de. These are the complementary tools of brain imaging and genetics. These ne w tools suggest that brains at greatest risk for addiction/relapse may be the \"same brains\" at great risk for violence and risk-tak ing (including HIV risk) -- he lping to explain why these devastating public health problems often travel together in the same indivi duals. By applying state-of-the-art brain-behavioral tools to c linical (d rug court clients; cocaine, opiate, nicotine and alcohol-addicted patients, and at-risk adolescents ) we hope to impact not only addiction outcomes, but also the linked problems of violence and HIV risk. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses What are the brain vulnerabilities that increase 1) the risk for relapse in those who are already addicted (to cocaine, opiate s, nicotine and alcohol)? 2) the risk for addiction in those who are not yet addicted (adole scents at risk)? 3) the risk for aggression/violence and risk-taking behavior (including HIV risk ), in all these groups? Research in our lab, and in ot hers', suggests that (struc tural and functional) defic its in the brain's frontal regions, responsible for modulating bot h reward and aggressive impulses, may be critical in explaining vulnerability to addiction, to re lapse, and to the linked problems of violence/crime, and HIV risk. What are the genetic variants associated with the above brain and behavi oral vulnerabilities? Our labs have already identified genetic varia tions that influence addiction medication response, risk for heavy smoking, and greater vulnerability to drug craving cues. Gene variants leading to frontal dysfunction (poor inhibition, poor impulse control, poor decision-making) are an impo rtant research focus . Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Our guiding hypothesis -- that si milar frontal deficits/genetic variation ma y confer vulnerability to relapse, to addiction, to violence, and to HIV ri sk -- will be used to predict outc ome/treatment response in the following - 46 -target populations: 1) For dr ug court clients with cocaine -related crime, can we pred ict which clients are at greatest risk for relapse AND for viol ence -- while offering behavioral trea tment addressing both problems? 2) For underserved minority females with nicotine dependen ce, stratified on dopamine tr ansporter genetics: Can a novel medication impact the brain response to drug cu es, improving treatment outcomes? 3) For Veteran (Afghanistan; Iraq) and non-veterans with alcohol dependence and prior trauma: Can brain and genetic measures predict treatment response to a novel medica tion that may benefit both alcohol and PTSD? 4) For opiate-addicted individuals receivi ng depot naltrexone treatment: Can imaging of brain opiate receptor occupancy predict medication efficacy and clinical outco me? 5) For ADHD adolescent smokers at-risk for illicit drug use: Will brain/genetic measures predict progression to illicit drug use? Can brain measures be used to create more effective anti-drug/pro-health messages? Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Addictions -- and the closely- associated problems of violence, crim e and HIV -- exact an extraordinary toll on the nation and on the health of Pennsylvanians. A ddictions are extremely comm on psychiatric disorders, with the lifetime likelih ood of 1 in 6 for meeting the di agnostic criteria for addiction. Nationally, the estimated cost of illicit drug use exceed s 160 billion dollars annuall y, with the majority of the costs associated with loss of produc tivity -- but including th e costs of addic tion-related health care, auto accidents, and crime (Office of National Drug Contro l Policy, 2000). Alcoholism and drug abuse are the \"number one cause of preventable illness and death and ar e the root cause of one in four deaths each year through infectious disease, cirrhosis, car accidents or overdoses (McLellan, testimony before Philadelphia City Council, May 2003)\". Drug use is implicat ed in \"40% of violent crime, 60% of domestic violence crime, 80% of child abuse and neglect cases, 50 % of theft and property offenses, a nd 75% to 99% of crimes involving prostitution or drug deali ng/manufacturing (ibid, 2003)\". Pennsylvania mirrors these alarming national statis tics, with cocaine, opiates, and marijuana as the most commonly trafficked illicit drugs (US DEA, 2007). Cocai ne led the list of problema tic illicit drugs through the 1980's and 1990's (associated with a high rate of emergency room mentions), with a severe impact on African American communities. There is unfortunately still no FDA-approved medication for cocaine dependence. Heroin addiction has been on a sharp rise in past decade, fueled by incr eases in heroin purity: Philadelphia heroin is now up to 70% pure, nearly twice the national average (DEA Phila delphia Field Division). Abuse of prescription opiates (OxyContin, Vicodin) has risen steeply in Pennsylvania, with the youth involvment in these drugs of particular concern. Addiction to the legal drugs of nicotine and alcohol have severe economic and health consequences for Pennsylvanians. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the nation and in the state, with more than 20,000 Pennsylvania deaths annually due to sm oking -- 7 times the number of deaths due to motor vehicle accidents, homicides and suicides combined (Pe nnsylvania Department of Health, Tobacco Facts 2008). Pennsylvania health care costs for smoking-related illnesses ex ceed 4 billion annually, and the additional costs for lost productivity are estimated at 4.5 billion. Though there ar e treatments for nicotin e dependence, standard nicotine replacement does not work as well for females, and underserved minority females have high rates of smoking and smoking-related illnesses (as compared to non-m inorities). Alcohol is associ ated with 39% of fatal Pennsylvania crashes, with billions in lost productiv ity and associated health care costs (e.g.,cirrhosis). Underage drinking in Pennsylvania is a ssociated with annual costs of 2 bi llion dollars. Half of this (nearly 1 billion dollars) is related to violence-associated costs, $658 million is due to traffic crashes, and approximately $152 million is related to high-risk sexual activity. Alcohol is the most prevalent problem drug for veterans returning from Afghanistan and Iraq, and is often co -morbid with the chronic, debilitating illness of post- traumatic stress disorder. A final addiction-related health risk -- and high health cost -- for Pennsylva nians is exposure to the HIV virus. HIV risk among drug using populations derives no t only from the risk behaviors of needle-sharing among - 47 -intravenous users, but also from high-risk, unprotected sexual behavior s while intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol. HIV risk is particularly high in urban \"hot s pots\"; in Philadelphia, HIV ri sk is over-represented among minorities. Our hypothesis is that the ep idemics of drug addiction, drug violence , crime, and HIV risk are linked not just by circumstance, but by a shared biologic vulnerabili ty. We feel the combined tools of neuroimaging and neurogenetics can impact these intertwined pr oblems, to great public health advantage. - 48 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Brian L.

Typically, most drugs and other new medical st rategies are studied in randomized clinical trials including homogeneous populations, compared to a placebo. This is sufficient to show the drug or device works. It does not show whethe r it works better or worse th an alternative approaches to the same medical problems, nor does it show that it wo rks and is safe for use in the real world, as opposed to the ideal world of that clinic al trial. It also does not identify subgroups in whom the approach is most likely to be effective, or most likely to do harm. All this inform ation is badly needed for practical clinical decisions by clinicians or patients, to determine which interventions are most effective for which patients. Further, at a time of concern over health care costs, it behooves us to apply the treatments which are most effective, and only those. Yet, this evidence is usually missing. Comparative effectiveness research is typically performed by: 1) synthesi zing evidence already available, 2) generating new evidence, and 3) dissem inating the available evidence to be certain it is applied clinically. There is especially a need for an in crease in #2, and for an increase in human and data infrastructure to conduct it. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Many comparative effectiveness studie s are conducted using patient-oriente d research methods, in particular using clinical trials. Their primary goal, however, is not to study disease mechanis ms, but rather to compare patient outcomes when given alternative treatments. The types of questions are ther efore the same as those addressed by health services re search, and are discussed below. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses The techniques used to generate new evidence for compar ative effectiveness research are typically large simple clinical trials, and epidemiologic an alyses of large compilations of exis ting clinical (e.g., electronic health records) and claims (e.g., Medicaid and PACE) databases. The former are very expensive, but are the only valid approach, when there is substantial channeling of th e different alternative interventions into different populations. The latter require adequate databases to be available and the absence of such channeling. A wide - 49 -range of questions can be addressed using these tec hniques, e.g., comparison among alternative treatments for methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections; comparison among different frequencies for use of colonoscopy in the elderly; comparison among treatments for the preven tion of amputation in diabe tics; comparative risk of hepatotoxicity among different treatments for hepatitis C; comparison of different ap proaches to computerized provider order entry, in modi fying provider practice; comparison of diffe rent approaches to the regionalization of critical care delivery; and comparativ e risks of injuries resulting from use in the elderly of different sedatives and hypnotics. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The leading causes of mortality in Penns ylvania (2004-2006 data) are heart disease (age-adjusted death rate 229/100,000/year), cancer (195/ 100,000/year), stroke (49/100,000/year), chronic respiratory disease (39/100,000/year), accidents (39/ 100,000/year), and diabetes (23/100,000/year). Yet, these vary substantially in different subpopulations. The infant death rate was 7/1000 live births /year, but ranged from 5/1000 live births/year for Asians and Pacific Islanders, to 17/1000 live births/year for blacks. 15.2% of Pennsylvania's population is 65 years of age or older, the third-larges t percentage in the nation. 7.2% of Pennsylvanians over age 5 have one type of disability a nd 9 percent have two or more types of disability. The resources expended in Pennsylvania to address this diseas e burden are vast. Based on data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Resear ch and Quality, Pennsylvanians spent about $4 billion on healthcare in 2006. Yet, strikingly, despite these huge resources, in ve ry many clinical situations we do not even know some of the most basic information we nee d, i.e., do our treatments really work, and in whom should they be used? In the past, we have seen treatments that were expected to save lives, actually increase mortality. We have recently found out that some thrombolytics are bette r than others in certain circumstances. Among antipsychotics, the newer and more expensive drugs appear like they may have the same effectiveness as the older ones, and perhaps not large differences in safety. Thioridazine and haloperidol appear to have similar overall rates of life threatening sudden death and ventricular arrhythmia, but thioridazine is wo rse at high dose. When should angina be treated me dically, when with angioplasty, a nd when surgically? We now have antidiabetic agents of many types, given in part to decr ease myocardial infarction, bu t there are accusations that at least one may increase the risk of m yocardial infarction. Is th is true, and is it different for the other drugs for this condition? These are all questions of comparative effectiveness. Knowing the answers, will permit us to use the best approach for a given clin ical setting. In the process, we w ould have better clinical outcomes, prevent unnecessary adverse reactions, a nd decrease the overuse of ineffectiv e treatments and testing. The net impact would be decreased mortality and morbidity from many conditions. Further, there might be a decrease in healthcare costs, with more efficient use of the available te chnology. For certain, there should be an improvement in healthcare outcomes, which in turn shoul d have beneficial societal and economic effects. Further, could some of these drugs be better for some subpopulations, a nd other drugs be better for others? This study of heterogeneity of response is a central role of compar ative effectiveness research, and is critically missing. This is especially important to minorities and the elde rly. Not only are they vulnerable to many of the illnesses which would be studied, but if there are treatments which work particularly well in these subpopulations, or where they are at partic ularly high risk of the tr eatments' adverse events, it is critical that we learn this information so ther apy can be steered accordingly. Finally, the specialized techniques used to generate new eviden ce for comparative effectiveness research, described above, each requires special expertise, and sp ecial facilities. The rese arch team needs to be multidisciplinary, and special training is needed for resear chers in this field. Pennsylvania has the opportunity to be a major leader in developing this infrastructure. I ndeed, it has a number of indi viduals already serving as leaders in this new field, and databa ses which can be useful for this res earch, e.g., PACE, so it is well poised to accomplish this. This is also a major new focus of federa l funding. If Pennsylvania develops the infrastructure to be a leader in conducting these stud ies, it will be positioned to attrac t substantial federa l funding into the state, and in the process con tinue these efforts long-term. - 50 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Anil K.

All play vital roles in basic nutrition, physiology and pharmacology. Disorders and diseases of the digestive tract are amongst the most common human conditions in the United States and the state of Pennsylvani a, as highlighted by the NIH in their burden of digestive diseases re port (Gastroenterology 136: 376-386, 1134-1144, 2009; see also, www3.niddk.nih.gov/Burden_of_Digestiv e_Diseases), costing society hundreds and hundreds of millions dollars. The US Congress and the NIH commissioned experts and members of the lay public to address the burden of digestive diseases and develop a long- range plan. The recommendations of the National Commission on Digestive Diseases, outlines a br oad and ambitious agenda aimed at improving the health of the nation for digestive diseases through resear ch (http://NCDD.niddk.nih.gov) . These diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to the following: (1) ga stroesophageal acid refl cancer; (3 ) Polyps and colon cancer; (4) Inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer: and (5) Vi ral hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. They share common themes of the interpla y of environmental and dietary exposu res with genetic factors. The goals of this proposal are to im pact the biological understa nding, clinical management a nd health care delivery of these diseases. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. How does Barrett's esophagus lead to esophageal cancer? Hypothesis: Transdifferentiation of th e normal esophageal epithelium involv the interplay of developmental pathways to induce Barrett's esophagus, a widely prevalen t condition associated with acid-reflux and the main precursor to esophageal adenocar cinoma, which has the fastest rate of increase of any cancer. 2. How do colon polyps give rise to colon cancer? Hypothesis: The progression of polyps to cancer involves newly identified pathways, apart from chromosomal instability and microsatel lite instability. These pathways involve hypermethylation, B-raf mutation, microRNAs, and other genomic alterations. 3. How does the gut microbiome influence the development of inflammatory bowel disease? Hypothesis: Changes in the bacterial flora in the gut influences the init iation and progression of inflammatory bowel disease, reminscient of associa tions in diabetes mellitus and obesity. - 51 - Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1. How is diabetes mellitus related to colon cancer development and progression? Hypothesis: Insulin, both endogenous and exogenous, lead s to a greater prevalence and incidence of colon cancer. 2. Do the inherited and familial forms of pancreatic cancer inform about the sporadic form of pancreatic cancer? Hypothesis: The inherited (known gene s) and familial forms (unknown genes) can help in the early detection and therapy of pancreatic cancer. 3. Do the use of probiotics and antibiotics improve the clinical outcomes in in flammtory bowel diseases? Hypothesis: Changes in the gut bacter ial flora will help in the clinical management of inflammatory bowel disease through the use of probiotics and antibiotics. 4. Does liver cancer re spond to immunotherapy? Hypothesis: Changes in the immune response to liver cancer antigens will improve survival in liver cancer. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. Can we improve the access to colon cancer screening in traditionally underserved populations in Pennsylvania, including African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanic Americans? Hypothesis: Access to colon cancer screening can be im proved through the overcoming of cultural, social and language barriers. This will lead to decreased colon cancer incidence. 2. Can we improve screening and survei llance of liver cancer in Pennsylvania? Hypothesis: Targeting of at-risk population groups (those with hepatitis B, hepatitis C) will impact upon decreasing liver cancer incidence. 3. Can we improve screening of pa ncreatic cancer in Pennsylvania? Hypothesis: Through the instruction a nd implementation of fixed clinical protocols in the general population, at-risk population groups can be identified so that pancre atic cancer can be detected as a precancerous stage or at an early stage. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Digestive tract cancers and diseases are common in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These cancers arise in the colon/rectum, pancreas, stomach, esophagus, and liver . They are in aggregat e amongst the most common cancers in Pennsylvania. Some of th ese cancers arise in counties where th ere has been expos ure to industrial waste; all are associated with cigarette-smoking; and all are associated with increasing incidence in traditionally under-represented minority groups--Afr ican-Americans, Hispanic-American s and Asian-Americans. Through research--biomedical, clinical and he alth services--using state of the art laboratory based approaches, clinical trials, and population based studies and strategies, Pennsylvania has th e unique opportunity to impact upon these otherwise devastating cancers (as each one is associ ated with poor outcomes) and take the lead in the United States. The benefits relate to the residents of Pennsylvania, those w ho relocate to Pennsylvania, and for attracting new partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as the NIH/NCI. - 52 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Gerard J.

They are th e acute and sometimes deadly manifestations of a chronic disease. AECOPD have been reported to: (1) be th e primary cause for frequent hospital admissions and to the death of many patients, either dur ing hospitalization or shortly ther stress, pr olonged physical discomfort, and drama tically consume the majority of the resources available to manage this chroni 1996; }} 5) frequently are allowed to progress to a severe stage warranti ng hospitalization before any abortive treatment changes are instituted,{{535 Chandra,D. 2009; }} and ; 6) may loss of lung function{{260 Donaldson,G.C. 2005; }}, a steady decline that is a cardinal feature of COPD. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1. Explore the demographics of Pennsylva nia residents hospita lized for AECOPD 2. Understand the impact of geographic location in Pe nnsylvania (e.g., rural and urba n regions) for hospitalized AECOPD 3. Explore the impact of gender and race on hospitalized AECOPD 4. Investigate the pathogenesis of hospitalized AECOPD on lung and syst emic inflammation and procoagulant mechanisms 5. Study the high rate of cardi ac events (e.g., arrhythmias, acute myocardi al venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) that are major causes of morbidity and mortality in COPD in those hospitalized for AECOPD 6. Study new treatments or approaches to prevent hospitalized AECOPD 7. Explore new therapies and approaches to treatmen t in Pennsylvania resident s hospitalized for AECOPD 8. Examine the cost-effectiveness of new approach es to the treatment of hospitalized AECOPD - 53 -Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians AECOPD that require hospitalization are the most severe manifestation of a worsening of the course of the patient with COPD. 50% of patients are readmitted to the hospital within 6 months of the initial hospitalization and patients overall experience an approximately 15% 6- month mortality. Hospitalization for AECOPD is a major problem for Pennsylvania residents and conti nues to afflict 28,000 to 30,000 pa tients annually (Figure 1) No decrease has occurred in AECOPD hospitalizations in Pennsylvania in contrast to admission for acute myocardial infarctions in Pennsylvania residents over the past 6 year s. Based on PHC4 data , hospitalization in FY 2007 incurred annual total charges of $593 million, appr oximately 200 million dollars more than the cost of care for Pennsylvanians admitted for care of acute myocardial infarction (Figure 2). Clearly, AECOPD that require hospita lization is a major problem that re quires attention for Pennsylvanian residents. Despite the obvious great clinical ne ed and high morbidity and mortality of hospitalized AECOPD, there have been no new major approaches to the pharmacologic tr eatment of hospitalized AE COPD in over 3 decades. I believe that a new focus into the epidemiology, prevention and potential treatments that either prevent or lessen the impact of AECOPD that require hospitalization coul d make major impact into the morbidity, mortality and high costs of care of hospitalized AECOPD. Hopefully putting acute exacerbations of chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) that require hospitalization as a research funding pr iority topic will garner the appropriate resources to investigate and hopefully eventually treat this very common and impor tant clinical problem in Pennsylvania residents - 54 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Jill Siegfried DEGREE(S) Ph.D. Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Professor NAME OF ORGANIZATION University of Pittsburgh MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) Department of Pharmacology University of Pittsburgh Co-Director, Thoracic Malignancies Program University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 412-623-7769 E-MAIL ADDRESS: siegfriedjm@upmc.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Research in Biomarkers to Improve Cancer Screening Biomarker signatures that di stinguish cancer patients fr om individuals without cancer have been reported, but few are in clinical use. The major limitation has been l ack of sufficient sensitivity (presence of false negatives) or specificity (presence of false positives). This was demonstrated most recently by the failure of the serum biomarker prostate specific antigen (PSA) to increase survival for men di agnosed with prostate cancer. The performance of a biomarker in screen ing the general population must be extremely high, on the order of 99% overall accuracy (99% specificity and 99% sensitivity ), which PSA never achieved. Newer methods using proteomic approaches to examine prot eins in blood have a much greater potential to find combinations of biomarkers that can more accurately discriminate be tween individuals who do and no not have cancer. This approach could potentially also detect cancer at an early stage. Further, in a clinic al context using a high-risk population, great improvement in clinical work-up of suspicious screening fi ndings for a specific cancer can be achieved with tests that discriminate at much lower stringency, such as 80% sens itivity/85-90% specificity. Examples of high-risk populations are: those scr eened for lung cancer with abnormal computed tomography findings, women with changes in breast density seen on mammogram (possible breast cancer), those with colon polyps found at colonoscopy (possible colon cancer), and men with abnorma l digital rectal exams (possible prostate cancer). Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses The hypothesis is that proteomic analys is of blood-borne proteins can di stinguish in a high-risk population between individuals who do and do not have cancer. The second hypothesis is that proteomic biomarkers can detect cancer at an early stage in high-risk populations. Proteomic tests will be most readily applicable to those with suspicious, but inconclusive, findings on screening for lung cancer, breast cancer, colo n cancer, or prostate cancer. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses In high risk patients screened for lu ng, breast, colon, or prostate cancer who have pre-cancerous findings or have findings that are suspicious of cancer, biomarker profiles found by pr oteomic analysis will be able to correctly predict or detect cancer at a sensitivity of at least 80% and a spec ificity of over 90%. Proteomic tests will be able to correctly rule out can cer in over 90% of high-risk patients who are cancer-free, while correctly identifying cancer in over 80% of those who do have th e disease. The correct identification of those with cancer will also find cancer at an early stage where it is still curable. Us e of proteomic tests will lessen the health costs and anxiety of cancer screening. - 55 -Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Incorporating validated cancer biomarkers into a sc reening protocol will redu ce the number of medical procedures in screened individuals who end up with a negative cancer di agnosis as a result of screening. Incorporating validated cancer biomarke rs into a screening protocol will re duce the anxiety level of individuals who undergo cancer screening a nd have a suspicious finding. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Most recent statistics available from the Pennsylvania De partment of Health show th at the following number of new cases of cancer were diagnosed in Pennsylvania in 2006: prostate (10,770) ; lung and bronchus (10,455); female breast (9,739); colon a nd rectum (8,004). These are the top 4 type s of cancer diagnosed The number of cancer deaths was also high for thes e 4 types of cancer: lung and bronc hus (7,892); colon and rectum (2,884); female breast (2,096); and prostate (1 ,453). These cancer types represent more than 50 percent of all of the cancer deaths reported in the state. Although improvements in cancer therapy ar e being made, the best way to avoi d cancer death is early detection. Screening is an important part of ear ly detection but can also lead to many false positive findings (suspicious changes that may resemble cancer but are actually benign). False positive results not only increase patient anxiety and health costs due to extra procedures performed to confirm or ru le out cancer, they also lead in many cases to unnecessary surgery. These o ccurrences make cancer sc reening less efficient and, in some cases, cause at-risk individuals to avoid cancer sc reening. Blood tests that could comp lement screening will greatly improve the reliability of screening tests. This improvement will , in turn, lead to greater use of screening and higher probability of early cancer detection. - 56 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Henry R.

The economic cost of br east cancer in the US for 2001 was estimated to be $157 billion. Approximately 25% of breast cancer patients overexpress the Her2 receptor (Her2-positive) and exhibit higher recurrence rates and decreased survival . Although many of these patients ar e well-treated with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, as many as 66% of those treated deve lop resistance to this ch emotherapy. Recent work indicates that the efficacy of trastuzumab will likely be improved by combination with inhibitors of the Ras/MAPK and/or Akt pathway in populations of breast can cer patients. Selective inhib itors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B both the Akt and Ras/MAPK pa thways and decrease the growth of breast cancer tumors.The proposed hea lth research priority is to assess the clinical bene fit of combining selective PTP1B inhibitors with existing chemotherapies to improve survival and quality of life for breast cancer patients. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses The overarching hypothesis is that specific combinations of selective inhibitors can imp rove the course of breast cancer (BC) chemotherapy. Selective i nhibitors of protein tyrosine phosph atase 1B and Ras/MAPK pathways and d ecrease the growth of breast cancer tumors. We hypothesize that more effective treatment regimens for breast cancer can be develope d by the identification of synergistic chemotherapy regimens of a selective PTP1B inhibitor with existing therapeutic regimens. This hypothesis will be assessed by (1) studying the effect of isobolic combinations of trastuzumab with a selective PTP1B inhibitor on genomic and proteomic patterns of breast tumor cell apoptosis in physiologic and cell models, (2) assessing the efficacy of selected combina tion regimens of trastuzumab with a selective PTP1B inhibitor for inhibiting tumor growth in xenograft models, (3) evaluating the efficacy of a synergistic regimen of trastuzumab and a selective PTP1B inhibitor to redu ce tumor volume and improve quality of life in breast cancer patients. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Large numbers of breast cancer patients have benefited from newer therapies but of these, up to two-thirds become resistant to the treatment and undergo relapse. W ill aggressive treatment of patients early in the disease course lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced disease activity? Will newer diagnostic techniques which - 57 -guide therapeutic regimens lead to c linical responses to chemotherapies? Ar e there specific biomarkers of breast cancer patients who develop resistan ce to trastuzumab and other chemothe rapies? We hypothesize that newer assessments of resistance biomarkers in concert with combination therapies will lead to better health-related quality of life and a longe r-lasting clinical effect. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Resistance to existing chemotherapies is unquestionabl y complex and, to some extent, idiosyncratic with individual differences in sensitivit y and in the impact on daily living. A major hypothesis is whether it will be possible to decrease resistance and improve response to existing therapeutic modalities by combining them with new agents which inhibit the activity of resistance markers, such as PTEN/Akt. With this hypothesis demonstrated, it will be important to identify patients likely to benefit from this novel regimen through the use of reliable biomarkers and/or pharmacogenomic analyses. This would permit the delivery of enhanced treatment modalities for breast cancer with a minimum of side effect s. The ability to deliver more effective breast cancer therapeutics with reduced side effect s has countless benefits to the indivi dual citizens of the State, to their families, and to the overall impact wherein recurrent br east cancer severely compromises productivity and is a continuing and costly burden on the health care system. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Breast cancer is a significant health issue, affecting nearly 48,000 Pennsylva nians every year and approximately 2,096 women and men are expected to have died from breast cancer in 20 06. Although surgical and pharmacological regimens have signif icantly improved patient survival a nd quality-of-life, breast cancer remains the third leading causes of death in the Pennsylvania, following lung and colon cancer (Pennsylvania Department of Health). The impact of novel treatment modalities for breast cancer would be a decrease in the mortality of Pennsyvania ci tizens from breast cancer. A major objective of the proposed studies would be th e development of new trea tment modalities for breast cancer through the work of new and es tablished Centers of Excellence with in the state of Pennsylvania which will lead to new investigators and gran t applications. Importantly, this effort will yield new partnerships and entrepreneurial opportuniti es that will help build the State's workfor ce as well as alleviate a serious debilitating impediment to comfort and productivity. - 58 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Kathleen Sullivan DEGREE(S) MD PhD Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Professor of Pediatrics NAME OF ORGANIZATION The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 3615 iCvic Center Blvd Philadelphia, PA 19104.

African American women are affected more than Caucasian women but in all cases the peak age of onset is 20-35 years of age. Ten percent of cases begi n in childhood and a similar number of ca ses develop after menopause. Only 10% of cases occur in males and it tends to be older males. Therefore, the ma jority of cases arise in women at a time when they could be startgin a family and initiating a career. Lupus can begin in sidiously and is typically associated with fatigue and joint pain. Interventions for early or mild lupus include nonste roidal anti- inflammatories. More aggressive treatments are typically reserved for significant re nal disease, life threatening hematologic disease, or CNS disease. These treatmen ts involve cyclophosphamide or other high level immune suppressive agents and these interventions are typically associated with a risk of infection and additional fatigue. Because of the risks associated with high le vel immune suppression, these tr eatments are not initiated for mild to moderate disease. Renal involvement is one of the most feared compli cations as it contributes to approximately half the mortality seen in lupus. The re nal inflammations seen in lupus ranges from mild to severe and a macropahge dominance has been found in one study to predict poor outcome. Additional interventions are needed for lupus ne phritis and understanding the role of the renal macrophage could led to improved, targeted interventions. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses We wish to define alterations to ge ne expression at two levels. Other ge ne expression studies in SLE have defined altered gene expression in pe ripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. One of the difficulties in the array studies of SLE patients has been the mixed cell population. An innovative aspect of the current application is that the monocyte has been specifically targ eted. Although the monocyte has not received much attention with respect to lupus, it clearly plays an important role in atherosc lerosis, which is accelerated in SLE and in renal disease, which continues to be the majo r source of morbidity on SLE. The second innovation of this application is that our study will pair expression arrays and histone ChIP arrays to define both the set of genes with altered expression and the set of genes with the potential fo r altered expression. Th is latter set will be identified by having altered histone modifications but RNA levels at base line. The long term goal of this type of research is to identify novel pathways which coul d potentially be targeted ther apeutically. By targeting the pathways which drive the histone modifications, the poten tial exists to re-regul ate gene expression. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses The hypothesis that aberrant gene expre ssion could be re-set to ba seline is, at this point , untested. Our approach is to define the pathologic path ways which led to the altered hist one modifications and target those - 59 -therapeutically in future st udies. Epigenetic contributions to lupus c ould explain the twin discordance seen as well as the epidemiologically-defined effects of diet. Current therapeutics target immune dysregulation but are unable to re-establish a durable remissi on. Addressing the source of aberrant gene expression has the potential to induce a sustained disease remission. Importantl y, by addressing the cause of the pathologic gene expression, this approach has the pote ntial to cure renal disease not ju st temporarily tame the effects. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Lupus rephritis represents a tractable system to inves tigate the epigeneic alterati ons to macrophages, lt is anticipated that this style or aproach could be eb eneficial in many choronic autoimmune syndromes. The concept of identifying a cure seems he retical but it may be possible once the aberrant pathways leading to dysregualted gene expression have been identified. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Lupus has unusual demongraphics, affecting predominantly women in their peak wage -earning years. African American women are affected more than Caucasian wo men. Ten percent of cases begin in childhood and a similar number of cases develop after menopause. Only 10% of cases occur in males and it tends to be older males. Therefore, the majority of cases arise at a time when the patient could be starting a family or a career. With a prevalence of approximately 1:1000, between 500,000 and 2 million people are affected, leading a significant lost number of work days and a significant burde n on the health care system. SLE is one of the most common autoimmune diseases and its efects on joints, kidn ey, heart, and skin limit patients' ability to function in the work place. This application proposes to identify pathways that could be therapeutically targeted in the future to reverse renal disease. The targets are pathways involved in hi stone modifications and these interventions have already been piloted in oncology. The concept that SLE could be treated in ways to prevent progression is new. The focus has been on improving renal outcome and mortality bu t now that patients are livi ng longer, it is clear that smoldering inflammation is associated with an increased ri sk of atherosclerosis and qu ality of life studies have demonstrated that chronic symptoms are limiting job perf ormance. For these reasons, the study of lupus is very important for CURE funding. The goal of the research in my laboratory is to improve th e health of patients with SLE. To do this will take a new strategy. The medications used today are no different than the medica tions used twenty years ago. There are new agents being developed recently which allow a ta rgeted resetting of the gene expression. These agents have thus far been used primarily to treate malignancie s, but the concept of utilizing the strategy of re-setting gene expression could be very powerful for autoimmune diseases in general, and for SLE specifically. - 60 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Jonathan M.

The 2008 CDC report from Branum and Luckas indicated 1 ou t of 4 children have food allergies with nearly 3 million children reporting a food reaction in 2007. The pr evalence of food allergies have increased 18% in the last 10 years and over 9500 hospital admission for food a llergies were noted from 2004-06 making it an urgent medical need. Food allergies are the l eading cause of pediatric Emergency De partment Visits for acute allergic reactions. In addition, many food alle rgies are life-long and are potential ly life-threatening making them a significant risk factor for adults. However, food reac tions can vary and include life-threatening, wheezing, prolonged vomiting, or a mildly localized rash. The current diagnostic tests (prick skin tests and blood tests) have an acceptable rate of false pos itive and negatives and do not predict which pateints. The treatment for food allergies is avoidance and preliminary trials are for alternative treatments have mixed success. Therefore, there are no cure for food a llergies and only avoidance. These large gaps in scie ntific knowledge show the strong need for an emphasis on research for food allergy. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Hypothesis: Genome-Wide Associati on analysis has the power to unveil genes and genetic factors that predispose to Food Allergies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify new genes in many other diseases including autism , diabetes, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. It has not been used for food allergy, but provides a nove l and important tool to discover ne w protein and protein interactions. Question #1: Can a whole genome scan identify novel protiens or interactions that asso ciate with Food Allergy including life threatening allergic reactions. Question #2: Will these novel protiens or protein interactions identify new pathways for diagnosis of food allergy. Question #3: Can GWAS identif y novel protein or protein interactions that should be studied to develop a potent ial cure for food allergy? Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Hypothesis: Proteins or protein in teractions identified by GWAS will l ead to improved diagnostic techniques for food allergy and identify pa tients at risk for severe life-threatening reactions. Question #1: Is there a way to predict which patients are at risk for different types of allergic reactions. Will the novel proteins identified by GWAS identify which patients ar e at risk for urticaria reac tions, reactions of emesis only or the patients with acute life-th reatening reaction with closure of th e airway. Question #2. Will the novel proteins or their interactions iden tified by GWAS provide im proved diagnostic techniques to allow better and improved diagnosis to prevent unnecessary food avoidan ce and allergic reactions. Question #3: Can GWAS - 61 -and analysis of protein interacti on develop an improved approach to prevent the current increase in food allergy? This area of research will be a pproximately 70% of the effort. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Food allergy affect upto 1 in 4 of children have food a llergies affecting races and ge nder equally according to 2008 CDC data. There has been ov er 9500 hospital admission and 50,000 emerge ncy department visits due to food allergies in the United States, bu t local Pennsylvania rates are unknown. It is a major issue in school and avoidance of food allergens in school create significant social and emotiona l barriers for the children with food allergies. Children with food allergy also have a significant higher rate of asthma compared to general population (29% vs 12%) according to 2008 statistics from the CDC. This comorbidity has significant impact on pateints and health care cost in United States and Pennsylvania. The impact on the school system is enourmous. Data from 2006 School Health Policy and Program Study indicate: over 50% of states require d information on severe food or other allergies be obtained and kept in student records; over 95% of schools obtained and kept information on se vere food or other allergies in student records and 45% of states provided m odel policies to districts or schools on severe food or other allergies. These statistics indicate the hi gh prevalence of food allergies. Food allergies are part of the Commonwealth of Penns ylvania Healthly People 2010 Program with objective 10- 04. However, no data is available for this area indicating a need fo r further emphasis and research. In conclusion, food allergies affect a large proportion of Pennsylvania reside nts including all ra ces and gender.

Such evidence has led to national gui delines endorsing universal screenin g for health and mental health conditions for these children, and the recent Fostering Conne ctions Act now requires stat es to demonstrate that they are meeting the health and well -being needs of children under their su pervision. As Pennsylvania seeks to confront the requirements to improve the healthcare deli very system for children in foster care, there are many challenges that will stand before th em. Coordinating the care for childre n who frequently disrupt placements continues to be a great cha llenge, and uncertainty about who consents for treatment of children in foster care has led to an emerging crisis around the use of psychiat ric medications by these child ren. This research topic area would endorse applications that seek to: 1) Study the impact of new healthcare delivery designs to improve the access to a nd quality of healthcare delivered to children in foster are; 2) Use exisiting data (and potential ly data linked across systems) to evaluate emerging concerns about medication use by children; and 3) Through community-based participation, devel op guidelines for safe and effective practice. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses None Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Research question 1: Can coordina tion across public health and child welfare systems improve health and placement outcomes for children in foster care? [Hypot hesis: implementing a system where the health departments assists child welfare to coordinate general medical and behavi oral healthcare for children will improve access to care for children in foster care] Research Question 2: What is the ma gnitude in growth of the use of psyc hiatric medications (and particularly antipsychotic medications) over time among children in fo ster care, and which children and placement settings are at greatest risk? [Hypothesis: th ere will be excessive variation in th e use of medications by children across placement setting that can help systems identify ou tliers that require oversight and investigation.] - 63 -Research Question 3: Can a standardized approach to consent for treatment and oversight of medication use by children influence medication patterns among children? [Hypothesis: Guidelines will reduce overall frequency of polypharmacy and antipsychotic use among children in foster care.] Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Children in foster care are among the most vulnerable of Pennsylvania's c itizens. In Philadelphia alone, over 6,000 children remain in foster care , representing only 5% of the a nnual reports to child welfare for maltreatment each year. The challenges to coordina ting the healthcare for these children have been well documented. National statistics illust rate that while 40%-80% of these children have se rious behavioral problems, only about a quarter of them will receive care. For those that receive care, it remains unclear of how informed consent is obtained for treatment, particul arly at a time when children are increasingly using psychiatric medications to treat disr uptive symptoms. Analysis by the PolicyLab at the Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia reveals, for example, that in 2004, 18% of ch ildren in foster care with Attention Deficit Disorder (1/2 of all children in foster care diagnosed with a be havioral disorder) were using three or more psychiatric medications in combination at the same time; 37% of these children were using antipsychotics. The implication of these data is that for children in foster care, the challe nges for delivering effective and safe healthcare are a double-edged sword. For many children, the issue of access to care, sharing of information with their caregivers, and principally the coordination of their healthcare w ith their experiences in foster care, remain a paramount issue. But, for those children w ho are able to access care, the issue then becomes how systems of care can ensure that treatments are safe and effective, and that the goals of treatment are aligned systemically to long-term goals for well-being. With foster care on the national age nda following the Fostering Connecti ons Act of 2008, this research topic area is particularly timely, as Pennsylvania will be aske d to demonstrate how it is meeting the needs of these children. Aligning a research program with these requirements would be a great opportunity to inform the program improvement that will be required of Penns ylvania's public health a nd child welfare systems. - 64 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Anette Duensing / Saumendra Sarkar (for the Molecular Virology Pr ogram at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute) DEGREE(S) M.D. / Ph.D. Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Assistant Professors NAME OF ORGANIZATION University of Pittsburgh MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) Molecular Virology Program University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Hillman Cancer Center 5117 Centre Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 412-623-5870 / 412-623-7720 E-MAIL ADDRESS: aduensin@pitt.edu / saumen@pitt.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Infection, Immunity, and Cancer Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that infectious agents ar e responsible for over 15% of all malignancies worldwide, most of th em being caused by viruses. Human pa pillomavirus (HPV)-induced cervical carcinoma is widespread amongst the general population, but the majority of virus-induced neoplasms affect smaller subpopulations. These are often immunocompromi sed, such as human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)- positive individuals and elderly patients. Tumor viru ses that are most prominently involved in these subpopulations are Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) and the newl y identified Merkel cell carcinoma virus (MCV). Moreover, infec tion with high-risk HPV is intimately associated with anal carcinoma in HIV-positive patients. The population of Pennsylva nia not only comprises of a very high proportion of residents over the age of 50, ranking nu mber six in the nation, but also ra nks sixth in the rate of HIV-positive individuals with the implica tion that virus-induced malig-nancies are a major health problem in Pennsylvania. The Molecular Virology Program at the University of P ittsburgh Cancer Institute has extensive experience in this field of research and is exceptionally well-suited to address this health research priority. Our main goals are (i) to better define how viruses cause cancer focusing on mechanisms of transformation, the host immune response and genomic instability, (ii) to develop biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and (iii) to define novel therapeutic targets. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Our main goal is to address the que stion of how viruses cause cancer a nd to exploit this knowledge for novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. We will focus on several research areas to address this question. (i) What are the exact mechanisms of transformation? Th e identification of viral onc ogenes and their mechanism of transformation will be essentia l to understand virus-induced carcinoge nesis and the identification of therapeutic targets. (ii) What is the role of the host immune respons e? Because the above-mentioned virus- induced malignancies predominantly occur in the immunoc ompromised host, it will be imperative to dissect the host cell immune response afte r infection and during tumor progression. (iii) What pathways contribute to genomic instability? As most malignant tumors, virus- induced carcinomas are genomically unstable. We will therefore analyze mitotic de fects as well as changes in the DNA damage response in these tumors. (iv) Which signaling pathways contribute to carc inogenesis? Tumor viruses are known to hijack the cellular signaling machinery. Hence, it will be crucial to map pathways that are aberrantly ac tivated in virus-induced malignancies. - 65 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Our main clinical objective is to improve patient mana gement. Here, we will concentrate on two major areas: (i) the development of biomarkers for diagnostic and prognosti c purposes and (ii) the iden tification of novel targets for prevention and therapeutic purposes. Diagnostic and pr edictive biomarkers will be instrumental to improve risk assessment and quality of life. Candidates will include molecules that have a major role in virus-induced carcinogenesis, such as viral oncogenes, members of the host immune response, regulators of the mitotic machinery or members of cellular signa ling pathways (see above). Their respect ive value will be tested in blood or tissue samples obtained from patients. For preventi on and therapy, we will focus on vaccine development and the identification of novel drug targets employing siRNA-based screens that were recently developed in the Molecular Virology Program. These will encompass librari es of genes that are pha rmacologically targetable, such as kinases, phosphatases and members of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The state of Pennsylvania has an exceptionally high nu mber of older residents. 34.4% of all residents in Pennsylvania are of age 50 or older. Th is means that Pennsylvania ranks sixth of all states in the U.S. with a population over age 50 (Census 2007 Estimates; www. census.gov/popest/datasets.html). Moreover, Pennsylvania comprises an unproportionally high percenta ge of inhabitants that are seropositive for HIV and therefore likely to be immunocomprom ised. The total incidence of AIDS in Pennsylvania from 1980 to 2004 was 30,368 cases as reported by the HI V/AIDS Surveillance - Bureau of Epidemiology of the Pennsylvania Department of Health (www.dsf.health.state.pa.us /health/cwp/view.asp?A=171&Q=237037), and Pennsylvania ranked sixth in the United States for both cumulative AIDS cases (all ages) and new AIDS cases in 2007 (all ages; www.statehealthfacts.org, Kaiser Family Foundation). These above-mentioned subpopulations have a significan tly higher incidence well as Merkel cell carcino ma. Most importantly, because the ad vent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a significan t increase in lifespan for HIV-infect ed patients, it has also led to an increase in tumor burden from AIDS-rela ted malignancies in these individuals. Although much progress has been made in the field of vi ral carcinogenesis in the recent past, many of these findings pertain to the etiol ogy of virus-induced malignancies. It is cl ear that a number of major obstacles still need to be overcome. The main problems that need to be addressed involve the improvement of diagnosis and risk assessment, treatment options and quality of life. In elucidating the m echanisms of tumor formation as well as defining biomarkers and novel ther apeutic targets, our research wi ll have a major impact on patient management and quality of life especially for Penns ylvanians but also for el derly and immunocompromised patients in general. - 66 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Steven E.

Greater understanding of cancer stem cells in lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, pa ncreas and other deadly forms of cancer can be achieved by deciphering their cancer stem cells. Genes whic h mark such stem cells provide r obust biomarkers for more precise diagnosis and individualized therapy. This is particularly important to the diverse populations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as studies have shown disparate outcomes in cancer treatment based on gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses The hypotheses is that common deadly cancers are driven by cancer stem cells and that understanding the genetic and protein profiles of these stem cells will cr eate better biomarkers and new targeted individualized therapies. Questions to be adressed include: 1. How are cancer stem cells best identified? 2. What are their genetic and protein profiles? 3. What are the best biomarkers of cancer stem cells?

For example, researchers at Jefferson recently indentified that the genetic profile of breast cancer in African-American wo men is distinct from that of Caucasian women. Furthermore, this distinct ion is associated with differe nt stages at presentation and different responses to therapy. - 67 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Steven E.

Early ex pression of these cardiovascular- metabolic disorders are accelerated by the childhood obes ity epidemic. Little is known about 1) mechanisms underlying the early phase of these chronic conditions including gene-environmenta l interaction, 2) how to identify and quantify target organ injury, and 3) biomar kers of the pathogenic pathways. The Commonwealth's investment in 2005-2006 non-formula funding for obesity resear ch was very timely and progressive. It is now clear that further progress must be made to build on th is foundation. This work truly needs bench to bedside to community interactions, and impacts urban, suburban and ru ral citizens of the Commonwea lth of Pennsylvania.

There is a major burden of productive work lost, - 68 -lives shortened, and cost to individua ls and taxpayers. It is becoming cl ear that these conditions have their origins in childhood and adolescence in the obesity epidemic. More interdis plinary studies are needed now to understand more about these conditions in order to prevent a tidal wave of adult chronic disease in the future.

Within the \"3 T's of Translation\", this gap occurs at the third level of translation\u2014translating cl inical and epidemiological evidence into routine practice. Implementation research w ithin healthcare evaluates methods to promote the uptake of evidence- based practices into routine practice, resulting in improvement in healthcar e, including improved effectiveness, reliability, safety, equity and efficiency. In response to regulatory a nd financial policies, i ndividual healthcare systems have invested in the infrastructure and pers onnel needed to implement i ndustry models of quality improvement. However, these individual efforts are poorly coordinated and not tied to scientific methods in order to accelerate our unders tanding of the basis for syst em change within healthca re delivery organizations. The purpose of this research priority is to stimulate co llaborative research across th e Commonwealth to rapidly accelerate the advancement of knowledge in implementation sc iences. To advance science in this area requires the establishment of a sustainable, tr anslational research infrastructure, co upling the clinical operations of a network of community and academic medical centers with a team of quantitative a nd qualitative scientists conducting innovative work in implementation sciences to improve quality and enhance patient safety. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Research designed to improve patient safety and quality of care proceeds through three stages: describing the existing quality/safety gaps, identifying the system level factors associated with those gaps, and evaluating interventions to reduce gaps in safety and quality. Exampl es of questions to be addr essed within each of these stages include: -What is the frequency and clinical consequences of inadequate informa tion exchange in the intra-hospital transfer of patients from ICU care to medical/surgical floor ca re? Hypothesis: ina ccurate and incomplete information exchange is common an d results in increased ICU readmi ssions, medication order errors, and increased length of hospitalization. -What are the system-level factors as sociated with catheter associated infections? Hypothesis: lack of standardized catheter insert ion and maintenance procedures are associ ated with increased risk of infection. -Can an immediate feedback program improve quality of care for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest? Hypothesis: Immediate (vs. dela yed) feedback on cardiac arrest car e can lead to improved outcomes. - 70 -Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Substantial knowledge gaps currently underlie the inability of health care delivery systems to effectively and efficiently translate evidence into practi ce. This stands in star k contrast to models of quality improvement and system reengineering in many other industries, which have successfully linked opera tions with research and system-wide learning. As a result, key scientific areas of uncertainty ex ist in the areas of organizational behavior change, education and training, operations resear ch, and communication. Examples of specific gaps in knowledge to be addressed include: -The role and attributes of local phy sician and nurse champions in promoting organizational change to achieve quality improvement goals. Hypothesi s: Local champions are critically important for implementation success. -The tradeoffs between standardizat ion vs. flexibility in communication tools between nurses and physicians. Hypothesis: Rigid standardization of communication tools reduces usability and reduces implementation of QI initiatives. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Taken together, preventable medical errors and the failu re to delivery evidence-bas ed high quality care account for substantial morbidity and mortality in our medical sy stem at tremendous increa sed cost. Medical errors account for a minimum of 44,000 deaths annually, which is mo re than motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or HIV.(1) In the Institute of Medici ne's report, \"To Err is Human: Bu ilding a Safer Health System,\" the important research questions ask about the conditions unde r which people make errors, the types of errors being made, and the types of systems that can be put into place to prevent errors al together when possible. Analogously, the IOM report \"Crossing the Qualit y Chasm: A New Health System for the 21 st Century\" highlights the gap between our understanding of evidence-bas ed effective treatments and the delivery of those treatments, even in our most elite medical institutions. For example, in a recent national study, only 22.8% of patients received recommended care (prophylactic antibio tics and anticoagulation) du ring acute hospitalizations for hip fracture. In Pennsylvania, there is abundant ev idence that all Pennsylvanian's do not receive the highest quality of care available and preventable medical errors occur at an al arming rate. For example, according to data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Counc il (PHC4), in 2007, 27,949 patients experienced hospital- acquired infections in Pennsylvania, a rate of 17.7 pe r 1,000 admissions. These largel y preventable infections (including catheter associated urinary tract and blood str eam infections and ventilat or associated pneumonia) resulted in substantial morbidity, mortality and cost: patients with infections e xperienced 12.2% mortality, 15 day median length of hospitalization, and $87,655 median hospital charges compared to 2% mortality, 3 day median length of hospitalization, and $19,748 median charge s for patients without infe ctions.(3) Similarly, evidence suggests that there are many oppor tunities for raising the quality of care delivered in PA hospitals. For example, according to PHC4 data, 57,360 patients disc harged from PA hospitals with selected conditions were readmitted within 30 days, accounting for 18.7% of all admissions. These data also highlight substantial variability across PA hospitals in risk adjusted length of stay and total charges for many clinical diagnoses, including cardiovascular and pulmona ry diseases and pneumonia.(4) Standardization of evidence based procedures for these common conditions can improve clin ical outcomes and reduce re admissions at substantial cost savings. Yet, our understanding of organizational barriers to implem enting these evidence based guidelines is limited and has resulted in a substantial gap between what we know and what we deliver. Disparities in the occurrence of me dical errors and the delivery of high quality, evidence-based care are prevalent. In a study of hospitalized patients in New Yo rk, rates of adverse events rose with age, and the percentage of adverse events due to negligence was markedly higher among the elderly.(5) Advanced age is also consistently cited as a risk fact or for medication errors. Racial and et hnic disparities in the delivery of high quality, evidence-based care are also prevalent, with multiple national st udies demonstrating that African Americans consistently receive lower qua lity of hospital care than whites. Central to efforts to improve quality of care and patient safety is a focus on impr oving equity across the health system in PA. 1. Kohn LT et al., eds. To Err Is Human.

Over 34 million adults in this country meet diagnostic criteria for dependence on t obacco, alcohol, prescription medications and/or illicit drugs. While often thought of as a so cial problem, comparisons between addi ctions and chronic illnesses on key features such as etiology, genetic heritabillity, pathophysiology and respon se to treatment show substantial commonality. Like other chronic illne sses, the etiology and c ourse of addictions ar e affected by genetic heritability, personal choice, family, a nd environmental factors. Many behavi oral interventions and medications are effective in the treatment of a ddictions; though non-compliance and relaps e rates are as high in addiction as in most other chronic illnesses. Like other chronic illnesses, there is pres ently no cure for addiction but medical treatments can provide cost-effective reductions in substance use and its a ttendant public health problems. This is important because according to the UN-WHO study of all chronic illnesses, addiction to alcohol was the second most disabling condition (after Major Depre ssion) and addiction to other drugs ranked fourth. Addictions are more disabling than other chronic illnesses because of th eir greater prevalence and early onset (16 - 24) and because untreated addiction reduces productiv ity and quality of life not only for patients, but also for their loved ones. Studies show that the family member s of substance abusers utiliz e four times more health services and typically have impaired daily functioning. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Addiction is now widely accepted as a chronic medical illness, but it is not insured, treated or managed like other chronic illnesses. Standard addiction treatment typicallyinvolves 30 - 60 days of outpatient counseling with no medication and with relapse rates of 40 - 60% w ithin six months. Imagine the relapse rates that would occur in diabetes or hypertension if those illnesses were treated in this acute care fashion. We hypothesize substantially better cl inical outcomes among addicted individuals unde r a \"disease manageme nt\" approach that uses long-term monitoring w ith continuing treatment, medication adju stment, and family and other services (e.g., educational) as needed; similar to what is typically insured and pr ovided in other ch ronic illnesses. Moreover, we hypothesize reduced costs of related health conditions (e.g. cirrhosis, HI V, HCV) and ER visits for addicted patients treated in a di sease management approach. Some s upport for this hypothesis comes from a study of addicted physicians who received a disease mana gement model of treatment (3 - 6 months of formal - 73 -treatment, followed by 3.5 years of monitoring and supports) and had 80% positive outcomes over five years (McLellan, DuPont & Skipper, 2008). Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses There are numerous, research-derived, evidence-based tr eatments for most addictions and new evidence-based disease models of treatment are being developed; yet most programs do not use evidence-based treatments and the overall quality of available addiction treatment is su spect. Even when providers try to learn new evidence- based treatments, the level of training available usually does not teach them to pr ovide a good quality evidence- based treatment. Worse yet, research s hows that typical training methods may lead providers to believe they are implementing evidence-based treatments when they are not. Furthermore, payers, families, and affected individuals are not readily able to evaluate the quality of addic tion treatment services. Can economical and effective training and certification programs be developed for evidence-based treatments? If consumers had information about treatment programs' use of and certifi cation in these treatments would they select programs certified in them? Would programs that were certifie d in evidence-based treatment s have better clinical outcomes? Based on treatment and training studies and on our own work with families and substance abusers, we hypothesize that the answer to all 3 questions is \"yes.\" Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Drug abuse and addiction affect all Pennsylvanians. While the Commonwealth ha s appropriately developed several Healthy People 2010 targets for reduced mortality from alcohol rela ted driving fatalities and from drug related deaths; as well as many targets for reduced morbidity (e.g. fewer young people binge drinking; initiating marijuana use, etc.) - an inspection of performance records on that website (2008) indicates that most of these markers have gotten worse instead of better since the goals were set in 2002! More than 50,000 Pennsylvania teens and young adults have died from alcohol and/ or drug related causes since 2002; and these already significant death rates are di sproportionately higher among African and Hispanic Pennsylvanians. By contrast, the five year wars in Iraq and Afga nistan - significant worries to all parents of young service men and women - have killed fewer than 500 Penns ylvanians (NY Times, June, 2008). And things are not gettng better nationally. The CDC figures shown that young ad ults between the ages of 15 and 24 dying from drug overdoses has more than doubled between 1999 and 2005; from 849 to 2,355. While mortality is the most devastating eff ect of alcohol and drug abuse - there are substantially more prevalent and more costly health and social effect s related to alcohol and drug abuse. Specifically, alcohol is implicated in over 60% of all emergency room and trauma center visits nationally (figures not av ailable for PA). It is suspected that drug use is also imp licated in a significant proportion of highway accidents and ER visits, but drug abuse is not as easily detected as alcohol nor as widely tested. Drug-related crimes account for over 65% of all incarcerations in st ate prisons in Pennsylvania; and over 50% of all re-in carcerations due to parole violations (personal accounts during G overnor's Council Meeting with State Attorney General - April, 2008). Fully seventy percent of all foster children nationally (figures not available from Pennsylvania) have been placed into foster care due to dr ug and alcohol related parental righ ts restrictions. Finally, the UN-WHO commissioned a study of all chronic illnesses and found that addiction to alcohol was the second most disabling condition and addiction to other drugs ranked fourth. Addictions are more disabling than ot her common chronic illnesses because of its greater prevalence, because it begins in early life (16 - 24); and because untreated addiction reduces productivity and qual ity of life for patients and for thos e around them. Studies indicate that the family members of substance abus ers utilize four times more health services (Langenbucher, 1994) and often have impaired daily functioning (Hudson et al., 2002). As recently as June 18, 2008 a New York Times ed itorial commented on the lack of addiction treatment - particularly for young people \"...fewer than 1 in 10 Amer ican adolescents who need drug treatment get it, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv ices Administration. This threatens their health and well being.\" Family members are often distressed about the adolescent or young adult's substance use long before the substance user realizes they have a problem. Family members are usually desp erate to find help to deal with the - 74 -young person and their problems, but little help is availa ble. Several evidence-based family treatments have been developed to help families encourage substance abusers to enter treatment, to stay in treatment, and to improve treatment outcomes (e.g., Fals-Stewart et al., 2005 ; Kirby et al., 1999; Meyers et al., 2002; O'Farrell et al., 2008). These types of treatments could have pos itive health impacts on adolescent and young substance abusers and their families. - 75 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) John J.

New viruses continue to emerge through rapid evolution or by facilitated m odes of transmission. In addition, new viruses are being discovered and link ed to human disease through improve d methods of detection, sequencing, and genomic analysis. Significant advancem ents are needed in the methods of virus detection, as well as a better understanding of viral infection, pathogenesis, and hos t-immunity. This information is necessary for the development of novel anti-viral pharmaceuticals and biolog icals, as well as traditional and non-traditional vaccine strategies. We propose a new Stat e Initiative to focus on the role of chronic and latent infections in human disease. This initiative will support (a) research focused on the id entification of novel or previously undetected virus agents in cancer and auto-immune disease settings; and (b) basic research aimed at understanding the mechanism of long-term viral persistence, latency, and reactiv ation, including th e role of life- related stress in the reactivation process. This initia tive will also promote a deeper understanding of the interaction of chronic viral infecti on on the immune system. This initiativ e will support efforts directed at the eradication of latent infection through either small molecule inhibitors or vaccine strategies. The overall goal of this will be to reduce the burden of viral infection on human health. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis B/C, human papillomavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus lead to a number of cancers that are highly elevated in ageing and immunocompromised populations. Evidence suggests that immune cell function is compromised in viral-associated cancers due to environmental cofactors, genetic predisposition, T-cell exhaustion, or viral-induced immune dysfunction. We propose a study of virus biology, immunological responses to viral infec tion, and tumor-microenvironment inter actions in the context of chronic infection. The hypotheses to be tested include (1) whethe r chronic exposure to vira l antigens induces exhaustion of viral-specific T- cells response, (2) whether virus encoded factors promot e immune tolerance through negative T-cell regulatory pathways including Tregs, HVEM, and PD1, and (3) whether environmental cofactors associated with local infl ammatory response alter imm une regulation of viral infected pre-cancerous cells. We also propose to develop anti viral strategies, including small mol ecule inhibitors of key viral and cellular regulatory pathways, and the development of an ti-viral therapeutic vaccines designed to overcome the negative regulatory arms of the immune response. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Chronic viral infections are known to cause several human cancers and are suspected of causing a variety of immunological disorders. Ne w methods of virus identifi cation, detection, and charac terization have enhanced - 76 -our ability to connect viruses to spec ific disease states. We hypothesize th at previously uncharacterized virus- associated diseases exist and will be identified using high-throughput sequencing methods. We propose to establish a network of clinical and basic researcher s who will use human tissue samples to identify viral markers associated with specific diseases using th e most sophisticated gene sequencing and genomic technologies. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Chronic viral infections are responsib le for a large number of cancers in humans, including cervical and head and neck cancers (HPV); liver cance r (Hepatitis B and C); lymphoma, and Hodgkins lymphoma (Epste in-Barr virus). In addition, chronic viral infections are suspected of causing immunological disorders such as rheumatoid ar thritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. As with many diseases, minorities are disproportionately a ffected by these diseases. Although a vaccine against HPV is now available, there are many women who were exposed to the virus prior to the development of the vaccine; and it will be many decades be fore HPV infection will be largely eliminated in the population. It is essential that we continue to search for therapies to treat HPV. Evidence suggests that normal immune cell function is co mpromised in viral-associat ed cancers due to genetic predisposition (e.g., X-linked lymphoproliferative di seases), environmental cofactors (e.g., chronic inflammation, alcohol, tobacco), T-cell exhaustion (e .g., HIV/AIDS), or viral-i nduced immune e.g., Castleman's disease). Elucidating the molecular mech anisms by which latent viral infections induce cancer and compromise the human immune system will lead to the development of new therapies, including small molecules (drugs) and immune-based therapies (vaccines and antibodies), for the treatment of chronic viral infections. The development of new therapies to eradicate latent viral infection in humans w ill serve the needs of all Pennsylvanians; these infections strike regardless of socio-economic status. - 77 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) James E.

The prevalence of cancer pain remains unacceptably high and, in many cases, is unremitting and unresponsive to treatment with existing pharmacological therapies. Breast, lung and pros tate cancers account for approximately 80% of all bone metastases and over half of all metastatic cancers will be associated with pain. Often, chemotherapeutic treatments produce neuropathic pain that persists once treatment has been discontinued. Chemotherapeutic-induced neuropathies are often limiting factors in cancer treatment and preclude a patient's ability to tolerate higher - and potentially more effective - doses. There is a need for systematic epidemiological studies incorporatimg the powerful tools of bioinformatics and health informatics to examine potential biomarkers and outcomes in patients with regard to the type of cancer pain, the type of treatment for the cancer, as well as the effectiveness and duration of treatmen t for the cancer-related pain. Additionally, there is a corresponding need for the development and integration of an imal models of cancer pain to parallel this clinical assessment to evaluate of emerging novel drug targets that compare current treat ments and evaluate the effectiveness of new drugs for cancer pain management . A combination of the powerful tools and expertise available within the Pennsylvania biomedical res earch community promises many novel opportunities for developing new treatment appr oaches to cancer pain. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses The emphasis of this recommendation is to pursue a bol d, comprehensive, and integrated approach to cancer pain management. The fundamental tenet behind this proposal is that there is a pressing need for multiple approaches within the biomedical community to be directed towards developing a better understanding of cancer pain syndromes, current treatment methods, a nd innovative model systems that will generate new hypotheses designed to discover and provi de better treatments for this significant unmet need. The research would focus on the following questions: i) how closel y aligned are the current animal models to the pathophysiology and progression of the disease in humans; ii) what animal models pr ovide the opportunity to evaluate current therapeutic approaches to different types of cancer pain (e .g., metastatic bone cancer, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain); iii) what are the new targets to be evaluated for the treatment of cancer pain; iv) is their a relationshi p between cancer prog ression and pain therapy; and v) can newer animal models be used to identify and evaluate new molecula r targets and compounds with a view to providing more effective treatments that are devoid of the side effects that occur with existing therapies? - 78 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses A major emphasis of this research would be to em ploy and align the powerful methods of clinical and epidemiological assessment of cancer pa in and treatment with the pharmacol ogical research efforts to better understand and treat cancer pain. Epid emiological studies will address the following questions: i) what are the current treatment approaches and outcomes assessments for different types of cancer pain, modalities and efficacy of treatment; ii) what are the major liabilitie s and shortcomings of current approaches to the management of cancer pain and where are there the grea test unmet needs; iii) are there valid and reliable biomarkers that can distinguish responders from n on-responders to various pain therapy approaches among different cancer populations; iv) can thes e methods predict side-effect profile s, the development of tolerance, and other characteristics that might also inform basic research studies a nd be useful in the identification of new targets; and v) can these biomarkers be used as translational tools to inform the use of animal models to better predict efficacy and side-effect profiles that woul d permit more rapid introduction and assessment of new therapeutics into the clinic? Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The Pennsylvania Department of Health has estimat ed that over 70,000 Pennsylvanians would be diagnosed with cancer in 2008, with over 28,000 patie nts expected to die in cancer-rela ted deaths (Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, Bureau of Health Statistics and Research, Department of Health). This report also indicates that between 1995 and 2005, the annual age-adjusted cancer mo rtality rates in Pennsylva nia were consistently higher than comparable U.S. mortality rates. It is estimated that on average, an estimated 97 male residents were expected to be diagnosed with invasive cancer each day during 2008; for females this figure is 96. The majority of these patients will have cancer-related pain that is directly related to the cancer or is associated with the chemotherapy used to treat the cancer . Pain is often most severe and intr actable at the end of life for these patients. A major objective of this proposed a pproach would consist of a system atic and careful epidemiological assessment of cancer pain within the St ate of Pennsylvania. The plan is to utilize the combined strengths of epidemiology, the tools of contemporary biomedical science, such as bioi nformatics and health informatics, together with the discipline of pharmacology to deve lop a thorough characterization of cancer pain within the State and to integrate this information into a basic research program. The research program will be based within the Department of Pharmacology, College of Medici ne at Drexel University and will be strongly aligned with the School of Public Health. This effort to address the impact of cance r pain on the health of Pennsylvanians will not only provide a rigorous evaluation of the current approaches to the treatment of cancer pain with a view towards delineation of optimal treatment strategies, but will also serve as a platform to identify newer, more effective treatments. A longer-term goa l of this proposal is to seek partnership with pharmaceutical companies in the Philadelphia area and the State to establish the infrastructure for drug discovery and development to address th is critical unmet need. These effo rts will yield new discoveries, new tools for clinical assessment and pres cribed therapies, as well as new i nvestigators and grant applications. Importantly, it will provide a detailed analysis of cancer pain and treatment approaches within the State of Pennsylvania designed ultimately to provide more eff ective cancer pain management for its citizens. Furthermore, this effort will potentia lly yield new partnerships and entrep reneurial opportunitie s that will help build the State's workforce as well as alleviate a serious debilitating impediment to comfort at a time when the major focus should be on cancer treatment not associated pain. - 79 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Dawn Bonnell DEGREE(S) PhD Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Professor, Director of the Nano/Bio Interface Center NAME OF ORGANIZATION University of Pennsylvania MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) University of Pennsylvania 3231 Walnut St Philadelphia, PA 19104 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 215 898 6231 E-MAIL ADDRESS: bonnell@lrsm.upenn.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Cancer & Nano-biotechnology Dete ction and Targeted Treatment In Pennsylvania alone over 70,000 cases of invasive cancer are diagnosed ea ch year and over 28,000 deaths are attributed to cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. The last 20 years has seen reduced mortality for cardiovascular disease, but simila r advances have not been made with cancer. The relatively poor outcomes of several cancers illustrate a need for improved methods of early detection and of targeted treatments. Both the National Institute of Health Roadmap and the Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer have pointed to the important role that nano-biotechnology can play. Nano-biotechnology holds the promise to advance cancer outcomes by enabling new strategies for examining basic mechanisms of protein and cellular function asso ciated with disease, and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. The stat e's universities and medical schools, in conjunction with nationally recognized nanotechnology centers position Pe nnsylvania as a leader with unique capabilities in this arena. As such, a multi-disciplinary collaborative program is required to address specific technical issues that limit implementation of these strategies to a broader range of cancers. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Biomolecular recognition is a process with two sided functio n. It is the basis of targeting and can be used for focused chemotherapy of cancer tumors and enhanced im aging for early detection. On the other hand it is the basis of sensing biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. Co mbining biomarker detection and microfluidic technology yields a device for early screen ing of oral cancer. What is the range of biomarkers that can be implemented in these strategies so that it can be applied to other cancers? Nanoparticles can be functionalized to exhibit molecular recognition of specific pr otein targets leading to targeted drug delivery and imaging detection strategies. What are the limits to and guiding principles for extending this approach to include a wider range of biomarkers? Protein interactions are prime disease indicators. New t ools allow protein motility to be quantified and protein mapping and characterization on a scale necessa ry to direct biomarker development. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses As the number of medical and non medical devices that incorporate structures incr eases, the potential for exposure to the population in general in creases. While some nanoparticles have been shown to be non toxic, for many cases the toxicological impact is not known. A r ecent study by the Wilson Center pointed to the need for much more research in this area. Critical research questions include: - 80 - Under what conditions do struct ures pose a toxicity hazard? Are the outcomes of exposure cancer related disease? Are manufacturers and/or clinicians at risk of exposure if current protocols are followed? What strategies for exposure pr evention should be implemented? Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses None Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians As noted above cancer is a health issue that impacts a large number in Pennsylvania and the same is true nationally. In many cases the relativel y poor outcomes in terms of surviv al would be mediated by improved methods of early detection a nd of targeted treatments. Outcomes of this research initiative will include: Enhanced understanding of the effect of disease on protein interactions A strategy for automated, rapid detection and molecular anal ysis of cancers in a miniaturized format suitable for use in the clinic and/or the operating room. A suite of functionalized nanostrucutures for molecular recognition at tumors. Understanding of toxicology of nanostructure. The application of these concepts to early detection and treatment will increase positive treatment outcomes and patient quality of life in Penns ylvania as well as the nation.. - 81 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Susmita Pati DEGREE(S) M.D., MPH Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Assistant Professor of Pediatrics NAME OF ORGANIZATION Children's Hospital of Philadelphia The University Of Pennsylvania MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 34th and Civic Center Boulevard Philadelphia, PA, 19104 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 267-426-5056 E-MAIL ADDRESS: pati@email.chop.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Improving Medicaid Retention: A Health Literacy Focus As noted in Healthy People 2010, creati ng a stable child health insurance system has been one of the most intractable challenges in American health policy that co ntributes to persistent chil d health disparities. Despite recent efforts, one-quarter to one-third of Medicaid -eligible children are disenrolled in any given year. Furthermore, studies have shown that two-thirds of the nation's uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP and, in 2006, one-third of uninsured children had been enrolled in one of these programs during the previous 12 months. Continuous insurance coverage is part icularly important for children because they require regular health supervision visits to attain optimal hea lth and developmental outcomes. In adults, studies have shown that low health literacy results in inadequate e ngagement in, and benefit from , health care advances and that low health literacy is likely a major contributor to adverse health outcomes. Gi ven that low health literacy affects more than 90 million American adults (~20% of the adult population), many children have caregivers with inadequate health literacy. As the wording used in many states' Me dicaid applications and informational documents score well above a fifth grade level on literacy tests, caregivers with lo w health literacy may not fully understand renewal instructions for these programs and this may lead to lapses in insurance coverage for their children. These lapses may lead to delays in obtaining care, such as immuni zations, health supervision visits, and developmental evaluations. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses None Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses None Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses H1. Parents/caregivers with low levels of health lit eracy will express greater difficulties navigating the Medicaid application and renewa l process than those with high levels of health literacy. H2. Parents/caregivers with low levels of health literacy will have children with lower Medicaid retention rates than those with high leve ls of health literacy. H3. Parents/caregivers from racial/ethni c minorities will have children with lower Medicaid retention rates than those from other groups. - 82 -Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians As of May 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of P ublic Welfare reported approximately 933,000 Medicaid eligible children living in the state of Pennsylvania. There is clear eviden ce that participation in specific public programs, such as Medicaid, leads to positive child health outcomes. Many reports have documented that uninsured children are more likely to have adverse heal th outcomes, such as delayed immunizations, inadequate health care utilizati on, and increased risk of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions. Recently, attention has been focused on the consequences of disc ontinuous coverage for children and there is evidence that gaps in coverage lead to delays in medical care for children, including preventive visits, and unfilled prescriptions. Dr. Pati's ongoing review of Medicaid retention rates among children in all 50 states found that 27.8% of children receiving Medicaid in Pennsylvania experienced at least one gap in coverage in the two year period from 2001-2002. Based on these results, we propose focusing research on impr oving Medicaid retention through literacy-relat ed interventions. We propose research focused on literacy because prior studies have identified lite racy-related barriers as noteworthy contributors to low child re tention rates in Medicaid. Despite th e body of literature discussing this correlation and the existence of health literacy guidelines for Medicaid applications in 45 states, to our knowledge, no research has been done to assess the impact of h ealth literacy focused in terventions designed to improve retention in Medicaid. Acco rding to a survey administered by Health Literacy Innovations, Pennsylvania has a 4th grade reading level guideline fo r state Medicaid information. However, the current Medicaid application scores well above the 4th grade reading level on available literacy tests. This is particularly relevant in light of Dr. Pati's recent study involving 717 primar ily African-American single mothers living in medically underserved areas of Philadelphia which found that ~20% of these mothers had inadequate or marginal health literacy as meas ured by administration of the S-TOFHLA. Several overriding trends re garding participant ch aracteristics and persistent unde r-enrollment in public health insurance programs have been documented in numerous re ports. These reports have c onsistently demonstrated that low-income, racial and ethnic minorities, young and single mothers, and mothers who have not completed high school are more likely to partic ipate in these programs than high-in come, white, older, married mothers who completed high school. Similar ch aracteristics have been identified in relation to patte rns of retention. However, the likelihood of dropping out of Medicaid whil e remaining eligible for coverage has proven more difficult to predict. A review of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (S IPP) concluded that white children, children from two-parent families, childre n in families with incomes between 100-200% of poverty and children with a full-time working parent were proportionally more highly re presented among the population of eligible uninsured children than in the populati on covered by Medicaid. Though under-enrollment is difficult to estimate, reports estimate that, nationally, approxima tely 24%-45% of uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid and that 65-83% of Medicaid-eligible child ren participate. Other reports have documented that approximately one-quarter to one-third of Medicaid-eligible children are disenrolled in any given year. The findings from this research may provide critical data for the implementation of sustainable interventions to improve child Medicaid retention and, ultimately, re duce disparities in child health outcomes for the approximately 25% of Pennsylvania' s children who r eceive Medicaid. - 83 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) (John) Chris Feudtner DEGREE(S) MD PhD MPH Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Director of Research, Pedi atric Advanced Care Team NAME OF ORGANIZATION The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) CHOP North - Room 1523 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia 34th and Civic Center Blvd Philadelphia, PA 19104 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 267-426-5032 E-MAIL ADDRESS: feudtner@email.chop.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Pediatric Advanced, Palliative, and Hospice Care Each year in Pennsylvania, approxim ately 2000 infants and children die. While approximately half of these children die from acute or preventa ble conditions, the other half live w ith life-threatening complex chronic conditions for months or years before dying. While the parents and siblings of a ll of these children could benefit from bereavement services, th ose children in the second group may especially benefit from pediatric advanced care, including palliative and hospice care. As recently detailed in a PA taskforce report (sponsored by the Department of Public Welfare; www.dpw.sta te.pa.us/About/Secretary/PPHC/), these children and families face daunting challenges and vast unmet needs, ranging from support regarding medical decisionmaking through to pharmacological management of pain and symptoms. Pe diatric advanced care for children with life-threatening comp lex chronic conditions, including pal liative and hospice care, aims to improve quality of life for the child and help the family (including siblings) with the challenges they confront. As medical technology and advancements in health care enable more infants and children to survive what previously would have been quickly fatal conditions, the priority of mee ting the needs of these children and their family steadily mounts, as does the need to assure access to high qu ality pediatric advanced care to all children, including those from different cultural backgrounds and with different languages. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. What basic biologic difference acc ount for differences among patients with regard to opioid effects and side effects? Patients exhibit di fferent responses to opioid analgesics, with some patients having symptomatic relief on a dose that to another patient brings no relief, and to another comparable patient is a dose large enough to induce stupor. Our hypothesis is that th is variation in response to opioids (and the associ ated opioid-related side effects) can be explained by 2 prim ary forms of genetic variation, spec ifically splice va rient mu-opioid receptors or to single nucleotide gene tic polymorphisms. Knowledge regarding the existance and size of this effect would enable us to ta ilor analgesic therapy to indi vidual patients more effectively. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses 1. How to best support medical decisionmaking by parent s on behalf of an infant or child with a life- threatening complex chronic condition? The standard appr oach to date has emphasize d the cognitive aspects of decisionmaking, specifically in terms of informed consent regarding th e risks and benefits of proposed medical interventions. We hypothesize, base d on preliminary data from a pros pective cohort study, that parental emotion (positive and negative affect) are strong determ inants of subsequent medical decisions, above and beyond the impact of clinical risk/benefit information. Kn owledge regarding the impact of emotions on medical decisionmaking would enable better forms of decision support to be developed. - 84 -2. What are the best modes of support for siblings of pediatric patients living w ith life-threatening complex chronic conditions? We hypothesize th at a \"strengths-based\" approach to helping siblings adapt to the challenges that they confront will result in lower levels of pscyho-social-educationa l distress. Knowledge of best practices in this realm would help parent s and teachers to better help these siblings. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. What are the impacts, medically and financially, of pediatric pallia tive and hospice care on children with life-threatening complex chronic conditions and their fa milies? We hypothesize that children receiving these services live as long as matched patie nts (ie, with similar conditions and stages of illness) who do not, and experience less suffering and higher sa tisfaction with care, at reduced or comparable costs. Knowledge regarding these impacts would improve counseling provide d to individual families as well as planning for the health care system and payers in terms of funding levels of various services. 2. What is the most effective method to teach health ca re providers to delivery \"bad news\" to parents and to partner with parents in th e care of their children with life-threa tening complex chronic conditions? We hypothesize that an approach built around principles of \"collaborativ e communication\" and \"partnering leadership\" will results in greater statisfaction of parent s (and of health care providers as well). Knowledge regarding the most effective techniqu es would improve the education and training of healthcare professionals and benefit children and parent s throughout the Commonwealth. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians As mentioned above, 2000 pediatric patie nts die each year in Pennsylvania; countless more live on with life- threating conditions (accurate populatio n-level statistics regarding the prevalence of these conditions is lacking). For these infants and children, and their families, inadequate palliative and hospice care has at least 7 levels of negative repercussions (as was documented time and again in the taskforc e report cited above): 1. Parents often face some of the most challenging decisions that one co uld ever imagine alone, without adequate support to think through what mode of care is in a child's best interest, and to sort out one's feelings about what is the best way to be a good parent for a child. Parents are often told 'bad news' about their children's diagnoses or prognoses in ways that are insensitive and hurtful. Pare nts too often feel that they must navigate through the medical system on their own, coordinating care as best they can, and advocating for the care of their child and not just the treatment of a disease. 2. Children often do not receive optimal managent for, and relief from, pain and other terrible symptoms (data from studies of children with cancer suggest that more than 2/3rd of patients were in excessive amounts of pain duri ng the last week of thei r lives, along with a host of other symptoms). 3. Because decisionmaking is not adequately supported, some children receive extreme forms of medical intervention that can cause harm and suffering when unsuc cessful. 4. The forementioned problems all result in depriving children and families from experiencing a higher qu alitive of life for the weeks, months, or even years that they may live with the life-threatening condition (this point is worth underscoring: the average life- expectancy of pediatric patie nts who received a palliative care consulta tion in a study of 6 pediatric palliative care programs was in excess of a year). 5. Many families ar e tasked with providing home care that entail a vast amount of work, on a ceaseless 24/7/365 schedule, resulting in a parent devoting herself/himself entirely to the care of the child, leaving the employed workforce, and cr eating further financial hardships for the family, which likely also has to content with medical bills and out-of-poc ket healthcare expenses. 6. Meanwhile, the siblings of these ill children (and more than half of the children receiving palliative care do ha ve sisters or brothers) are often relegated to the status of an afterthought, as all the attention and time of the parents are poured into the care of the ill child, and no systematic attempt is made to address the psychological need s of the sibling. 7. At the same time as children and families are suffering for want of a better system of care, healthcare providers (the vast majority of whom want to do the right thi ng for these children) are also suffering, unsure of how to bring comfort to the child or sound and supportive counsel to the parents (an uncertainty that has been well documented among pediatricians, nurses, and others involved in the care of children repeatedly), in need of better education and wider disseminati on of best clinical practices regard ing the care of children with life- threatening complex chronic conditions and their families. - 85 - Pediatric advanced, palliative, and ho spice care are not panaceas that will completely solve all of the above- mentioned problems, but they are necessa ry ingredients for any clinically e ffective and ethically sound solution. Two other attributes of the situation also need mention: First, we know from what limited research has been conducted regarding disparities in pedi atric palliative care that cultural differences and language barriers are formidable challenges to providing outstanding care for children with life-threatening conditions. Second, while we do not want clinical deci sion-making for these children to be unduly influenced by financial considerations, we acknowledge the not only the deleteri ous repercussions on the families (as noted above), but also the economic impact on the Commo nwealth of parents' who must leav e the workforce, and on the system of public health insurance that unde rwrites much of the medical care. - 86 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Robert F.

These conditions cause a loss of proper activation of the breathing muscles and reduce gas exchange. Treatment of ten includes mechanical ven tilation, which causes an array of problems including pulmonary infections (e.g., pne umonia), and for this reason clinicians endeavor to wean patients off artificial ventilato rs. We propose to alleviate respir atory insufficiencies directly by developing a closed-loop (feedback controlled) system that will drive diaphragmatic muscle contraction via electrical stimulation of the phrenic ne rves. In our initial construct, phren ic nerve stimulation parameters will be modified on-the-fly by blood oxyge nation (measured transdermally), a nd eventually by pulmonary stretch receptor activity measured in the cervi cal vagus nerve. The device will be developed via a combination of basic science research and clinical application across four ma jor biomedical institutions in Philadelphia, each with significant research and clinical invest ment in this area, where patient po pulations are readily available, and where an existing, rudimentary phrenic pacing device is in use. By leveraging th e combined expertise of biomedical scientists/engineers, physi cians and rehabilitation sp ecialists, our goal is to quantifiably reduce both patient suffering and health care costs via re-train ing the key neuromuscular components of breathing. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Respiratory rhythm is produced primar ily in the brain stem, which activates motor neuron pools in stereotypical patters. Respiratory arrhythmias/cessa tion (e.g., central apnea) or weakened motor drive (e.g., in SIDS, ALS, or from stroke or spinal cord injury) inevitably produce ve ntilatory insufficiencies, and hence the need for assist devices such as artificial positive-pressure ventilator s. Recently, direct activation of the diaphragm via electrical pacing of the phrenic nerve has demonstrated th at ventilatory insufficiencies can be markedly reduced without the use of artificial ventilat ion. However, existing phrenic pacemakers have no feedback control; the parameters are set and cannot respond to alterations in metabolic demand (e.g., sleep vs. waking, quiet rest vs. physical exertion). Thus, we ask, \"Can an integrated phrenic stimulator that in cludes feedback control be created and control breathi ng in animals with diminished respirator y function?\" Respiratory neuroengineers and neurophysiologists at Drexel University College of Medicine (Drs. Rogers, Rybak, Nissanov, Murray, Fischer) will develop a new generation of phrenic pacemaker s in conjunction with a lo cal manufacturer, and test this system in animals. - 87 -Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Upon successful fabrication of a feedback-controlled phren ic stimulator, patient populat ions will be selected at Shriners Hospital for Children (Drs. Be tz, Selzer), and at Thomas Jeffer son University Hospital (Drs. Harrop, Sharan). Patients will be implanted with phrenic stim ulator systems equipped with feedback control modules. Rehabilitation progress will be evaluate d via standard physical (e.g., maximum inspiratory pressure, forced vital capacity) and physiological measures (e.g., nocturnal oxymet ry, arterial blood gases), providing an answer to the central question, \"Do patients with feedback-contro lled pacemakers recover more completely and rapidly than those with standard phren ic stimulators and than those with no stimul ators?\" In two separate clinical trials, outcomes from multiple subgroups based on underlying cause s of respiratory insufficiency including spinal cord injury, stroke, central apnea, an d general autonomic dsyfunction, will be evaluated in order to identify the groups most responsive to phrenic stimulation. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Analyses of cost savings will be performed by administra tors at the Shriner's and TJU health care systems. Recovery time and degree, need for a dditional therapies, and health care provider man-hours will be quantified in order to evaluate the hypothesis that \"phrenic stimulati on with feedback control reduces the burden of healthcare costs to the Commonwealth of Pennsylva nia,\" in addition to imp roving health outcomes. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians POPULATION: Respiratory insufficiencies or failures ar e caused by a multitude of diseases, injuries, and conditions, and therefore affect a dive rse array of Pennsylvanians, and some more than others. For example, African-Americans are several times more likely to have traumatic spinal cord injuries than whites. The elderly, who represent a substantial fr action of Pennsylvanians, are more su sceptible to stroke and post-polio syndrome. Neonates experience SIDS, central apnea, and respiratory dist ress syndrome, and among them poor and minority babies are affected at higher rates than other classes and races. A study conducted in 2001 reported that 18 of every 1,000 live births required mechan ical ventilation, and the in cidence was higher in boys than girls (20 vs. 15.6) and in African-Americans (29), with a fatality rate of 11.1% (higher in minority groups). Many spinal cord injured (SCI) patients experience resp iratory insufficiencies. Ve ntilator-related diseases, specifically pneumonia, cause 19% of the deaths within the first year of inju ry, and 13% of those after the first year. In addition, SCI patient s are 10 times more likely to experience sleep apnea than individuals without SCI. 67% of acute SCI patients experience respiratory complications (atelect asis 36%, pneumonia 31%, respiratory failure 22.6%), with an increased prevalence with age, level of injury, an d completeness of injury. COSTS: In neonates, the mean hospital stay and costs were 31.1 days and $51,000 (2001 figures) for those requiring mechanical ventilation. In the US in 2001, there were 8500 deaths (of 80,000 hospitalizations), with total hospital costs of $4. 4 billion, and ventilator use in neonates is on ly approximately one-fifth that of adults. Other studies found that 55% of mechanical ventilation-dependent patien ts experience pulmonary complications requiring 22 days of hospitalization per year, with a 3-ye ar mortality rate of 37%. First year expenses for paraplegics and quadriplegics were $152,000 and $417,000, wh ile average costs for paraplegics and quadriplegics were $428,000 and $1.35 million, respectively (2002). 52% of SCI indivi duals were covered by private insurance, and 63% of them were unemployed. APPROACH: Since the diaphragm produ ces 65% of vital capacity (air movement), its activation has the largest impact on restoration of nor mal breathing. Electrical activati on of the phrenic nerves causes diaphragmatic contractions. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHS: Drexel University College of Medicine has one of the premier groups of spinal cord injury research and the only center of its kind in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This group, centered in the Department of Neur obiology and Anatomy, is in a unique position to provide the leadership required in developing an inter-disciplinary and inter-in stitutional approach that combines the needed basic respiratory neuroscience and clinical expertise required for phrenic stimulat or development. The members of this group have acquired a broad expertise from 20 years of research that includes the use of cell - 88 -transplantation, gene therapy, pharmaco logical interventions, physiological an alysis and behavioral assessment of functional recovery. The Spinal Cord Center has core facilities, primary and affiliated faculty members and a research portfolio of over $10 million. In addition, Drex el University already has a joint Neuroengineering program between the School of Biomedical Engineering and the College of Medicine , which is directed at collaborative research projects and educational programs at both schools. Shriners Hospital has recently made significant investment in clini cal research, and Dr. Selzer is leading an effort to treat SCI, and other mechanical ventilation-dependent, children. Thomas Jefferson Univer sity is the loca tion of one of only 16 Spinal Cord Injury Centers in the United States, as designated by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. In addition, a manufacturer of phrenic stimulators (Synapse Bi omedical, Inc.) operates centers in both TJU and Shriners. - 89 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Katrina Armstrong DEGREE(S) MD, MS Ms. Mr. Dr. POSITION TITLE Associate Professor of Medici ne, Director, Division of General Internal Medicine NAME OF ORGANIZATION University of Pennsylvania MAILING ADDRESS (Street, City, State, Zip Code) 1220 Blockley Hall 423 Guardian Drive Philadelphia PA 19104 TELEPHONE (Area code, number and extension) 215-898-0957 E-MAIL ADDRESS: karmstro@mail.med.upenn.edu Health Research Priority Title and Description Translation of genomics into clinical practice Advances in genomics have the poten tial to improve the delivery of heal th care by targeting interventions to individuals who will receive the greatest benefit and expe rience the lowest risk of adverse events. The promise of this approach, often termed pe rsonalized medicine, for improving heal th outcomes is widely recognized. Perhaps less well recognized is that more effective targe ting of interventions will also reduce health care costs, a critically important goal for the US economy today. Because of this promis e, the nation has invested billions of dollars in the sequencin g of the human genome and the identification of genetic markers for disease and disease outcomes. However, this investment is currently at risk because of a lack of information about how to translate these discoveries into clinical prac tice. The number of potential tests is overwhelming but knowledge about how to use these tests is almost non-exis tent. Without evidence to guide the use of these tests, genomics risks becoming another example of a new t echnology that increases health care co sts without improving the health of the US population. We propose to develop a multidisciplinar y initiative to generate the evidence needed to ensure the effective translation of genomic tests into improvements in disease prevention and treatment. This initiative will focus on the use of genomics in cancer because of the significant can cer burden in Pennsylvanians and the potential for genomics to transform cancer preven tion, diagnosis and treatment in the immediate future. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses This initiative builds upon basic scie nce discoveries in genomics to answer reseach questions about how these discoveries should be used in clini cal practice to improve health outcome s and increase health care value. However, the results of these studies will also increase understanding of the mechanisms linking genetic markers to outcomes, thereby informing the basic biomedi cal research in cancer. For example, one of the areas of investigation is the use of EG FR/KRAS testing to determine trea tment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This testing has the potent ial to target treatment and improve outcomes in a disease where 5 year survival is currently under 20%. Studying the use of personalized therapy in NSCLC will provide important evidence about how to improve outcomes in this disease t oday but will also provide insight into the mechanisms by which EGFR and KRAS influence cancer initiation and progression, ther eby supporting the development of new therapies that may improve disease outcomes in the future. Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses The initiative will answer important clinical questions about the use of personalized and genomic strategies to improve outcomes of cancer prevention, treatment and survi vorship. These questions fall into three main areas: (1) whether pharmacogenetic testing can improve treatment effectiveness and reduce treatment related side effects; (2) whether genomic risk panels (i.e. SNPs) can be used to improve the accuracy of cancer screening to - 90 -reduce the risk of false positive and false negative tests; (3) whether tests of somatic genetic changes in tumors can be used to tailor cancer treatment to improve trea tment effectiveness and reduce treatment related side effects; and (4) whether genetic te sts for cancer susceptibility can im prove adherence to cancer prevention behaviors and interventions among high risk individuals . For each of these areas , there are novel genomic strategies that need to be tested in multiple different cancer types, including breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate and leukemia. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses This initiative will also a ddress important health services research questions about the cost-effectiveness of personalized and genomic strategies. These questions includ e the relative value of different strategies (i.e. how much benefit is achieved at what cost) and whether the use of personalized and genomic strategies save health care dollars by reducing util ization of unnecessary and often highl y expensive therap ies (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy in a patient who has an extremely low risk of recurrence). Given th e current economic climate and the economic burden created by risi ng health care costs, u nderstanding the value of these new technologies and how they impact the cost of pr evention and treatment is necessary to inform effective health policy in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, by provid ing evidence to support th e development of policy in these areas, these research questions help to reduce disparities in ac cess created by uneven insura nce coverage policies or inadequate investment in the delivery systems for high valu e interventions. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians The potential impact of genomics on cancer pr evention, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship in Pennsylvanians is staggering. In 2006, 73,895 Pennsylvanian s were diagnosed with invasive cancer and 28,955 died from their disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Pennsylvanians. The burden of cancer is particularly great among mi nority populations with African-Ameri can men being 37% more likely to die from cancer than white men and African-Ame rican women 17% more likely than white women. Furthermore, the adverse impact of cancer treatment is enormous, both fo r the long-term health consequences for cancer survivors and the costs for the population as a wh ole. The cost of cancer care in the US is estimated to be 219 billion dollars a year. It is difficult to overestimate the potential impact of improved strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of can cer on the health of Pennsylvanians. While new genomic approaches to cancer are continually being deve loped in the labor atory, there are currently many examples that already have the potent ial to dramatically impact the burden of cancer in Pennsylvania. For each of these examples, investigators at the University of Pennsylvania and other institutions in Pennsylvania are poised to conduct the clinical studies necessary to move these discoveries into clinical practice. These include: (1) Pharmacogenetic tailoring of nicotine addiction treatment: Cigarette smoking causes 80-90% of all lung cancer deaths, and increases the risk of several other cancers. Current approaches to nicotine addiction treatment are limited because of variab ility in response to the FDA approve d therapies (nicotine replacement, buproprion and varenicline), side effects and high rates of relapse. Use of information about individual variation in nicotine metabolism (based upon the nicotine metabolism ratio) to optimize therapy ma y result in greater rates of sustained abstinence with fe wer side-effects and lower costs. (2) Genetic susceptibilty and breast cancer screening a nd prevention: Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women in Pennsylvani a with 9,739 new cases in 2006. Breas t cancer risk assessment has the potential to decrease morbidity a nd mortality from breast cancer thr ough improved prevention and screening strategies but current risk predicti on models are inadequate for use in clinical practice. Genome wide association studies have identified multiple genetic mark ers that may dramatically improve risk prediction and screening and prevention decisions. Te sts using these markers are currently available and studies are needed to determine their effectiveness in breast cancer risk stratification. (3) Personalized treatment for NSCLC: In 2009, 45% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases will be advanced stage NSCLC. Standard tr eatment involves empiric, relativel y toxic therapy given with little distinction between histologic subt ypes and virtually no input based on molecular typing. However, - 91 -developments in cancer genomics over the last five year s suggest that both patholog ic analysis and molecular typing (particularly EGFR and KRAS mutaiton testing) may be important in determining appropriate therapy for patients with NSCLC and improving disease outcomes and reducing toxicity. (4) Genetic testing in melanoma families: Adherence to sun protection behaviors remains one of the major challenges in cancer control, particularly for individuals with a personal or familial history of melanoma. The impact of genetic testing for p16 mutations on adherence is prom ising but currently unknown. While the potential benefit of th ese genomic approaches to the health of Pennsylvanians is substantial, the development of evidence to support the tr anslation into clinical pr actice is particularly important to ensure that these approaches are able to benefit all segments of the population, including tr aditionally disadvantaged groups. Disparities in the use of heal th care advances are an important problem and evidence based guidelines for these advances are an important st ep to addressing these disparities. - 92 -Contact Information PERSON SUBMITTING TESTIMONY NAME (First Name MI Last Name) Flordeliza S.

Strides in our understanding of the molecular foundations of disease have created the pote ntial to diagnose diseases earlier and more precisely than heretofore possible. This er a has also spawned novel treatme nts that target specific molecular aspects of disease and tailo r therapy to individual patient pheno type. Advanced molecular imaging will be required to translate such opp ortunities into improved patient health. Molecular imaging is the science and practice of sensing specific molecula r targets, biological processes, or cell types in living humans, distinct from traditional anatomic or functional imaging modes in current clinical use. Molecular imaging sits at the confluence of multiple disciplines, including chemis try, biology, physiology, engine ering, imaging, medicine, epidemiology, and public health, with far reaching applic ations in medical diagnosis , risk stratification, and drug discovery, particularly within cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and oncology. The development of new drug, gene, or cellular therapeutics will ultimately be c onstrained by paucity of non-in vasive imaging strategies to detect and monitor molecular-biologi cal effects of such treatments. It is proposed that a health research priority be articulated to promote the multidisciplinar y efforts required to clinically implement molecular imaging; this initiative will support critical yet unmet needs in the tran slation of our post-genomic insights into human disease into improved patient outcome. Biomedical Research Questions and Hypotheses Imaging modalities requiring research and development for molecular im aging include single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tom ography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US), which each have unique advantages for molecular imaging across a spectrum of organ systems. Research effort will be required to identi fy suitable targets and to develop imaging agents and hardware platforms. A partial lis t of topics that can be addresse d includes: CARDIOVASCULAR: (1) Identification of atherosclerotic plaques at greatest risk for rupture and causing in farction or stroke based on molecular characterization of plaque composition (e.g. PET imaging of plaque metabolism; MRI of plaque macrophages; US imaging of adhesion molecules); (2) Detecti on of acute thrombosis, angiogenesis, or an ischemic cause to chest pain by imaging molecular mark ers unique to these conditions ; (3) In vivo tracking of therapeutically deliver ed cells (e.g. stem cells). CANCER: (1) Identification of tumors by imaging unique molecular markers (e.g. breast cancer sc reening with molecular US; (2) Assessment of malignant potential. DIABETES: Quantification of beta cell mass (pre-diabetes). Clinical Research Questi ons and Hypotheses Molecular imaging should be implemented in patient populati ons as part of research or clinical trials along the spectrum of disease states listed above, as well as others (e.g. Alzheimer's di sease). A partial list includes: (1) - 93 -Longitudinal studies comparing molecular imaging endpoi nts vs. standard risk factors to predict future outcomes (e.g. conventional Framingham risk score vs. P ET or MRI molecular imaging of plaques; endothelial function measurement molecular imag ing; beta cell mass quantification vs. serial glucose measurements in long term follow up of diabetes); (2) Diagnosis of cardiac chest pain in the emergency department by imaging molecules indicative of \"isc hemic memory;\" (3) Evaluation of nove l pharmaceuticals in clinical trials using intermediate molecular endpo ints as surrogates for long term clinical endpoints (e.g. nanoparticle enhanced MRI, FDG-PET); (4) Evaluation of the effects of mental stress or mental health on molecular markers of endothelial dysfunction (e.g. adhesion molecules) or plaque inflammation, to establish a mechanistic connection between mental health a nd cardiovascular disease. Health Services Research Questions and Hypotheses Multimodality molecular imaging (i.e. combination of above modalities, e.g. PET, SPECT, etc.) can be implemented to improve screening for disease and m onitoring treatment. Population screening can be performed, for example, in asymptomatic subjects with st andard coronary risk factors, and those with \"rupture prone plaque\" based on molecular imaging criteria would undergo aggr essive lifestyle and/or medical interventions vs. \"standard of care.\" In such studies, molecular surroga te intermediate endpoints (e.g. plaque inflammation) could be measured and used as timely feedback on treatment efficacy, in addition to conventional endpoints. Similar studies can be performed in obese pa tients: those with early \"i mpending\" diabetes based on imaging of beta cell mass could be more aggressively ma naged. Studies to evaluate risk/benefit ratios and cost effectiveness are required, with an emphasis on the fi nancial and health conse quences ensuing from the prevention of disease through application of molecula r imaging, as well as the impact of image-guided therapies. For modalities that can be easily exported (e.g. US), research should pilot technology transfer to outpatient settings to further extend the capabilities to the community. Impact on Health of Pennsylvanians Successful realization of mo lecular imaging strategies can play a tr ansformative role in health outcomes, particularly in the areas of cardiovascular disease, diab etes, and cancer. The power of imaging strategies that are based on an interrogation of mole cular and cellular changes that accompany disease is that they can allow early diagnosis by identifying otherwise \"invisible\" markers that predate the clinical manifestations of illness. Furthermore, molecular imaging can enab le novel therapeutics targeted at the molecular basis of the disease. In this regard, molecular imaging can provide meaningf ul surrogate endpoints for non-invasively measuring treatment efficacy more rapidly than traditional clinical outcomes, which can take years to detect. Treatments that fail to demonstrate an early effect on the molecular level can be triaged out, spar ing the health and financial burdens of therapies that may ultimately prove to be ine ffective years later using trad itional clinical endpoints. Given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in Pennsylvania, accounting for 28% of deaths in the state in 2005, the impact of mature clinical molecular imaging programs on the health of Pennsylvania residents could be particularly significant. Also, dispar ities in the morbidity and mortality from stroke and heart disease exist along racial lines; while the etiology for these disparities is complex, their existence invites an examination of fundamental differen ces in mechanisms of disease which might be detected using molecular imaging approaches. The identification of patients at high risk fo r plaque rupture based on a molecular characterization of pla que composition can lead to pre-em ptive mechanical or pharmacologic interventions that should reduce morbidity and mortality from stroke and acute co ronary syndromes and their sequelae of congestive heart failure. The accurate diagnosis of cardiac ches t pain in the emergency department using molecular imaging could spare thousands of patie nts from unnecessary hospitalization and save health dollars spent on admissions for low risk non-cardiac pain, wh ile selecting patients in tr ue need of hospitalization for acute cardiac care. Molecular imaging will enable re generative cell therapies for heart disease by allowing in vivo tracking of the fate of de livered cells, ultimately improving out comes in heart failure. Molecular imaging will benefit cancer patients as well: The annual age adjusted incidence rate s for all cancers diagnosed between 1998-2005 show that Pennsylvani a had higher rates than the rest of the United States, and annual age- - 94 -adjusted cancer mortality rates were c onsistently higher in Pennsylvania than in the rest of the country. There were 75,130 new cases of cancer diagnosed in Pennsyl vania in 2007. The early diagnosis of cancer and evaluation of response to treatments st and to benefit from molecular imagi ng and quantification of cell-specific markers of malignancy. As such, given the burden of cancer to Pennsylvania, molecular imaging may exert a significant mitigating effect on the toll of cancer in terms of mortality, morbidity, health dollars, and loss of work productivity. The impact of molecular imaging on diabet es could also be significant: In 2007, the rate of diagnosis of diabetes among Pennsyl vanians was 7.8%, compared to the Healthy People 2010 national goal of 2.5%. Only 34% of Pennsylvania's population is at \"h ealthy weight,\" implying a major burden of future metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Serial molecular im aging of pancreatic beta islet cell mass would have tremendous value in risk stratifying patients and hence ta rgeting interventions. To the extent that molecular imaging may provide a more sensitive index of responses to new treatments than tr aditional clinical endpoints, it can be used to refine therapies more quickly, and serve as a form of feedback for the effect of biobehavioral interventions in diabetes management. In sum, the unique \"l ens\" provided by noninvasive imaging on a molecular scale, combined with the scope of organ sy stems amenable to this le vel of interrogation, position molecular imaging strategies to have a significant im pact on the health outcomes of Pennsylvania "}
