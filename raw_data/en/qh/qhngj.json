A. Satyanarayan Naidu, PhD Peter Pressman, MD, PhD Roger A. Clemens, DrPH In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, global medical re- search has undertaken a relentless quest to unravel the vir- ulence mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, the innate barriers of host defense, the surveillance of progress toward herd im-munity, and the attempts to quickly identify and evaluate novel or alternative coronavirus interventions. This nutri- tion update highlights the important role of dietary factorsin achieving optimum health and also explores possible approaches to augmenting innate host defenses. The potential anti-coronavirus benefits of micronutrientsand macronutrients (ie, minerals, vitamins, lipids, pro-teins and polyphenols) to combat COVID-19 infection t h r o u g hi n h i b i t i o no fv i r a lt a r g e t so nh u m a nc e l ls u r f a c e (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) for docking, entry,and replication and, furthermore, to regulate immune and inflammatory responses (cytokine storm), oxidative stress (redox imbalance), and normal signaling pathways tothe reduce health risks among vulnerable populations (ie, elderly) with metabolic disorders (ie, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma) and recov-ery of patients to normal health are discussed. Nutr Today. 2021;00(1):00 -00 Since the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in November 2019 in Wuhan, China,more than 122 000 peer-reviewed scientific articles have been published about this viral pandemic. Approximately5500 clinical trials have been initiated, and numerouspharmacological agents and an array of antivirals, cortico- steroids, or their combinations have been administered topatients worldwide. However, to date, no specific or defin-itively efficacious antiviral intervention is available forCOVID-19. Therefore, a multidimensional strategy is at thistime the most desirable to achieve successful global health outcomes. According to a recent report, consumer interests in di- etary supplements for immune support and overall healthhave skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dietand nutrition are fundamental for an effective host defense,whereas malnutrition could seriously compromise immunecompetence. Global experience with COVID-19 outbreaksemphasizes the significance of rapid diagnosis of malnutri- tion and immediate implementation of calorie/protein- balanced nutrition care. These protocols are recommended by several health agencies to achieve therapeutic successin lowering mortality rates in severe COVID-19 cases. 1 This review updates the impact of nutritional status on the overall host defense and virulence of COVID-19. Con-sidering the epidemiological differences in coronavirus(CoV) transmission and varied symptomatic outcomes of infected individuals, we arrange the nutritional interven- tions into 3 categories: (i) immune nutrition, (ii) redox nu-trition, and (iii) nutrient-related disruption of viral entryand replication. A few bioactives, naturally present in food,for which there is some (although not yet conclusive) evi-dence of possible activity in each category, are discussed.Figure presents these categories. It is important to note that the anti-CoV effects of sev- eral micronutrients and bioactive compounds are pre- liminary. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are needed tounravel their safety, efficacy, and modes of action. Pharma-cokinetic data should establish the ADME (absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profiles of thesecompounds. Furthermore, the bioavailability, dosage, tol-erance, and drug interactions (if any) of these nutrientsshould be established. Once efficacy data are available, it is possible that after regulatory evaluation of a bioactive compound or \"nutraceutical, \"a product may qualify as potential prophylactic or adjuvant therapy (likely a drugclassification in the United States) for the control andA Satyanarayan Naidu, PhD, is the Director of N-terminus Research Lab- oratory in Yorba Linda, California and a fellow of the Royal Society forMedicine and the Linnean Society of London, Nterminus.

IMMUNE NUTRITION A healthy immune response depends on adequate dietand nutrition. For example, sufficient protein intake sup-ports optimal antibody production, vitamin D activatesantibody-secreting cells, and vitamin A stimulates T-cellproliferation. A wealth of clinical data show that vitamins(ie, A, B 6,B12,C ,D ,E ,a n df o l a t e ) ,t r a c ee l e m e n t s( i e ,z i n c , iron, selenium, magnesium, and copper), and omega-3 fattyacids (ie, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) play a complementary role to enhance immune function. Micronutrients are vital for immunomodulation, and theirdeficiency could increase susce ptibility to viral infections. Individuals at high risk for spec ific nutrient deficiencies are likely to benefit from dietary supplements if they are trulydeficient; if they are not deficient (as assessed with selectedbiomarkers), then there may be little benefit by providingmore of the nutrient or purported bioactive. In summary, individual dietary and nutritional status could be critical for determining the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Modulators of Immunity and Hyperinflammation ( \"Cytokine Storm \") The development of SARS-CoV-2-evoked pneumonia with hyperinflammatory responses in the lung is collectivelyknown as the \"cytokine storm. \"A clinical analysis of COVID-19 patients (n = 150) revealed a link between fatal-ity and elevated ferritin levels and interleukin (IL)-6, sug-gesting that the high case fatality rate (CFR) in patientswas related to virus-induced hyperinflammation. 2Thecytokine profile of severe COVID-19 cases also showed an increase in tumor necrosis factor , IL-2, IL-7, interferon (IFN)- inducible protein 10, Granulocyte Colony Stimulat- ing Factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1- ,a n d monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.3 No effective drugs are currently available to suppress the cytokine storm, although sever al have been proposed. These proposed drugs include 4-phenylbutiric acid (a drug oftenused to treat urea-cycle disorders) and tocilizumab (a mono-clonal antibody known to block IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis). From a nutritional intervention perspective, the low tox- icity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activitiesof some minerals and natural bioactives may be considered. Ifthey are administered before the onset of cytokine storm, thesesubstances may improve the symptoms and outcomes ofCOVID-19. Thus, it may be most important to maintain a po-tent immune system through more healthful dietary patterns. Zinc (Zn 2+)down-regulates inflammation via inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway and mod- ulates T-cell activity to limit the cytokine storm.4In a hu- man clinical study, COVID-19 patients (n = 411) takingzinc sulfate (220 mg) with hydroxychloroquine andazithromycin showed an increased frequency of patientdischarges from hospital and decreased need for ventila-tion and intensive care unit (ICU) admission with lowCFR. 5This combination dietary supplement and drug inter- vention is used as a prophylactic protocol in a prospectively followed cohort (NCT04326725; active, not recruiting) and ahuman RCT (NCT04377646; not recruiting). Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) improves immune function by down-regulating inflammatory mediators such as IL-6and endothelin-1, which may reduce the duration of FIGURE.

COVID-19 symptoms, facilitate rapid recovery, and shorten the length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay whenconsumed at 2 g/d (intravenous) for 96 hours. 6Ac o m b i n a - tion of vitamin C (3 g q6 for 7 days) and quercetin (250 -500 mg bid) showed antiviral synergism and protection ofh i g h - r i s kC O V I D - 1 9p a t i e n t s . 7Using a bioinformatics sys- tem, a combination of vitamin C and glycyrrhizic acid dem- onstrated antiviral activity based on 17 targeted outcomesand thus may be beneficial to test in COVID-19 patients. 8 No human studies on this cocktail are available at present. -Glucan (in branched form) seems to modulate im- mune responses against several viral infections. It activatesmacrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and neu-trophils, resulting in an effective T- and B-cell response against SARS-CoV-2. These effects could decrease the du- ration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. 9In a 2-week mouse study, -glucans from maitake fruit body extract and whole mycelial mushroom powders of Shiitake,Reishi, Agaricus, and Chaga increased the production ofIL-1, tumor necrosis factor , and IFN- in peripheral blood and potentiated the antibody response to influenzainfection. 10-Glucan extracts from the edible mushroom Lentinus edodes reduced proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. These extracts elicited immunomodula-tory and pulmonary cytoprotective effects with prophylac-tic implications in COVID-19 patients, especially indown-regulating the cytokine storm. 11The oral doses of 500 mg - g l u c a nh a v eb e e ns u g g e s t e df o ra ne f f e c t i v ea n t i - viral intervention. Clearly, more research is needed to con-firm the potential clinical value among COVID-19 patients. Curcumin , the primary yellow-orange curcuminoid de- rived from benefitsas a plant-based bioactive. 12Pharmacokinetic studies with rodent models and among humans indicate a poor absorp-tion of this curcuminoid. 13For example, the oral adminis- tration of curcumin at 2 g/kg body undetectable serum levels(0.006 \u00b1 0.005 g/mL at 1 hour). Regardless, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that curcumin, and per- haps its scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS) thatmay exacerbate the inflammatory response. 14Curcumin may be beneficial against pneumonia and acute respiratorydistress syndrome resulting from COVID-19 infection as sug- gested by several in vitro studies and rodent models. 15As with other interventions, research is needed to confirmthese findings among humans. Several flavonoids demonstrat e potent anti-inflammatory effects against CoVs. For example, emodin, a unique an-thraquinone found in aloe, rhubarb and buckthorn, ap-pears to ameliorate the asthmatic airway inflammation of activated macrophages in a murine modelwhen administered intraperitoneally viainhibition of the a h w a y . 17Certain carotenoids and polyphenols interact with transcription factors such as NF- B and nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2, to elicit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.18 REDOX NUTRITION The severity of COVID-19 is associated with clinical onsetof hypoxia triggered by imbalance in the redox state, in-flammation, and the ensuing cytokine storm. An imbalancein redox increases oxidative stress and triggers a cascade ofevents that may increase COVID-19 susceptibility amonghigh-risk individuals. The purpose of what might betermed \"redox nutrition \"is to restore of redox nutrition-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 supplements may provide ( a) promotion of mitophagy to remove dysfunctional mitochondria damaged by ROSand reduce immune evasion of viral pathogens; ( b)b i o - availability of transition metals to catalyze oxidation andcreate a reduced environment to maintain intracellularpH; ( micronutrients and bioactive compounds with potent ( anti-inflammatory and e) immunomodulatory molecules to hypoxia as-sociated dysfunctions. 19 Nutritional Regulation of Oxidative Stress Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production ofROS and their elimination by protective mechanisms in thebody. Oxidative stress activates a variety of transcriptionfactors involved in inflammatory pathways. Oxidativestress during viral infection is associated with the inductionof hyperinflammation (cytokine storm), the underlyingcause for severe clinical symptoms and fatality outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The roles of certain natural antioxi- dants to ameliorate oxidative s tress and reduce pathological complications associated with COVID-19 are highlighted. Selenium (Se) is an essential cofactor for several redox enzymes and, in concert with vitamin E, reduces the forma-tion of ROS. Selenium inadequacy has been implicated inthe pathogenicity of several viruses. Selenium status, basedon hair analysis, showed an association ( R 2= 0.74) between the cure rate of COVID-19-infected patients in the Wuhan, China, outbreak, but this association varied among citiesoutside Hubei Provence. 20Selenium and selenoproteins, such as the interlinked redox homeostasis, inflammatory responses, as well as impact viral replica-tion. 21Some suggest that for optimal function of these en- zymes, a daily intake of at least 100 g Se/d is needed.22 Volume 00, Number 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. The recommended daily intake for selenium in the United States is 55 g. However, research is still needed to establish whether such levels of Se are, in fact, safe and efficacious. Astaxanthin is a lipid-soluble carotenoid in the class of terpenes and occurs naturally in some algae, yeast, salmon,and shrimp. Some studies suggest that astaxanthin exhibits potent-free radical scavenging activity. It decreases the membrane fluidity and increases the activation of nuclearfactor erythroid 2 -related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 path- also of superoxide and nitrogen dioxide radicals, cyto- solic calcium, ROS, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and other ox- idative mediators. Some international regulatory agenciessuggest or have approved that the effective dosage for an-tiviral activity of astaxanthin is between 2 mg/d (acceptabledaily intake in Europe) and 24mg/d. 24Within the United States, the Food and Drug Administration provided \"no ob- jection \"letters for nearly 20 New Dietary Ingredient Notifi- cations for astaxanthin with daily doses between 2 and 24 mg. Whether these doses are efficacious remains to be determined. Metallo-Proteins and Redox Homeostasis Redox biochemistry is likely a key in metabolic dis-orders associated with COVID-19. Impaired redox stateand the ensuing oxidative stress have been linked to in-creased susceptibility of individuals to SARS-CoV-2. For ex- ample, inadequate or depleted glutathione, a peptide from glutamate, glycine, and cysteine that is synthesized in thecytosol of all human cells, has been linked to severe symp-toms and CFR among COVID-19 patients. 25Three metallo- proteins, lactoferrin (LF), ceruloplasmin, (LF), the iron-binding mammalian tein, is a potent regulator of cellular redox and may play a significant role in the clinical management of COVID-19. 26 Binding of LF to Fe3+ions could block iron-mediated catal- ysis and oxidative its related metabolic syndromes arevirulence factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. As radical scavenger, LF regulates oxidative stressand various proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, LF could contribute to the suppression of COVID-19 infection and inflammation, either acting as natural barrier for both re-spiratory and intestinal mucosa or reverting the iron dis-orders related to viral colonization. 27Lactoferrin may also induce the expression of antiviral cytokine mRNA, such asIFN-and IFN- , that could inhibit viral replication in in- fected cells. These inhibitory effects are achieved throughcompetitive binding of LF to host cell receptors (ie,Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans, ACE2, sialic acids, etc), and/or directly to SARS-CoV-2 capsid (ie, S, E, M, N pro-teins). The antiviral effects of LF are widely studied andseveral human RCTs have shed light on the possible mech-anisms of action, therapeutic efficacy, and safety of thismultifunctional milk protein. 28 Ceruloplasmin , a glycoprotein initially synthesized in the liver, is not involved with copper metabolism per se.It has considerable ferroxidase activity and is critical inmaintaining iron homeostasis. 29Interestingly, nearly 40 years ago, several in vitro studies indicated the presenceof ceruloplasmin in culture medium inhibited replicationof H0N1 and H1N1 viruses. 30,31However, these findings have not been used to study COVID-19. Myeloperoxidase is expressed primarily in neutrophils, and to a lesser degree in monocytes. The expression of thisenzyme may increase health risks and provide benefits,depending on the inflammatory disease state of thehost. 32Although MPO has been implicated in an array of inflammatory conditions in rodent models and humans,such as rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome, and pul-monary inflammation, its potential role to induce proin- flammatory cytokines among COVID-19 patients has not been characterized. Importantly, its contributions to the es-tablishment of neutrophil extracellular traps that may trig-ger immunothrombosis and, in part, may explain theprothrombotic clinical presentations in COVID-19 acute re-spiratory distress syndrome remain unclear. 33Thus, great care is needed in use of this bioactive. NUTRIENT-RELATED DISRUPTION OF VIRAL ENTRY AND REPLICATION Inhibition of viral docking to host cell surface receptors, membrane fusion, cellular entry, and viral replication seem to be potent intervention strategies to combat COVID-19. The Spike (S)-protein, a class I fusion molecule on the viralsurface, is essential for COVID-19 infection. Spike-proteinbinds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) receptors for entry into the host cell. After the cellu-lar entry, the viral genomic RNA interacts with the hostribosome and translates into 2 proteases, 3CLpro andPLpro, for processing the assembly of new viral particles. For replication of the RNA genome, the virus encodes RdRp, a replicase enzyme. These 4 proteins are Intervention strategies totarget Spike, RdRp, 3CLpro, and PLpro for the effective clin-ical management of COVID-19 are in active developmentin several laboratories worldwide. 34 Phytochemical ACE2 Receptor Blockers Several phytochemicals interfere with viral docking to hostcells and block the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Based on dockingexperiments, curcumin (from turmeric), nimbin (neem),withaferin A plants Solanaceae family), piperine 4 Nutrition Today\u00aeVolume 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

(from black and white pepper), mangiferin (from a small fern, Asplenium montanum , and its hybrid descendants), thebaine (also known paramorphine, primarily fromIranian opium/Persian poppy), Oregon grape, and goldenseal), and andrographolide(from various plants of the genus Andrographis ) have been identified as potential disruptors of CoV interac- tion with human ACE2 receptor. Other natural compoundssuch as resveratrol (from red grapes and blueberries), querce-tin (widely distributed among edible plants), luteolin (fromparsley, celery, lemons and othe r citrus fruits, and melons), naringenin (from grapefruit and orange peel), zingiberene (pri- marily from ginger), and gallic acid (from carob, strawberries,grapes, bananas and other fruits ) demonstrate binding affinity only toward the human ACE2 receptor; therefore, they may be useful for ACE2-mediated attachment inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. 35It is important to point out that cellular studies are a long way from proof of efficacy and that more clinical re-search is required to determine if plant-based ACE2 recep-tor blockers have risk reduction effects. Resveratrol intake up-regulates ACE2 and interferes with CoV binding to host cell surface receptor. Conversely, a high intake of dietary fat (~50%-60% of total energy in- take in a mouse model) could elicit a detrimental effectby ACE2 down-regulation. 36Several other rodent model studies with varied dietary fat, carbohydrate, and proteincontent indicated either an absence of or improved effecton ACE2 expression. 37,38In the same model, it seems that resveratrol may be a potent disruptor of viral S-proteinand human ACE2-receptor complex. A high-affinity inter- action of resveratrol with host receptor-virus complex was documented in molecular dynamic simulation experi-ments. 39Again, the potential value of this lead depends on more research in humans. Quercetin: Molecular dynamics simulation studies have indicated that quercetin binds and perturbs the hACE2-S-protein complex (human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 and spike glycoprotein complex). In silico studies have further supported that quercetin may be an effective disruptor of hACE2-S-protein complex. 40The COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) enzyme plays a functional role in viral replication and transcription. Quercetin derivatives, such as quercetin-3- D-xyloside and quercetin 3- O--L-arabinopyranoside, seem to be potent inhibitors of COVID-19 Mproenzyme ac- tivity.41Thus, these derivatives deserve more clinical study. Inhibitors of Viral Replication Antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, are effective inhibitorsof SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Because of the high-dose require-ment and narrow therapeutic index of these drugs, patientsoften experience severe side effects. Currently, there is noapproved therapy for COVID-19; therefore, the WorldHealth Organization endorses these for supportive careonly. However, frontline clinicians and researchers are ex- ploring several virus-based and host-based interventions. Vitamin D may reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections by several mechanisms, including ( a) induction of cathelicidins, which are antimicrobial peptides the serve acritical role in mammalian innate immune defense against invasive bacterial infection, and defensins, which are host peptides for the defense against bacteria, to lower viral rep-lication rates; ( b) down-regulation of c) up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. 42 Vitamin D is suggested to play a role in COVID-19 patho- biology, where ecological studies indicated that the rateof infection was higher in countries at higher latitudes and/or with lower vitamin D status. 43A clinical study on COVID-19 inpatients (n = 134) found that a smaller num-ber of patients in the ICU had 25-OH-D greater than50 nmol/L (19%) compared with those in conventionalmedical wards (39.1%). 44An association between vitamin D deficiency and hospital admission, disease severity, andmortality among patients from primary care and special-ized clinics (n = 691) has been reported. 45However, sev- eral other reports on this topic indicated no association between vitamin D status and risk of COVID-19 infection.46,47 To reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, some suggest10 000 IU/d of vitamin D 3for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25(OH)D levels, followed by 5000 IU/d. The goal is to raise25(OH)D levels greater than 40 to 60 ng/mL (100 -150 nmol/L). For treatment of COVID-19 patients, higher vita-min D 3doses might be beneficial to help rapid recovery, a topic currently under debate in the UK parliament.42 CONCLUSIONS Nutrition is a biochemical process that involves metabo- lism, energy balance, cellular stress, and the gut biome,with cumulative health outcomes in the human population.Diet is well established as a major contributor in the clinical management of several metabolic disorders; accordingly, COVID-19 virulence is compounded with comorbiditiessuch as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular dis-ease. It is important to understand the interaction of dietarypatterns and chronic noncommunicable illness in popula-tions with low viral spread rates and reduced CFRs forCOVID-19. The global experience with the COVID-19 out-breaks emphasizes the importance of rapid diagnosis of malnutrition and immediate implementation of caloric/ protein-balanced nutrition care. These activities are criticalto achieve success with nutritional interventions as well aslower mortality rates. Patients with mild symptoms ofCOVID-19, especially in advanced age with comorbidities,require an effective nutritional protocol.
