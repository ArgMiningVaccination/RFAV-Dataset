Crystal therapy has been used for centuries to help treat the body holistically for various ailments and the use of these beautiful minerals dates back to Egyptian times when they were said to be used to purge 'evil spirits.' These days, thanks to celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Ella Woodward, Madonna and Katy Perry promoting the benefits, crystal therapy has shrugged off its 'hippy' image and has gained a much bigger following from those looking to heal their body naturally and ensure all round wellbeing. The belief behind crystal therapy is that individual stones such as amethyst, rose quartz and jade have the ability to communicate with the energy flow of the human body and help to realign the energy channels that are interrupting the natural flow of the body and help it heal itself. Crystals with specific stones are said to help to relieve specific ailments such as anxiety, depression and insomnia, or more physical ailments such as digestive problems. Crystal therapy can be as simple as wearing precious stones and minerals as bracelets and necklaces, placing crystals in the room where you work and sleep or being treated by a crystal therapist, who can identify which stones can work to stimulate the seven chakras, or 'energy points' around the body. The electromagnetic charge within each stone is said to offer healing vibrations as they work to remove blockages around the body and restore a natural flow of energy. Here's a quick guide to the seven chakras: First chakra: This chakra represents stability, security and our basic needs and when unblocked. It is said to help us feel safe and fearless. Second chakra: This chakra is our centre of creativity and helps us express ourselves. Third chakra: A source of personal power. Fourth chakra: This energy point unites the lower chakras of matter and the upper chakras of spirit and acts as a bridge between our body, mind, emotions and spirit. Fifth chakra: This chakra is situated in the neck and is a source of verbal expression and helps our ability to speak our highest truth. Sixth chakra: Located in between the eyebrows, this chakra is often called the \"third eye\" and represents our centre of intuition. Seventh Chakra: The Sahaswara chakra or the \"thousand petal lotus\" chakra is located at the crown of the head. This is the chakra of enlightenment and spiritual connection to ourselves and others.
