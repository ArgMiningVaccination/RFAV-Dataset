By 2020, through excellence and innovations in teaching, research, service, and learning, Nova Southeastern University will be recognized by accrediting agencies, the academic community, and the general public as a premier, private, not- for-profit university of quality and distinction that engages all students and produces alumni who serve with integrity in their lives, fields of study, and resulting careers. Academic Excellence Student CenteredIntegrityInnovationOpportunityScholarship/ResearchDiversityCommunity The Mission Statement, Vision 2020 Statement, and Core Values were adopted by the NSU Board of Trustees on March 28, 2011.6 NSU Health Professions DivisionHealth Professions Division Mission Statement The mission of Nova Southeastern University Health Professions Division is to train primary care health practitioners in a multidisciplinary setting, with an emphasis on medically underserved areas. The institutional premise is that health professionals should be trained in a multidisciplinary setting and, whenever possible, with integrated education. The university trains students in concert with other health profession students so that the various disciplines will learn to work together as a team for the good of the public's health. During their didactic work, students share campus facilities and, in some cases, have combined classes. In their clinical experiences, they work together in facilities operated by the university. Furthermore, the division aims to educate health care practitioners who will eventually increase the availability of health care in areas of Florida that suffer from health care shortages. The division aims to alleviate some of these shortages by exposing the entire student body to the needs, challenges, and rewards of rural, underserved urban, and geriatric care. Existing curricula require all students to attend ambulatory care clerkships in rural or urban areas, or both, making Nova Southeastern University strongly oriented toward a pattern of training its students in areas geographically removed from the health center itself, and to the care of indigent and multicultural population groups. In doing this, it developed training programs that address the primary care needs of the region's most medically underserved populations.Health Professions Division Board of Governors Royal Flagg Jonas, J.D.

Memorial Day, u niversity closed8 NSU Health Professions DivisionUniversity History Sustained growth and unity has made Nova Southeastern University (NSU) the largest independent university in the state of Florida. This growth culminated in January 1994, when Nova University and Southeastern University of the Health Sciences merged to become Nova Southeastern University. Nova University was chartered in 1964 as a graduate institution in the physical and social sciences. Over time, Nova added programs in law, education, business, psychology, computer science, oceanography, social and systemic studies, and hospitality, and, in 1972, introduced its first off-campus course of study, in education. Soon, Nova became nationally recognized for its innovative distance learning programs. Today, field-based programs are located in 32 other Florida cities, in nearly 30 other states, and at selected international sites. While Nova continued to expand its educational reach, Southeastern University of the Health Sciences also was on an expansion course. Southeastern was created by osteopathic physicians committed to establishing a College of Osteopathic Medicine in the Southeast. As a result, Southeastern College of Osteopathic Medicine, as it was first known, opened in 1981. From 1987 to 1997, Southeastern added Colleges of Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health, Medical Sciences, and the College of Dental Medicine, which admitted 88 students in 1997. This growth was unprecedented, but not unsurpassed. There was still more to come. The merger brought on new possibilities. Prior to 1994, Nova had evolved with innovative technology and Southeastern expanded to provide much needed health care education. With the merger, Nova Southeastern University's resources make possible a more transdisciplinary education. Students have an opportunity to integrate across the disciplines and understand how their professions relate to society as a whole. Campus Nova Southeastern University's Health Professions Division offers a rare blend of tropical South Florida weather, plentiful sunny beaches, an easily accessible campus, a dedicated and professional faculty, well established affiliations with many hospitals, clinics, and health care systems in the area, and a mission to educate professionals capable of providing the highest-quality health care service. The university's main campus is located on a lush, 300-acre site in the Greater Fort Lauderdale area, 10 miles inland of the Atlantic Ocean and readily accessible via several highways and Florida's Turnpike. The Health Professions Division complex, dedicated in June 1996, is located on 21 acres and encompasses more than 1 million square feet of buildings. The division comprises the Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry, Allied Health and Nursing, Medical Sciences, and Dental Medicine. The division elicited input from students and faculty members and incorporated innovations in architecture, ergonomics, and computer-aided technology to provide facilities that enhance the learning experience. The complex is an arrangement of eight buildings, four of which are connected by air conditioned lobbies. The Sanford L. Ziff Health Care Center, physical plant, and 1,600-space garage are connected to the central buildings by covered walkways. Administration and faculty offices are on the upper levels of the five-story Terry Administration Building, with the departments of admissions and student affairs, and a cafeteria located on the first floor. Located in the lobby of the Terry Building, the Health Museum exhibits artifacts and antiques representing each of the colleges of the Health Professions Division. The collection houses an informative and historical display of medical memorabilia for students, faculty members, and visitors to explore. Private tours of the museum can be arranged with the curator, Cynthia Magalian Tupler, B.F .A. Contact Helen Caidin in the Pharmacy Department to schedule an appointment, (954) 262-1380. Adjacent to the administration building is the Assembly Building, which consists of a 500-seat auditorium, a 250-seat auditorium, and eight 126-seat amphitheater- classrooms, all equipped with computerized audio/ video systems. Connected to this is the three-story Library/ Laboratory Building. On the first floor is the library and a 100-seat cardiac laboratory utilizing \"Harvey,\" a computerized mannequin that duplicates the sounds and symptoms of most heart conditions. Also on the first floor are patient simulation training rooms and a 50-station computer laboratory for student use. The second and third floors house laboratories, a student lounge, and a research area. Laboratories are equipped for viewing pretaped medical procedures, and each large laboratory has a video system and hookups to equipment such as an electron microscope, so that illustrations can be amplified for laboratory-wide viewing. Just north of the Library/ Laboratory Building is the Health Care Center, with facilities for primary health care, rehabilitative services, eye care, pharmacy, and a simulation nursing laboratory. The College of Dental Medicine's 70,500-square-foot building advances the state-of-the-art in dental education facilities. The first floor contains a 100-operatory predoctoral clinic facility and clinics and support laboratories for oral medicine, radiology, and oral surgery. NSU Health Professions Division 9The second floor houses a faculty practice and clinics for postgraduate programs in endodontics, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontology, and prosthodontics, a 120-position simulation technique laboratory and support laboratories. Faculty and administration offices are on the third floor. The Health Professions Division added a building to foster opportunities for interdisciplinary education and to meet the need for additional classroom, computer, and research facilities. This modern, spacious facility known as the Assembly II Building contains more than 31,000 square feet of instructional and research facilities, including a 312-seat auditorium, ultrasound training center, a 50-station computer science laboratory, and 37 seminar and study rooms.

Admissions Policy Students provisionally are admitted to a degree-seeking program based on a review of unofficial transcripts or other specific program admission requirements. However, this admission includes a condition that final and official transcripts, documents, and requirements must be received within 90 calendar days from matriculation. If these final and official transcripts, documents, and/or requirements are not received by that time, the student will not be allowed to continue class attendance. Financial aid will not be disbursed to a provisional/ conditional student until he or she has been fully admitted as a regular student (all admissions requirements have been approved by the college /program admissions office). Students who have an unpaid balance 30 days from the start of the term will be assessed a $100 fee. Background Checks Accepted applicants and students are required to authorize the NSU Health Professions Division to obtain background check (s) as per the policy adopted on April 22, 2005. If the background check (s) reveal information of concern, which the NSU Health Professions Division may deem unfavorable, HPD will request that the individual provide a detailed written explanation of the information contained in this report, along with appropriate documentation (e.g., police reports). Students may also be required to authorize clinical training facilities that they are assigned to by the Health Professions Division to obtain a background check with the results reported to the clinical training facility. This information must be delivered in the format requested (electronic or written) to the NSU Health Professions Division Background Check Committee within 10 business days of the date the communication is sent or another date specified by HPD in its communication with the student. Offers of admission will not be considered final until the completion of the background check (s), with results deemed favorable by the NSU Health Professions Division, and where appropriate, by the clinical training facilities. If information received indicates that the student has provided false or misleading statements, has omitted required information, or in any way is unable to meet the requirements for completion of the program, then the admission may be denied or rescinded, the student may be disciplined or dismissed, or his or her enrollment may be terminated. Following the initial background check (s), students will be asked annually to provide a certification relating to any convictions or guilty or no-contest pleas to any criminal offense other than traffic violations. Tuition Refund Policy\u2014Voluntary Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw must submit a written request for voluntary withdrawal to the dean, who will evaluate the student's request. After completing the required withdrawal form (s) and obtaining the dean's approval, an eligible student may receive partial refund of the tuition, according to the following formula: First three class days .................................. 70 percent Fourth or fifth class day ............................. 60 percent Sixth or seventh class day ......................... 40 percent Eighth, ninth, or tenth class day .............. 20 percent After the tenth class day ............................ 0 percent10 NSU Health Professions Division No refunds will be made thereafter. (Students with questions should consult the program office.) Students may not be given refunds for portions of tuition paid by financial aid funds. As appropriate, the respective financial aid programs will be credited in accordance with federal regulations. Students should notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance prior to withdrawing to determine the effect this will have on financial aid. For complete withdrawals, please refer to the Return of Title IV Funds section of the student handbook. Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize future receipt of Title IV student assistance funds at any institution of higher education the student may attend. A refund due the student will be mailed to the student's permanent home address or deposited directly into his or her checking account as soon as the dean of the respective college has approved the withdrawal. The tuition refund policy is subject to change at the discretion of the university's board of trustees. Florida Residency Eligible students must request in-state tuition on application. For tuition purposes, students' Florida residency status (in-state or out-of-state) will be determined at initial matriculation and will remain the same throughout the entire enrollment of the student at NSU. Accordingly, tuition will not be adjusted as a result of any change in residency status after initial enrollment registration. Enrollment and Student Services Enrollment and Student Services (ESS) includes the Office of Student Financial Assistance, the University Registrar's Office, the University Bursar's Office, the One-Stop Shop, the University Call Center, Enrollment Processing Services, Transfer Evaluation Services, the Office of International Affairs, the Health Professions Division (HPD) Admissions and Financial Aid Services, and the Help Desk. Collectively, the ultimate goal of ESS is to effectively meet the information and service needs of all NSU students. Financial Aid The Office of Student Financial Assistance administers federal, state, and institutional aid programs such as grants, scholarships, federal work-study funds, and loans. To be considered for these programs, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.gov. Florida residents pursuing their first bachelor's degree or graduate students who qualify for one semester of Florida Bright Futures eligibility will also be required to complete the NSU State Aid Application to apply for state aid funds.In order to successfully complete the financial aid process, students should apply early, provide all necessary documents and information to the Office of Student Financial Assistance promptly, register for at least the minimum number of credits required per semester (half time in a degree-seeking program), and meet all required deadlines and eligibility requirements. For more information regarding the financial aid process and sources of aid, visit the NSU financial aid Web site at www.nova.edu/financialaid/. Students will be notified of missing information, notifications, and other financial aid-related information via NSU email and WebSTAR. Students may access their financial aid status in WebSTAR by logging into SharkLink at https://sharklink.nova.edu/cp /home/displaylogin, selecting the Student tab, and clicking on My Financial Aid. Payment The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing payments, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for financial aid funds. Bursar's Office Policies By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment. The student is responsible for the full balance on the account plus any additional costs that may be incurred by the university in the collection of these debts. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU ebills are sent the middle of each month. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the University RecPlex and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Method of Payment NSU accepts VISA, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. Electronic check and credit card payments can be made through NSU eBill or WebSTAR. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's Web site at www.nova.edu/bursar/forms /cc_authorization.pdf and faxed to (954) 262-2473. NSU Health Professions Division 11Payment Plans NSU students (with the exception of international students) who wish to defer payment of their tuition, fees, and other institutional charges due at the time of registration may sign up for a 3-month or a 10-month payment plan.

These certificates (whether done privately or by the university) will be placed in an appropriate facility.12 NSU Health Professions DivisionImmunization Requirements Students must complete the mandatory immunization form, which must be signed by a licensed health care provider. The form can be found at www.nova.edu/smc/. The immunizations/vaccinations listed below are required of students at the Health Professions Division, based on the current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations for Health Care Personnel. Basic Immunizations Every student is required to have had an immunization for, or show evidence of immunity to, the following diseases before matriculating at Nova Southeastern University: Varicella (chicken pox) Measles Mumps Rubella Additional Immunizations/Vaccinations Tetanus-Diptheria-Pertussis All students are required to have had a Tetanus- Diphtheria (Td) booster within the 10 years prior to matriculation and must maintain immunity by continuing to remain current according to the CDC recommendations for health care personnel during their program. Due to the increased risk of pertussis in health care settings, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices highly recommends that health care workers receive a one-time Tdap (ask your health care provider), only if it has been more than two years since receiving a Td booster. Therefore, students are encouraged to receive a Tdap if it has been more than two years since receiving a Td booster. Hepatitis B Vaccine Because every student at the Health Professions Division can be potentially exposed to this deadly virus, and since many rotation sites require it of personnel, we will require and administer hepatitis B vaccinations for all entering students during their first year, with a follow-up blood test showing the presence of the hepatitis B antibody. Students with documented immunity to hepatitis B must provide such documentation upon matriculation, including a Hepatitis B Surface Antibody Titer. Tuberculosis Because of the resurgence of tuberculosis and the possible exposure of students to TB, the Health Professions Division will require and provide a yearly tuberculosis test for every student. Arrangements Students may request that the Student Medical Center administer these immunizations. The Student Medical Center will make appointments in as timely a manner as possible. The appointment, once made, becomes an obligation of the student and must be kept. For students at the SECs, the appointments may be scheduled with the NSU-designated physician for their area. Student Activities Fees The student activity fees cover hepatitis B and TB screenings. All other immunizations and health care services are the responsibility of the student.Failure to Comply The university is not required to provide alternate sites for clinical practicum or rotations should immunization be a requirement for placement. Therefore, failure to comply with this policy may result in a student's inability to satisfy the graduation requirements in his or her program. Student Housing NSU offers a residential living program that is designed to meet a wide array of student needs.

These badges are given to the students at no charge, except for replacement.Students may not wear the following: shorts cut-offs mini-skirts (higher than mid-thigh) jeans halter-tops shoes, including beach/flip-flops, sandals, thong footwear, or plastic clogs with holes on the sides or top (Croc type) t-shirts (as the outer shirt) jogging or exercise clothing hats or caps, unless of a religious nature All individuals who work or study in the clinic environment must be proactive in reducing the potential for workplace foot injuries. No open-toed shoes are to be worn in the clinics. These guidelines apply on campus from 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and while on duty on rotations.14 NSU Health Professions DivisionStudents inappropriately dressed or groomed may be requested to leave the campus. In this circumstance, an unexcused absence will be recorded until the student returns properly attired. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the dean, whose decision shall be final. Repeated violations will be considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action. When a class requires special dress (such as the wearing of scrub suits in anatomy laboratory), it will be the only exception to the dress code allowed during that time. The dress code is to be observed at all times including midterms and examination periods. Students are expected to consult their respective program handbooks for compliance with any program-specific supplemental dress code policy. Identification Requirements and Fieldwork Prerequisites An affiliated clinical/fieldwork teaching facility may also require a student to pass a state of Florida Department of Health screening before rotation. Other requirements that may be held by the affiliated facility include, but are not limited to, fingerprinting, a criminal background check, urinalysis for drugs and alcohol, and proof of immunization. If a student does not meet all requirements held by the affiliated facility before the first day of the scheduled placement, the student's placement will be canceled. If the placement has already begun, the student will be asked to leave. Student Insurance Requirement It is required that each Health Professions Division student including online M.P .H. students carry adequate personal medical and hospitalization insurance. (Other online program students, as well as the R.N. to B.S.N. and R.N. to M.S.N. students, are not required to submit proof of personal medical and hospitalization insurance). It is strongly suggested that students and their families avail themselves of the insurance plan obtainable through the university. Information about the policy can be obtained through the HPD Admissions and Student Services Office, or by accessing the Web site at www.nova.edu/smc and clicking on the link for Student Health Insurance. Please note that students will see a charge for health insurance appear on their student account as part of the academic registration process. For those students who already have health insurance coverage and do not need the NSU-endorsed insurance plan, this charge will be removed from their account once proof of coverage has been submitted by completing the online waiver. To complete the waiver form, go to www.nova.edu/insurancewaiver. The online waiver is the only process by which insurance charges will be removed and coverage will be cancelled. Students who fail to complete the waiver form and provide proof of health insurance by the stated deadline will not be eligible to have charges removed and will continue to be enrolled in the insurance plan endorsed by NSU. Waivers must be completed each academic year. Veterans' Benefits Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits are designed to provide eligible individuals with an opportunity for educational and career growth. Eligible veterans and their dependents should contact the veterans benefit administrator by calling (954) 262-7236 or toll free at 800-541-6682, ext. 27236, Monday through Friday, between 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., or by visiting the veterans benefits Web page at www.nova.edu/financialaid/veterans/. If you have any questions concerning eligibility, you may also contact the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) at 888-442-4551 or visit their Web site at www.gibill.va.gov. Standards of Progress for Veterans A student receiving veterans benefits must maintain satisfactory progress. Students will be considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they meet the academic standards set by their school for retention in their degree programs. A student who, at the end of any evaluation period, has not attained and maintained satisfactory progress will be certified, in a probationary status, for only one additional evaluation period. Should this student not attain and maintain satisfactory progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational benefits will be terminated for unsatisfactory progress. A student whose VA educational benefits have been terminated for unsatisfactory progress may petition the school to be recertified after one evaluation period has elapsed. To initiate the petition process, students should contact the Office of Student Financial Assistance, Veterans Benefits administrator, at 800-541-6682, ext. 27236. The school may recertify the student for VA educational benefits only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the student will be able to attain and maintain satisfactory progress for the remainder of the program. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year, unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic dean for that program. Grade /Progress Reports for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits Each student who has VA benefits will be provided with a grade/progress report at the end of every evaluation period NSU Health Professions Division 15(e.g., term, semester). A copy of each report will be placed in the student's permanent file maintained by the school. The university periodically furnishes each student with a working transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/ or attempted, plus grades for courses in which the student is currently enrolled. Conduct Policy for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits All VA students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of Nova Southeastern University. Academic dishonesty and/or nonacademic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institutional documents and/or academic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. Students should refer to the Appeals and Grievance Procedures section of the NSU Student Handbook.

Through its interprofessional programs, the college prepares competent and compassionate lifelong learners; supports research, scholarly activity, and community service; and advocates for the health and welfare of diverse populations, including the medically underserved. An Osteopathic Physician T wo types of complete physicians may practice medicine in all 50 states: the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) and the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). While both types of physicians are trained in all aspects of patient care, D.O.s offer a distinct, holistic approach to medicine. Osteopathic medicine is distinguished by an emphasis on primary care, by using osteopathic manipulative medicine when necessary, and by a tradition of caring for patients in underserved rural and urban areas. Osteopathic physicians recognize the relationship between physical structure and organic function and view the human body as an interdependent unit rather than an assortment of separate parts and systems. While all medical and surgical specialties are represented within the osteopathic medical profession, the training of vitally needed family physicians and the drive to reach rural, minority, geriatric, and indigent populations, make the osteopathic medical profession unique. We are proud of our success in producing vitally needed primary care physicians\u2014nearly 70 percent of our graduates practice in the primary care disciplines of family medicine, general internal medicine, or general pediatrics\u2014and we remain committed to training physicians capable of delivering the highest standards of total-patient care in all practice settings. Accreditation Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine has been granted accreditation by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation of the American Osteopathic Association. This body is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council of Post-Secondary Accreditation as the accrediting agency for colleges educating osteopathic physicians and surgeons.

Academics Transfer of Credit Circumstances may warrant that a student enrolled in a medical school seeks to transfer to another institution. Credits may be transferred from medical schools and colleges accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) of the American Osteopathic Association or by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME).24 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program Transfers from a medical school accredited by the COCA or the LCME shall require that, at minimum, the last two years of instruction be completed within the NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. Transfers from an LCME-accredited medical school must complete NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine's requirement for osteopathic manipulative medicine prior to graduation. Transfer credits will only be given if the student is in good academic standing at, and eligible for readmission to, the previously attended COCA- or LCME- accredited medical school. Credit is only given for completed courses with grades of 70 percent (2.0) or greater that fulfill the COM's graduation requirements. Anyone wishing to transfer to NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine must meet the following criteria: 1. make a formal application to NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Office of Admissions 2. satisfy all admission requirements to NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, which include submitting official transcripts of all college work (including osteopathic transcripts); MCAT scores; National Board scores, if taken; and letters of evaluation 3. be in good standing at the transferring institution, as documented by a letter from the dean of the transferring institution 4. supply a letter of recommendation from a faculty member of the transferring institution 5. supply a written statement outlining reasons for request for transfer Decisions on transfer are made by the dean. No applicant will be accepted without an interview. The decision will be based on factors which include, but are not limited to, academic record, interview, circumstances leading to the transfer request, available space, and admission standards. Advanced Placement Request for advanced placement for any course at Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine must be declared and all supporting documentation must be submitted by the student no later than 45 days prior to the first day of class. The student must present all supporting documents to the College of Osteopathic Medicine Office of Student Affairs. The student will be required to attend all classes and take all examinations until the disposition of the advanced placement request is finalized. A student must have significant training or history of accomplishments in a basic science area that warrants consideration for advanced placement examinations. Students must pass a comprehensive examination given for the purpose of determining the student's competency in the subject involved. The passing requirement will be determined by the College of Osteopathic Medicine. The decision regarding the request for advanced standing will be transmitted in writing to the student by the dean. The Office of the Registrar will be appropriately notified. Courses for which advanced standing is granted will be designated as advanced placement on the student's transcript and will not show a grade or contribute to the student's grade point average. Course of Study The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a dedicated faculty; well established affiliations with medical centers, hospitals, and health care systems; a nationally recognized rural medicine program; and a mission to educate the finest osteopathic physicians possible. We place our students and residents at the nation's fourth largest public hospital system\u2014the North Broward Hospital District\u2014or at one of our regional academic centers throughout the state to improve continuity and coordination of clinical education within our vast and growing clinical training network. Our innovative curriculum is designed to fulfill our mission of training primary-care physicians. The design of the curriculum is based on successful academic models\u2014 carefully developed and integrated. It emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration, guiding students to develop a holistic, and more importantly, an osteopathic approach to medicine. We continually correlate basic scientific information with fundamental clinical application. Students are exposed to clinical settings in their first semester, which gives them the opportunity to prepare for the \"real world\" of medicine. This clinical exposure continues into the second year when students have increased opportunity to interact with standardized patients on campus as well as be involved, under physician supervision, with real patients in the office and hospital setting. A notable aspect of the clinical program is a required three- month rotation in a rural practice setting. In rural clinics throughout the state of Florida, our students provide health care to medically underserved and indigent patients. Our students learn to treat various patients whose lifestyles, practices, and attitudes toward health care differ from those seen in more traditional training sites. This enriching educational experience is one that cannot be taught in the classroom. Physicians do not work in a vacuum, but rather in a health care team, and NSU promotes interdisciplinary cooperation whenever possible. Students share faculty members and campus facilities with NSU's pharmacy, dental, optometry, physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health, nursing, and medical science students.

The premise of the program is that exposure to professional role models is a significant determinant of medical students' career choices, and that an early clinical experience is an essential learning component for medical students to begin to correlate classroom knowledge with actual patient encounters. The IGC Program is composed of three components: (1) the IGC Physician Mentor Program, (2) the IGC Business of Medicine /Managed Care Program, and (3) the College of Osteopathic Medicine in Community Service (COM2Serve) Program. IGC Physician Mentor Program Students are placed with physician mentors, either one or two students at a time. They may elect to switch mentors every semester and are required to switch primary care disciplines and mentors after their first year. In addition to providing a broad exposure to the role of a primary care physician, the physician mentor provides the student with the opportunity to perform patient histories and physical examinations within the limits of the student's ability, and educates the student by providing timely feedback and engaging in discussions and explanations of his or her decision making. There are approximately 140 primary care physician mentors who teach first- and/ or second-year medical students in their private offices. This network of preceptors is composed of physicians in the three primary care disciplines; they are located throughout the tricounty area.IGC Business of Medicine/Managed Care Program Students learn the business aspects of practice as well as the various components of managed care organizations (MCOs). Each student is either assigned to an MCO teaching partner, or attends a special conference or seminar on health care systems, policies, and access. Students learn how a managed care organization operates by participating in seminars and small group discussions led by professionals representing various departments/experiences such as medical operations, physician committee meetings, utilization management, quality management, and provider /practice management. IGC COM2Serve Program This is the community service component of the IGC preceptorship, in which second-year medical students are involved in service learning with community health centers, public health departments, homeless assistance centers, migrant farmworker clinics, and other subsidized community clinics. The COM2Serve partner organizations provide health care and other needed services to medically underserved, minority, and at-risk populations. Osteopathic Principles and Practice Laboratories The development of the palpatory skills used for diagnosis and treatment is a significant distinction between the educational programs in osteopathic and allopathic medical schools. Stedman's Medical Dictionary defines palpation as \"examination with the hands and fingers; touching, feeling, or perceiving by the sense of touch.\" Palpation in the osteopathic medical education context is the use of touch to examine the body. Palpatory skills are used in all areas of osteopathic medical practice and are especially important in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the musculoskeletal system. The development of palpatory skills is taught in the first- and second-year osteopathic principles and practice (OPP) courses. Successful completion of these courses requires active participation in all laboratory sessions. During the two years, each student will palpate, in the laboratory setting, a variety of people, representing both genders and individuals with different body types to simulate the diversity of patients expected in a practice setting. Being palpated by other students helps the student understand from the patient's perspective how palpation feels and enables the students to provide feedback to their laboratory partners, thus enhancing the palpatory skills of all students. The osteopathic medical profession uses a variety of treatment models, and through the skills development process, the student learns the art and skills of manipulative treatment. Psychomotor skills are developed by repeated practice. Reading and observation, although helpful, do not develop the skills required to perform palpatory diagnosis and manipulative treatment. Each student is required to actively participate in all skills development laboratory 40 College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Programsessions. These skills are taught by treating and being treated by a cadre of students of both genders and with varying body types to simulate a medical practice setting. Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program The mission of NSU's Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Program is to improve the access to and the quality of primary health care service to medically underserved communities by linking the resources of academic health centers with community-based health care providers. Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, the first medical school in the state of Florida to develop an AHEC Program, officially began its program in 1985. Since its inception, the program has worked to develop effective and comprehensive training programs that improve access to quality primary health care for Florida's medically underserved rural and inner- city urban communities. Our nationally recognized program now serves underserved communities and populations throughout a nearly 20,000 square mile area of South and Central Florida. Our first AHEC center\u2014the Everglades AHEC\u2014reaches underserved areas within a 10-county region extending from the inner city of northern Miami-Dade County to rural communities around Lake Okeechobee. Based on the success of the Everglades AHEC, the university was awarded additional funding to develop a Central Florida AHEC, which now serves nine counties and extends from Lake Okeechobee to north of Orlando. By including training programs in community settings, we expose students to the challenges, rewards, and practice opportunities related to working in medically underserved areas. Students have opportunities to work together while learning to provide valuable primary care services to the community. Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME) In January 1999, the College of Osteopathic Medicine established an innovative program to revolutionize clinical education and training. The Consortium for Excellence in Medical Education (CEME), in affiliation with NSU College of Osteopathic Medicine, was formed to increase opportunities for postdoctoral medical training, including internships, residencies, fellowships, and continuing education programs. The CEME is an alliance of affiliated clinical sites linked through electronic networks; teaching, research, and community health collaborations; and a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomorrow's physicians. CEME partners are joining forces on postgraduate clinical education, research initiatives, and public health and preventative medicine programs to benefit Florida's elderly, indigent, and minority patient populations. The CEME creates a unified medical education system composed of Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine and 18 teaching hospitals and hospital systems spanning the state of Florida and includes ambulatory centers, county health departments, and social service agencies. Four additional affiliated programs are located in Georgia, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The CEME, as a dynamic network of affiliated regional academic training centers, uses distance learning systems to strengthen teaching, research, and community health collaboration while also nurturing a shared commitment to excellence in the education of tomorrow's physicians. West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a major affiliation with the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). This state-of-the-art health care facility's close academic ties with the college includes sharing academic positions, granting faculty appointments to VAMC staff members, a shared residency training program in preventive medicine, and major participation in the clinical program of the college. The VAMC employs a computerized paperless patient record system. It also permits X rays to be visualized with high resolution, includes laboratory and other reports that can be retrieved and tracked, has systems that ensure the selection of appropriate drugs for patient safety, and facilitates arrangements for specialist consultations. Students may spend as much as six months at the facility during their clinical years. Rural Medicine Program Since its establishment in 1979, the College of Osteopathic Medicine has been committed to educating students about rural medicine and having them train in underserved communities. The Department of Rural Medicine's instructional programs have been recognized nationally for helping to meet the health care needs of underserved communities and enhancing the medical skills of our students. Our fourth-year medical students train for three months in rural and underserved settings. They are expected to expand their diagnostic and therapeutic skills as well as their patient and community proficiency in relation to addressing multicultural populations. Training sites include community health centers, private physicians' offices, ambulatory care facilities operated by the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and leading health care institutions of the Florida Department of Corrections. The Rural Medicine Training Program provides our students with a unique and enriching experience. A number of our graduates are now clinical directors at the community health centers or have established successful practices in a rural Florida region. College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Osteopathic Medicine Program 41Preventive Medicine Prevention, in its broadest sense, is practiced by all physicians and other health professionals who help their patients to stay healthy. Preventive medicine, however, is also a distinct medical specialty, one of 25 recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties. The specialty of preventive medicine is based on our knowledge that promoting health and preventing disease requires work with both individuals and communities. Preventive medicine physicians are trained in both clinical medicine and public health. They have the skills to understand and reduce the risks of disease, disability, and premature death both in individuals and population groups. The distinctive aspects of preventive medicine include knowledge and competence in biostatistics bioterrorism epidemiology environmental and occupational health planning, administration, and evaluation of health services the social and behavioral aspects of health and disease the practice of prevention in clinical medicine The American Osteopathic Association grants certificates to physicians who have successfully completed three years of supervised training and a written examination in any one of three areas: general preventive medicine /public health, occupational medicine, or aerospace medicine. Specialists in general preventive medicine /public health focus their skills on population groups, such as the residents of a particular community or state or the patient population of a health center, hospital, or managed care organization. Preventive medicine specialists work in a wide variety of settings, including primary care and managed care settings, public health and community agencies, industry, and academia. These physicians usually engage in multiple activities, including planning, administration and evaluation of disease prevention and health promotion programs, research, teaching, and direct patient care. The varied career paths include managed care, public health, occupational medicine, aerospace medicine, clinical medicine, informatics, policy development, academic medicine, international medicine, and research, covering all levels of government, educational institutions, organized medical care programs in industry, as well as voluntary health agencies and health professional organizations. About 6,000 physicians nationally are board-certified in preventive medicine. In addition to the need for more physicians trained in the specialty of preventive medicine, there is a need for more training in prevention in all the other medical specialties, especially in primary care. Toward this end, the Department of Preventive Medicine is initiating efforts to strengthen prevention education, particularly in relation to individual patient care. This will be accomplished by weaving the distinctive aspects of preventive medicine throughout all coursework offered to medical students at the College of Osteopathic Medicine. Specialists in preventive medicine, who have skills in population-based prevention as well as individual preventive interventions, can assist the other specialties in the further development of education in prevention and the population-based health sciences for residents and medical students alike. Geriatric Teaching Program The College of Osteopathic Medicine has a strong commitment to teaching students, residents, and physicians about the care of the geriatric patient. As a result, the college requires a didactic geriatric course in the M-2 year, which addresses \"successful aging.\" Attention is given to elderly populations and their diverse profiles and circumstances. During the M-3 year, students participate in a monthlong, required geriatric clerkship, where they care for elders in a variety of settings under the supervision of a geriatric specialist. The College of Osteopathic Medicine also provides clinical teaching in geriatrics for second-year family medicine residents from its Palmetto Family Medicine Residency during a one-month rotation. The College of Osteopathic Medicine, along with the North Broward Hospital District, sponsors a geriatric fellowship training program for family medicine physicians who successfully complete an American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP) approved family medicine residency program. This will prepare the physician for a Certificate of Added Qualifications (CAQ) in geriatrics. We are excited about what we are doing in geriatrics and are looking for ways to expand our programs and teaching facilities.

D.O./D.M.D. Dual-Degree Program In order to address the access to care issue and meet the needs of underserved populations, Nova Southeastern University's (NSU's) College of Dental Medicine and College of Osteopathic Medicine have structured a curriculum that provides students with an opportunity to receive a D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) and a D.M.D. (Doctor of Dental Medicine) degree. This D.O./D.M.D. Dual-Degree Program is in accord with the missions of both schools. This dual program will prepare health care practitioners to use a totally holistic approach to health care that will address preventive medicine and general dentistry, as well as access to care issues, meeting the needs of rural and underserved populations. Once students complete this six-year program, they will be qualified for licensure in dentistry and for postgraduate, one-year residencies that are required prior to medical licensure. Only a select number of motivated students who have attained the highest academic standards and embody the spirit of this collaborative initiative will be considered. College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Public Health Program 43Master of Public Health Program The Master of Public Health (M.P .H.) Program is an accredited graduate level program designed to prepare students to define, critically assess, and resolve public health problems. The program provides training in the theories, concepts, and principles of public health and their application. To meet the rapidly changing needs of health service professionals, including preventive medicine specialists, the curriculum is structured to accommodate a diversity of backgrounds and individual career goals. The demand for public health professionals is increasing as a result of emerging and re-emerging diseases, environmental health concerns, health care reform, health care system, sociopolitical factors affecting our nation's health, and expansion of health issues that are global in scope.

These issues include predicting who will become sick preventing health complications or problems in individuals making effective interventions in large populations reducing adverse complications in health care overcoming physician resistance to intricate systems and information technology maximizing constrained resources The Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics is a participating program of the Southern Regional Education Board's Electronic Campus program. The SREB certifies that the online programs and courses it approves for this program are in full compliance with its comprehensive set of Principles of Good Practice. Course of Study The M.S.B.I. Program is designed to prepare students for careers in information management, teaching, and research in academic health centers, other health care institutions and organizations, and the health care computing industry. It has become almost axiomatic that the organization and retrieval of information is essential for the development of new knowledge. The quality of a medical school's computing and information technology environment will profoundly affect its ability to compete in both education and research. In addition, the quality of the biomedical informatics program will influence a school's opportunities to collaborate with health organizations such as hospitals, health departments, medical societies, and physicians in remote areas. The major areas included in the M.S.B.I. education program are computer science and its clinical application in medical informatics, management, and program evaluations of health information technology. Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics Nova Southeastern University College of Osteopathic Medicine in collaboration with the NSU Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences (GSCIS) has developed a course of study leading to the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics. It is designed to train future leaders in the development, dissemination, and evaluation of information technology as it relates to health care environments, such as hospitals, health systems, health information technology system vendors, eHealth companies, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions. This innovative distance program uses a completely online format to enable working professionals to earn a master's degree in biomedical informatics without career disruption. There has been an emergence of biomedical informatics as a discipline due to advances in computer and communications technology and an increasing awareness of the exponential growth of biomedical knowledge. This has been accompanied by clinical information that has become unmanageable by traditional, paper-based methods and the growing realization that the process involved in knowledge retrieval and decision making are important to modern biomedicine and clinical decision making. Biomedical informatics is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates computer and information sciences, cognitive and decision sciences, epidemiology, telecommunications, and other fields. Researchers in this evolving field discover new methods and techniques to enhance health care, biomedical research, and education through information technology. Those in this discipline study and encourage the use of appropriate information to support clinical care, research, teaching, and health services information. Biomedical informatics allows physicians and other health professionals to integrate advanced information system capabilities and highly trained individuals with a clinical outlook and approach. The methods, tools, and resources developed through biomedical informatics often help physicians and other health professionals accomplish tasks that they were already doing, but in a more efficient, perhaps more accurate, or even entirely new manner. It also allows for the performance of tasks that were not previously possible. Informational technology now provides physicians and other health professionals with the potential to access large databases. As a result, they can now begin to think like epidemiologists, in addition to being providers of patient care. Specific areas of added value provided by biomedical informatics include analyzing information to develop new knowledge and information College of Osteopathic Medicine\u2014Biomedical Informatics Program 53 possess a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or above on a 4.0 scale (preferred) demonstrate competency in the use of computers by credentials or work experience demonstrate the ability to clearly communicate in a written manner A health professions degree is desirable, but not required.

Administrative Director, Puerto Rico ProgramGoar A M.S., Ph.D. Dean Emeritus Pharmacy With the nation struggling to deliver high quality, affordable health care, there has come a greater appreciation of the importance of pharmacists as members of today's health care team. The pharmacist's role has expanded rapidly from drug compounding and distribution to a more patient-oriented role. The College of Pharmacy is educating its students in practices vital to meeting the challenges facing the profession and important to improving health and reducing health care costs. The College of Pharmacy admitted its first class in 1987 to become the first College of Pharmacy in South Florida. Since then, it has graduated more than 2,700 pharmacy professionals. The college offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree program and began offering a graduate Ph.D. program in 2010. Pharmacists are experts on drugs and therapeutic goals, their biological action and uses, formulation, adverse effects, and potential for drug interactions. However, pharmacists are not only knowledgeable about drugs, they must also be people-oriented. They consider both the medication and the patient to ensure the patient has the right drug, in the right amount, for the right length of time, and with minimal adverse effects. The result is improved health care.College of Pharmacy Andr\u00e9s Malav\u00e9, B.S., in patient-oriented settings: in community pharmacies, hospitals, extended care facilities, or public health clinics. In addition, pharmacists are employed by the pharmaceutical industry in research and development, in manufacturing, or as medical service representatives. They work in academic institutions, government, health maintenance organizations, and home health care programs. It is because of these challenges and opportunities that pharmacy has assumed a wider role and become an increasingly rewarding profession involving patient counseling, compliance, and education. The shortage of pharmacists has become so critical that colleges of pharmacy would have to double their enrollments to meet the projected needs of the health care system. Accreditation The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 20 North Clark Street, Suite 2500, Chicago, IL 60602-5109, (312) 664-3575, 800-533-3606; Fax (312) 664-4652, Web site: www.acpe-accredit.org , has accredited the Doctor of Pharmacy Program of the College of Pharmacy, Nova Southeastern University. The College of Pharmacy is a member of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Facilities The College of Pharmacy is headquartered on the third floor of the Health Professions Division Administration Building. Pharmacy practice and research laboratories are located on the third floor of the Library /Laboratories Building, near the Health Professions Division's research laboratories. Experiential sites are primarily located throughout Central and South Florida. In the fall of 2000, the NSU College of Pharmacy opened a West Palm Beach program. A new facility has been constructed in Palm Beach at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Military Trail in Palm Beach Gardens. Classes will be held in the new building starting in the fall of 2011. In the fall of 2001, a full-time program on the campus of Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico in Ponce, Puerto Rico, was opened. The only distinction between the Fort Lauderdale campus-based degree and the distance degree is geography. Each location has a program director, administrators, and faculty and staff members. Interactive video technology is used to provide lectures among the three sites simultaneously. This provides for live interaction between lecturer and students regardless of location. Identical handouts, tests, and texts are used. Communication through telephone, fax, online technologies, and email are available to students at all sites. All students have access to the Health Professions Division Library, computer labs, online learning resources, and the vast technological innovations provided by NSU, which has been a leader in distance education programs for many years.The pharmaceutical care center and pharmacy are adjacent to the health clinic in Fort Lauderdale. This is a community pharmacy with disease management services for diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and anticoagulation. It also manages pharmacy services, including drug regimen review, consultation, and teaching. The College of Pharmacy's Drug Information Center meets a pressing demand among health care professionals for accurate, up-to-date information on medications, their adverse effects, incompatibilities, potential for interactions, and related legal issues. Financial Aid The purpose of the Student Financial Assistance Program at Nova Southeastern University is to help as many qualified students as possible to complete their pharmacy education. Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of a health professions education. Approximately 90 percent of College of Pharmacy students receive some form of financial assistance. These financial assistance programs are described in a variety of separate university publications. Although most first-year pharmacy students will be classified as graduate students for financial aid purposes, students who matriculate with fewer than 90 semester hours and students in the dual-admission program will be classified as undergraduates for the first year in the College of Pharmacy. Transfer Credits Requests for transfer credit must be submitted in writing to the executive associate dean. The request must include a copy of the transcript (containing the course title and final grade) and a course syllabus. Transfer credit will only be considered for courses taken at pharmacy schools accredited by ACPE or for those courses given prior approval by the executive associate dean. An official transcript from the institution attended must be provided before transfer credit will be awarded. All transfer credit requests must be received prior to August 1 of the first year of pharmacy school. The dean's office will evaluate the courses and determine appropriate credits. A minimum of 16 credit hours of didactic coursework and a minimum of five advanced pharmacy practice experiences must be completed at Nova Southeastern University. Class Cancellation Policy The university reserves the right to cancel any class. If a class is cancelled and a replacement is not offered, students will receive a full refund of tuition paid for the cancelled class. If the student registered for only one class, then other fees will be refunded as well.

For information and requirements, contact one of the following: Office of Admissions Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences Nova Southeastern University 3301 College Avenue Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33314-7796 70 College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level Program Office of Admissions Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Puerto Rico 2250 Avenida Las Americas Suite 584 Ponce, Puerto Rico 00717-0777 Office of Admissions International College 2655 Northbrooke Drive Naples, Florida 34119 Internship An internship is a requirement for licensure. The internship must be completed within the guidelines of the Florida Board of Pharmacy as set forth in the Rule, Chapter 64B16-26.400(4), or by the Board of Pharmacy in the state in which the student plans to fulfill the requirements for internship. A Social Security number is necessary in order to obtain an intern license from the state of Florida. It is the responsibility of any student who does not have U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status to ensure that his or her visa status allows for the issue of a Social Security number. An intern license is a requirement for placement on practice experiences. Without practice experiences, a student cannot complete the curriculum or the requirements of the Pharm.D. degree program. Any student who has concerns regarding visa or Social Security status should contact the Office of International Students by phone at (954) 262-7241 or 800-541-6682, extension 27241, or by email at intl@nsu.nova.edu . The college's director of experiential programs provides assistance and guidance to students regarding internships. Course of Study The Doctor of Pharmacy degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study in the College of Pharmacy. The curriculum stresses innovative teaching delivery and assessment methods. Students are provided an initial orientation during which they are exposed to library and online resources, professionalism, and academic expectations. The curriculum is designed so courses integrate information and build on one another in order to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profession. The didactic component of the curriculum builds a foundation in the medical and pharmaceutical sciences. Traditional courses in physiology and pathophysiology, biochemistry, microbiology, research design, and statistics are provided in order to develop a solid foundation. Pharmaceutical sciences courses including Pharmaceutics, Pharmacokinetics, and Nonprescription Therapies are designed to provide students with a strong understanding of the principles of drug therapy. The innovative curriculum also includes the integration of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology into one course titled Pharmacodynamics, which runs four semesters. Insight into the business, human relations, communication, marketing, and legal aspects of pharmacy and the health care system are also provided. Students are actively involved in the two-semester Pharmacy Leadership course that covers topics such as ethics and professionalism. Additionally, the curriculum includes courses that focus on application of material learned in previous semesters. Pharmacotherapy addresses the use of drugs in the disease process and physical assessment provides students with hands-on opportunities to develop skills essential to monitoring and managing medication therapy. Students hone their analytical skills with courses in pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research and biomedical literature evaluation. All students must complete a minimum of 6 semester hours of elective credit. Unique aspects of the first three years of the curriculum include an introductory pharmacy practice experience program and an integrated laboratory. Opportunities for the students to experience pharmacy practice first hand are provided early in the curriculum. In the first year, students participate in a pharmacy leadership course, which is designed to begin the development of abilities including thinking and learning; social and cultural awareness; active citizenship and leadership; personal, ethical, and legal judgment; and communication. In the second year of the curriculum, students spend four hours per week in a community pharmacy setting. Practice experiences in the third year involve eight hours per week in hospital and pharmacy service preclinical settings. Patient Care Management Lab is initiated during the second year and continues through the third. This provides an opportunity for students to integrate information learned in all courses of the curriculum in order to facilitate application of the material in real-life practice settings. During the fourth year, through experiential coursework, students will complete nine 160-hour Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) courses, four in core practice areas and five selective experiences in specialty health care areas. APPEs continue the student's education by providing opportunities for the clinical application of patient care in a broad variety of health care environments and systems. The majority of a student's APPEs must be in direct patient care practices. At this point in the curriculum, it is expected that student pharmacists practice drug therapy monitoring with more independence. Each term of the fourth year curriculum includes a Professional Development Capstone course that offers student-initiated review and update of calculations and case-based drug therapy evaluations. During the last month of the curriculum, student pharmacists return to campus for updates on law, medication therapy, and preparation for the national board examination. Note: The advanced pharmacy practice experiences are full-time commitments for the students (a minimum of 40 College of Pharmacy\u2014Entry-Level Program 71hours per week). Students are assigned to approved off- campus facilities and must arrange their own transportation. Experiences may be taken in any sequence, however students may not enroll in advanced practice experiences until all didactic work has been satisfactorily completed. There are currently few advancecd pharmacy practice sites in Puerto Rico for the entry-level students. Students must expect to use Florida sites for most experiences. The curriculum is designed so that knowledge gained in one semester becomes the foundation for material covered in subsequent semesters. Therefore, if students do not successfully complete the coursework specified for one semester, it will impede their ability to take courses in the future semesters. (Students have 60 days after the end of the semester to resolve any grade disputes; after that, the instructor may discard all materials from the semester.) This may lead to a delay in graduation. The program must be completed within seven years from the date of matriculation. Study Abroad Opportunities for study abroad programs may be provided during the summer. Graduation Requirements To receive a degree, a student must fulfill the following requirements: be of good moral character pass all required courses complete a minimum of 145 semester hours of coursework in the College of Pharmacy within seven years satisfactorily complete the assigned curriculum requirements for the degree, including all assignments, with a GPA of 2.0 on a four-point scale or a numerical average of 70 percent or above satisfactorily complete the capstone examination satisfactorily meet all financial and library obligations complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of didactic coursework in addition to five advanced pharmacy practice experiences if transferring submit to the registrar's office an application for degree /diploma by March 15.

Upon completion of the degree program, students are eligible to take the North American Pharmacy Licensing Examination (NAPLEX). This opportunity is designed exclusively for graduates of pharmacy degree programs outside of the United States jurisdiction, allowing them to build upon their pharmacy education and prepare them for clinical pharmacy practice. The International Pharmacy Graduate curriculum educates students to achieve the same outcomes as the Entry-level Pharm.D. Degree Program. Courses integrate information and build on one another to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the profession. Pharmacodynamics and Nonprescription Therapies courses provide a strong understanding of the principles of drug therapy. The business, human relation, communication, marketing, and legal aspects of pharmacy and the health care system are also studied. Courses focus on application of material learned, the use of drugs in the disease process, and developing skills essential to monitoring drug therapy. Students hone their analytical skills with courses in pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research and biomedical literature evaluation. All students must complete a minimum of 4 semester hours of elective credit. Pharmacy practice experiences in community, hospital, and other traditional pharmacy settings facilitate real- life application of the material and provide opportunities to integrate information learned. Full-time practice experiences facilitate application of drug therapy monitoring with more independence. International pharmacists applying for the entry-level program may be awarded advanced standing based on their previous coursework. Advanced standing and the actual degree curriculum will vary based on the matriculant's previous pharmacy coursework.

Administration David Loshin Didactic Education Optometry Sight is one of our most precious gifts and the optometric physician is dedicated to the preservation and enhancement of this gift. The optometric physician, through academic and clinical training, is able to examine, diagnose, treat, and manage disorders and diseases of the visual system and associated structures. Optometry is constantly evolving as a profession to enable optometric physicians to broaden their scope as the primary eye-care practitioner. The profession of optometry offers many challenges and rewards to those willing to devote themselves to serving others through a lifetime of study and dedication to excellence.Today's optometrists practice in urban and rural communities throughout the nation, in individual or group practices, hospital settings, centers for vision research, and in the public health service. They also take part in teaching, research, and public health. Nova Southeastern University College of Optometry stands alone as the only optometric academic institution in the state of Florida. Furthermore, the college benefits from the integrated multidisciplinary health care programs of the university's Health Professions Division, represented by optometry, osteopathic medicine, dental medicine, pharmacy, and allied health and nursing. Nova Southeastern University takes pride in the optometry degree program, which provides a strong didactic and clinical education.

The didactic focus of the first two years is in the basic sciences, including biochemistry, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, optics, and the vision sciences. Some of the basic science courses are taught in combined classes with other health care students. Concurrently, students initiate the study of general optometric theory and methods; general pathology; and the diagnosis, treatment, and management of binocular vision anomalies and ocular disease in preparation for direct patient care in our primary care clinic. In the third academic year, students study contact lenses, pediatric, geriatric, and rehabilitative optometry and develop a deeper understanding and ability to diagnose, treat, and manage increasingly complex conditions concerning anomalies of vision development and ocular disease. Additionally, students begin training in the primary care clinic by providing direct patient eye care. The fourth year of the academic program is entirely clinical with intensive training in university-based or affiliated primary, secondary, and tertiary care facilities. These include clinics dealing with contact lenses, pediatrics, binocular vision, low vision, and geriatric issues. Students also receive training in medical/ surgical t ertiary care settings. By the completion of the program, our students have been trained to be optometric physicians capable of providing quality eye care. Extended (Five-Year) Doctor of Optometry Degree The College of Optometry has instituted an extended program leading to the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree. The extended program is designed for individuals who are returning to school after an absence, are changing professional fields, or who require a lighter course load initially because of family or other obligations. Students in the extended program take courses with the full time students but with a reduced course load. Coursework covered in the first two years of the traditional full-time program is covered in three years in the extended program. The last two years of both programs are identical. The curriculum and graduation requirements for the extended and full-time programs are the same. The enrollment for the extended program is limited. The dean of the College of Optometry will make the final determination on eligibility for the extended program. Tuition for 2011-2012 (subject to change by the board of trustees) is $19,545 for Florida residents and $23,610 for out-of-state residents for the first three years. Tuition reverts to the regular rate for the fourth and fifth years.

(3 credits) College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Occupational Therapy Department 143Occupational Therapy Department Occupational therapists provide services to enhance participation and function in daily occupations, including self care, work, and leisure. Occupational therapists frequently work with individuals when performance has been interrupted or jeopardized by disease, injury, disability, life stress, or other factors. Therapy consists of clients' planned involvement in occupation\u2014purposeful and meaningful activities\u2014that positively influences their life adaptation. This involvement in occupation may be facilitated by supportive training, specialized equipment, environmental modification and/or problem solving to accomplish life tasks. The therapeutic process is founded upon the belief that individuals are the principal agents of their own adaptation, and through active involvement in occupation, can have a significant impact on their health status, recovery from illness, and adjustment to disability. The occupational therapist must be an expert in the knowledge of occupation, its role in health and adaptation, and its use in therapy. Occupational therapy practice requires the therapist to exercise increasingly complex, autonomous decision-making and problem-solving skills in multifactorial situations. The therapist must, therefore, be a critical thinker, capable of evaluating and synthesizing information from a variety of sources about a wide range of phenomena. Finally, the therapist should be a reflective practitioner able to evaluate his or her own clinical reasoning. The NSU Occupational Therapy Department offers an entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy (M.O.T.) degree and two postprofessional degrees: a Doctor of Occupational Therapy (Dr.OT), and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The M.O.T. program is a full- time, campus-based entry-level program. The M.O.T. is designed so that a student may enter after completing an undergraduate or graduate degree from a regionally accredited college or university. The Dr.OT and Ph.D. are postprofessional OT degrees offered through distance education. Accreditation The entry-level Master of Occupational Therapy is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), located at 4720 Montgomery Lane, P .O. Box 31220, Bethesda, Maryland 20824-1220. ACOTE's telephone number, care of AOTA, is (301) 652-AOTA. Graduates of the program will be eligible to sit for the national certification examination for the occupational therapist administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy (NBCOT). After successful completion of this exam, the individual will be an Occupational Therapist, Registered (OTR). In addition, most states require licensure in order to practice; however, state licenses are usually based on the results of the NBCOT certification examination. Note that a felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination or attain state licensure. Master of Occupational Therapy Admissions Requirements The Master of Occupational Therapy Program selects students based on grade point average (GPA), Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, a written essay, letters of evaluation, and an interview.

It is required that each student carry adequate personal medical and hospital insurance. Students may avail themselves of the hospitalization insurance plan obtainable through the university. Master of Occupational Therapy Course of Study The academic discipline of occupational therapy draws upon and integrates a wide range of interdisciplinary topics. Theories that illuminate the understanding of occupation in human life, the role of occupation in health and adaptation, and the art and science of using activities as therapeutic agents create the foundation for the discipline. As part of the regular curriculum, occupational therapy students are placed in fieldwork sites that require all students to be fingerprinted and subjected to a background check in accordance with regulations of the Child Care, Licensing and Enforcement Section, Bureau of Children's Services and Broward County, Florida. Additionally, some placement facilities may require criminal background checks and/or drug testing. Students may, under supervision, provide occupational therapy services to patients seen in the university clinics as part of the regular course of study. A felony conviction may affect a graduate's ability to sit for the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy, Inc. (NBCOT) certification examination or attain state licensure.146 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Occupational Therapy DepartmentRequirements for Graduation In order to be eligible for the M.O.T. degree, students shall be of good moral character have satisfactorily completed the program of study required for the degree (101 credits) with a minimum grade of 75 percent in each oct course and 70 percent in anatomy and neuroanatomy have satisfactorily met all financial and library obligations successfully complete Level II fieldwork within 24 months of completion of didactic courses attend in person the rehearsal and commencement program in the year that the diploma will be conferred Curriculum Outline for Master of Occupational Therapy Program First Year\u2014 Summer Semester Credits OCT 5014 Introduction to Occupation 1 ANA 5420 Anatomy 5 Total Credits 6 First Year\u2014Fall Semester Credits OCT 5011 Occupational Performance and Participation Throughout the Life Span 2 OCT 5800 Applied Kinesiology for Occupational Therapy 3 OCT 5101 Historical and Theoretical Foundations of Occupational Therapy Practice 3 OCT 5013 Occupational Analysis 2 OCT 5121 Impact of Human Conditions on Occupational Performance I 4 Total Credits 14 First Year \u2014Win ter Semester Credits ANA 5533 Neuroanatomy 3 OCT 5123 Impact of Human Conditions on Occupational Performance II 4 OCT 5130 Human Interactions 2 OCT 5963 Fieldwork Issues I 1 OCT 5015 Impact of Environment on Occupational Performance 3 OCT 5174 Evidence-Based Practice 3 Total Credits 16 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Occupational Therapy Department 147Second Year\u2014Summer Semester Credits OCT 6106 Occupational Therapy Practice I 6 Total Credits 6 Fall Semester Credits OCT 6107 Occupational Therapy Practice II or III 12 OCT 6175 Research 3 Total Credits 15 Second Year\u2014Winter Semester Credits OCT 6108 Occupational Therapy Practice II or III 12 OCT 6176 Research Practicum 2 OCT 6150 Professionalism and Management 3 OCT 6980 Fieldwork Issues II 1 Total Credits 18 Second Year\u2014Spring Semester Credits OCT 6350 Professionalism and Leadership 2 Total Credits 2 Third Year\u2014Summer /Fal l Semester Credits OCT 6981 Fieldwork Experience II (40 hours/week for 12 weeks) 12 OCT 6982 Fieldwork Experience II (40 hours/week for 12 weeks) 12 Total Credits 24 Total Hours 101148 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Occupational Therapy DepartmentThe following courses are required to complete the program: OCT 7002\u2014Introduction to Research Methods (3 credits) OCT 7003\u2014Capstone Residency (3 credits) OCT 7005\u2014Evidence-Based Practice and Critical Thinking in OT (3 credits) OCT 7007\u2014Evidence and Outcomes (3 credits) OCT 7010\u2014Theory Development for Models of Practice (3 credits) OCT 7103\u2014Occupation-Centered Practice (3 credits) OCT 7133\u2014Advanced Policy Issues (3 credits) OCT 7302\u2014Contextual Aspects of Occupational Performance (3 credits) OCT 7860\u2014Creative Leadership (3 credits) electives\u2014selected with doctoral program director approval to complement student's practice focus Doctoral Tuition and Fees (Dr.OT) 1.

(3 credits) 156 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Physical Therapy DepartmentPhysical therapists are health care professionals who diagnose and treat movement dysfunction that results in physical impairment and disability. In addition to providing direct patient care services, physical therapists serve as administrators of physical therapy services, educators, and consultants. They screen people for potential risk for movement dysfunction in order to prevent impairment and disability and engage in critical inquiry to conduct and review research. Physical therapists work in a range of settings including acute and subacute care hospitals, rehabilitation centers, outpatient clinics, home health, skilled nursing facilities, school systems, and industrial settings. Physical therapists may work as employees of health care systems, may independently contract their services, or own and manage a private practice. In any setting, for every patient, physical therapists perform a history and physical examination; conduct assessments to determine a diagnosis; select, perform, and supervise appropriate physical therapy interventions; and monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Physical therapists are licensed in all states and may practice without physician referral in most of them. They are integral members of health care teams in a variety of service systems who serve to improve and maintain the quality of life for millions of people. More than 900,000 people a day are helped by physical therapists to restore health, alleviate pain, and prevent the onset of disease. The mission of the Nova Southeastern University Physical Therapy Department is to prepare and advance physical therapists as primary care providers who stand beside other health care providers, in any setting, in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of movement-related dysfunction. In addition, the Physical Therapy Department fosters critical inquiry, research, lifelong learning, and service to the profession and the community. Physical Therapy Student Organizations Student Council The Physical Therapy Student Council is the official voice of all students.

(1 credit) * Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Fort Lauderdale Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 73,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialities and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician /PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the master of medical science degree in physician assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in challenging clinical rotations at a variety of health care facilities associated with the program. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine. Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA). The NSU Physician Assistant Program has enjoyed continuing accreditation since its inception and was recently awarded continuing accreditation until 2015, a seven-year term, the longest allowed by ARC-PA. The department is a member of the Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA). Mission Statement To provide a primary care training program designed for, and dedicated to, producing competent physician assistants who will provide quality health care in rural, urban, underserved, and culturally diverse communities; to increase the accessibility of quality health care in the primary care setting; to prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership roles; and to promote the physician assistant profession.

(54-0-3) Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Southwest Florida Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 73,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical /surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession was ranked the fourth fastest growing profession in the country by CNN.com and Forbes.com in 2007. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician /PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high- quality patient care and professional growth.The Physician Assistant Department\u2014Southwest Florida offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will earn a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in the basic sciences, clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, radiology, psychiatry, legal and ethical issues in health care, cultural issues in health care, interpretation and evaluation of medical literature, complementary medicine and nutrition, and clinical pharmacology. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations throughout the state of Florida, primarily within 80-100 miles from NSU's Fort Myers Student Educational Center. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. Each student should expect to complete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the student. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

Course of Study The Physician Assistant Program curriculum is completed following attainment of a baccalaureate degree, including specified course prerequisites. The comprehensive curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 14 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., although there are occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU Southwest Florida. The clinical year is devoted to 13 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care / gynecology, surgery, and internal medicine. The students also complete three elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required subject rotations and two of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length. All required rotations must be completed in the state of Florida, primarily in an area within 100 miles from the Fort Myers Student Educational Center. Each student should expect to complete at least one rotation in a rural or underserved area. This will likely entail traveling beyond the 80-100 mile radius of Fort Myers. For core rotations assigned by the program outside of the 100-mile radius, housing will be provided for the student.Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, although many rotation sites require a greater student participation. Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a master of medical science (M.M.S.) in physician assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to continued learning.

(4-90-3)202 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Physician Assistant DepartmentPhysician Assistant Department\u2014Orlando Physician assistants (PAs) serve as an essential component of a medical system that continues to strive to provide quality, affordable health care for all individuals. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 73,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many practice in primary care settings, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship of, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high-quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department\u2014Orlando offers a modern program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, the student is awarded a Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instructions in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures, surgical skills, electrocardiography and radiology, and psychiatry. The student also takes courses in the Master of Medical Science program including health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, cultural issues in health care, publication skills, and medical research, as well as a graduate project. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations predominantly in Central Florida. Required six-week rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, general surgery, and one selective of six weeks from one of the following areas: dermatology, otorhinolaryngology, or orthopedics. The clinical year contains one six-week and one four-week elective rotation. With a sound foundation in medical training, NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.Accreditation The NSU Physician Assistant Program\u2014Orlando has been awarded accreditation from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician Assistants, Inc., (ARC-PA).

The comprehensive PA curriculum, completed in a consecutive manner, is oriented to primary care and prepares the student to practice in a wide variety of clinical settings. The first 15 months of study consist of basic sciences and clinically related didactic courses. All courses are required and must be successfully completed before advancing to the next semester or the clinical year. During this time frame, students are generally in class from Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:20 p.m., although there may be occasional evening and/or weekend hours. Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at NSU. Therefore, no requests for advanced placement, transfer of credit, and credit for experiential learning will be considered. The clinical year is devoted to 12 months of clinical training with required six-week clinical rotations in family medicine, internal medicine, emergency medicine, 206 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Physician Assistant Departmentpediatrics, prenatal care/gynecology, general surgery, as well as a selective rotation in orthopedics, dermatology, or otorhinolaryngology and a six-week and a four-week elective. The rotations are as follows: Emergency Medicine (six weeks) Family Medicine (six weeks) Internal Medicine (six weeks) Pediatrics (six weeks) Prenatal Care and Gynecology (six weeks) General Surgery (six weeks) Selective (six weeks in one of the following three courses) Orth opedics (six weeks) Dermatology (six weeks) Otorhinolaryngology (six weeks) Elective (six weeks) Elective (four weeks) Graduate Project (each semester) Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. The six-week elective rotation requires the submission of an acceptable paper on a selected disease process related to the rotation. A comprehensive, written, summative examination is administered as a component of the four-week elective and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. Testing on rotation specialties will be required and must be submitted to advisers at the scheduled times. Weekly Exam Master tests and comprehensive pre- and post-rotation examinations are included. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require a greater student participation.Upon completion of the course of study, students will have earned a Master of Medical Science (M.M.S.) in Physician Assistant degree. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. The role of the physician assistant requires a high level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to lifelong learning and becoming a professional.

Final summer semester (0-0-1) College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Physician Assistant Department 213Physician Assistant Department\u2014 Jacksonville Physician assistants (PAs) serve as essential components of a medical system that continues to struggle to provide quality, affordable health care for all Americans. Their roles in the system will continue to grow as changes in health care indicate. Today, more than 73,000 individuals are in practice as PAs in the United States. PAs provide care that would otherwise be provided by physicians. PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order and interpret tests, diagnose and treat illnesses, perform medical/surgical procedures, assist in surgery, and can write prescriptions in all states. PAs work in most medical specialties and in all types of communities. Many PAs practice family and internal medicine, and more than one-third are in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. The PA profession is one of the fastest growing health care professions. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment of PAs is expected to grow 39 percent from 2008 to 2018. It is the obligation of each physician/PA team to ensure that the PA's scope of practice is identified; that delegation of medical tasks is appropriate to the PA's level of competence; that the relationship with, and access to, the supervisory physician is defined; and that a process of performance evaluation is established. Adequate responsible supervision of the PA contributes to both high- quality patient care and professional growth. The Physician Assistant Department offers an innovative program that lasts 27 months. Upon successful completion of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science Degree in Physician Assistant. The curriculum includes rigorous instruction in basic science subjects, followed by clinical medicine, physical diagnosis, clinical laboratory medicine, clinical pathophysiology, clinical procedures and surgical skills, electrocardiography, pharmacology, radiology, and others. Students also take courses that include health care law and ethics, epidemiology and biostatistics, research methodology, and cultural issues in health care. During the clinical year of study, the student participates in clinical rotations. These rotations include family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and prenatal care, emergency medicine, and surgery, all complemented by three elective rotations. NSU graduates are prepared to work in many clinical areas, both in primary care and specialty medicine.

Because of its highly integrated and compact curriculum, the PA department requires matriculants to complete the entire curriculum at this campus. No advanced placement, transfer of credit, or credit for experiential learning will be granted. The clinical year is devoted to 13 months of clinical training with required clinical rotations in family medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, prenatal care/ gynecology, surgery, and internal medicine. Students must also complete three elective rotations, for a total of nine clinical rotations. The required rotations and two of the elective rotations are six weeks in length. The remaining elective rotation is four weeks in length.Each required rotation has assigned readings and learning objectives. At the end of each required rotation, a written, comprehensive subject examination is administered and must be passed. During rotations, students will be supervised by licensed practitioners and will actively participate in patient assessments, perform common laboratory procedures, interpret common diagnostic examinations, and help manage common medical problems. The work hours during clinical rotations are set by the preceptor and can include evening and weekend hours. Students are required to work a minimum of 40 hours per week, however, many rotation sites require students to work substantially more hours per week. Upon completion of the course of study, students will be awarded the Master of Medical Science degree in Physician Assistant. Graduates will be eligible to take the Physician Assistant National Certification Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants. The role of the physician assistant requires a high-level of expertise and responsibility. The applicant must possess the ability and desire to complete a rigorous academic and clinical program and make a commitment to con - tinued learning.

The program will admit midlevel clinicians, and allied health professionals with diverse education, work, and life experiences who have demonstrated capacity to pursue the course of study and increasingly responsible positions in health care. Areas of consideration include application content, academic record, prior health care experience, letters of evaluation, and personal motivation. In special circumstances, a personal interview with members of the committee may be required (phone interview may be substituted). All interview expenses are the responsibility of the applicant. Admission to the B.H.Sc. program requires the following: 1. completion prior to matriculation of three semester hours (or equivalent) of college-level written composition from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum grade of C (GPA of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale)226 College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Department of Health Science2. an associate's degree in a field of health from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 grading scale or a post-high school diploma or certificate of completion in a professional field of health care with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 grading scale In order for this coursework and education to be considered for credit, an applicant must submit a student-prepared learning portfolio requesting assessment of prior experiences for academic credit. This will describe all traditional, online, military, and other health care education, as well as work-related experience and health care-related conferences attended. A resume or CV , transcripts and/ or official documentation of attendance must accompany all prior learning portfolios. Learning portfolios will be reviewed to determine the amount of credit given, if any, for prior learning only after an applicant has been accepted into the program. 3. documented evidence demonstrating education or experience in the health care field within the past five years. All applicants must show evidence of computer skills through course work or self-study prior to the end of the first term. Students may obtain instruction through the NSU Student Microcomputer Laboratory or other training facilities. It should be noted that many criteria, in addition to academic credentials, play a role in the admission process for the B.H.Sc. program. While the program allows the student to demonstrate academic capability, it does not assure admission to any professional school. Admission to the B.H.Sc. program will not guarantee admission to any other program of Nova Southeastern University. Upon receipt of the completed application, fees, credentials and transcripts, the admissions officers and the College of Allied Health and Nursing will review all material for evidence of the proper education, training, and background to enter the B.H.Sc. program. Transfer Credit Policy Students who have earned college credits at other regionally accredited colleges or universities can transfer these credits into the B.H.Sc. program. Students should contact a B.H.Sc. admissions counselor to discuss how prior college credits can be used to obtain the B.H.Sc. degree. A final and official evaluation will not be initiated until NSU receives all of your official transcripts. You may want to speak to your academic adviser for more information or visit the Transfer Evaluation Services Web site at www.nova.edu/cwis/registrar/tes/. The B.H.Sc. program will transfer a maximum of 90 eligible semester credits including credit for CLEP , proficiency exams, and prior experiential learning toward a degree. Official high school transcripts (showing courses, grades, and graduation date) or a GED equivalent are required for applicants with fewer than 24 college credits. Only courses with a grade of C (2.0 on 4.0 scale) or better will accepted toward transfer of credit. Students must complete a minimum of 25 percent (30 semester hours) of their coursework within the B.H.Sc. program major. Students with credits, health care or academic experiences, certificates, diplomas or degrees from nationally accredited colleges, military training or other educational training / experiences should refer to the section below tilted: Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit in order to apply to convert these prior experiences into academic credit. Assessment of Prior Experiences for Academic Credit Nova Southeastern University has established four different mechanisms for students to convert their prior experiences into academic credit. Students must initiate all requests for experiential learning credit before they complete 24 credits at NSU. Credits will be transcripted after 12 credits are successfully earned at NSU. For additional information, contact the B.H.Sc. Program or the Office of Prior Learning Assessment at (954) 262-8414 or 800-356- 0026, ext. 28414, or via email at miletsky@nsu.nova.edu. 1. CLEP/DANTES/ACT-PEP/Computer Test-Out Students can demonstrate their knowledge in a variety of areas by taking objective tests. The coordinator of experiential learning can provide further information about these tests as can the testing office in Academic Services. 2. Nationally Accredited School Portfolios Students who have attended nationally accredited institutions have the opportunity to write school portfolios. The coordinator of experiential learning works with each student in reviewing the student's nationally accredited institutional transcript to identify courses that may be applied toward his or her academic goal. 3. Full Portfolio\u2014Course Challenge The full portfolio is the process for challenging a college- level course for credit. Through this mechanism, a student presents his or her knowledge on a topic and has it evaluated by a faculty member. A maximum of 25 percent of a student's credits may be earned through the full portfolio process. 4. Standard Grant Certain training courses, military experiences, or licenses may be converted into college credit. This can be done by supplying some very basic documentation. For military College of Allied Health and Nursing \u2014Department of Health Science 227training programs the recommendations contained in the Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experiences in the Armed Forces from the American Council on Education, will be used to evaluate such training for credit transfer. Examples include Combat Casualty and Flight Medicine Courses of training. Distance Education Support Distance education students in the B.H.Sc. Program are provided with NSU computer accounts including email. The student, however, must obtain their own Internet service providers (ISP) and use their own computer systems (IBM-compatible PC or Apple Macintosh and a modem). New students receive an orientation and extensive online technical support online access, online tools and methods, and library resources. Online interactive learning methods involve Web pages to access course materials, announcements, the electronic library, and other information, plus a range of online activities that facilitate frequent student-professor interaction. Faculty members and students interact via online forums using threaded bulletin boards, chat rooms, and email. Students are able to submit assignments as email attachments, through the use of online forms sent directly to program instructors, fax to fax, fax to email, and through WebCT. Some online courses may include electronic classroom sessions. Online students have access to books, journal articles, microfiche, dissertations, index searches, catalog searches, and reference librarians.

General sonography includes subspecialties for obstetrics and gynecology exams, exams of the soft tissues and organs of the body, and exams of structures such as joints and tendons. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of all arteries and veins in the body. Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart. Cardiovascular technology consists of five areas of specialization: cardiac sonography (adult), cardiac sonography cardiology (angiograms and other catheter- based technology). The demand for all diagnostic medical sonographers and for all cardiovascular specialists is projected to increase, primarily due to the aging of the \"Baby Boom\" generation, as seniors are generally more prone to cardiac and vascular problems. The NSU Cardiovascular Sonography Program in Tampa offers didactic and clinical training in two of these specialties, cardiac sonography (adult) and vascular sonography, as an integrated curriculum. Additional course content introduces the student to pediatric cardiac sonography and basic concepts in electrophysiological cardiology. Because of strong interrelationships between cardiac and vascular diseases, the need was seen for a comprehensive program covering both specialties. Also, some cardiology departments and other imaging providers may prefer that sonographers obtain training and professional registry in both cardiac sonography and vascular sonography for purposes of diagnostic expediency and professional flexibility. Program Objectives to graduate competent, entry-level cardiovascular technologists who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic vascular and cardiac examinations to ensure that graduates are qualified to take and successfully pass at least one sonographic specialty national credentialing exam, in either cardiac or vascular ultrasound, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare graduates for future leadership roles in cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular laboratories and ultrasound departments to enhance students' academic skills for pursuing research studies or education in cardiac and vascular sonographyUpon successful completion of the bachelor's-degree level cardiovascular sonography specialization, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Master of Health Science (M.H.Sc.), and later the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) programs. Each of these programs is an online degree program, with the M.H.Sc. having no residency requirement and the D.H.Sc. having a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview Admission to the program requires the completion of a minimum of 33 semester hours of general education coursework. The core of the cardiovascular sonography course of study includes 102 semester hours. The entire program requires a total of 135 semester hours for a student to graduate with a Bachelor of Health Science\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography. The cardiovascular sonography program, both at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, includes on-campus lectures; extensive, hands-on training in our ultrasound laboratory; online courses; and a 12-month, focused or combined externship in a clinical laboratory setting. The graduating student will earn either a bachelor's or master's degree in health science with a specialization in cardiovascular sonography, depending on the program completed. Students will take a combination of general courses in the health science field and focused core courses in the cardiovascular technology field. Examples of general courses include Writing for Medical Publication, Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Principles and Practice of Management in Health Care. Examples of cardiovascular sonography courses include Ultrasound Physics, Cardiac Ultrasound, Carotid Artery Duplex, and EKG. While on campus, the student will spend more than 300 hours in the training laboratory learning imaging skills and techniques and physiologic testing methods prior to the clinical externship experience. In the second year, the student will complete a clinical training program of more than 1,800 hours, while continuing to take online courses. The student may have the option to perform his or her clinical externship in a vascular, adult echo, or combined cardiovascular clinical experience, based upon his or her interests and demonstrated competencies. Upon graduation, the student will be eligible to sit for professional registry exams based upon completion of the program and clinical requirements. Prerequisites In order to be eligible for admission to the Bachelor of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography (B.H.Sc.) specialization, a student must have completed 33 semester hours of prerequisite education coursework with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75 on a 4.0 grading scale.

Northwest Highway Park Ridge, Illinois 60068-2573 www.asahq.org Master of Health Science\u2014 Cardiovascular Sonography (On-Campus, Entry-Level, Tampa) Diagnostic medical sonography includes three primary areas of specialization: general, cardiac, and vascular. General sonography includes subspecialties for obstetrics and gynecology exams, exams of the soft tissues and organs of the body, and exams of structures such as joints and tendons. Vascular sonography studies the anatomical and physiological characteristics of all arteries and veins in the body. Cardiac sonography examines the anatomical structure and function of the heart. Cardiovascular technology consists of five areas of specialization: cardiac sonography (adult), cardiac sonography cardiology (angiograms and other catheter- based technology). The demand for all diagnostic medical sonographers and for all cardiovascular specialists is projected to increase, primarily due to the aging of the \"Baby Boom\" generation, as seniors are generally more prone to cardiac and vascular problems. The NSU Cardiovascular Sonography Program in Tampa offers didactic and clinical training in two of these specialties, cardiac sonography (adult) and vascular sonography, as an integrated curriculum. Additional course content introduces the student to pediatric cardiac sonography and basic concepts in electrophysiological cardiology. Because of strong interrelationships between cardiac and vascular diseases, the need was seen for a comprehensive program covering both specialties. Also, some cardiology departments and other imaging providers may prefer that sonographers obtain training and professional registry in both cardiac sonography and vascular sonography for purposes of diagnostic expediency and professional flexibility. The Master of Health Science\u2014Cardiovascular Sonography specialization at Nova Southeastern University is designed to train highly skilled and knowledgeable cardiovascular technologists at a graduate level. Students will take master's degree-level online courses and will develop professor-monitored research projects for publication and/or presentation in their second year. This course of study will prepare graduates for leadership positions in research, clinical management, and education. Program Objectives to offer an advanced-level, professional degree to those already holding a bachelor's-level degree in a health care-related or science field to graduate competent, entry-level cardiovascular technologists who are qualified to perform a variety of standard and specialized diagnostic vascular and cardiac examinations to ensure that graduates are qualified to take and successfully pass at least one sonographic specialty national credentialing exam, in either cardiac or vascular ultrasound, from either the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) or Cardiovascular Credentialing International (CCI) to prepare graduates for future leadership roles in cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular laboratories and ultrasound departments to enhance students' academic skills for pursuing research studies or education in cardiac and vascular sonography Upon successful completion of the master's-degree level cardiovascular sonography specialization, students are eligible to apply for admission to the Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) program. This is an online degree program with a requirement for students to complete two one-week summer institutes. Curriculum Overview Admission to the master's degree-level program requires the completion of a minimum of 33 semester hours of general education coursework, which may be satisfied within a previously earned bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution.

One is the generalist track. The second is a generalist track with a concentration in global health studies. The generalist D.H.Sc. program requires completion of a minimum of 61 semester hours of coursework. This includes 48 semester hours didactic coursework, 11 semester hours practical coursework, and 2 semester hours for the Doctoral Objective Analysis. The generalist D.H.Sc. program with a concentration in global health studies also consists of 61 semester hours, with the majority of electives and the internship and practicum dedicated to global health topics. The D.H.Sc. program is designed for completion in a distance learning format and requires only minimal on-campus time during two intensive, one-week, summer institute seminar sessions. The residential summer sessions are available at the NSU campuses or student educational centers, with the location varying from year to year. The program curricula are designed to build upon the scientific and general knowledge of the health care professional while focusing on the overall health care picture. Leadership, policy, diversity, evidence-based medical practice, and alternative methods of treatment are but a few of the areas stressed in the generalist curriculum. During the generalist course of study, the student must complete a practicum and internship approved by the D.H.Sc. program director in an area of health care such as leadership, education, policy, or delivery. Students selecting the global health concentration will focus their internship and practicum work in the global health arena. The internship is used to expose the student to an area of health care not commonly experienced in the student's normal area of practice. Though they are two separate portions of the curriculum, the internship may be used as an area of research in preparation for undertaking the practicum. The coursework is professor-paced using state-of-the-art, Web-based delivery. The curriculum and coursework follow a standard 12-week semester calendar in conjunction with resident on-campus programs. At the standard pace established by the program, the course of study can be completed in three years. It is required that all coursework be completed within seven years. Admissions Requirements Prospective D.H.Sc. students are selected by the Committee on Admissions, which considers the overall qualities of applicants and their suitability for this course of study. Areas of consideration include application content, academic record, prior health care experience, letters of evaluation, and personal motivation. In special circumstances, a personal interview with members of the committee on admissions may be required.1. Prior to matriculation, applicants must have completed a master's degree from a regionally accredited college or university. 2. Applicants should demonstrate a cumulative master's degree G.P .A. at or above a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be eligible for regular admission. 3. The Committee on Admissions will make a recommendation to the dean of the college as to any remedial coursework necessary for an applicant to achieve full admission. Prior health care experience is required and is strongly considered in the admissions process. The D.H.Sc. is a postprofessional degree designed for health practitioners, public health professionals, and health care administrators from a wide variety of disciplines. The commonality exhibited by our students is the expert practice of a recognized health occupation at a professional level, or five years of administrative experience in a health care organization with progressively increasing responsibilities over that time frame. The successful applicant's health profession may emphasize delivery of services to individual clients (e.g., PA, PT, R.N., LCSW, etc.) or be population based (M.P .H., M.H.A.). An appropriate level of professional practice is generally recognized by health professions licensure (e.g., R.N., PT), a national certification or registration (e.g., PA-C, RVT, RRT, CRNA, , FACHE), a M.P .H., M.S.N., M.S.W ., M.H.A., M.B.A.), or a combination of the above. All questions regarding the appropriateness of an applicant's qualifications for admission can be discussed with the department chair or program director on an informal basis, but the official recommendations are made by the Committee on Admi ssions to the dean of the College of Allied Health and Nursing. The dean makes the final determination. Successful past applicants and graduates have included physicians, dentists, nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, physician assistants, master's degree-level social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dental hygienists, and athletic trainers. We have recently expanded the program to include health care administrators, and our graduates now include a hospital CEO and an assistant surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service. 4.

Various loans, scholarships, and grants are available to qualified students to help ease the high cost of a health professions education. These financial assistance programs are described in a variety of separate university publications.366 College of Dental Medicine \u2014International Graduate ProgramOpportunities for a limited number of part-time work assignments are available. However, the demands of a program of professional study limit the number of hours a student can work. Policies Related to Academic and Student Affairs The policies regarding suspension, dismissal, readmission and other academic and student policy issues are described in the College of Dental Medicine Predoctoral Student Handbook , which is revised, updated, and distributed annually to all predoctoral dental medicine students. Graduation Requirements To receive a D.M.D. degree from the College of Dental Medicine, every student must fulfill the following requirements: be of good moral character have demonstrated the ethical, personal, and professional qualities deemed necessary for the successful and continued study and practice of dental medicine have satisfactorily passed all required didactic and clinical courses and clinical rotations in the CDM curriculum have demonstrated ongoing and full-time learning of continued and comprehensive patient care, and attended all classes through the last day of his or her predoctoral program have satisfactorily completed all clinical requirements, experiences, and competency examinations have completed all coursework in the College of Dental Medicine within four years from the date of matriculation (exclusive of any approved leave of absence in good standing) have satisfactorily completed all assigned curriculum requirements for the D.M.D. degree with a numerical average of 70 percent or higher have passed the National Board Dental Examination (NBDE) Part I. have satisfactorily met all financial and library obligations have attended, in person, the commencement program at which the D.M.D. degree is awarded have complied with any other university or Health Professions Division graduation requirements Degrees are not awarded solely upon the completion of any prescribed number of courses or upon passing a prescribed number of examinations but, in addition, when the faculty believes that the student has attained sufficient maturity of thought and proficiency. Matriculation and enrollment do not guarantee the issuance of a degree without satisfactorily meeting the aforementioned curriculum and degree requirements. Course of Study The College of Dental Medicine embodies a comprehensive didactic and group practice clinic model curriculum designed to graduate competent and compassionate clinicians devoted to comprehensive primary care of each patient. The college is closely allied with Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine and the other health professions colleges of the NSU Health Professions Division, in proximity as well as in academic collaboration. Early introduction into clinical settings under the preceptorship of faculty members will enable the student to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of the patient/ dentist relationship. It also will reinforce classroom instruction in basic and behavioral sciences to allow for management and delivery of quality dental health care as a component of total body health. Students will be taught the importance of teamwork in an efficient, modern health care delivery system.
