Customer Reviews For Kevin's 12\" Clean Pan with Lid Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I tried to restrict the use of this pan to preparing Kevin's entrees *only* and my wife keeps using it for eggs and other things! It's beautiful and so much better then any other nonstick pan I have ever tried. I love Kevin's. Love everything about it - we have Kevin's dinners at least twice a week, especially when my hubby needs to make dinner (it's SO guy friendly!) So when I caught drift of the Clean Pan, it was a no brainer for me. I love it and have used it daily ever since the purchase (at least a year now.) I love it so much I bought one as a wedding gift. When I was pondering what to get this lovely Bride who already has everything, I knew immediately without a doubt that \"this is it!\" This pan is amazing and we love it! My favorite pan ...but....DONT put it in a hot oven...the handles can't take it.... As a Chef, and FT Working mom of 4 I can't say enough How much I love Kevins Meals! I discovered the Clean Pan when I was gifted one over a year ago. It's the perfect size, Great nonstick coating, my go to pan. Loved it so much I just purchased a 2nd one. I have been using this plan exclusively for atleast a year and it is still perfect! Nothing sticks, wipes clean with ease, big enough to make just about anything but not too big and I love that I don't have to worry about chemicals in my food. Love this pan so much! This is a groovey pan and the size reduces splatter. I highly recommend! This is the best pan I have ever purchased. It works just as it is described and the quality is top notch. I can't believe how heavy it is. The bonus cooking tools are perfect since they won't scratch the cooking surface. I love the size which makes it versatile to cook family-size meals. I would love this pan in a couple more sizes or even a complete set (hint, hint). Love this pan. No sticking, no scratching, easy to clean, ingredients do not run to outside. Only suggestion is make in available in a 10\" with lid for smaller meals. Any plans to make a 10\"? Absolutely love this pan. It's my new go-to and I've been cooking anything and "}
