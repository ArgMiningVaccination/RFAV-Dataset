These arethe bare facts of a life. Career David Ridgway's first degree was in Classics, taken at UCL in 1960; while astudent his mind was opened toMediterranean archaeology as a resultof participating in a cruise to theMediterranean thanks to a bursary. Hethen spent 5 years at the University ofOxford Institute of Archaeology study-ing European and MediterraneanArchaeology as a pupil of ChristopherHawkes, taking the Oxford Diploma inEuropean Archaeology in 1962.

Given the emergency situation and the certain archaeological importance ofthe site, the first excavation campaignwas promptly begun under the of the Superintendency for Archaeological Heritage of Lazio.

The pyramids were spot-ted by a series of ancient stairs that hadbeen carved into the wall of what is nowa wine cellar...\" Thanks for all, Barbara Johnson Dear Barb, Friend of Etruscan News: Many thanks for your letter. We arealways happy to hear from readers whobring us news and suggestions. The dis- covery of the \"pyramids\" you bring toour attention is the subject of twovideos, one by the Italian excavator,Claudio Bizzarri, and the other by theUS archaeologist, David George. See, too, the article in the present issue.Dear Editors: There are always many [Etruscan] things at Christie's and Sotheby's: this year, I have seen two more unpublishedinscriptions on Chiusine urns, one atChristie's and one at Sotheby's! They will increase my chronicle on unpub-lished inscriptions on the net in theRivista d'Epigrafia Etrusca. It will bring to the attention of scholars materi-al that would otherwise remainunknown. Dominique BriquelCNRS, Paris Editor' s Note: We are happy to bring this resource to the attention of ourreaders who are interested in Etruscaninscriptions, and to any who might knowof such unpublished inscriptions.In my paper in Etruscan News 14, Winter 2012, p. 22: \"Early EtruscanThrones in Olympia\", a drawing - ofwhich I was not informed - has beenadded to the photograph of the fragmen-tary Olympia throne back, Fig. 1. Thetwo rings drawn on top of the bronzefragment are pure invention, a misinter-pretation of the curves of the ornamentat the upper break of the relief, easilyobservable in the photograph. Suchrings could never be connected with anEtruscan throne back, as is obvious fromFigs. 2-3. The invention subverts theargumentation of my paper and I shallask readers to ignore the drawing.

I read a letterin Etruscan News 12, 2010 in which you write about a copy (or more) in London(O'Connor collection). I tried to find inRome the volume: \"Manifattura diSigna\" reproducing the Trono Corsiniand another ancient Roman chair, but,unfortunately, Roman Libraries haven'tthe volume (also the AmericanAcademy Library at Rome hasn't it: it ismissing!). Can you confirm that the Trono Corsini of Signa is in terracotta paintedin white? If you are interested about the story of some copies of the Trono Corsini letme know and I would be happy to sendyou my essay which is now in press. Best regards, del sig-nore di Londra, non aveva la mini-ma idea di che cosa fossero, ma che Intanto Le mandiamo in contatto con lui a Roma Tre?First of all I wish to thank you for your interest in the matter, and for show-ing your good will towards this city. The Argentina Cats Sanctuary is the most famous feline colony in the worldand also for it Rome is internationallyrenowned for the care and protection itoffers its animals. So the situationregarding the cats of Torre Argentina isof course in this moment worrying us agreat deal. This Department has notified Dr. Fabio Tancredi, head of the office forthe well being of animals, to informother offices and executives of theMunicipality of Rome that thisDepartment and its staff will firmly pro-tect the cats of Torre Argentina. The town hall of the historical center of Rome has already asked the CentralMunicipality that the feline colony ofTorre Argentina be recognized as aBiocultural Public Property of the his-torical center of Rome. It has also sug-gested that the work done by the associ-ation which takes care of the cats ofTorre Argentina is compatible with theplace, especially so, as under archeolog-ical guardianship and under Italian law,live beings have prevalence of protec-tion over an historical monument. Also the conclusion was that the feline colony and the association withits guardianship, in no way damages thehistorical surroundings , but on the con-trary, it is not only to be considered ben-eficial for all, but also a plus value to it. We also inform you that recently we have put out the \"Council rules for theprotection of animals,\" which is a veryimportant document for the guardian-ship and protection of the animals inRome. Of course it is also very impor-tant that the citizens collaborate in allthis, so that we can really guarantee theprotection of these animals. My collaborators and I appreciate when citizens report any problems thathave to do with the well being of ani-mals and we commit ourselves to beingvigilant that no harm will be done to thecats of Torre Argentina. Thanking You, Marco ViscontiCounselor for Environmental and Urban Green Roma Capitale Roberto Verde UrbanoDear Readers, This is our 15th issue and the 10th anniversary of Etruscan News. For five years we produced two issues a year, one in the spring and one in time for theAIA Annual Meeting in the winter, but as the volume of both news and thedemands of our lives expanded, we cut back to just one, much enlarged produc-tion. We are looking forward to celebrating this 10th year at the AIA Meeting inSeattle when we will host an Etruscan News party \u2014 in association with NYU's ancient studies, Berkeley, and Florida State University \u2014 at a reception hono-ring the lifetime achievement of Mario Del Chiaro. Please join us. We will alsobe seeing many of our friends and readers in the halls and in the Etruscan ses-sions that are part of the program this year. Etruscan studies in the US are now flourishing in classrooms and excava- tions. A number of universities are offering courses on the Etruscans and haveenthusiastic students: Florida State University with Nancy de Grummond; the U.of Mass at Amherst, a \"center of excellence,\" with Rex Wallace and AnthonyTuck; U. of Michigan with Nicola Terrenato; Columbia University withFrancesco de Angelis and on the west coast, Berkeley with Lisa Pieraccini,thanks to Mario Del Chiaro's generous gift to the university. Many of thesescholars have important excavations in Italy. Abroad, Petra Amman at Viennaand Alesandro Naso at Innsbruck, the Etruscan chairs in Italy, and the newlyestablished chair at Somerville College, Oxford, keep alive Pallottino's vision ofEtruscan studies as an international discipline. Unfortunately this year has alsobrought the loss of several beloved scholars in or around the circle of Etruscanstudies: David Ridgway, Brian Shefton, Natalie Kampen, Eve Harrison andother Classical scholars who will be greatly missed. With this issue we bring our readers the Index to volumes 1-14. Our great thanks go to the new member of our editorial team, Joseph Woldman, who pre-pared the index and will continue to work on Etruscan News. The journal Archeo has been most helpful in providing images and material throughout our tenyears, and in this issue in particular our back page article on the Giants of MontePrama has been excerpted from their publication. We are proud that Etruscan News is online as an open access journal, but we want to remind our readers that we appreciate the moral and financial support ofthose who buy subscriptions and make donations, which help in the distributionof the journal. We continue to offer institutions the special price of $25 for was described in the New York Times issue of Thursday, November 8, 2012, see page 15 . We are delighted to report that an agreement has been reached between the archaeological Soprintendenza andthe cat sanctuary, and the cats will beallowed to stay in their present home.Dear Editors: 24 [1977]: 17-30). But his are not nor- mal book reviews - they are explo-rations of books, showing deep readingand an ability to contextualise born ofgreat scholarship. In another age theywould perhaps have been more valued. His wife, Francesca, was from a Sardinian family, and they both hadwide knowledge of Nuragic and IronAge Sardinia, on which they published,for example the 1984 British Museum Occasional Paper, with E. Macnamara, The bronze hoard from S. Maria inPaulis, Sardinia; they both had a longcollaboration with Fulvia Lo Schiavo. Bridge Italy-UK Above all David was the tireless bridge between Italian and Britishscholars: from 1968 to 2002 he com-piled exhaustive accounts of newarchaeology in Etruria, South Italy andSardinia for Archaeological Reports , published by the councils of theHellenic Society and the British Schoolat Athens. These could only beachieved from a great depth of knowl-edge, wide travelling and excellent rela-tions with the archaeologists whosework he reported. Since much Italianarchaeology is published in outlets thatare difficult to find in British libraries,these reports are very precious. Many of his book reviews draw the English-speaking world's attention toItalian scholarship, deftly contextualis-ing them. The book David andFrancesca edited in 1979, Italy before the Romans: the Iron Age, Orientalizingand Etruscan periods, typified his viewthat it is not for British archaeologists toteach our Italian colleagues how to doarchaeology, it is our role to engagewith the discourse of Italian archaeolo-gy. In that volume translations of keyworks of Italian Iron Age scholarshipare made available for monoglot Anglo-Saxon audiences. It is a pity that manyBritish scholars, finding that the papersin the volume did not engage with theirparochial theoretical concerns, did notappreciate the opening that the collec-tion gave them on an entirely differentarchaeological discourse.Furthermore, many of us will also knowthat he spoke a mean Neapolitandialect! Life and soul of the party David was ever the life and soul of the party; gregarious, witty and fun-loving.My sad duty as executor has shown methe extent of his kindness: whatever hethought of a colleague's scholarship, hewas courteous and kind. He knew thedifficulties faced by young scholars,particularlyRidgway, continued from page 1 Page 4ARCHAEOCAT POETRYMuseum, Philadelphia. Here he met hisfuture wife, the Etruscan archaeologistFrancesca Romana Serra. From 1965 to1967 he was Sir James Knott ResearchFellow at the Department of Classics ofthe University of Newcastle upon Tyneand in 1966 he was invited by the lateGiorgio Buchner, of the ArchaeologicalSuperintendency of Naples, to collabo-rate in the publication of Buchner'sexcavations at the Valle di San Montanocemetery at Pithekoussai on the islandof Ischia. As a result of this he held aLeverhulme European Scholarship1967-68 for research in Naples andIschia. In 1968 David was appointed toa post at the University of Edinburgh,where he stayed until he retired in 2003(first as Lecturer then Reader (from1986) in the Department ofArchaeology, then as Reader (from1993) in the Department of Classics). In1985 he was visiting Fellow at theHumanities Research Centre, AustralianNational University, Canberra, in 1990-91 he was Jerome Lecturer, Universityof Michigan at Ann Arbor and theAmerican Academy in Rome and in2002 he was F\u00e9liz Neubergh Lecturer atthe University of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.When he retired he moved south andbecame an Associate Fellow of theInstitute of Classical Studies in Londonin 2003. He was elected Fellow of theSociety of Antiquaries in 1978. Pithekoussai To die after a day on Euboea was a fit- ting finale for a man whose work under-standing the origins of westernEuropean civilisation took as its startingpoint the colonists from that island. Hewas arguably best known for his workon the earliest Greek colonists in thewestern Mediterranean, and his publica-tions about Pithekoussai, on the Italianisland of Ischia, where they first settledin the early to middle 8th century BC.He wrote two important books on thesubject - L'alba della Magna Grecia (Milan 1984), rather characteristicallyfirst published in Italian and then trans-lated into English as The first Western Greeks (Cambridge 1992), and the mon- umental Pithekoussai I with G. Buchner, published in the Monumenti Antichi series in 1993, 14 years after the manu-script was submitted to the Accademiadei Lincei in 1979! Archaeologist David Ridgway was master of the con- cise - but dense - article and bookreview, often showing his characteristichumour, as in his 'Manios faked?'

The shape is that of atype used at Caere, where tourists todaycan still see a group of funerary cippi infront of a funeral mound in theBanditaccia necropolis. similarphallic-shaped male cippi, together withhouse-shaped female cippi, indicate thegender of the deceased that wereinterred inside the chamber tombs. Itsdate is the fourth or early third centuryBC, so it is almost contemporary withthe Genucilia plates from Caere foundin the necropoleis of Carthage. Suchgrave markers have been found outsideItaly only at Aleria, in Corsica. This cip-pus, along with its base, evidentlymarked the grave of an inhabitant ofCaere, buried far from his homeland. In conclusion, there is enough evi- dence (which was developed in the lec-ture) to prove the presence of an archaicEtruscans at Marseilles and Carthage: the fondouk evidence by Jean Gran-Aymerich, Paris The illustrated lecture, \"A First Partnership in the Mediterranean: TheEtruscans at Marseilles and Carthage,\"was presented at the University ofPennsylvania Museum, on October 9,2012, and dealt with the interaction ofEtruscans, Greeks and Carthaginians inthe Western Mediterranean. TheEtruscan thalassocracy, or \"maritime rule,\" one of the three greatMediterranean powers on the sea,shared the rule of the WesternMediterranean: in the northwestern,from Marseilles to Ampurias, and in thesouthwestern from Carthage to Malagaand Huelva (Fig. 1). The \"partnership\" in the title there- fore refers to the close diplomatic andcommercial agreements between greatfamilies of the Etruscan cities like Caereand Carthage. The lectures showedarchaeological material that proves notonly the range of Etruscan trade, but theactual presence of Etruscans abroad insouthern France and Carthage, in theseventh and sixth centuries BC. This is the case, for example, for a fragmentary Etruscan inscription (Fig.2)written in large letters on an amphorafrom Marseilles: it is clearly the endingof an Etruscan name, with the typicalmasculine ending in -e. The Etruscanwho wrote his name on the locally madeamphora full of what was no doubt avery good local French wine, had pre-sented it to the Marseillais as an expen- sive diplomatic gift, probably in thecourse of a ceremony that took place inthe handsome public building where itwas found.The regions of the northwestern Mediterranean that provide the largestnumber and variation of Etruscanimports are: Marseilles Etruscan amphorae arenumerous at these sites, and are even inthe majority during the first half of thesixth century, whereas, during the sec-ond half, the Greek amphorae ofMarseilles appear amphorae, theyappear that ofan Etruscan amphora and a Phoenicianamphora deposited in the grotto of Roc de Buffens at Caunes-Minervois (Aude), in Languedoc at theentrance of the corridor. Thetwo amphoras in (Fig. 3) are respective-ly Phoenician (from the area of theStraits of Gibraltar) and Etruscan, fromCaere, were found together and they hadbeen left as votive gifts. From Carthage comes a very large and rich variety of Etruscan objects dat-ing from the seventh and sixth centuriesBC, from necropoleis as well as, mostrecently, from a habitation site. Fromthe necropoleis come over a hundredpieces of bronze or pottery banquetware; more Etruscan bronze vases havebeen found at Carthage than anywhereelse, with the exception of sites on theTyrrhenian Sea including Aleria inCorsica. One of the most intriguing finds from Carthage includes a bronze stat-uette of a kore, a type well known in Etruria (Fig. 4). It was found, in theearly nineteenth century, at Dar-Seniat,South of Sidi Bou-Sa\u00efd. It is now inter-preted as the votive gift brought by awoman in a sanctuary dedicated to afemale goddess - whether Etruscan Uni-Turan, Greek Aphrodite, or PunicAstarte. The date of this votive gift, theend of the sixth or beginning of the fifthcentury, corresponds to a moment whendiplomatic relations between Caere andCarthage were particularly intense. Another exceptional find proving an Etruscan presence at Carthage is that of Etruscan fondouk , that is, an easily accessible port of call near a large city,both at Carthage and Marseilles, andelsewhere, as at Ampurias and Malaga.There, a ship could find safe harbor, themerchants and sailors could rest, mer-chandise could be unloaded, and therecould be meetings, ceremonies, anddiplomatic representation. TheEtruscans, in the context of long-rangeexpeditions are, by their uniqueness, asubject of permanent paradox forresearchers. Etruscan naval activitiesbeyond the Tyrrhenian Sea appear tofunction without colonial foundationsand their own ports. Rather than trans-porting Etruscan freight on Greek orPhoenician ships, the entrepreneurs andshippers of the most prosperousEtruscan maritime cities appear to havemade use of ports open to their ships andtheir products, thanks to prearrangedtreaties.

The rocky crag accom- modates several consecutive and proba-bly communicating cavities, from whichspring water still flows though openingsin its back walls. It may have been belie-ved that these waters had therapeuticand healing properties; this beliefencouraged the development of a cult ofdeities connected with them. Chemicalanalysis will confirm this hypothesis. The donated votive items belong to different types, with a chronology pri-marily from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC.The ceramics are mainly impasto (espe-cially olle) and black-painted wares (including many miniature pieces andsovradipinti). Many anatomical votives,however, were brought to light; thesewere models of hands, feet, legs, arms,male and female full figures and swad-dled infants, torsos with exposed inte-stines, bladders, breasts, uteri, phalli,vulvas, ears, eye masks, male and fema- le heads and a unique and hitherto unknown type of votive oral cavity. Each votive deposit displayed a pre- valence of one type of object, but not anexclusivity. The objects, concave, werefilled and then sealed with fine clay andplaced in artificial wall niches or on theground with encircling stones arrangedto retain them. Around the source of thespring the ceramic miniatures were laiddirectly on the rock, where the waterflowed over them, as confirmed byabundant calcareous concretions on thepottery and votives. The act of worship also included offerings of food and drink to the gods;this is shown by traces of burning, fromwhich it is possible to identify severalrepeated acts of deposition linked tofires. There had to have been an openflame in direct contact with the rockface, from which the high temperaturehas given it a typical reddish color underthe clear traces of burning. Remains ofPantanacci, continued from page 1 carbon were found on flat stones and tiles, which offered support to the upsi-de down containers - probably similar toclibani - used to burn offerings. Traces of foods such as peas, hazelnuts, shel-lfish shells and bones of poultry andsheep were also found. The primary deposition points are distributed along the walls of the cave inthe vicinity of large slabs of peperinothat seemed to have served as a floor,flanked by points where there is a natu-ral rock support, which could possiblyhave been covered by a wooden ramp tofacilitate walking around. The center ofthe cave has no votive deposits to speakof and is characterized by a rocky bot-tom covered by a layer of fine clay. Itcan be assumed that this area was alrea-dy in antiquity a point of collection forthe sacred spring water, the level ofwhich would have been kept under con-trol thanks to a stone enclosure wall,part of which has been found. The votive offerings of the Pantanacci stipe, together with the evi-dence gathered during the first excava-tion campaign, therefore provide a fra-mework that allows us to outline a welldefined sacred context, whose full mea-ning and connection to the territory willbe made clearer by further investiga-tions. Given the peculiarity of the disco-very and its primarily intact deposi-tions, valuable both in the quantity andquality of the material found, the site iscertainly one of the major archaeologi-cal discoveries of scientific interest inrecent years in Italy and Lazio in parti-cular. Thanks to the efforts of the city ofLanuvio and the Ministry of Heritageand Culture, the Superintendency for theArchaeological Heritage of Lazio hopesto reconstruct the whole site and open itto the public, and to display this parti-cular archaeological jewel within thebeautiful natural environment of theCastelli Romani.

George, Saint Anselm College and Claudio Bizzarri, PAAO Initial investigations have begun on a series of pyramidal chambers carved from the tufa rock underneath the city ofOrvieto, Italy. Dr. David B. George ofthe Department of Classics at SaintAnselm College and from Saint Anselm. The interior of the subterranean space had been filled almost to the topwith the upper section used as a modernwine cellar. However one featurecaught the eye; a series of ancient stairscarved into the wall of a constructionaltype consistent with an Etruscan date. The team initially noticed how the sides of the rock-hewn chamber wherethe wine cellar is now located, taperedup in a pyramidal fashion. Even moreintriguing were a series of tunnels, againof Etruscan construction, that ran under-neath the wine cellar and hinted at thepossibility of deeper undiscoveredstructures below. The owner of the cel-lar, Antonio Pagliaccia, was intrigued bythe mystery and actively encouraged itsexploration. Working with the local inspector for the Soprintendenza per i BeniArcheologici dell'Umbria, Dr. PaoloBruschetti, the team obtained a permit toexplore the feature through theFondazione per il Museo C. Faina.Excavations commenced on May 21,2012, by first digging through a 20thcentury floor and midden complete withold tennis shoes, broken plates and otherearly 20th and late 19th centuryephemera. After moving a meter of soiland debris, the diggers reached a medieval floor surface.However, immediately beneath this floor was a layer of fill that, to the sur-prise of everyone, contained culturalmaterial and artifacts, such as Attic redfigured pottery from the middle of the5th century BC, 6th-5th century BCEtruscan pottery with inscriptions, andeven objects that dated to 1000 BC.This fill layer seems to have beenbrought from various tombs as part of aclearing operation and was depositedinto the pyramidal cavity through thecenter of its apex now capped with amedieval arch. The layer is striking forits lack of Etruscan black gloss ceram-ics; this indicates that the site was sealedbefore the Hellenistic period in the mid-dle of the fifth century BC. It seemslikely the space was stumbled upon dur-ing the Middle Ages and used as a cel-lar. As excavations continued below thislayer of fill, the excavators came upon1.5 meters of sterile grey material inten-tionally deposited from a hole in the topof the structure now truncated bymedieval construction. Beneath this however, was another layer and a set of stone carved stairs -which gave the first hints of the struc-ture's origins - continuing down thewall and turning at one corner, belowwhich it appeared as though a structurehad been built into the wall, perhaps tocontinue the decent on wooden stairs.The material from this context all datestightly to the middle of the fifth centuryBC with nothing later. At this level alsowas found a tunnel running to anotherpyramidal structure; this tunnel datesfrom before the 5th century BC. So far the excavators have removed 3 meters of infill and the pyramidalstructure continues on down. It is now acavernous space rising about 10 metersfrom the current level of excavation tothe present cellar ceiling. The leadarchaeologists are still perplexed as tothe function of the structure though it isclearly not a cistern. Dr. Bizzarri notesthat there is nothing like these structureson record anywhere in Italy or theEtruscan world. Dr. George notes that it could be part of a sanctuary, and calls attention to thepyramid structures that were describedin the literary sources as being part ofLars Porsena's tomb. Lars Porsena wasan Etruscan king who ruled Chiusi andOrvieto at the end of the 6th century. Dr. Bizzarri is, however, cautious that even this parallel is not exactlywhat is beginning to appear here, but itdoes open up intriguing possibilities.Both agree that the answer waits at thebase level which could be 4.5 or moremeters below the layer they have nowreached. The subterranean pyramidal hypogea in Orvieto could offer a unique insight into this civilization and willenhance the work the team has been car-rying out for the past six years at sites inthe area.

The baths, on a sprawling site sli- ghtly off the beaten track in a city crow-ded by monumental attractions, holdtheir own against the nearby CircusMaximus, its shattered walls standing37 meters high, recalling its second cen-tury heyday when it pulled in 5,000bathers a day. But for Piranomonte, it isthe three-kilometer triple-tiered grid oftunnels that lies under the site - the firsttract of which will open for visits inDecember - which really shows off howseriously the Romans took their saunatime. An army of hundreds of slaves kept firmly out of sight of bathers scurriedalong the tunnels feeding 50 ovens withtonnes of wood a day to heat water sur-ging through a network of undergroundchannels that arrived via aqueduct froma source 100 km away. Below that, mas-sive sewers, which are now being explo-red by speleologists, flowed towards theTiber. \"It's the dimension and the orga-nisation that amazes - there is no spa asbig as this anywhere in the worldtoday,\" said Piranomonte. Upstairs, Romans would kick off a visit with a session in one of two gyms,then enjoy a sauna and a spell in a hottub in the 36 meter (120 ft) wide, domedcaldarium - slightly smaller thanRome's Pantheon. The tepidarium thenbeckoned, before a cool down in the fri-gidarium, a space so elegant its designand dimensions were copied at Unionstation in Chicago. \"The side room atthe station where the shoot-out on thestairs is set in The Untouchables actual- ly contained a large cold bath here,\" saidPiranomonte. To complete the experience, a pool 50 meters long and a gardencomplete with lending library flankedthe baths. \"The emperor Caracalla wascruel, but he built beautiful things,\" saidPiranomonte, who is charged with thesite's upkeep. A thousand years after it was built, the ghostly ruins of the massive buil-dings were overgrown and abandoned.\"Because it was on theoutskirts of Rome, no one built on top ofit and the tunnels weresimply forgotten, probably sealed byundergrowth,\" she added. Followingtheir rediscovery at the end of the 19thcentury, Mussolini strengthened the tun-nels when he decided to stage operasamid the ruins overhead, butPiranomonte was less than impressedwith his handiwork. \"Look at trickling through; that'sMussolini's bricks leaking while oursare fine,\" she said, pointing to the per-fect Roman brick arches disappearinginto the gloom. The reopening of a short stretch of the tunnels on 21 December caps aclean-up of the baths. The opera, whichused the remains of the caldarium for astage and kept a stage-set workshop inone of the saunas, has been shuntedback into the gardens. A \u20ac450,000(\u00a3360,000) restoration program alsoresulted in the December reopening ofan underground temple at the baths, lin-ked to the tunnel network and dedicatedto Mithras, the deity whose popularitysoared just before Christianity took holdin the Roman empire. Entering the tem-ple, which boasts black-and-white floormosaic and is the biggest of its kind inthe Roman empire, Piranomonte pointsto a frieze of Mithras holding globebut missing his head. \"Probably takenoff by the Christians,\" she said. A chamber flanked by space for spreading out on during banquets cen-ters on a large pit where a drugged bullwas placed on a metal grill and butche-red. Below the grill is a small nichewhere an initiate to the cult would crawlto be drenched with litres of bull'sblood. \"It was a cruel cult, for men only,so you understand why Christianity gotthe upper hand,\" said Piranomonte. Emerging from the temple, she turns left and pauses before what she descri-bes as her favourite part of the baths: anauthentic Roman roundabout. A largearch leads to the entrance of the tunnelnetwork, where carts carrying tonnes oflogs would queue to enter to feed theovens. Now fully excavated and resto-red, the tunnel starts with a roundaboutthat circles a guard's kiosk to stop a traf-fic jam. \"A Roman spa with a rounda-bout,\" said Piranamonte, \"That I findreally fascinating.\" With the aid docu- ments drawn from the confiscations, theexhibit replayed the long and adventu-rous journey of the recovered master-pieces by examining the illicit traffic-king routes that, immediately after theclandestine excavations, enabled thetransfer of the objects from Italy toSwitzerland, the first important stop.The intricate system for \"laundering\"the goods was revealed, as well as howcertificates of \"legal provenience\" weredevised for each object that had beenillicitly excavated; these had probablyalready from the beginning been reser-ved for the collections of some of the most famous museums of the world. The goal of the exhibit is to make known to the wider public the intensework that was undertaken during theseyears by the Magistratura, in partner-ship with the Carabinieri della TutelaPatrimonio Culturale, the Guardia dellaFinanza and the archaeologists of theSoprintendenza. The archaeologistsagreed to be involved for two veryimportant reasons: the recuperation of avery great number of finds, and thesignificant decline in clandestine exca-vations in the areas of Cerveteri, Vulci,Tarquinia, once the object of actualraids. The exhibit is an opportunity to experience the long and silent \"worldtour\" traveled by the recovered archaeo-logical masterpieces, fortunately stop-ped where it had begun. There are gold ornaments, pottery anditems of war exhibited from the ancienttowns of Alatri, Ardea, Tivoli, Lanuvio,Segni and Gabii, a highlight of which isthe sarcophagus carved out of an oaktrunk discovered in Gabii in 1989. On the ground floor is a library with more than 17,000 specialist volumes onEtruscan studies. The large Veio rooms located in the right wing of Villa Giulia exhibit awealth of Etruscan treasures, most ofwhich have been kept in storage for thelast 60 years. Items on display from theancient city include funerary artifacts,bronze urns, intact and fractured terra-cotta, jewellery and weaponry.

The precarious con-ditions of this archaeological complex,which is still in use today despite thefact that it goes back to the age of theRoman kings, are mainly caused by thelack of maintenance. Bundles of dis-carded electric cables, debris of variouskinds that create a dam effect, unautho-rized connections, the drainage ofmuddy waters, crumbling vaulted struc-tures\u2014these are all phenomena thatseriously threaten the endurance of theCloaca. The recent abundant rains havefully revealed its fragility. The flood ofOctober 20, 2011 has caused the sewerto overflow and inundate the areas ofthe Colosseum and the ForumRomanum with two meters of water. OnNovember 7, 2011, a symposium on theCloaca Maxima organized by theIstituto Nazionale di Studi Romani hasdrawn attention to the critical situationof the ancient sewage system of the city,which dates to the 6th c. BC and stillserves the historical center of Italy'scapital. \"Last year's inundation showedthat the Cloaca is inadequate in relationto the current volume of water and thatit is subject to frequent cloggings. Therisk of inundations, overflows and col-lapses of the supporting structures is toohigh and can no longer be tolerated,\"says Maria Grazia Filetici, an architectof the Archaeological Superintendencyof Rome.\" Therefore last year we organ-ized a global check-up of the sewagesystem in the central archaeologicalarea, so as to highlight all its critical sit-uations.\" A map of the Cloaca at riskwas produced and submitted in Augustto the municipality of Rome. Now tech-nicians are waiting for a response fromthe Capitoline authorities in order tointervene with restoration, unclogging, and drainage work. \"We are conductinga survey of the hydrological and hydro-graphic system, that is, of the sourcewaters and of the hydraulic conduits,both ancient and modern,\" says PatriziaFortini, the official in charge of theCloaca in the central archaeologicalarea. \"The flooding problems haveforced us to check the functionality ofthe conduits and restore it whereverneeded in order to safeguard the monu-ments above. Thanks to these surveyswe realized that the lack of maintenancehas caused long tracts of the Cloaca tobe filled with earth, provoking waterdrainage problems. We have comeacross structural damages and will needto do conservation work.\" Quite signifi-cantly, ground is visibly subsiding inseveral places in the piazza of the ClivusArgentarius, signaling the collapse ofthe underlying structures; in the sectorunder Via di San Teodoro, the vault ofthe Cloaca has considerable cracks. \"Wehave noticed a series of modern draininlets that pour slop water into theCloaca and undermine the stability ofthe archaeological structures,'' goes onFortini, \"moreover, we even foundlarge-scale debris, such as ladders,tables, chairs, not to speak of plasticbags and bundles of old electric cablesthat occupy precious space and causedirt to accumulate.\" Filetici sadlyremarks: \"What the Tarquin kings con-ceived as the great project to ensureRome's safety seems to have nowbecome a serious threat to the moderncity.\" I came, I saw, I constructed by Elissa Blake History and hobbies collide in Sydney's latest slice of Lego architecture.

Vetulonia, Etruscans and Peoples of the Basilicata This small but sharply focused exhib- it is intended to throw light on the char- acter and nature of the relations betweenVetulonia and some of the most impor-tant peoples of Italy from the beginningof the Iron Age, ca. 1000 BC. The cul-tures of these peoples, the Daunians,Enotri, and North Lucanians, who livedin the north-west and southern areas ofthe Basilicata region, developed in con-tact with the civilizations of the trans-Adriatic and Ionian coast. This contactresulted from the Greek colonizingmovements of the 7th and 6th centuriesBC, on the one hand, and with theEtruscans of the Tyrrhenian coast on theother. The exhibit shows how each of these peoples of ancient Italy developed, andhow politics, society, economy and cul-ture were transformed in the course ofthe first centuries of the Iron Age,between the 9th and 6th century BC. Itallows us to compare the progress oftheir \"civilizing\" under the influence ofthe culture and style of life of a moreadvanced civilization, chosen as theideal model to be imitated. The chosenmodel was in turn the Near East, theGreek world of Homeric epic, the worldof the poleis or cities, and finally, for thepeoples of the Basilicata region, theEtruria of the Principes, which by this who was the excavator of Vetulonia andnamesake of the New Museum, thecauldron is now finally once moreshown to the public. In the same sectionis the fragment of a mid-8th centurybronze cup from Poggio alla Guardia.The exhibit is arranged chronologically,marking the various phases down to the7th and 6th centuries BC, when one cancompare the situation of these differentpeoples of ancient Italy - Etruscans,Daunians and Enotrians - at the highestpoint of their development. A breakoccurs between the \"precolonial\" and\"colonial\" periods; by the beginning ofthe 5th century these peoples havebecome fully Hellenized. This phase isrepresented by an object that refers bothto Greek ideas and to the symposiumthat transmitted them: the bronze cande-time had itself been strongly influencedby Greek culture. The Exhibit The chronological organization ranges from the Early Villanovan, in the 9thcentury BC, through the Late Archaicperiod of the 6th century BC. It startswith Enotrian and Italic objects found intwo tomb groups from Vetulonia at theend of the 9th and the mid-8th century.These include a bronze fibula with fourspirals and a bronze sheath for an ironsword. Opening the exhibit in the sec-tion on luxury goods imported from theSyrian Phoenician area is the hugebronze cauldron, decorated with castbronze appliqu\u00e9s in the outspread, discovered in theCircolo dei Lebes of Vetulonia.Restored over a long period of timesince its discovery by Isidoro Falchi,labrum from Ruvo del Monte inBasilicata. The candelabrum is toppedby a bronze statuette representing thegoddess of the Dawn, Eos, with heryoung lover Kephalos in her arms. The objects chosen for this exhibit include ornaments in amber, bronze,iron, ivory and gold, metal tableware,and ceramics with geometric decorationthat had been imported or imitatedlocally. The tomb groups and individualobjects illustrate similarities and differ-ences among these ethnic groups, espe-cially in the various ways they respondto the Hellenic influence that overtakesthe two large areas of ancient Italy,Etruria in the north and the Italic worldof Basilicata in the south. The objectsoften bring out points of comparison notnoted so far in isolated studies.

Restored in Rome, Ambernecklace from Chiaromonte. continued on page 12Page 11A New Addition to the Metropolitan Museum's Etruscan Collection by Richard De Puma An unusual black-figure amphora is the latest addition to the fine collection of Etruscan and Italic antiquities at theMetropolitan Museum of Art, NewYork. The amphora comes from a Swissprivate collection and was first pub-lished in 1963 by Tobias Dohrn, one ofthe most influential Etruscologists of the last century. 1The vase is an excellent illustration of an Etruscan potter's response to Greek pottery prototypes.The shape has several characteristicsthat identify it as a Type B amphora: thebody and neck form a continuous curve;the wide lip flares and is slightly con-cave; the handles are cylindrical (and, inthis case, double) and set high on theshoulder; the foot is an inverted echinusshape. The painted ray patterns at thebase as well as the large figural panelsset between the handles are found onAttic Greek amphoras of this type beginning about 600 B.C. 2 The painted decoration is unusual in that the artist has added six square pan- els or \"metopes\" around the lower partof the vase's belly. These metopes con-trast with the larger and more commonrectangular panels between the handles.It should be noted that on both Attic andEtruscan black-figure Type B amphoras,the lower belly is almost always devoidof figural ornament. It is simply paint-ed black. The subjects are unusual too:each of the six metopes shows a largebird, probably a duck or some otherwaterfowl, in profile. The rectangularpanels depict two fantastic sea creatures,perhaps tritons or mermen, swimmingpast one another and, on the oppositeside of the vase, two large dogs growl- ing and poised to attack each other. 3 Many details of the animals and mer- men are enhanced by incision. A styl-ized ivy chain, almost certainly a sim-plified and less precise version of theivy chains on contemporaneous Atticblack-figure amphoras, frames theupper border large rectangularpanel. is a perfunctory zigzag.Similar zigzags decorate the tops andbottoms of each metope. The lid, whichrises to a pointed conical knob, is orna-mented with a kind of tongue pattern,partly incised and partly painted in asymmetrical fashion. There is a gooddeal of added red and white on the bod-ies of the bearded mermen and the birds,Gaultier (1995, note 1) to painters relat- ed to the Painter of Tarquinia RC 7946 5 and the Group of Louvre CA 1870.6 These painters are, in turn, connected with the so-called Pontic and Ivy LeafGroups. The Ivy Leaf group, compris-ing some sixty vases (mostlyamphoras), may be the output of a single vase painter 7who was strongly influ- enced by Attic artists such as the Amasis Painter, the Nikosthenes Painter, theAffecter and the Elbows Out Painter. Both the New York and Bonn vases belong to the third quarter of the sixthcentury, ca. 540-525 B.C., and wereprobably made at Vulci. Of course,Vulci was a major importer of Attic pot-tery during this period and vases by allthe Attic painters mentioned have beenfound there. Both amphoras are ofalmost identical shape and both show anextensive and highly-decorative use ofadded color, especially the New Yorkvase. In addition, the New York ampho-ra depicts unusual subjects: both the pairof mermen and the growling dogs seemto be exceptional on Etruscan black-fig-ure pottery. Finally, the addition of sixmetopes with birds in the lower bellyfrieze is unparalleled in late Etruscanblack-figure, making this an attractiveand unusual addition to an alreadyintriguing collection.

Milne, Shapes and Names of Athenian Vases (New York 1935) 3-4, figs. 1-4 (where it is called Type Ia) andI. Werner, Dionysos in Etruria: The Ivy Leaf Group (Stockholm 2005) 35-37. A close parallel for the shape is theamphora by themaking this a quite colorful vase. Monika Boosen in her book on Etruskische Meeresmischwesen (see note 3), doubted the authenticity of theamphora now in New York. All of herreasons are stylistic. She believed thatthe awkward, inorganic rendering of themermen's arms (and the absence of aleft arm for the merman on the right sideof the panel) as well as the disposition oftheir fins, and the poor execution of thehanging leaves, strengthened herdoubts. Although she offers nospecifics, she also objected to the lookof the bird metopes and the growlingdogs. Boosen makes no reference to theamphora's shape (which finds preciseparallels in other Etruscan examples;see below note 5) or to the relative skillwith which added colors and incisionsare used. It is not clear from her briefdescription whether she examined thisvase in person or simply relied on theblack-and-white photographs of it pub-lished by Dohrn in 1963. Later men-tions of the vase do not cite Boosen'sopinion and, personally, I see her criti-cisms as an indication of the relativelack of the painter's skills, not the vase'sauthenticity. There are several Etruscanblack-figure vases of similar artistic andtechnical quality. I am convinced thatthe New York amphora is indeed ancientEtruscan. The use of square panels or metopes has a long history in Villanovan and Etruscan pottery. 4Our amphora's painter was careful to orient the metope panels by turning the vase slowly on thewheel while holding an incising tool tocreate faint horizontal guidelines in theleather-hard clay. These are still visibleunder magnification. The four horizon-tal bands, two enclosing each bird at thetop and bottom of each metope, are per-fectly parallel and contrast sharply withthe cursory zigzags that fill the spacesthey create. In his initial publication of this amphora, Tobias Dohrn identified in note 1).This remains the closest parallel for theMetropolitan's vase. It is the sameshape and employs the large rectangularpanels, this time with confronted sirenson one side and sphinxes on the other.The decorative ivy chains are differentbut the cursory zigzags are almost iden-tical. There are no metopes with birds.The New York and Bonn amphoras areprobably from the same workshop, andhave been attributed by Fran\u00e7oiseAmphora, front and back panels.

Celebrating theOlympian ideal, the exhibition featuresancient Greek and Roman coinage, con-temporary work from artists includingRobert Mapplethorpe, Diane Arbus andAlex Katz, advertising labels, and avariety of sculptures, works on paper,antiquities, and textiles. Curated by Ren\u00e9e Dreyfus, Curator in Charge of Ancient Art andInterpretation, Gifts from the Gods: Art and the Olympic Ideal begins at the intersection of athletics and religiouspractice. \"The ancient Greeks believedthat victory at Olympia was owed to thefavor of the gods,\" says Dreyfus. \"TheAthenian philosopher Plato especiallywas of this opinion when he wrote aboutstriving for perfection and the ideal. Hewas an athlete, trained as a wrestler andhis love of the Games is seen in his fre-quent use of athletic analogies andevent, offering a window to Games bothsimilar and very different to our own.The continuity of the Olympic ideal, andthe inspiration that modern artists findin the physical grace of Olympic ath-letes, brings Gifts from the Gods: Art and the Olympic Ideal into the more contemporary realm\u2014with worksincluding Rodin's sculpture ofAmerican athlete Samuel StocktonWhite III and Arbus' portrait of amuscle man contestant. The exhibitionillustrates artists' continuing fascinationwith the ideal human form while alsoexploring the commercial images thatare a major part of the modernOlympics. Though the ideals expressed through the Olympics are put to different uses,they all share a common sense of opti-mism and purpose. A showcase of therich and diverse works in the permanentcollections of the Fine Arts Museums ofSan Francisco, Gifts from the Gods: Art and the Olympic Ideal offers an intimateview of the Olympics as a cultural con-struct and an individual endeavor, bothspiritual and commercial, from theancient world to modern times. AsDreyfus notes, \"Almost 3,000 yearsafter the first recorded Olympic Games,we still see the Games as the ultimatecompetition. It is only the championswho return home triumphant and whosefame endures. Theirs are the perfectbodies creating unbelievable feats ofsheer strength, extraordinary move-ments, and beautiful forms.\"The exhibition reveals how the Gameswere central to Greek culture from 776BC to the mid-fifth century AD. ThoseGames, originally dedicated to theOlympian gods, eventually lost theirreligious emphasis and died out untilbeing revived as an entirely secularevent in 1896. The exhibition's featured coins include images of traditional foot andhorse races in addition to trumpet blow-ing and more brutal events like thepankration, a no-holds-barred wrestlingexamples, which were probably drawnfrom his own experience. To him,divinely inspired art and athleticprowess were truly gifts from the gods.\" Focusing extensively on the perma- nent collection of the Fine ArtsMuseums of San Francisco, and featur-ing ancient coins lent by the SanFrancisco Ancient Numismatic Society,Gifts from the Gods: Art and theOlympic Ideal is an exploration of phys- ical beauty in the context of both theancient and modern Olympic Games. servation work undertaken in Rome.

These are the remains of a wagon placed within the impressive tumulusknown as \"the tomb of the Queen,\" dat-ing from the 7th century BC and locatedin the center of the vast necropolis of theDoganaccia, in a dominant positionoverlooking the ancient entrance to theEtruscan city of Tarquinia. The carriage of \"the Queen\" was recovered in September 2011 in the so-called \"piazzaletto,\" the wide entrancegiving access to the three burial cham-bers. The remains \u2014 fragments of thehub and body panels, rims, and ironwheels \u2014 were skillfully recovered byarchaeologists and restorers workingtogether in the field. Following a moredetailed analysis, they identified theremaining parts as those of a calesse. Among the various carts of antiqui- ty, the calesse is more frequently associ- ated with female burials. It was a morecomfortable means of transport,because it was driven while seated; itwas used not only for everydaywomen's transportation but also for cer-emonies, particularly weddings. The calesse is now being restored by Dr. Ioppolo, from the Academy of FineArts \"Lorenzo da Viterbo,\" who \u2014together with the students of theCertificate Course in Restorationdell'ABA V coordinated by Anna Gruzzi\u2014 are working on the artifact to ensureits conservation and eventual publicexhibition.

In the proto-Celtic of the Golasecca necropolis of cremation burials atPombia, a pozzo tomb dating back to around the mid-sixth century BCretained such special microenvironmen-tal conditions that it provided an excep-tional discovery. The ashes of the deceased, an adult male, had beenremoved from the funeral pyre andplaced in a small urn. This terracottacinerary urn and its cover were intactand created an almost watertight sealafter burial in a fine clay soil. Animpasto beaker full of liquid (about 18cl), was placed inside the urn over theashes, and preserved some of the con- tents. At the time of the discovery, the con- tents had become a bright brownish-redcrust weighing about one gram.Precipitated residue from fermentedsugars left no doubt about the natureof its contents. Its color led us to thinkof wine, but the pollen analysis docu-mented a percentage of over 90% of treeand cereal pollens as well hops. It wasclear that this was the remains of a bev-erage obtained by fermentation of cere-al kernels with the addition of vegetalaromas; in short, a high alcohol contentdark beer. The Pombia find not only provides the earliest European evidence for beerof a high alcoholic content but actuallypredates the use of hops as a flavoringfor beer. Even today, hops grow wildin the moors of the Ticino betweenPombia and Castelletto and is stillused, locally as a flavoring for risotto,according to a recipe described by Plinythe Elder. In 550 B.C the proto-Celtic popula- tions, long before the invasion of theGauls, drank a beer at Pombia that wasvery similar to some of our modernstrong beers. It was dark and reddishlike the cervisia described by classical sources: quite well filtered, made froma variety of cereals and served in a con-tainer with a wide mouth that made iteasy to pour off the foam. The deceased,who lived in a farming area around theproto-urban settlement of CastellettoTicino, evidently liked it better thanwine, which was quite available in thesixth-century Golasecca culture, butwhich was probably often mediocre, sothat he prefered beer as his last drinkand took it with him to the afterlife.(photos MIBAC) Impasto Urn with as found. The Brewing of Etruscan Beer Jane Whitehead A collaboration between Dogfish Head Craft Brewery in Delaware and two microbreweries in Italy--Birra delBorgo and Birra Baladin-- has led to thebrewing of an early Etruscan \"grog,\"the Italian version of a mixed beveragethat was common throughout Europebefore the introduction of grape wine. By combining a variety of clues (archaeological, archaeobotanical, andchemical) from well-preserved tombs,dated ca. 800-700 BC, at Carmignano,Verucchio, and elsewhere, a wheat andbarley brew, in accord with the laterdrink from Pombia (below), is envi-sioned. Other ingredients might haveincluded honey, pine resin or myrrh, andlocally available fruits. including hazel-nuts, apple, and wild grape. Many ofthese ingredients are especially well-attested in Tomb B at Prato Rosellowhere the cremated remains of a war-rior prince were buried inside a biconi-cal krater (left) together with other bronze Orientalizing vessels fromCasale Marittimo/Casa Nocera, (phialesand more exotic types), also containingthese same types of contents. Ofcourse, these natural products mightsimply have served as tomb offerings,but when they are found inside drinkingvessels, one may propose that they wereadditives to the \"grog.\" Birra Etrusca, as it has been dubbed by the brewers, tries to do justice to all thevaried lines of ancient evidence. Itincludes two-rowed barley, an heirloomItalian wheat, pomegranate juice,raisins, hazelnut flour, chestnut andwildflower honey, myrrh, and a touch ofhops (in keeping with the Pombia evi-dence). A special \"heirloom yeast\"\u2014across between a Vin Santo and S.bayanus from Montalcino grapes\u2014wasdeveloped, reflecting what might havebeen available in ancient Etruria, toachieve a suitably high alcohol contentof 8.5%. for Etruscan tastes The three breweries released their individual versions of Birra Etrusca inthe past two months. They fermentedtheir brews in vats made of differentmaterials, again partly based on theancient evidence. Dogfish suspendedbronze plates down into the vats to sim-ulate a bronze vessel, Birra del Borgohad a local potter replicate jars inancient Etruscan design, and BirraBaladin used wooden barrels, which areonly attested much later but whichwould certainly not have been beyondthe expertise of Etruscan carpenters inearlier periods. Each fermenter impartsan additional special character to eachbeverage. (Terracotta fermentation vat).

What has ensued is a fight thathas drawn in city officials, elicited aflood of e-mail from upset cat loversand revealed a deeper clash between tra-dition and legality. The battle has pitted preservation officials against an especially feisty Roman breed of cat caretakers, the so-called gattare. In the middle are the cats themselves, ancient inhabitants whohave been officially declared There are organized volunteer asso- ciations for large colonies of feral cats, some in archaeological sites, includingone at the Pyramid of Cestius, from thefirst century BC, and another at Trajan'sMarket, where gattare have been given a room within the ancient area.

Northern end of Carsulae, aerial view showing the locations of Soundings A, B, and C, excavated in 2012.Carsulae: The first excavation campaign near the Arch of San Damiano by Paolo Bruschetti, dell'Umbria The summer of 2012 saw the first excavation campaign at the northern endof the city of Carsulae, more preciselybetween the monumental necropolis andthe Arch of San Damiano. The excava-tion was organized under the scientificdirection of Dr. Paolo Bruschetti of theSoprintendenza per i Beni Archeologicidell'Umbria and coordinated in archaeologists Dr. Luca Donniniand Dr. andRoma La Sapienza participated. Within the complex of the ancient city, three different soundings (A, B,and C) were opened (Fig. 1), which yiel-ded a large funerary monument with arectangular plan, an underground struc-ture whose purpose and use are not yetclear, a stretch of paved road hithertounknown, and a series of structuresadjacent to the road that are yet to beexplored. Below is a brief description of the major finds that came to light during thefirst campaign; these are useful forunderstanding the objectives of the rese-arch to come. Sounding B Located at the northern end of the archaeological area along the stretch ofthe via Flaminia inside the monumentalnecropolis of Carsulae, Sounding B issituated at the back of the so-calledTower Tomb and corresponds with thefind spot of the Sarcophagus \"dellaFanciulla.\" We began by clearing thearea and exposing the original trench cutinto virgin soil for the deposition of thesarcophagus. We then opened a seriesof quadrants 4 meters on a side in thesurrounding area, which allowed us toidentify a series of walled structuresrazed to their foundation level. Thesewere all related to a single large structu-re. It is thus possible to see that the sar- cophagus was not placed outside, butwithin the remains of a large rectangularfunerary monument (8 x 12 m.) orientedeast-west (Fig. 2). The remains are thefoundations of a building in opus cae- menticum that had been laid directly into the trenches excavated into the vir-gin soil. These foundations have amedian width of more than a meter andare about 120 cm. deep; from this wehypothesize that they supported a super-structure in opus quadratum that has been completely lost. The plan of the structure shows at least two rooms, of which the first andsmaller has a rectangular form orientednorth-south (1.60 m. x 8 m. on the insi-de); the second, almost square (7.30 x8.0 m. on the inside), was the one thatcontained the Sarcophagus \"dellaFanciulla\" (deposited against thewestern back wall and centrally placed).The placement of the sarcophagusagainst the back wall and the dimen-sions of the structure would suggest theexistence of other similar monuments,which must have been already removedin antiquity. At the exact center of the main room was also found an infant burial withinan amphora (enchytrismos). The vesselcontained the remains of a newborn or afetus, now robbed of its grave goods(Fig. 3). At some time, perhaps corre-sponding to the period of abandonmentof the city, the monument must havebeen completely dismantled and thestructures razed to their foundationlevel. The stratigraphy did not producesignificant material that could give aprecise dating to the abandonment andconsequent despoliation of the super-structure. Sounding C Located in the NE part of the traver- tine shelf on which Carsulae rests, eastof the via Flaminia and about 70 m. SSEof the Arch of San Damiano, SoundingC was opened in an area adjacent to arectangular underground structure cove-red with a partially collapsed barrelvault (Fig. 4). Before the start of the2012 excavations, the entire area betwe-en the Arch of San Damiano and thelarge sink hole (near the basilica in thecenter of the city) seemed to be comple-tely unknown from an archaeologicalpoint of view. This was either because itappeared to lack structures of any inte-rest or because already in antiquity ithad been designated for agriculture, per-haps for vegetable gardens (in whichcase the underground structure couldhave been interpreted as a cistern foragricutural use). The excavations, however, revealed a much more complex situation than anywe could have expected (Fig. 5). Infact, that which at first had seemed to bea simple row of limestone slabs definingthe southern side of the cistern turnedout to be in reality an actual curbing fora paved road (probably one of the decu- mani of Carsulae) of which a large part (14 x 4 m.) was found in a very goodstate of preservation. Above the pavingstones, to a thickness of about .60 m.,were the remains of a large dump ofceramic material, mortar, and polychro-me painted plaster. On the sides of thepaved stretch, on the other side of theunderground structure, were found theremains of some walls leveled almost totheir foundations, which seemed tobelong to a reorganization of the area inthe Imperial period, certainly after thepaved road had gone out of use. Thestretch of road that we found was theonly part preserved because it was use- Page 17Fig.5. Photogrammatic image of pavements and road in Sounding C.ful in the new urban plan. With regard to the cistern, finally, the excavationrevealed its whole upper part as far asthe spring point of the vault, and itseems, from a large trench in the cortina of the short eastern side, that it was fil-led in at a relatively recent date. In spite of the still preliminary phase of the excavation research, it has none-theless been possible to advance severalinteresting hypotheses with regard to thetopography of this area. As regards thepaved road and the cistern, evidencesuggests that the two were the result ofa single urban design that must dateapproximately between the 2nd and 1stcenturies BC (thus before the reorgani-zation in the Augustan period, which ledto the construction of the Arch of SanDamiano and the great funerary monu-ments). At least three elements supportthis hypothesis: first, the discoveryamong the paving stones of at least onecoin of the Republican period, a clearindication of the use of the road from the1st century BC; second, the orientationof the road, which is completely unrela-ted to the axis defined by the current lineof the via Flaminia, but perfectly ali-gned with the orientation of the forumarea (thus with the most ancient nucleusof Carsulae); and third, the completeabandonment of the use of the road,whose higher stones come to be enclo-sed within later structures (which arestill to be explored), while at the easternand western ends the paving stones andcurbing blocks were removed and, onthe west end, replaced with a cocciope- stopavement. With regard to the area on the edge of the stone pavement, as we mentionedbefore, we found the crests of severalwalls preserved almost to foundation level on the other side of a cocciopesto pavement that had been put in place ofthe paving stones on the westen end ofthe stretch of road. At present the studyof these structures is quite preliminary,and only through our next season ofexcavation will it be possible to deter-mine with greater clarity both the chro-nology and the intended use of the area,even if it seems likely that they date to aperiod later than the great Augustanrestorations. Both the stone pavement and the walls that border it were covered by theremains of a tremendous dump of rooftiles, mortar, and innumerable fragmentsof polychrome painted plaster whoseform would date to the last phase ofhabitation at Carsulae, when it wasnecessary systematically to dismantlethe city's buildings in order to gather theconstruction materials. In the next excavation campaign scheduled for the summer of 2013, weplan to enlarge Sounding C with the fol-lowing goals: to dig out the under-ground structure in order to determinewith absolute certainty its intended use;to excavate the structures on the eastand south of the stone pavement in orderto understand better their chronologyand use; to open a new sounding to theeast of the stone pavement in the hope offinding further stretches of road preser-ved and ultimately the point where itmeets a hypothetical stretch of the viaFlaminia that predates the Augustan era.(This original stretch of road, perhapsfallen into ruin because of the possiblecollapse of the eastern edge of the sinkhole and thus rebuilt in a place fartherback and differently directed, shouldpass about 29 m. east of the stretch ofroad found in the 2012 campaign). New Excavations at Castrum Novum by M.- L. Haack Since September 2010 a new stage of archaeological research has begun onthe site of the Roman city of Castrum Novum, an important seaside settlementand port of call on the Tyrrhenian Sea,founded in the first half of the 3rd cen-tury B.C. The research project, initiatedby the Museo del Mare e della Navigazione antica, was made possiblethanks to a close cooperation archeologica Gruppo archeologico del territorio cerite association. The project was born because of the will to deepen the knowledge of the his-tory and the ancient topography of thearchaeological site, which is littleknown today in spite of the synthesismade by Piero Alfredo Gianfrotta in1973. The goal of the project is to check the historical continuity of built-up areas from the mid-Republican period tothe early Middle Ages and to understandthe topography of the first castrum, the development, the urban organizationand the population of the Republicanand Imperial period city. The study alsodeals with the port area, its facilities built-up area. In September 2010, work concen- trated on the graphic and photographic documentation of the ruins of the bal-neum of \"le Guardiole\" and the ruins in the sea, visible in section, along thestretch of coastline between \"TorreChiaruccia\" and \"Casale Alibrandi\".Edoardo Bruni (Societ\u00e0 Poseidon)undertook a first campaign of underwa-ter survey to a depth of 100 meters. The remains of the balneum of \"le Guardiole\", traditionally considered aspart of a Roman villa equipped withfish-tanks, consist of eight rooms orient-ed northwest/southeast, facing onto thesouth side of via Aurelia Vetus .Stratigraphic analysis of the walls doc-umented many differences in interpreta-tion in comparison with the conclusionssuggested previously by researchers,now identifying at least four stages forthe complex, one of which may datefrom the early Middle Ages. On the coastline, in the west sector, two dense levels of pottery fragmentswere identified and dated from theVillanovan period, whereas in the east-ern sector, remains of a series of Romanbuildings turned up, among these a sec-ond balneum with an apse, at least 1.50 m. high, and cappuccina graves, partly damaged by clandestine excavations. In September 2011, the mapping of the ruins of \"le Guardiole\" continued.The first stratigraphic soundings weretaken in the \"le Guardiole.\"In front of \"Casale Alibrandi,\" the Sienauniversity team, led by StefanoCampana, carried out the first geophys-ical survey.

Page 18A Special Sarcophagus for a Faliscan Wake by Maria Anna de Lucia Brolli and Jacopo Tabolli In June of 2012, the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici dell'Etruria Meridionale, in its ongoing activity forprotection of territory against illegalintrusions, conducted excavations in thenecropolis of Narce, at the southern endof the ancient Ager Faliscan site, on theslopes of La Petrina (Fig. 1). The inve-stigations have focused on a small groupof trenches, partially explored by clan-destine diggers, near the northernburials investigated in June interestingwas Tomb 1/2012, measuring 2.80 x1.55 m, a simple trench that had beencut through several geological layers,and which reached a maximum depth of1.45 m. Deposed into the simple trenchwas a monolithic tufa sarcophagus wei-ghing 1.2 metric tons, covered by irre-gular stones (Figs. 2-3). Its shape seemsto recall burials: to have been \"stone hou-ses\" for the dead, whose lids reflectedthe ancient settlement's evolution fromhuts to houses. The sarcophagus was laid on an intentional slight slope (7.4%) and it isreasonable to assume, on the basis of theshape of the sarcophagus (as well as byanalogy with what is documented in thesame cemetery), that the deceased, pro-bably a woman, was buried with thehead towards the east. The trench hadbeen disturbed by illegal diggers only inthe eastern part, up to the area of the sar-cophagus. Skeletal remains have notbeen found, with the exception of asmall fragment. The grave goods wereprobably stolen, except for a bronzering, likely on the left hand. In the soilthrown out by the clandestine diggers, abronze fusiform pendant and fragmentsof a cup were recovered, of types alrea-dy documented at Narce, so that one candate the tomb to the mid-third quarter of the eighth century BC. The unparalleled discovery of com- plex stratigraphy in the trench revealsthe ritual practices that took placeduring the funeral (Fig. 3). The sarco-phagus had been housed in a recess for-med on the bottom of the trench, thenfilled with a layer of fine sand. On thelong sides, the case was held in place bya layer of small rocks, covered by a hardstratum of pressed and compacted tufa tufa blocks mixed with clay (Fig. 3). The sides of the trench appeared to belined, at a higher level, by some verticaltufa slabs. This complex stratigraphycan be read as the result of actions toprotect the sarcophagus. The excavation of the remaining soil in the sarcophagus permitted us to reco-gnize on the bottom, inside the chest,the presence of a drainage channel in theform of a \"Y\" ending in a circular holeat the foot of the body (Fig. 4). Majorstonecutting operations in the mid-8thcentury are certainly surprising. A cur-rent survey of sarcophagi from Narcestored in several different museums isallowing us to find other examples ofsuch a peculiar feature of the tomb, usedas recently as the second half of the 6thcentury BC. Since the natural process of putre- faction involves a substantial liquefac-tion, the channel may reveal a specificfunction for the outflow of the first slur-ry, then perhaps of all the organic tissuesof the body, preventing the persistenceof residues in the sarcophagus. Theslope of the sarcophagus, with an incli-ne opposite to that of the natural tufa,together with the slope of the bottom ofthe chest, could have been intended forthe flow of the fluids, which normallytend to concentrate at the feet of thedeceased, into the channel. This hypo-thesis may suggest that the woman wasexposed for a short time inside the sar-cophagus before it was closed by itscomplex ritual deposition of fillinglayers into the trench. The dispersal of\"unclean\" fluids during this exposuretime would have allowed the body to bepreserved within the sarcophagus, andsymbolically purified before the finalclosing. The sarcophagus was removed from the site by crane and is now displayedin the Museo documentedin the majority of sarcophagus burials atNarce, it was covered not with a realcover, but by irregular blocks. Abovethis covering it was possible to identify,in succession, a thick layer of coal andclay, then a layer of sand and small frag-ments of pozzolana.

Ewell andTaylor have also identified an area ofiron-working which may have contin-ued in usage from Etruscan to Romantimes. Adjacent to the artisans' zone isan Etruscan sanctuary of the 2nd centu-ry B.C., featuring altars, votive pits andofferings of vessels and foodstuffs, fre-quently burned and broken. A remark-able find in 2008 was an offering of abowl of cooked chickpeas flanked by awine goblet, evidently considered anappropriate meal for the gods. The sanc-tuary also yielded abundant remains ofgrain, apples, grapes and olives of theEtruscan period, all burnt and thus car-bonized.

A collaborative team of American universities and Italian scientists, exca-vating in May and June of 2012 in theRoman levels of the well, have retrievedsome 150 specimens of grape pips,along with numerous other indicationsof plant and animal life 2000 years ago.Professor de Grummond credits theItalian firm of Ichnos: Archeologia, Ambiente e Sperimentazione for the vision of the possibilities of the projectas well as for the successful conquest ofthe challenging conditions at a depth of97 ft. below ground level. \"FrancescoCini, the president of Ichnos, told metwo years ago that one of the mostimportant objectives in this well wouldbe to find scientific evidence of thegrapes grown in Chianti in antiquity, \"said de Grummond, \"and now our wish-es have come true.\" The wet conditions in the well favor the excellent preservation of all sorts oforganic matter and allow for types ofanalysis not usual for excavations atland sites. \"In have Cetamura,\" said deGrummond, referring to burnt examplesfound in a sacred Etruscan offering, \"butthey were carbonized and did not allowinvestigation into the variety of grapes.With all of these new samples, there isthe chance that scientists may be able toidentify DNA and tell us a great dealabout the vineyards and the consump-tion of grapes in the Roman period.\" The samples have been entrusted to thelaboratory of Prof. Gaetano Di Pasqualeat the University of Naples, whereMauro Buonincontri, a doctoral studentand member of the Ichnos team, willcarry out the appropriate analysis.

They belong to an archaic type originating in Greece thatencloses the leg and has the line of theinside calf muscle indicated. The hollo-wed-out upper part is very high androunded, reaching just under the kneewithout completely enclosing the knee-cap, in contrast to the later form datingfrom the end of the 6th century to thebeginning of the 5th. The type is atte-sted in central peninsular Italy in the lastthird of the 7th century (at Fabriano andPitino di San Severino in the Marche,for example), but it is more frequentlyused in Etruria during the 6th century, asin the Tomba dei Flabelli in Populonia(before 560). This is the type that ismost frequently represented in scenes ofbattle, when the equipment of the hopli-tes is precisely delineated, up to the lastthird of the 6th century. It is greaves ofthis type that are worn, for example, byone of the hoplites opposing Heracleson one of the revetments of the combatchariot from the tomb at Castel SanMariano in Umbria (around 530-520).The principal difference in the canonicalGreek and Etruscan series lies in theabsence of the line of holes for attachingthe inner lining made of perishablematerial, of which one must take intoaccount in a precise typological study. The two greaves are similar, but per- haps not completely identical. Thus, ifone compares the borders of the upperpart, near the inside of the calf: the rightgreave (a), on the edge toward the insi-de, displays a series of three parallelincisions, a smooth band, then a seriesof three parallel incisions; the left grea- ve (b), at the same place, has only one series of three parallel incisions alongthe edge. As concerns the decoration, by com- bining the photographs we manage torestore the composition of the whole,which is the same symmetrically on thetwo leg pieces. I made a poor sketch ofthe composition of the left greave togive myself an idea (see fig. 1). The central group consists of Heracles, who lunges forward whilebrandishing his club (?) above the headof a giant; he is already on the ground and may be Alkyoneus. There are simi-lar examples, following the Argiveshield plaques of the 7th century, inwhich Heracles pulls the giant's hair.Alkyoneus holds the end of Heracles'club (unless he brandishes a large rock\u2014 it is not clear in the photos).Normally this combat is representedalone, but there exist indications sugge-sting that the combat of Heracles andAlkyoneus was part of theGigantomachy, since in effect the figureon the right of the sketch should beHephaistos holding in two tongs thefirebrands that he is getting ready tothrow onto the giants. The theme isattested in Attic ceramics since Lydos(deinos of the Acropolis), and a frag-ment from Gravisca attributed toExekias represents the Gigantomachywith Hephaistos holding two bellows. The figure on the left remains to be identified. He is shown in profile viewand may be slightly raising his head.We can reconstruct the position of hisright arm on the basis of a photo of theleft greave, where we see one hand rightnext to that of Heracles. He holds some-thing that is not clear. Is it a masculineor feminine figure? A divinity? It is nota Giant, but why not Gaia? Does itssymmetrical position with the figure ofHephaistos indicate that it may be agoddess? The hairstyle of three separa-te tresses, on the right greave, mightalso be suitable for a masculine figure(see the dancer and one of the banque-ters in the Tomb of the Lionesses atTarqunia) such as Apollo. In this case, Ibelieve that one must see the objectsthemselves: other hypotheses are possi-ble. The composition of the whole must derive from well known models onbronze chariot revetments from the wor-kshops of Vulci of the third quarter ofthe 6th century. The way in which theGiant is held by the hair is found in thecombat between Zeus and a Giant onone of the plaques on War Chariot Ifrom Castel San Mariano. The place-ment of the club (if that is actually whatone sees) with the point forward appearson a plaque from War Chariot II fromthe same tomb (later one finds it morefrequently) as well as the general place-ment of the figure: Heracles is lungingagainst his adversaries in the center,while two characters face the combat oneither side. This specific compositionalso evokes a great later work, the pla-que from the pediment of Temple A atPyrgi (around 460), which represents anepisode from the Seven Against Thebes,but has at the same time been interpre-ted as a Gigantomachy scene. There areonly two supplementary figures, butotherwise the general composition is thesame. The style of the right greave seems rather close to the most recent chariotrevetment plaques of the archaic series,that is, from around 530-520 B.C. Thepreserved part of Hephaistos' profile,with a slightly curved and pointedbeard, recalls the figure of Zeus onChariot I from Castel San Mariano, forexample, but one obviously must see theobject to be sure. The design of the right greave is very carefully done and more precisethan that of the left greave. The lattercould be a copy of the right greave,taking into account what has been saidabout the differences in the treatment ofthe border. The style of the faces in theleft greave might still be dated to the 6thcentury, possibly a little later (for theprofile of the figure of Hephaistos, com-pare the profiles in the Tomb of theOlympiads, perhaps around 520-519).Likewise, the beardless face of Heracleson the right greave seems close to that ofthe figures on the first generation ofAttic red-figure vases. There are many historical comments that one could make on the choice of thetheme of the Gigantomachy, on themanner of representing Heracleswithout a beard (at least on the left grea-ve) and on the presence of Hephaistosbehind the hero, but one must wait tosee the objects before going further. The pair of decorated greaves from Aleria is a unique work, both for the ori-ginality of the decoration and for thesupport \u2014 no known Etruscan greaveseems to bear such a complex decora-tion. If we hold to a high date, around530-520 for the right greave at least, thisalso poses important questions about thehistory of the beginnings of the Etruscannecropolis. But all these observationsare extremely provisional and suggesti-ve, since they are not based on a directexamination of the pieces. Fig. 1.

The Working Group, whose main referent is Dr. Friederike Bubenheimer-Erhart (University of Vienna), intends tostrengthen re-anchor the ofthe Etruscans and Italics in Universitycourses of Classics departments,encouraging and promoting lectures andtalks on these subjects and supportingthe number of interested young scholars,which is increasing. As the main bibli-ography in these disciplines is in Italian,another aim of the Working Group is topromote translations into German ofimportant Italian studies. Through anup-to-date and rich Web site, regularAugust Kestner-Museum of Hanover, socalled in honor of the important Germanarchaeologist and collector, and the newresearch by Anne Viola Siebert onKestner's role in the study ofEtruscology provided a background tothe third meeting, which, organized forthe 7th of January 2012 by Siebert her-self, was dedicated to the specific topicof the history of Etruscan and Italicscholarship and collections in theGerman-speaking countries. The aimwas to explore the role of these studiesin particular historical and political peri-ods, like the Nazi years, and to addressimportant German or German-speakingscholars (Hans M\u00fchlestein, Otto-Wilhelm and collections (theCastellani Collection in theKunsthistorisches Museum of Vienna).

This reconstructed vestige is the center of Dioses y h\u00e9roes de la antig\u00fce- dad, Gods and Heroes of Antiquity,which deals with \"Los siete contraTebas,\" the Seven Against Thebes. Itfeatures sculptures of Greek godsandurns and vases decorated with mytholo-gical scenes. Labels accompany thearchaeological pieces, which tell usabout Greek mythology (or remind uswhat we have learned and forgottenyears ago in school): they tell us storiesabout Athena, Zeus, Hercules, Minerva,and the Sphinx , among others. An audioguide is also available. This exclusive exhibition has been sent from the Museo NazionaleArcheologico of Florence and the archa-eological museum of Siena; this is onlythe second time the exhibtion has leftItaly. It is the most important historicaland archaeological exhibition this yearin Chile. \"One of our main objectives is tomaintain relations with the mostfamous museums in the world.

Careful analysis and restoration have restored the funerary offerings ofthe Second Melone of Sodo to their for-mer beauty. This archaeological siteconsists of 15 untouched tombs datingfrom the end of the 7th century to thebeginning of the 6th century BC. Thediscovery of these Orientalizing tombshas confirmed the hypothesis of somehistorians who believed that Cortonawas a multicultural town open to bothGreek and Eastern cultures. The exhibition is spread over four halls and shows all the different phasesof archaeological finds restored by theCentro di Restauro The exhibition explains theprocess from the digging, through therecovery of materials (ceramic, iron,bronze, etc) and the possible micro-excavation of the finds in the laboratory;it describes the phases of diagnosis,restoration, cleaning, assembling, andintegration up to the complete restora-tion of the finds before they are perma-nently displayed at the MAEC Museum.Valuable bucchero vases, amber jewelsand necklaces, ivory jewelry, weapons,armor, and bronze objects are only someof the finds that tell the life of a warrioraristocracy where women played a veryimportant role, and a flourishing econo-my based on trade, agriculture, and ani-mal breeding. There is originality in the design and planning of the exhibit through newtechnologies, such as impressive 3Dpresentations, and through workshopsand other interactive activities.

It exhibited materials found inexcavations on his vast estates. In 1865the Royal Museum of Palermo, which atthat time was in process of formationand in need of a home, acquired the col-lection. It is without doubt one of themost important collections of Etruscanartifacts in Italy and includes approxi-mately 10,000 objects. Since 1869 the collection has been housed at the Museo ArcheologicoRegionale Antonino Salinas in Palermo.The Casuccini Collection is very signifi-cant from the point of view of the cul-tural history and archaeological heritageof the city of Palermo; the high qualityof its many objects offers a completeand homogeneous testimony to the arti-stic production of ancient Clusium. The Regional Archaeological Museum Antonino Salinas, whose corewas formed in 1814 at the Museum ofthe University of Palermo, contains anextraordinary wealth of cultural materialspanning from the Palaeolithic to themodern age. A restoration of the buil-ding is currently in progress, after whicha new systematic and scientific exami-nation of the archaeological and artisticcollections is planned: a) to illustrate theprocess of the formation of the Museum,which was born from the aggregation ofcollections of diverse types and origins,and b) to provide a wide overview andchronologically accurate history ofwestern Sicily through its most impor-tant archaeological sites. This exhibition is a sort of \"test run\" for the new public presentation ofEtruscan Collection, before its ultimate-ly permanent installation in the newMuseum Salinas. The introductory sec-tion presents archival documents andbooks belonging to the library of theMuseum Salinas published in the 18thand 20th centuries, which pertain to the\"discovery\" of Etruscan art. The exhibi-tion then unfolds in chronological order,starting with a canopic head, a testimo-ny of the first funeral customs of thenorthern interior. The tour continues with Archaic funerary sculpture, figural ceramicsimported from Greece and others produ-ced in Etruria. Of note are the famousbilingual kylix by the Andokides Painterand the oinochoe in bucchero pesante depicting the myth of Perseus andMedusa. Archaic section closeswith material from the tumulus ofPoggio Gaiella, which has been traditio-nally associated with king Porsenna; itis known for its imposing monumentalcircular stairway and the famous cinera-ry statue known as Plutone. Afterwards come a few objects from the Classical period, finely engravedmirrors and other objects in bronze andivory. These are followed by a broadselection of materials from theHellenistic period, including sarcophagidecorated in relief and numerous urns inalabaster, travertine and terracotta. The exhibition closes with a section on the Archaeological Museum inPalermo, the history of its formation, thefigure of Antonio Salinas and the resto-ration work currently involving the buil-ding. Museo Civico Marinella, Castello \"Museo del Mare e della Navigazione Antica\" present the inauguration of \"The Museum of the Etruscans in 3D\" December 14, 2012 The Civic Museum of Santa Marinella, established in 1993, wastransformed after several years of effortinto the significant \"Museum of the Seaand Ancient Navigation.\" In 2005 itwas awarded the Regional Quality Award and became a scientific and cul-tural landmark for the northern coast ofLazio. This new museum and its multi-media section will now form the princi-pal core of the \"ExtraordinaryMuseums\" of the Castle of Santa Severaand the archaeological area of Pyrgi. The new museum is divided into various rooms within the courtyardwalls of the Castle of Santa Severa(above); it incorporates 3D video pro-jections with audio guides, which pre-sent a unique and engaging view of thedaily life and habits of the ancientEtruscans. \"It's the only museum of itskind in Italy,\" said Director Enei. \"Itwill allow us to enhance and promoteeven more of our precious and rarehistorical and archaeological resources.In spite of the limited resources alloca-ted to culture, we were able to achieve,with the help of Coop. Fuori Centro, the'Historia' association and, with the strong support of the city, this majorproject, which further enhances theCastle of Santa Severa. It is preciselythe Castle itself,\" continued Enei, \"thatthe district, with the help of these insti-tutions, is moving to ensure; we areworking toward the preservation of thisvaluable site for culture, tourism andemployment, to its restoration for ourcitizens and visitors from around theworld.\" \"Due to our laser scanning project carried out at the Necropolis ofCerveteri and Tarquinia,\" added Dr.Barelli, \"we were able to reproduce, inthree dimensions, details and features ofthe tombs themselves that otherwisewould not be visible. It is an extraordi-nary, unique project for its kind. We willpromote it widely throughout Europe,so that many visitors can discover thebeauty of our territory.\"\"It is the active collaboration,\" said the Mayor of Cerveteri, AlessioPascucci, \"between the municipalitiesof the area that leads us to achieveresults like these. And all will benefitfrom the tourism and the economicgrowth resulting from it. We must conti-nue on this path.\" \"I agree with Mayor Pascucci,\" finally concluded Roberto Bacheca. \"Iam certain that other collaborations willcontinue in the future in other sectors,such as health, transport and tourism.Likewise the battle will continue for thefuture of the Castle of Santa Severa.Complete privatization would be mad-ness, after having spent more than \u20ac 12million for the castle's restoration andredevelopment. A province cannot payfor the neglect of decades of regionalextravagance, and we will continue towork together in committee and withour local administrations, to avoid thatscenario and to make the Castle of SantaSevera a real point of cultural excellen-ce for all of Southern Etruria.

Page 24 Bronze Landmark Exhibition at the Royal Academy, London The Royal Academy's landmark exhibition, Bronze , celebrates the remarkable historical, geographical and stylistic range of this enduring medium.The exhibition brings together outstand-ing works from the earliest times to thepresent in a thematic arrangement that isfresh and unique. With works spanningover 5,000 years, no such cross-culturalexhibition on this scale has ever beenattempted. The exhibition features over150 of the finest bronzes from Asia,Africa and Europe and includes impor-tant discoveries from the Mediterraneanas well as archaeological excavations.Many of the pieces have never beenseen in the UK. Arranged thematically, Bronze brings together outstanding works fromantiquity to the present. Different sec-tions focus on the Human Figure,Animals, Groups, Objects, Reliefs,Gods, Heads and Busts. The exhibitionfeatures stunning Ancient Greek,Roman and Etruscan bronzes, throughto rare survivals from the Medieval peri-od. The Renaissance is represented withthe works of artists such as Ghiberti,Donatello, Cellini, and laterGiambologna, De Vries and others.Bronzes by Rodin, Matisse, Picasso,Moore, Bourgeois and Koons are repre-sentative of the best from the 19th cen-tury to today. Bronze has beenemployed as an artistic medium for overfive millennia. It is an alloy consistingmainly of copper, with lesser amountsof tin, zinc and lead. Due to its inherenttoughness and resistance, the material'suses over the centuries have beenremarkably varied. A section of theexhibition is devoted to the complexprocesses involved in making bronzes,enabling visitors to explore how modelsare made, cast and finished by a varietyof different techniques. The exhibitionoffers a unique exploration of artisticpractice, an understanding of the physi-cal properties and distinctive qualities ofbronze, and the rare opportunity to seethe very best examples in one place. Among the earliest works in the exhibition is the 14th-century BCbronze and gold Chariot of the Sun(National Museum, Copenhagen),Denmark's national treasure; ancientChinese ritual vessels, including oneimpressively large example of the type'zun' of zoomorphic form, Elephant-shaped vessel, Shang Dynasty,1100-1050 masterpiece Etruscan of Arezzo, c. 400 BC (MuseoArcheologico Nazionale, archaeological include whichwas discovered off the coast of Sicily in1998 and acknowledged as one of themost important antiquities retrievedfrom Italian waters. The impressivePortrait of King Seuthes III, earlyHellenistic period (NationalArcheological Museum, Sofia), found in2004 during archaeological excavationsin Bulgaria is another major highlight,as is the Crosby Garrett Helmet, aRoman cavalry helmet found inCumbria in 2010 and now in a privatecollection. The exhibition benefits from an extremely strong representation ofRenaissance bronzes. These includeGhiberti's St. Stephen, 1425-29, madefor one of the external niches on thechurch of Orsanmichele, Florence;Rustici's monumental ensemble of St.John the Baptist Preaching to a Leviteand a Pharisee (1506-11) that for nearly500 years was set above the north doorof the Florence 1611(Bayerisches Nationalmuseum,Munich). Works from the 19th century to today include Rodin's The Age ofBronze, c. 1876 (Victoria Young,1951 (Minneapolis Institute of Arts),Johns' Ale Cans, 1960 (LudwigMuseum, Cologne) and Bourgeois'Spider IV, 1996 (The EastonFoundation, New York).

Giants, continued from page 39 Unresolved questions Thus there are still many open que- stions, even after the careful restorationwork, to which answers can only beoffered after excavation at the site ofMonte Prama is resumed. The resum- ption of the excavation should revealwhether the statues were closely con-nected with the tombs. Many see a closeconnection between the necropolis andthe statues, which are dated on the basisof one of the few grave offerings foundwithin the tombs, a scarab from the endof the 8th c. BC. While this dating isshared by several scholars, others consi-der the statues to be older by analogywith the small bronzes. The uniqueness of the boxers, archers, and warriors does not help toresolve the dispute between supportersof the \"higher\" and \"lower\" dates, butthe presence of nuraghi models in con- nection with the statues may furnishsome new elements. As we have seen,the nuraghe models are well documen-ted in sacred contexts datable to betwe-en the 11th and 9th centuries BC. Thepresence of these nuraghi models sug-gests the hypothesis, already advancedby many scholars, that there existedsome building, more or less connectedto the necropolis, in which the sculptu-res were placed. A final question: Who sculpted the Monte Prama statues, which, if oneaccepts the higher dating, are the mostancient representations in the round ofhuman figures in the westMediterranean? The long tradition ofstone work among the inhabitants ofSardinia, the close relationship betweenstone statuary and the numerous bron- zetti, the many nuraghi models in Nuragic Sardinia, imply that they werethe work of Nuragic artisans.

BC Sanctuary Near Ardea in Latium Mario Torelli, University of Perugia April 2, 2013, U C, Berkeley One of the major discoveries of the last decade in the field of archaic Italy isthe site of the long-sought Castrum Inui,a minor settlement of mentioned by Vergil inAeneas' nekyia (6.775). The site takes the name from an obscure divinity ofArdea, Inuus, and has the appearance ofa castrum, inside of which there is thesanctuary of Inuus with three well pre-served temples. The literary and reli-gious evidence brings us to identify thegod Inuus with the local version of thegod venerated in Lavinium under thename of Indiges, subsequently (Dion.Hal.1.64.5).

A too nar-row focus, however, itself risks obscur-ing the broader way in which concep-tions of Roman error have informeddiverse modes of intellectual and cultur-al activity from the pre-modern to themodern period. In addressing this topic,therefore, this conference seeks to gobeyond a merely thematic discussion tore-examine the connections between\"Roman error,\" broadly conceived, andbasic features of including: misunderstanding andmisprision, repetition and difference,the subject's relation to a (rememberedor unconscious) past, performance andillusion, and the links between text andimage. If the Romans \"erred,\" what arethe consequences for Rome's inheritorsas they attempt to construct a stablerelation to Rome as a flawed \"source\" ormodel? We ask not simply, \"Are Rome'serrors ours?\" but, \"How does Romanerror figure in the reception of Romeitself?\" The international roster includes twelve speakers, six from the US, fivefrom the UK, and one from Germany(see below).

JOURNALS Page 31E-JOURNALSEU Funding of Promet Project for Metal Artifact Conservation The Mediterranean region is home to numerous museums and historical sites housing metal objects that providean invaluable window into the past. Conservation scientists have devel- oped a coherent restoration and preser-vation policy with innovative corrosion-protection systems combined with state-of-the-art portable technologies forassessing corrosion. EU funding of thePromet project enabled the consortiumto develop and test corrosion inhibitorsand coatings as well as physical vapourdeposition (PVD) and plasma-enhancedchemical vapour deposition (CVD) bar-rier films. for non-destructive ele-mental analysis of the chemical compo-sition of a sample. Collections evaluat-ed included archaeological museumsand excavation sites as well as collec-tions of coins and knights' armour. Promet concepts have the potential to enable widespread use of protectivecoatings and implementation of low-cost on-site assessments of corrosion ofarchaeological and historical collec-tions. This may ensure protection of anamazing cultural heritage of metallicobjects in the Mediterranean region sub-ject to high humidity and salt-water cor-rosion. contact TEI of Athens Dr. Ag.Spyridonos, 122 10 Aigaleo, Greece,www.promet.org.gr The Ancient World Online Open Access Journal FASTI: A database of archaeological excavations since the year 2000 Between 1946 and 1987 the International Association for ClassicalArchaeology (AIAC) published theFasti Archaeologici. It contained veryuseful summary notices of excavationsthroughout the area of the RomanEmpire. However, spiraling costs andpublication delays combined to render itless and less useful. AIACs board ofdirectors thus decided in 1998 to dis-continue the publication and to seek anew way of recording and diffusing newresults. The Fasti Online is the result ofthis effort.

Musel Vatlcanl On\u000flne The Vatican Museums originated as a group of sculptures collected by PopeJulius II (1503-1513) and placed in whattoday is the \"Cortile withinthe complex. The popes wereamong the first sovereigns who openedthe art collections of their palaces to thepublic, thus promoting knowledge of arthistory and culture. As seen today, theVatican Museums are a complex of dif-ferent pontifical museums and galleriesthat began under the patronage of thepopes Clement XIV (1769-1774) andPius VI (1775-1799). In fact, the Pio-Clementine Museum was named afterthese two popes, who set up this firstmajor curatorial section. Later, Pius VII(1800-1823) considerably expanded thecollections of Classical Antiquities, towhich he added the ChiaromontiMuseum and the \"Braccio Nuovo\"gallery. He also enriched the EpigraphicCollection, which was conserved in theLapidary Gallery. Gregory XVI (1831-1846) founded the Etruscan Museum (1837) witharchaeological finds discovered duringexcavations carried out from 1828onwards in southern Etruria. Later, heestablished the Egyptian Museum(1839), which houses ancient artifactsfrom explorations in Egypt, togetherwith other pieces already conserved inthe Vatican and in the MuseoCapitolino, and the Lateran ProfaneMuseum (1844), with statues, bas-reliefsculptures and mosaics of the Romanera, which could not be adequatelyplaced in the Vatican Palace.

The Etruscanswere inspired by the new ideas, prac-tices, techniques and styles with whichthey came into contact, but they hadtheir own traditions and absorbed for-eign influences into their own typicallyEtruscan culture.

Starting from the turn of the cen-tury the use of interdisciplinaryapproaches has multiplied. The fieldwas previously hampered both by theabsence of information on the subject inthe literature and by the neglect ofarchaeological sources, as well as by thelack of any consensus on the very defi-nition of a child. Who is a child? Whendoes he or she stop being a child, andwhy? Aside from social classificationsbased on age groups, the passage fromchildhood to adolescence can be definedin a number of ways, such as medical orpsychological... Martina Seifert is agood example of the way that singlescholars can orient their research in anumber of directions without the loss ofscientific rigor, in particular in the areaof archaeology \u2014 since the work can beconsidered to fit into the field of archae-ology or iconography\u2014 and avoid com-monplace motifs and over-simplifica-tion when it opens out to other disci-plines.

The BrontoscopicCalendar and Religious Practice . Cambridge University Press. 2012. This pioneering publication takes us back to the Iron Age and Orientalizingperiods in Italy as we retrace the earliestorigin of one of the fundamental worksof Etruscan divination, and down intoRoman and Byzantine times, when itwas carefully preserved. The subject is aremarkable example of the survival ofEtruscan technical knowledge, theBrontoscopic Calendar, on the interpre-tation of thunder. The learned NigidiusFigulus, a friend of Cicero, first translat-ed it into Latin in the first century BC,and specified that he rendered theEtruscan text word for word; he alsospecified that it was relevant for Rome.John the Lydian, six hundred years later,translated this Latin text faithfully into aGreek version, which was preserved inhis work, de ostentis, or, as he himself titled it, \"On the Signs of the Heavens.\"Jean Turfa, the most recent translatorand commentator, agrees with them inseeing the social and cultural context forthe text in the Etruscan world that wasfirst coming together in the ninth andeighth centuries. It was then that accord-ing to legend the prophet Tages dictatedthe disciplina etrusca.

The catalog isdivided by culture and includes Cypriot,Greek, Villanovan, Etruscan, Italic,Roman, and Near Eastern objects.Entries on the objects of early Italianorigin are written by Amanda Anderson,Amy Sowder, Richard De Puma, LisaPieraccini, Jason Earle, Patricia Lulof,and The objects urns, local and imported ceram-ics, bucchero, architectural and votive sculptures in terracotta, and an engravedbronze mirror. Each entry is illustrated,some with additional details or linedrawings of decoration or vessel pro-files, and the authors provide extensivecomparanda and provenance informa-tion when possible.

The debate concerning the implica- tions of the Roman conquest for local,non-urban religion has taken a moreimportant role in recent studies on thewestern provinces. By comparison, thework on Italy is much less prominentand less clearly theorized, in spite of theextremely rich archaeological and epi-graphical record. Scholars like MarioTorelli are among the few to haveengaged in a serious global reflection onthe phenomenon, offering overarchinginterpretations and insightful case stud-ies. Tesse Stek's book explicitly sets outto help advance a comprehensive analy-sis of the Roman impact on rural reli-gion, by linking together a number ofinterrelated issues and reviewing expert-ly the most recent archaeological evi-dence.

Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2012.12.14. Orvieto has had a very mixed archaeological history. Already studiedin the sixteenth century by Tuscan \u00e9ru- dits who are now generally neglected, it was seriously pillaged after Unification.Paolo Bruschetti, the Etruscan ceme-tery of Crocifisso del Tufo, on the north-ern slope of the great rock, between the1870s and the 1890s. Not that there isany point in applying anachronisticstandards retrospectively, and some-times at least Mancini made carefulrecords. (The wider story, which is notamong Bruschetti's concerns, is the des-perate struggle of the new Italian state toimpose a minimum of order on thebooming field of archaeology more gen-erally). After the 1890s there was verylittle archaeological activity at this cemetery for more than half a century,until the arrival of an exceptionallyenergetic and talented young scholar,Mario Bizzarri. Meanwhile imperfectlyinformed writers, from George Dennisto Raymond Bloch, had often deniedOrvieto its proper recognition as Etruscan V olsinii, or rather Velzna (thismatter was finally settled, I think, inPapers of the British School at Rome 33 [1965], 113-14). Bizzarri re-startedexploration of the Crocifisso del Tufosite and published two lengthy reports,but he died an early death in 1969.Between 1985 and 2000 Anna EugeniaFeruglio was able to bring some order tothe excavated area itself, but the materi-al found there over the years is scatteredthrough a number of museums and stor-age-places, and it has had to wait untilnow for a systematic publication. Andmuch of it disappeared long ago intoprivate hands. In these conditionsBruschetti and his helpers evidently hadan arduous time putting together thepresent publication. What has always given the Crocifisso del Tufo cemetery its specialinterest has been its organization on anorthogonal plan, with almost rectilinearstreets lined by homogeneouslydesigned tombs, many with namesinscribed on the architraves. Thisorthogonal planning had its best-knownforerunner (but probably not its onlyone) in the Banditaccia cemetery atCerveteri, which seems to have beenplanned several decades prior toCrocifisso del Tufo; the latter is datedby Colonna to the decade 580-570... Itwas presumably constructed under somepublic authority, perhaps a royal one,that was intent on limiting family rival-ry, though it should be noted that in spiteof their homogeneity the tombs varyconsiderably in size and in the value oftheir contents. It continued in frequentuse until well into the fifth century BC;Bruschetti seems strangely reluctant toadmit that it lasted so long, but some ofthe Attic vases described here make thatquite Palatine Hill in Rome is, like the Temple of Jerusalem, a site fraught withhistory, stories, and controversies. InRome, in contrast to Jerusalem, thesecontroversies fortunately have not hadmilitary consequences; but they havebeen\u2014and are\u2014no less heated, trigge-ring strong disagreements and intensepassions. Indeed, it is intense scholarlypassion that has now driven FilippoCoarelli to publish this important contri-bution to the key locus of Roman topo-graphy. The book avowedly (p. xii) star-ted as a review of Andrea Carandini'sand his collaborators' hypotheses. Eventhough this purpose is fully visiblethroughout the volume, it would bereductive to categorize Palatium only according to these terms. In fact, it is adistillation of Coarelli's lifelong rese-arch and experience on the site, and itcan legitimately claim its place alongsi-de his other volumes on the CampusMartius, the Forum Boarium, and theForum Romanum. The book starts by determining the boundaries of the Palatine and discus-sing the web of streets of which it waspart; it then analyzes traditions andmonuments related to the 'Romulean'phase, including the Lupercal and theso-called Roma quadrata. The follo- wing chapters are devoted to the majorsanctuaries (among which those ofMagna Mater and of Victoria), to theRepublican houses, and eventually tothe formation of the imperial palaces.The wealth of hypotheses, both old andnew, offered by Coarelli is impossible tosummarize here, all the more so sincemost of them are the outcome of com-plex and sophisticated arguments thatwould be worth reading on account oftheir methodology alone, and almostregardless of the results to which theylead. Two examples will hopefully suffi-ce to give a taste of the plentiful dishprepared by Coarelli and induce every-body to read the book from cover tocover. On pp. 200-19, a different (andconvincing) reconstruction of one of thegoddesses of the Republican terracottapediment from Via S. Gregorio allowsCoarelli to tentatively identify her asFortuna Redux, reinforcing of the Respiciens. Coarelli alsodiscusses the underground domed roomrecently re-discovered at the foot of thesanctuary of Apollo and identified byCarandini as the site of the Lupercal, thegrotto where picks up aningenious suggestion first brought for-ward in The Times by W. Ford, a British high-school teacher, and identifies theroom as the one where Augustus wouldseek protection from thunders andlightnings, which according toSuetonius he feared exceedingly. Clearly this volume will not bring the scholarly debate on the Palatine toan end, nor does it aim to do so. Just tomention a few examples, the publicationof the archaeological and architecturalinvestigations of the so-called House ofAugustus by S. Zink and of theDomitianic palace by U. Wulf-Rheidtand N. Sojc will undoubtedly producenew evidence and raise new questions.Coarelli's Palatium, however, is a mile- stone in the best tradition of topographi-cal studies on Rome, from the 15th-cen-tury antiquarian Flavio Biondo to theLexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae:it will therefore be a crucial referencework for future discussion.

Masterpieces of the collectioninclude 7th century B.C. objects fromthe Monteleone di Spoleto tomb group(including the famous remarkably well-preserved bronze chariot), intricate goldjewelry, carved gems, and wonderfulambers. For the first time in more than70 years, this incredible body of work ispublished in a comprehensive and beau-tifully designed book that draws upondecades of exhaustive research. Etruscan Art opens with short histo- ries of pre-Roman Italy, Etruscan stud-ies, and the Metropolitan's collection,followed by chronological analyses oftomb groups, types of objects, and indi-vidual objects. The closing section fea-tures forgeries, pastiches, and objects ofuncertain authenticity, all previouslythought to be genuine. Richard DanielDe Puma, one of the foremost expertson Etruscan art, provides an invaluablenew contribution to the study ancientItaly. Review 5/27/2013 The Etruscans can be shown to have made significant, in some cases perhaps the first, technical advances in the cen-tral and northern Mediterranean, withsuch developments as the tie-beam trussin large wooden structures, surveyingand engineering drainage and water tun-nels, the development of the foresail forfast long-distance of metal production post-mortem C-sections in medicine, and more. In art,many technical and iconographic devel-opments, although they certainly hap-pened first in Greece or the Near East,are first seen in extant Etruscan works,preserved in the lavish tombs and goodsof Etruscan aristocrats. These includeearly portraiture, the first full-lengthpainted portrait, the first perspectiveview of a human figure in monumentalart, specialized techniques of bronze-casting, and reduction-fired pottery (thebucchero phenomenon). Etruscan con-tacts, through trade, treaty and intermar-riage, linked their culture with Sardinia,Corsica and Sicily, with the Italic tribesof the peninsula, and with the NearEastern kingdoms, Greece and theGreek colonial world, Iberia, Gaul andthe Punic network of North Africa, andinfluenced the cultures of northernEurope. In the past fifteen years striking advances have been made in scholarshipand research techniques for EtruscanStudies. Archaeological and scientificdiscoveries have changed our picture ofthe Etruscans and furnished new, spe-cialized information. Thanks to thework of dozens of international schol-ars, it is now possible to discuss topicsof interest that could never before beresearched, such as Etruscan mining andmetallurgy, textile production, foodsand agriculture. In this volume, over 60experts provide insights into all theseaspects of Etruscan culture, and more,with many contributions available inEnglish for the first time to allow thereader access to research that may nototherwise be available to them. Lavishlyillustrated, The Etruscan World brings to life the culture and material past ofthe Etruscans and highlights key pointsof development in research, making itessential reading for researchers, aca-demics and students of this fascinating civilization.

Until the end of1945, she served as a Research AnalyticSpecialist, translating interceptedJapanese messages for the WarDepartment. With characteristic mod-esty, she later observed, \"They assumedthat anyone proficient in Greek andLatin could learn Japanese in sixmonths.\" In 1949, Eve Harrison joined the staff of the American School of ClassicalStudies excavations in the AthenianAgora. She received her Ph.D. fromColumbia in 1952, and a revised versionof her dissertation on the portrait sculp-ture found in the Agora inaugurated theseries The Athenian Agora: Results ofExcavations Conducted by theAmerican School of Classical Studies atAthens. Her Portrait Sculpture was fol-lowed in 1965 by Archaic andArchaistic Sculpture, volume XI of TheAthenian Agora. Both publicationsdemonstrate the broad erudition, con-summate eye, subtle thought, and per-sonal vision that were hallmarks of herscholarship and her teaching. Professor Harrison began her teach- ing career in 1951 at the University ofCincinnati where she taught not only arthistory, but also first-year Greek andLatin. After a second research positionwith the Agora Excavations between1953 and 1955, she joined the faculty ofthe Department of Art History andArchaeology of Columbia University,where she was named full professor in1967. Four years as Professor of Art andArchaeology at Princeton Universityfollowed, and in 1974 she was namedEdith Kitzmiller Professor of theHistory of Fine Arts at the Institute ofFine Arts of New York University. Eve Harrison has been honored for her contributions to art history andarchaeology by election as an HonoraryCouncilor of the Archaeological Societyof Athens, a member of the GermanArchaeological Institute, a member ofthe American Philosophical Society, anda member of the American Academy ofArts and Sciences. The ArchaeologicalInstitute of America recognized her life-time of accomplishment by awardingher its Gold Medal for DistinguishedArchaeological Achievement in 1992. As stated in the AIA award citation, \"Eve Harrison's scholarship has rede-fined our art historical perception of thefifth century. As her studies ofAlkamenes and Phidias have sharpenedour understanding of personal style, soher analysis of Archaic and Classicalsculpture has refined our knowledge ofperiod style. Her provocative recon-structions of lost originals -from theshield of Athena Parthenos to the cultstatue of the Hephaisteion- have urgedus to view all monuments with an acuteawareness of their archaeological, cul-tural, and historical context. Her exami-nation of dress and of coiffure hasdemonstrated to us the interrelationshipof style and iconography. Her approachhas extended our knowledge ofClassical art beyond its aesthetic andintellectual achievement to an apprecia-tion of its place in the continuum of cul-tural expression. The creativity, energy,conscientiousness, and dedication thatmark her scholarship continued into theclassroom and beyond, to all her col-leagues. Few students of Greek sculp-ture -- in fact, students of Greek art --have not been enriched by her wisdom.\" As many have noted, Eve Harrison's passing marks the end of an era, she willbe much missed, but we celebrate herlife, her friendship, and her many schol-arly contributions to our profession. OBITUARIES Crawford Greenewalt 1937-2012 by Kathleen Maclay Crawford Hallock Greenewalt, Jr., emeritus professor of classical archaeol-ogy at the University of California,Berkeley, and a leading participant formore than 50 years in theArchaeological Exploration of Sardis inTurkey, died on May 4 at the age of 74. He passed away in Delaware, due to complications from a brain tumor justover a week after receiving theAmerican Archaeological Institute'sesteemed Bandelier Award for PublicService to Archaeology for his personaland scholarly achievements in the field. Greenewalt, or \"Greenie\" as he was known by friends and colleagues, wasan expert on Lydian culture and pub-lished extensively on the site of Sardis,an ancient city that was the capital of theLydian Empire and home of KingCroesus, famous for his legendarywealth; and later, a capital city underPersian, Roman, and Byzantine rule. Healso took part in Turkish excavations atPitane, Old Smyrna, and Gordion. While still a graduate student, Greenewalt excavated some of Sardis'smost important monuments, includingthe monumental Lydian walls on theacropolis of Sardis, and investigated thehuge burial mound of Karnyark Tepe.He made his first real mark in Sardis in1960 when he rediscovered the longburied Pyramid Tomb. His ongoing archaeological work in the field and in the lab is said to havegreatly expanded the understanding ofLydian culture, Lydian and Greek pot-tery, and the chronology of Lydia aswell as of the entire Aegean and easternMediterranean world. Greenewalt also supervised the rein- stallation of the Sardis galleries in thenearby Archaeological Museum ofManisa, and carried out such galleryprojects as a building reconstruction dis-playing Lydian architectural terra cottas. Greenewalt was born on June 3, 1937, in Wilmington, Del. His interestin ancient civilization, said to have beensparked when he was just eight yearsold, never waned. He was educated at Tower Hill School in Wilmington, Del., and then atHarvard College, where he was awardeda B.A. in 1959, and the University ofPennsylvania, where he received hisPh.D. in 1966. Greenewalt joined the Sardis Expedition, which is sponsored jointlyby the Harvard University Art Museumsand Cornell University, as its officialphotographer in 1959, shortly aftergraduating from Harvard. He continued with the expedition every summer. He became its fielddirector in 1976, supervising an interna-tional staff of archaeologists, art histori-ans, architects, conservators, objectillustrators, anthropologists and othersas he kept the project's focus on theSardis of King Croesus and the Archaicperiod. At Sardis, he also trained gener-ations of students in archaeologicaltechniques. Greenewalt stepped down in 2007, and Nicholas Cahill, a Berkeley alum-nus and professor of art history at theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, tookthe helm. In 1996, Greenewalt joinedthe Classics Department at UCBerkeley, where he taught undergradu-ate and graduate courses in classicalarchaeology as well as Greek andRoman art, and seminars in subjectsincluding \"comparative destruction lay-ers\" from such ancient sites as Gordionand Pompeii. He held a curatorship at Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology. Greenewalt was honored in 1993 with the Henry Allen Moe Prize inHumanities by the AmericanPhilosophical Society in recognition ofhis commitment to the humanities aswell as for his paper, \"When a MightyEmpire Was Destroyed,\" and for his rolein reconstructing the history of the peo-ple of Lydia. He also was awarded hon-orific memberships in the German Archaeological Institute and the Austrian Archaeological Institute.

Throughout her years of devoted service to the Institute, EleanorGuralnick also found time to shine as aproductive scholar, publishing impor-tant research in the AJA, JNES, Iraq, Gnomon, as well as many other presti-gious journals. She presented manyimportant papers at AIA AnnualMeetings and at numerous national andinternational conferences, symposia andcolloquia. There are few parts of theInstitute - and few of us - who have notbeen touched in some way by the ener-gy, creativity, and just plain hard workthat Dr. Eleanor Guralnick contributedto further the functions of the AlA andincrease public awareness of its mission. Miranda Marvin 1941-2012 from The Wellesley Townsman Miranda Marvin, Professor Emeritus of Wellesley College died on July 2, 2012 at her home in Wellesley. She was71 years old and the cause of death wasa heart attack. Miranda Marvin was pro-fessor of art and classics and director ofthe inter-departmental program in clas-sical and Near Eastern archaeology atWellesley College. She was a magnetic and inspiring teacher and an insightful and influentialscholar. She has taught at BostonUniversity, and twice as Robert SterlingClark Visiting Professor of Art Historyat the Williams College GraduateProgram in the History of Art. She hasbeen a Getty Research Institute Scholar,a fellow of the Clark Art Institute, and aTrustee and Resident in ClassicalStudies of the American Academy inRome, She has participated in excava-tions at Corinth Gezer (Israel) andIdalion (Cyprus) where she was FieldDirector of the Idalion Survey. She was also a significant contribu- tor to numerous archaeological publica-tions, including Archaeology, American Journal of Archaeology, NationalGallery Studies in the History of Art,and Sculpture. Her crowning achieve- ment was a beautifully produced bookby Getty Publications in 2008: The Language of the Muses: The Dialoguebetween Greek and Roman Sculpture\"Looking at Ancient Sculpture with NewEyes.\" In this volume, Miranda Marvin argues and illustrates a new interpreta-tion of the relationship between Greekand Roman ideal sculpture. Miranda graduated from Bryn Mawr magna cum laude with honors,from the American School of ClassicalStudies at Athens in 1964, and receivedher Ph.D. from the Harvard ClassicalArchaeology Department in 1973. University acquisitions, grants from other bodies, and bequests and loansfrom outside benefactors into a collec-tion of nearly 1,000 objects. The collec-tion, which was named the SheftonMuseum of Greek Art and Archaeologyin Brian's honour in 1994, was housedin the Percy Building and latterly in theArmstong Building. It can now be seenin the Great North Museum, where it isdisplayed in the Shefton Gallery ofGreek and Etruscan archaeology. Alongside the archaeology collec- tion Brian also built up a significant col-lection of books on Greek and Etruscanarchaeology, which now make up theShefton Collection and form an impor-tant body of research material within theRobinson Library. The library holdingsand the archaeology collections comple-ment each other and create a valuableresource for teaching and research. Without Brian's unflagging energy and drive Newcastle University wouldnot have been blessed with such richresources for the study of Greek andEtruscan archaeology and it is a power-ful testament to his passion for his sub-ject. To Brian the archaeology collec-tion and the library holdings were hisgreatest academic achievements ofwhich he was justifiably proud. Brian's wide-ranging scholarship was truly international; he was an enthu-siastic traveller with an extensive net-work of colleagues and friends through-out the world. He played an active partin the realm of Greek and Etruscanarchaeology and frequently attendedinternational conferences, as well asreceiving numerous prestigious fellow-ships and honours. These included anhonorary doctorate from the Universityof Cologne and the British Academy'sKenyon.medal. Brian's is a life to be celebrated. His energy and enthusiasm for his disciplineand his keen interest in the wider worldsof Archaeology and Classics stayed withhim right up to the very end. In fact hespoke at a conference in Basle onEtruscan archaeology in October of lastyear and continued to work on severalresearch projects. He was also anincredibly kind and generous scholarwho always had time for others and washappy to give advice and support. Thiswas particularly marked with youngerscholars who were just embarking ontheir careers. His irrepressible energy and curios- ity were an inspiration to all those whoknew him and he will be greatly missedby friends and colleagues both inNewcastle and further afield. Lou was active in many classical organizations: AIA/APA, CAMWS,ACL, and CAES; he attended their con-ferences each year. He took great pleas-ure in talking with conferees eitherabout his books or about the classics ingeneral. Perhaps his favorite book of allwas The Epic of Gilgamesh, and he would engage anyone he could on thistopic. In addition to his focus on the Classics, he was also devoted toSlovakia, the country of his birth. Hewas the president of the Slovak-American International CulturalFoundation, a not-for-profit organiza-tion that published English translationsof Slovak literature and promotedSlovak art. Born June 7, 1937 in Michalovce, Slovakia, he passed away on July 28,2012 at the Pepper Family HospiceCenter in Barrington, Illinois. He is sur-vived by his wife Marie, his son Allan(Paul Mallatt) Bolchazy, his sistersJanine Bolchazy and vale. Requiescat (1919 - 2012) by Andrew Parkin, Keeper of Archaeology, Great North Museum, Hancock Emeritus Professor Brian Shefton, who died on Wednesday, 25th January2012 after a short illness, was a distin-guished scholar of Greek and Etruscanarchaeology, whose career and achieve-ments will leave a lasting legacy forNewcastle University as well as the cityof Newcastle. Brian was born in Cologne, Germany, in 1919; the son of IsidorScheftelowitz, Professor of Sanskrit andIranian philology at Cologne University,and his wife Frieda. In 1933 the familymoved to England to escape from theemerging threat of Nazi oppression inGermany and Brian's father took up ateaching post at Oxford University. Brian thrived in England and, after military service during which hechanged his name to Shefton, graduatedfrom Oriel College, Oxford, in1947. He spent three years after gradu-ation travelling and studying in Greecebefore taking up a lectureship in theClassics Department at ExeterUniversity. In October 1955 Brianmoved to Newcastle following hisappointment as a lecturer in GreekArchaeology and Ancient History. Heremained at the University for the rest ofhis career, becoming Professor of GreekArt and Archaeology in 1979. One of Brian's most significant achievements was the establishment of acollection of Greek and Etruscan archaeological material to support teaching and research. The collectionwas begun in 1956, shortly after hisarrival in Newcastle, when he was givena grant of reputedly \u00a320 by the University to purchase three Greek pots. From these small beginnings itexpanded, thanks to a combination ofLadislaus J. (Lou) Bolchazy June 7, 1937- July 28, 2012 Ladislaus J. (Lou) Bolchazy, PhD, was the publisher and founder ofBolchazy-Carducci Publishers (BCP),whose mission is \"a better futurethrough the lessons the past.\" Staffedby editors who are classicists, BCP spe-cializes in books dealing with theancient world. He was especially proudof the company's Latin for the New Millennium series, launched in 2008, which is the most popular new introduc-tory Latin series in the nation. The Red Flare: Cicero' s On Old Age, a transla-tion of De Senectute and a favorite of Lou's, was the last book he commis- sioned and also his 75 thbirthday present to himself. During the 1970's and 1980's, when other publishers nearlyabandoned Latin, BCP, under Lou'sleadership, provided a steady stream oftextbooks allowing teachers to expandthe breadth of Latin authors they couldteach in their Latin classrooms. His PhD in Classics was from SUNY Albany and his MA, also in clas-sics, was from NYU. His special inter-ests in teaching and research were in thehistory of ethical concepts in the ancientworld, comparative mythology, comput-er-oriented research in the Latin lan-guage, and Slavic studies. He previous-ly served as a classics professor atLoyola University Chicago and also atMillersville State University in PA.Author of the book Hospitality in Antiquity, he gave a number of papers atconferences and also developed a radioseries on myth (\"Myth Is Truth,\" 14 pro-grams in comparative mythology broad-cast by Loyola University and TritonCollege). Furthermore, he was the co-founder and co-editor of the Ancient World (1978-1991) and the editor of the Classical Bulletin (1991-2008). in Italy and other Mediterranean coun-tries, and was ever willing to do all hecould to help, whether it be in mentor-ing, as he did for me and countless oth-ers, some of whom are here today,reviewing our books, and writing refer-ences or lettere di raccomandazione. He was Trustee of the Ellaina Macnamara Memorial Scholarship andof the Dr M. Aylwin CottonFoundations. When I served as a mem-ber of the Consultative Committee ofthe Cotton Foundation I was able toobserve his great humanity; there wasno question that the candidates werejudged solely on academic merit butalso that their situations were scruti-nised and understood with great sympa-thy and realism. He also served on theScientific Committee of the greatTaranto conferences on Magna Grecia. David Ridgway was indeed 'il miglior fabbro'!Ridgway continued from page 3 Page 38 Page 39David Ridgway as an Etruscologist by Judith Swaddling, British Museum David Ridgway was an Etruscologist, but he was of course known equally, particularly outside theEtruscan community, as a Hellenist. Hewas renowned for his work atPithekoussai, and for his focus on otherearly Greek colonies around theMediterranean, and no less their mothercities back in the homeland: Corinthwith its Demaratus link, and of course,his beloved Euboea. of what fol-lows applies equally to David's soul-mate, Francesca, who worked so closelywith him on many projects. David was not a flamboyant Etruscologist, rather he and Francescawere twin pillars and rock-solid supportof all things Etruscan. Indeed \"support\"is the word that constantly recurs whenwe are talking about David. With eachEtruscan conference that the BM hasorganized, David could always be reliedupon either to give a paper, be a discus-sant, chair a session, or offer a vote ofthanks. You could not wish for a bettercollaborator and colleague. His remarkswere always immensely knowledgeable,witty, concise and greatly appreciatedby audience and speakers alike. It waswonderful to have David and Francescathere to discuss topics for conferences,and more than likely they would comeup with a new and innovative angle onproceedings. Indeed it was David whocame up with the splendid title for theconference and papers the BritishMuseum organised in honour of his dearfriend Sybille Haynes, Etruscan by Definition, the very distillation of whatexactly identifies artifacts as Etruscan. David published British Museum material, notably collaborating withFrancesca and Ellen Macnamara on thepublication of the Sardinian bronzes from Santa Maria in Paulis. He alsopublished BM objects elsewhere. One ofhis favourites was the cheese-grater,used for grating cheese into wine, fromthe tomb at Trebbia of which the BMhas the corredo - this was in his excel-lent article on Nestor's cup and theEtruscans in the Oxford Journal ofArchaeology. David noted the unlikelyattraction of adding cheese, albeit goat'scheese, to wine, especially when accom-panied by an onion, as Homer relateswas prepared for Nestor. For the conference that the BM held in honour of Sybille, David contributeda paper on James Byres, the antiquarian\"Etruscan\" students, he did encourage,mentor and help numerous students andscholars, some of whom are active in thefield today. He was a reader for manypapers and theses. Those who benefitedfrom this enviable service hold him indeep respect and affection and readilyacknowledge their debt to David andFrancesca. The couple were honorarypatrons to many. I feel that this is animportant point to be made, and I'msure that, to name but a few - CorinnaRiva, Judith Toms, Lisa Pieraccini andAndrea Babbi - will confirm this view. Way back in 1981, I began work on what was to be the then new permanentEtruscan gallery at the British Museum.I was determined that it should not onlyfeature the Etruscans but the other cul-tures of pre-Roman Italy. The seminalwork that was to become universallyknown as Ridgway and Ridgway, theiredited conference papers on Italy Beforethe Roman Empire, had been publishedrelatively recently in 1979, and it was amine of information and had a big influ-ence on the display. The book remainsa very useful reference work to the pres-ent day. As a special consultant to assistwith the exhibition I had Dr EllenMacnamara, another dear friend andrenowned Etruscologist, who sadlycould not attend David's funeral or theMemorial. She too had a great admira-tion and fondness for both David andFrancesca. Ellen would always askDavid's and Francesca's advice andthoughts on any new Etruscan venturein which she was involved. Ellen wasresponsible for the Ellaina Macnamaramemorial scholarship that commemo-rated her mother and focused on Italianarchaeology, and for some years wasalso responsible for administering theCotton Fund, commemorating the greatMollie Cotton. For many years Davidplayed a vital role on the boards for bothfunds. More recently David sat with myself and with Sybille Haynes, founder of theEtruscan lectureship in Oxford, astrustees on the board to create that post.This will be the first establishedEtruscan lectureship in the country, andhopefully will give rise to generations offuture students of Etruscology. The postwill be at Somerville College. Sybillewishes to acknowledge David's soundadvice and immense support for thisproject, which is a milestone forEtruscology in the UK and internation-ally, Sybille's project, to which she her-self has donated years of effort as wellas selfless funding and fund-raising, wasvery close to David's heart. on whom David was the greatest expert.Similarly he excelled on the reception ofthe Etruscans in Britain, notably the so-called Etruscan Room at Osterley Park.Whatever his subject, David couldalways be relied upon to produce a fact-filled expos\u00e9 spiced with new insights.This was crucially what he admired inothers, and indeed his and Francesca'spatience with any publication which fellshort of their expectations of their ownwork, would get short shrift. To haveone's work reviewed by the great couplewas pretty intimidating, but at the sametime, a review well worth having. If youwere wise, you would consult them asreaders before publication, and in thisthey were endlessly generous with theirtime, advice and suggestions. He andFrancesca could have spent their timewriting more books - indeed it was sucha shame that David did not have time tocomplete his book on Demaratos . Theycould have spent time publishing morepapers, already very substantial in num-ber, but instead they advised students,helped colleagues, translated importantworks such as Stefan Steingrabers' bookon Etruscan tomb-painting, and wroteliterally hundreds of reviews. As TomRasmussen wrote in his obituary forFrancesca: This kind of work, undertaken from a deep conviction that scholarship is animportant matter and the field ofenquiry is worthy of wide dissemination,offers little personal kudos but is grate-fully appreciated by the academic com-munity. There was an obituary in the Times for David which several friends and col-leagues felt sadly undervalued his serv-ices to Etruscology, not recognising theimportance of this basic work and thefact that, although formally he may not have had a great number of official Giants, continued from page 40 Francesca and David Ridgwaytread an ancient Roman road.clothing. a decorated, fringed tunic,and circular shield with a central bossand chevron patterns. The relevance ofthe shield is again confirmed by com-parisons with bronze figures. As Giovanni Lilliu emphasized, the stone images had the same relative pro-portions as the Nuragic bronzes, withelongated head and trunk and veryshort, legs. That the statues reproduceall the details already known from thebronzes is noted by all the scholars whohave studied the stone sculptures ofMonte Prama. Stone statues and littlebronzes have many characteristics incommon and must be contemporane-ous, at least in part; but the stone figu-res were produced over a shorter periodof time than the bronzes, which wereproduced over several centuries. Small Nuragic towers In association with the large warrior statues were found many fragments ofmodels of stone nuraghi made with thesame type of stone. Monte Prama is thesite that has yielded the largest numberof models, with characteristics that donot occur elsewhere. The variousmodels present stylized architecturalelements characteristic of actual nura-gic towers. Among the larger modelsare nuraghi with four lobes, composedof one central tower and four sidetowers connected by straight walls,preserved to a height of 140 cm. Aninnovation is the representation ofpolylobate nuraghi consisting of a cen-tral tower, four angular towers and foursecondary towers at the center ofstraight connecting walls. At leastthree quadrilobate and four polylobateexamples have been identified. Like an altar Large stone nuraghi models are found within the nuraghi, in rooms forcultic use... Some of these models canbe considered true \"altars,\" such as theexamples from Mulinidi Villanovafranca, Strisalliand from Su Monte di Sorradile. Thefinal phase of the Bronze Age yields nomore built nuraghi, but there wererestructured spaces, some meant forstorage and conservation of commodi-ties, for hoarding, or for ritual practi-ces. The first collapse of the tops of thetowers occurs already in the secondphase of the Final Bronze Age. Then inthe late 10th to early 9th centuries BC,in the first phase of the Iron Age, Thenuraghe form served to legitimize andreinforce the power of the hegemnicgroups. continued on page 24The Mystery of the Giants by Valentina Leonelli and Luisanna Usai from Archeo After years of restoration, the monu- mental stone statues found in fragments in the funerary area of Monte (Mont'e)Prama in Sardinia have come back tolight: warriors, archers, boxers andarchitectural models, as a testament tothe last major production of the Nuragiccivilization. The exhibition \"Stone and the Heroes: the restored sculptures Nuoro, the restoration of the stone sculpturesfound at Monte Prama in the territory ofCabas. It is the first display of the scul-ptural group as a whole, and constitutesa significant aspect of the material pro-duction of the Nuragic civilization.These sculptures in the round representthe human figure, often larger than life,and reproduce iconography alreadyknown from the more famous bronzetti. Although their precise dates are stilluncertain, they are currently the onlylarge sculptural group from the protohi-storical period in Italy and the westernMediteranean. Extraordinary fragments Most of the fragments come from a 1979 survey excavation, but many hadcome to light several years earlier. Inthe excavation of 1979 the sculpturalfragments were found in a disorganizedheap \"dump\" above a series of pozzetto tombs placed one next to another in anirregular alignment, and with the decea-sed in a squatting position. Until the discovery of the first frag- ments, there were few examples of stonefigures carved completely in the round from Nuragic contexts. In the meantimeseveral sculptures in the round havebeen found, among them the very beau-tiful head of a bull from Nughedu San Nicol\u00f2. These depict predominantlyanimals, as in the case of the rams from the rotunda of Sa Sedda and Sos Carrosdi Oliena.Larger than life Immediately after the discovery, Giovanni Lilliu published numerous sta-tue fragments in a long article, Dal beti- lo aniconico alla statuaria nuragica. Inspite of this, the finds did not receive theattention they deserved in the scientificcommunity, especially outside ofSardinia. This is even more surprising ifone considers that certain statue frag-ments were displayed immediately inthe Museo Nazionale di Cagliari, andhave been published in popularizingbooks on the Nuragic civilization. Onemight almost say that only beginning with the restoration project have thesculptures of Monte Prama been trulydiscovered. The restoration has already provided valuable information about the sculptu-res and what they represent. In 1981 the first excavation reports by CarloTronchetti focused on the over-life-sizelimestone statues depicting two figures:that of the \"boxer,\" already known froma small Nuragic bronze, and that of a warrior with a bow over his left shoul-der, a figure that is well attested in smal-ler Nuragic bronzes. The restoration ofthe fragments brought to light by the archaeological survey has increased thenumber of figures represented, and pro-simple close-fitting cap; thin braids thatfall onto the chest on either side. Soldier or athlete? A protuberance on the fist suggests that the glove was reinforced by a metalelement meant to increase the impact onthe opponent in close combat. The term\"boxer\" has now become conventional,even though it is not universally accep-ted. Some see these figures as light-armed soldiers ready for hand-to-handcombat; others consider them athleteswho perform in sacred games. Thishypothesis is reinforced by the massivechest of the pugilists and their robu-stness as compared to the soldiers; Stone archers and warriors The figure of the archer is more detailed, both from a greater complexityof the armor and possible variants in vided details illuminating both the diffe-rences among the individual types andtheir homogeneity. The boxer with the shield The most commonly represented figure is the boxer, a term used alreadyby Giovanni Lilliu for a bronzetto found in the territory of Dorgali. There are 16depictions of the boxer, of which thetwo best preserved show the upper part,with the large curved, rectangular shieldresting on the head. This shield createdproblems for the modern restorers, andmust have created even more for theancient craftsmen. The boxer, as well as the others described below, rests solidly on a qua-drangular base. The height of thosewith the most complete shield comes toover 2m. They wear a simple triangularskirt whose flaps overlap in front; thethickness and rigidity of the back sug-gest that it was originally of a veryheavy fabric or leather; a belt holds upthe skirt. The feet and legs are usuallybare; in some cases shoes can be discer-ned. The triangular face has large eyesmade of two concentric circles, themouth is indicated by a thin incised line.A pillar-like nose, flanked by deeplycurved eyebrows, projects from a highprominent forehead.

The left hand holds the bow,which was short and shown frontally,with the elbow at a right angle parallelto the body. The face of the archer issimilar to that of the boxer, as is thehairstyle; on the head, however, is a cre-sted and horned helmet. The archers wear a short tunic on which hangs a square breastplate withconcave sides. In the best preservedexamples one can see the detail of thethree strings that hold the breastplate inplace and the motif of thick horizontallines that complete it. The legs of thearchers are protected by greaves thatleave the feet bare, and a quiver hangson their backs. No one statue preservesall these details.
