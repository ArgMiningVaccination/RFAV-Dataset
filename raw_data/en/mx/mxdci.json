If all these vaccines were given separately, each child would have to receive a large number of injections. Combination vaccines such as the Parents sometimes worry that their child's immune system will not be able to cope with receiving several vaccines at once. In fact, even a tiny baby's immune system can cope easily. From birth onwards, a baby comes into contact with millions of germs every day. Babies' immune systems are working all the time to protect them against bacteria and viruses in the environment. Vaccines represent a very small challenge to the immune system when compared to this. Each millilitre of blood contains ten million B cells, the white blood cells that are associated with the immune response. It is estimated that this would be enough to cope with thousands of vaccines at a time, meaning that a baby's immune system is not stretched at all by receiving several vaccines at once. It is not a good idea to delay vaccinations to 'spread the load', because it leaves the baby unprotected against dangerous diseases for longer. Although the number of vaccines has increased, the number of antigens in vaccines has actually gone down dramatically. Antigens are the active ingredient in vaccines, the parts made from viruses or bacteria which challenge the immune system so that it makes antibodies to fight the disease. In 1960 there were around 3200 antigens in components of vaccines that protected babies and children against just four diseases. By 2012, vaccines for babies and children contained just over 60 antigens but protected against 11 diseases. "}
