The treatment is very similar to the well known Raindrop therapy treatment offered by Young Living, and is based on indigenous traditions from the North American continent.](https://creaturecomfortsbodywork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rainbath-2.jpg) The treatment is intensely relaxing and yet invigorating at the same time, leaving clients feeling refreshed and ready to take on life when they get up off of the massage table. This ancient Native American healing practice is from the Great Lakes region of the United States and has been in use for thousands of years. During your ceremony, you will walk with the Stone Tribe (stones) and the Rooted Ones (essential oils) down an ancient path of wellness that can bring deep relaxation and balance to the body. The combination of oils used have been perfected over the eons that this ceremony has been in use to work synergistically together to bring balance and wellness. When applied directly to the skin and the stones help them to be quickly and deeply absorbed, bring immediately [physiological changes](http://personalcaretruth.com/2010/09/the-psychology-and-physiology-of-the-inhalation-of-essential-oils/) to the nervous system and body.

If you have experienced the Young Living Raindrop therapy treatment before, I know that you will really enjoy the enhancement made by adding stones to the session, and if you are new to healing with [essential oils](http://www.youngliving.com) in this way, you are in for a treat! \"When I begin to feel physically and emotionally drained I know it is time to visit Shanna for one of her rejuvenating rain baths. Shanna always takes the time to find out how you are doing physically and emotionally and uses that knowledge to help shape your session with her. I leave my session feeling ready to take on the world again. The oils, techniques and ceremonial aspects she uses seem to find their way to all parts of my body and mind and allow me to find my center again. I am so grateful that Shanna is sharing her gifts with all of us.\" from a relaxed client "}
