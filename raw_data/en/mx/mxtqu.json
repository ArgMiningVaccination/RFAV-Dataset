With Millcreek Community Hospital and the Clinical Practices of LECOM, LECOM forms the only osteopathic academic health center in the United States. Allegheny Health Network (AHN) and LECOM have established a Pittsburgh regional campus affiliation headquartered at AHN's [Forbes Hospital](/locations/hospitals/forbes) in Monroeville, Pa. This new campus joins the main campus in Erie, Pa., and campuses in Greensburg, Pa., and Bradenton, Fla., in offering an exceptional, affordable education in osteopathic medicine and improving our society's overall health by training future primary care physicians. The establishment of LECOM's Pittsburgh clinical campus also dovetails with efforts already in place by Highmark Health to bolster the physician base in our region. Highmark Inc. has established a program to provide $500,000 in scholarships to aid LECOM students in their four years of medical school with the intention to help ultimately increase the supply and improve the retention of physicians in rural areas of Pennsylvania. Scholarship recipients upon graduation will practice medicine at a Highmark-approved site located in an area of need for each year that they receive scholarship funding. Beginning in June 2015, the Pittsburgh clinical campus will host 26 third-year students from LECOM for their clinical rotations, providing an opportunity for students from western Pennsylvania to complete their training closer to home. In June 2016, the number of students will increase to a total of 52 as the first group of students completes their fourth-year clinical work at Forbes and a new class of third-year students arrives. Classroom spaces and a new student lounge are being prepared at Forbes Hospital to accommodate the program.

Although clinical experiences begin as early as the first and second year, Phase III consists of third-and fourth-year clinical rotations (or clerkships). To achieve LECOM's curricular goals and objectives these clinical rotations will utilize: The clinical curriculum at the Pittsburgh clinical campus provides training on a rotational basis at a wide variety of geographically diverse sites located throughout southwestern Pennsylvania. Students will be provided with inpatient clinical experiences at hospitals and medical centers, as well as outpatient experiences at hospital-based clinics, free-standing clinics and physicians' offices. The availability of elective opportunities will maximize career options and enrich undergraduate medical education. This concentrated clinical training begins in the third year. During the third and fourth years, students will be required to successfully complete 24 clinical clerkships or preceptorships. Each of these clerkships is defined as one clinical rotation. These rotations are assigned by the Associate Dean of Clinical Education. The clinical rotations are directed toward areas of medicine that are important in the primary care "}
