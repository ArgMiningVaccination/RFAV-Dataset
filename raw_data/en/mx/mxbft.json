Even more so, TCM methods of therapy based on the yin-yang principle, the model of the five elements, and the classification of illnesses according to standard constellations of symptoms (TCM \"syndromes\") are largely unproven by the protocols of modern evidence-based medicine. This dissertation attempts to reconstruct TC M theory by: (a) providing explanations of TCM entities as abstractions and constructs th at relate to observable body functions and illness symptoms and (b) interpreting TCM theory as comprising heuristic models that were constructed from clinical experience to fit empirical observations of illnesses and their treatments with herbal medications a nd acupuncture. It suggests that scientists should be less concerned with the ontological status of TCM entities and the epistemic credentials of TCM models than with the abil ity of these concepts and models to guide physicians in therapy. More importantly, it makes the argument that these models are testable using the methods of evidence-based medicine. There are methodological difficulties associated with randomized controlled trials partly because TCM treatments tend to be individualized and syndromes are dynamic in nature; observationa l trials may be more appropriate in some situations. It is also possible that, for patients who are more culturally attuned to TCM, the placebo effect is strongly at play and may render the real effects of TCM treatments harder to tease out in clinical trials. The dissertation concludes that the main postula tes of TCM should be put to rigorous test. The result may be a leaner but more robust theory, with parts that do not stand up to the test being rejected or modified, and a possibl e acceptance of its more modest therapeutic claims for a limited range of pathological conditions like pain and chronic illnesses. Key words: Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine 4 Note on Terminology and Spelling 1. \"herbs\": plant parts (roots, barks, seeds etc), minerals and animal parts used in Chinese medicine are collectively called \" materia medica \". For convenience of reference, the term \"herbs\" is used in this dissertation to mean materia medica . 2. The pinyin system of spelling Chinese words, standard in China, Singapore and increasingly in Western countries, is used here rather than the older Wade-Giles system, used mainly in Taiwan today. \" Qi\" in pinyin is \"chi\" in Wade-Giles. 3. \"regulate qi\": This follows the common translation of li qi , which means \"to assist in the flow of qi\" in the body. 4. \"syndrome\": A TCM syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that define a pathological condition; also known as \"patte rn\" or \"manifestation\" (see page 119). It is similar to but conceptually differe nt from the syndrome in Western medicine 5. \"tonify\" is not common English usage but standard in Chinese translation for \"provide a tonic for\"; I have followed this usage. 5 Contents Chapter Page 1.

Chinese Medical Theory and it s Rational Reconstruction This dissertation focuses on some prin cipal epistemological issues in the theory of Chinese medicine. Ultimately , the question is: Is Chinese medicine based on science - that is, is it genuinely testable and do es it have an evidential basis so that it can be justifiably used for explanation and prediction? By Chinese medicine, I mean the sy stem of medicine that has been practised in China since ancient times ba sed on a body of theo ry that does not incorporate the scientific advances of Western medicine in modern times, in particular the discoveries of microbiologi cal agents like viruses and bacteria, as well as the enormous expans ion in the understanding of human physiology and molecular biology since the advent of the Scientific Revolution in 17 th century Europe. Chinese medicine, practised as an alternative to modern Western medicine in scientifically-developed Chin a and other East Asian countries, is as much an anachronism as would be ancient Greek and Galenic medicine were it to be practised in Europe toda y. Yet, in developed East Asian countries and some Western countries as well, it is indeed a serious alternative system taught through state-accredited university medical degr ee courses complete with graduate and research programmes. The motivation for researching this subject is my view that Chinese medicine is nothing more - and also nothing less - than a healing method based on crude and inaccurate science developed from clinical experience. Its theory comprises heuristic models, concepts and methods distilled from empirical observation since ancient times that threw up an intricate system of diagnosis and a broad menu of herbal and acupunctur e remedies. Through a review and interpretation of major parts of the theo ry, I seek to elucid ate in what sense Chinese medicine can be considered sc ientific, to examine the meaning and limitations of its theoretical claims, and to determine the kind of clinical and pharmacological research that would be required to reconstruct TCM theory for 8 better understanding, and possible select ive acceptance of its methods, by the scientific community. There is an extensive li terature aimed at elucid ating the mysteries of Chinese medicine, and a few piecemeal atte mpts at interpreting its concepts in biomedical terms.1 There has been little serious effort to take an approach based on philosophy of science to understanding Chin ese medicine. That approach is taken in this dissertation. 1.1 Chinese versus Western Medicine Chinese medicine was practised in Chin a as mainstream medicine well into the second half of the 20t h century. Following the la rge-scale intr oduction of Western science in the wake of the Ma y 4th Movement of 1919 (the \"Chinese Enlightenment\")2, Western medicine ra pidly gained ground on Chinese medicine in public health care. By the 1970s, there were more Western physicians than Chinese physicians. Nonetheless, even to day Chinese medicine continues to play a significant role in health care, part icularly in rural areas of the country.3 Controversy over the validity of Chin ese medical theory and the case for continuing state support for it was an inevitable consequence of the May 4th Movement. Young nationalists, weary of a technologically backward China that suffered repeated incursions into her te rritories by Western powers following the Opium Wars in the mid-19th century, viewed the adopti on of Western science and technology and of democratic principles as the only way to revive the nation and restore its former glory.4 Young scholars returning fr om universities in America, Europe and Japan saw Chines e medicine as a relic of China's scientifically backward past and mounted a campaign to er adicate it and replace it with Western medicine. 1 See, for example, Porkett (1978) and Katpchuk (2000) 2 Schwartz (1986) 3 In 1949, there were 38,000 Western and 276,000 Chinese physicians; by 1975, there were 292,980 and 228,640 respectively (WHO 1985:17). 4 Schwartz (1986) 9 A public debate broke out in the 1930s when Yu Yan, w ho studied Western medicine in Japan, proposed the replace ment of what he d eemed unscientific Chinese medicine by Western medicine an d the abolition of all Chinese medical practices other than the use of herbs, wh ose (alleged) therapeutic properties would be subject to research by clinical trials.5 The robust resp onse of the Chinese medical fraternity led initially by Y un Tieqiao set the stage for acrimonious debates that raged for nearly 20 years.6 The conflict enjoyed a respite with the ascendancy of Mao Zedong in the 1949 revolution. Ma o, a believer in Chinese medicine but impressed also with the great advances made by Western science and medicine, declared Chinese medicine to be a \"treasure trove of Chinese wisdom\", ordered its modernization an d encouraged its integration with Western medicine. By edict, the training of doctors in Western medicine included courses in Chinese medicine. They were encouraged to us e Chinese medicine in combination with Western methods, thereby lending a measure of scientific legiti macy to the former. Some observers interpret this as part of Mao's political agenda to show that the Chinese also had technology and knowledge from which the West could equally learn.7 The integration of Chinese and Western medicine began in earnest following Mao's lead. By the 1960s, colleges of Chinese medicine had been established and teams of scholars wrote textbooks in modern Chinese language, systematically laying out th e principles of Chinese medi cine for the training of a new generation of Chinese doctors. These textbooks followed th e style of Western medical books, each volume co vering a specific area such as basic medical theory, pharmacology, diagnostic techniques, inte rnal medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, skin disorders and acupuncture. This method of studying medicine through standard texts was in contra st to the old way of learning from ancient medical classics, studying recorded cases of famous or legendary physicians and sitting as 5 Wang (2003), Lei (2002) 6 See Yu Yun (1933) and Yun Tieqiao (1922). Note that I have used the Chinese convention of stating the family name (surname) first. Thus, 'Yun' would be Yun Tietao's surname. 7 Taylor (2005), 13-17,120 10 apprentices at the feet of experienced prac titioners. As medical colleges grew and expanded, post-graduate de grees and extensive research programmes were introduced. Today dozens of Chinese medi cal universities and colleges turn out large numbers of doctoral dissertations and publications by Chinese as well as international research stude nts from Japan, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Europe and the US. The modernization of Chinese medicine resulted in a systematization of Chinese medical theory not to be found in the classics, as well as additions to the theory that implicitly in corporated Western notions like viruses and bacteria (termed \"toxins\") and borrowed concepts like the immune system and essential vitamins and minerals. The result of these sweeping changes was the birth of \"Traditional Chinese Medicine \" (TCM ), the modern form of Chinese medicine. TCM was traditional only in th e sense that it kept intact the main core of ancient Chinese medical theory. In the rest of this dissertation we use the term \"TCM theory\" to refer to the modern systema tized form of Chinese medical theory. TCM attracted attention in the West following President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972. Wester n doctors saw Chinese medicine at work and witnessed the use of acupuncture to tr eat pain and as a fo rm of anesthesia. This aroused interest in TCM as a sy stem of alternative or complementary medicine. In recent years, rising rates of serious illnesses like heart disease, strokes, cancer and diabetes, even as We stern medicine made spectacular advances in knowledge and technology, may also have influenced patients to seek alternative methods of health care. Sixty years after Mao's edict for Chinese and Western medicine to work together, the ideological diffe rences between them have largely not been resolved. Integration of TCM and Western medicine has taken place only to the limited extent that TCM physicians are sufficient ly trained in Western medicine to use both systems of medicine in their clini cal work, whilst West ern-trained doctors take short courses to expose them to the basics of TCM. For the TCM physician, 11 diagnosis by TCM methods is supplemented by laboratory tests and modern diagnostic procedures like blood tests, X-rays, MR Is and PET scans. The treatment administered could be a combin ation of Chinese herbs, acupuncture and selected Western pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs. These physicians think in TCM terms when they diagnose the imbalances underlying an illness and accordin gly decide the therapies to be administered. They would be prepar ed to, and often do, supplement TCM treatments with Western drugs that could address more urgent conditions, including antibiotics for bacterial infections and steroids for acute inflammations. (I have used the term \"imbalance\" here in a generic sense of abnormality or deviation from the healthy st ate of the body. As will be explained in subsequent chapters, the kind of imbalance in partic ular pathological conditions are more precisely defined by TC M as deficiencies in yin and yang and/or the presence of heat, cold, dampness, phlegm, blood stasis, etc. The terms for these pathological conditions are used in TC M in a different way from or dinary medical language, and need explanation; again, these will be provided in subsequent chapters.) Take a common example of a patient who has recovered from influenza in the sense of being free of the virus but has a persistent cough with yellowish or greenish (bacterially-infected) sputum, suff ers from weakness and irritability, and feels dry in the throat and warm in the bo dy even though his temperature is normal. His tongue is red, with a thick layer of yellowish cove r (fur). By TCM diagnosis these are the classic symptoms of internal heat with warm phlegm. (\"heat\" and \"phlegm\", which have somewhat different usages in TCM theo ry from those in Western medicine, will be explained further in Chapter 3.) Treatment consists of using \"cooling\" herbs that, according to the Chinese pharm acopeia, reduce and eliminate internal heat, as well as other herbs that resolve phlegm. A week of herbal medication usually so lves the problem but if th e patient is run down and feeble it could take longer. At this stage, if the physician deems the patient to need assistance dealing with a bact erial infection, he may deci de to prescribe a Western 12 antibiotic to supplement th e herbal prescription.8 After the cough and internal heat have subsided, a Chinese me dical tonic may be prescrib ed to enhance the body's ability to restore balan ce and prevent a relapse. The Western doctor would typically view the patient as having sputum in his respiratory system because of a second ary bacterial infection and the patient's feeling of body warmth and irritability mere ly as transient after- effects of the viral infection. The usual treatment would be a course of antibiotics to kill off the bacteria and an expectorant to deal with the sputum. It is not uncommon for such a condition to require repeat doses of anti biotics as the infection returns after the antibiotics are stopped. After the sputum dries up, a dry persistent cough often follows that could drag on for weeks. TCM physicians in Asia often see su ch patients whose coughs have not recovered with Western medici ne and therefore seek altern ative treatments. There appears to be some anecdota l evidence that such patients find faster and more permanent relief with herbal treatments th at aim at clearing heat and phlegm and rebalancing the body. In this example, the TCM physician uses what he considers a holistic view of symptoms presented by th e patient which enable him to draw conclusions about the nature of imbalance in the patient's body. In TCM parlance, the patient's imbalance is caused by internal heat and phlegm. This approach is different from that of Western medicine based on cellular biology, which aims at eliminating an offending microbiological pathogen (bacte rium found in the sputum) and inducing the lungs to throw off the sputum that cause s discomfort (this being the role of the expectorant). Can the two approaches be reconciled? It is tempting to give biomedical interpretations to the TCM medications. Perhaps the herbs have antibiotic and expectorant properties. Many Chinese herb s do indeed have antibiotic properties, but in forms too attenuated to be really e ffective in killing the bacteria involved. 8 The combined use of Chinese and Western medicines is permitted in China but prohibited in most other jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. 13 Herbs for resolving phlegm are deemed in TCM theory to have the effect of stopping the body from prod ucing sputum rather than just expelling it. The modern TCM physician, drawing on his We stern medical training, would view the bacterial infection as a consequence of th e underlying imbalanc es in the body. The underlying condition (imbalances) is in ternal heat and phlegm. Its presence encourages secondary bacteria l infection to take hold. Hence the real solution is not to kill the bacteria but remove the root of the problem, namely eliminate internal heat and phlegm and thereby re store balance. With internal balance restored, the body's own de fenses overcome the bacteria eventually. When the TCM physician adds the antibiotic, the aim is to assist weaker pa tients, particularly the elderly, whose body defenses take too long or are inadequate for a satisfactory recovery. In this latter respect, the TCM ph ysician's approach is not unlike that of more progressive Western physicians wh o would not prescribe antibiotics for a condition such as the one desc ribed above, except as a last resort for frail patients with life-threatening infections. These doctors prefer the body to use its own immune system to overcome the infection, thereby strengthening it for future battles, but also redu cing the incidence of bacteria mutating and becoming resistant to the antibiotic used. Advocates of the TCM approach re adily concede the overwhelming superiority of Western science and modern medicine in unraveling the microbiological mechanisms by which dis ease affects physiological processes and drugs destroy hostile pathog ens and rectify cellular diso rders. The TCM approach is to look at underlying conditions (imb alances) that allow the pathogens to take hold or the cellular disorders to arise. Thomas Kuhn's remark may not have been intended to be used in a medical context, but anyway seems to be pertinent here: \"The man who first saw the exterior of the box from above later sees its interior from below \"9 TCM could be deemed as lookin g at the health of the human body holistically from above, whilst Western me dicine looks at it from below, at the level of cells, genes and mi crobiological agents. 9 Kuhn (1970),111 14 This is of course not a fair characte rization of Western medical principles, which also encourage looking at the patien t's body as a whole rather than just his or her blood tests and X-rays . But the reality is that Western medicine has become so technically advanced that doctors tend to rely more on labora tory tests than on observation of symptoms presented by the pa tient on examination; the role of the family physician or general practitioner ha s also declined relative to that of the specialist. TCM has only direct visual and tactile observations, and the patient's description of how he feels, on which to rely, hence being holistic is its only choice. Chinese diagnosis relies on directly observable symptoms presented by the patient, including the patien t's own detailed description of how s/he feels, then proceeds to draw conclusions on how the body's condition has deviated from that of healthily balanced state. Therapy cons ists of bringing th e body back to the balanced state. Like the ubiquitous wooden-wheeled car t pulled by a bullock in ancient China, Chinese medicine is techno logically primitive. Like the bullock cart, it is crude and slow but sometimes ge ts the job done. Oc casionally perhaps it even takes you through dirt tracks and hilly terrain that the BM W cannot handle. Chinese medicine invented relatively simple models of the human body and of disease causation and found ways of ap plying these models in complicated ways to handle a wide variety of illnesses usin g experience that physicians gained over its long history. That many people were healed when these methods were applied should not be in doubt. What can legi timately be asked is whether they were healed by the methods applied. Would the same number have been healed anyway if nothing had been done? (Close to 100% of common colds heal with no medical treatment.) Even if the an swer to this question is 'n o' so that there are some patients who are healed by Chinese medicine who would not have been healed if nothing had been done, it can still legitimately be asked if the therapeutic gain was caused by something specific to the TCM tr eatment rather than by a placebo effect (to be discussed in Chapter 7.) Hence there is ultimately a need to put TCM therapeutic methods to the test through clinical trials. 15 1.2 Reconstructing TCM Theory At the risk of over-simplification, we can regard attitude s to TCM as being polarized into two camps : the believers and non-believers. Most TCM practitioners belong to the first camp. Mo st Western doctors belong to the second group although typically, whilst rejecting TCM theory , some observe that TCM interventions may produce therapeutic resu lts, a point conceded even by one of alternative medicine's sternest critics.10 Many Western doct ors now also believe in and practise acupuncture as a meth od of pain relief without necessarily accepting TCM theory's explanation for its efficacy. For example, the Singapore health ministry recognizes a one-year part-time course to qualify Western doctors for the practice of acupuncture in their clinical work. These doctors learn to needle various acupoints for symptomatic relief of conditions such as pain, dizziness and insomnia; few of them beli eve the ancient Chinese theories that attempt to explain the therapeutic mechanism of acupuncture. (I shall return to this point when I discuss \"Weste rn acupuncture\" in Chapter 4.) TCM faces legitimate challenges by Western science on two counts. First , many of its core concepts like ' qi', 'meridians' and 'phlegm' look like meaningless terms or, at any rate, like metaphysical entities, ill-defined and mostly not measurable and ev en unobservable. Second , the models used in TCM theory are mostly untested; it is has also not been generally made clear that they are testable. A rational reconstruction of TCM theory would need to a ddress these issues. My approach in dealing with these issues is \"normative\", borrowing that term from Imre Lakatos when he argued, in the c ontext of reconstructing the history of science, that \"philosophy of science prov ides normative methodologies in terms of which the historian reconstructs 'internal history' and thereby provides a rational explanation of the growth of objective knowledge.\"11 It would also be necessary in 10 Singh and Ernst (2008), 328:\"TCM is difficult to evaluate. Some elements may be effective for some conditions, while other elements (e.g. cupping) are unlikely to offer any benefit above placebo..\" 11 Lakatos (1970), 91 16 reviewing TCM theory to interpret it in the light of modern medical knowledge. I shall suggest an approach towards the re construction of Chinese medical theory based on the thesis that it is derived from empirical observation and expressed through heuristic models. TCM theory presents a number of problems for the scientist. It employs complex concepts like ' qi' and 'phlegm' that have multiple and often somewhat obscure meanings. It reduces anatomy to: (a) a set of 'organs' that are in fact functional systems and not somatic structur es as we understand them in modern anatomy and (b) a network of 'meridians' (channels) that have been painstakingly mapped out in medical manuals but have ne ver been isolated in human dissections. Its account of human physiolo gy reduces to simplified models of relationships among organs, meridians and body fluids. A system of medicine based on anat omical and physiological models so much at variance with modern medica l knowledge of the human body cannot expect to be taken seriously unless there is evidence that - its apparently dubious theoretical base aside - it works as an eff ective tool of diagnosis and therapy for at least for some illnesses. Based on the history of Chinese medicine in providing health care from ancient to modern times, there is a prima facie case for supposing that it provides healing for some ailments. Any experienced doctor would concede that some folk remedies do work and not a few old wive s tales are true. There can be little doubt, for example, that the herb dahuang (radix et rhizome rhei ) used for constipation can induce purging, as anyone who takes a large dose would rapidly discover, or that mahuang (herba ephedrae ) helps induce perspira tion (its derivative ephedrine is now ex tensively used in Western medications). But for most Chinese medical treatmen ts, even when thes e treatments are followed by patient recovery, the question still remains whether the patient would have got better without treat ment, or whether only a placebo effect was at work. There is also the possibility that a treatm ent works for some but not for most of the ailments for which it makes claims. Bloodletting was practised in Chinese 17 medicine and also in Euro pe, based on the now-defunc t Galenic theory of body humours for almost 2000 years, before it fell into disrepute in the late 19th century. Yet it is used by modern medicine today as a life-saving method of treatment for a very limited number of blood -related illnesses such as hemochromatosis and polycythemia rubra vera .12 A small amount of bloodlett ing can (and is still used by some Chinese physicians) to temporarily relieve conditions like hypertension although, with the availability of modern drugs, this has now to be regarded as a primitive and risky (infection-prone) method of treatment. The challenge then, for believers in TCM, is to tease out th ose conditions for which they can be demonstrated through clinical trials to work consistently. TCM is not unlike Hippocratic and Galenic medicine practised in ancient Greece and Rome and medieval Europe, excep t that the Chinese continued using it into modern times and arguably may well have developed a better system. It is worthy of note that in mo dern Europe there was en ough useful knowledge in Galen's works that these cont inued to be studied in medical schools in England in the first half of the 20th century, in part because some of Galen's methods were still valid and useful. Likewise, TCM theory's main concepts and simple models may have captured some essentia l aspects of human physiolo gy in some fuzzy holistic way such that it works in some medical situations. How consistently TCM works and fo r what medical conditions it works well could largely be a matt er of perception. Chines e physicians reinforce their faith in these methods with anecdotal eviden ce of patients getting better with these treatments, unaware of or choosing to ignore the possibility of the post hoc ergo 12 Bloodletting (therapeutic phlebotomy) is used to treat hereditary hemochromatosis in which there is slow excessive iron build-up in the body, causing damage to or gans such as the liver, heart and joints. Regularly reducing the volume of blood in the body is also currently the main treatment for polycythemia rubra vera in which the blood becomes much too thick, increasing the risk of clots and strokes. Phlebotomy can also help people who are producing too many red cells because their bodies are starved of oxygen owing to a heart or lung problem. See \"The Basis of Therapeutic Phlebotomy\". James C. Barton, M.D. 2009. http://www.hemochromatosis.co.uk/tp.html and Mestel, Rosie (6 August 2001). \"Modern Bloodletting and Los Times . http://articles.latimes.com/2001/ Aug/06/health/he-31093 fallacy.13 But for the scientific commu nity at large, appropriate clinical trials are needed to establish belief in these methods. What constitutes appropriate clinical trials will be one of the principal topics of this dissertation. The rational reconstruction of TCM th eory would require not only the scientific interpretation of TCM concepts but also that it render the explanations and predictions of TCM models testable by the methods of evidence-based medicine. It should show how it would be possible to co nduct appropriate clinical trials to test the diagnosi s and therapies prescribed by the theory. Such clinical trials should be expected to eventually reject some parts of TCM theory, modify others, and increase faith in those that are validated. Such a reconstruction of Chinese medi cal theory would be a departure from what is taught in college textbooks for Chinese medical students. Received TCM theory, recognizing that its notion of an 'organ' has wider meanings than in Western anatomy, works on the presumptio n that the theory accurately reflects underlying realities and that the ancients had special insi ghts that allowed them to put together this internally consistent set of concepts and models from which are derived the principles of preventing an d overcoming illnesses. Confronted with charges of lacking scientific proof and being divorced fr om the real functions of organs as established by modern anatom y and physiology, a common defence has been that this is a syst em derived from the undoubted wisdom of ancient Chinese philosophy. 14 Naturally this cuts no ice with m o d e r n s c i e n t i s t s . W h e n K u h n ' s Structure of Scientific Revolutions appeared, besieged TCM theorists found a life raft in the idea of incommensurability. Western and Chinese medicine were incommensurable, and Chin ese medical theory was no t to be evaluated by the paradigms of Western medici ne. What resulted was th at the dialogue between the 13The post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy is that of assuming the patient gets better as a result of the treatment when in fact he recovers as a natural progression of the disease (which normally happens with an ailment like the common cold). 14 For example, Liu (2003) 19 two antagonists was effectively cut off, except for the occasional descent into name-calling.15 The rest of the dissertation is structured as follows. The next chapter begins with a brief comparative history of th e development of Chinese and Western medical thought to serve as background to understand ing medicine as it is practised today under these two systems. It also hi ghlights two historically important issues: disease causation as understood by the two systems, and the problems in translation of Chinese texts that arise because many key concepts in Chinese medicine having no counterparts in Western science. The chapter ends with a synopsis of TCM theory to which the reader might want to return for reference in the course of the discussions in subsequent chapters of the dissertation. Chapter 3 sets out the key concepts of ' qi', 'blood' and ' jingye' (body fluids) and pathogenic factors like heat, dampne ss and phlegm in TCM with a view to interpreting their meanings in the light of modern science. Chapter 4 deals with the TCM systems of organs and meridian s and ontological questions concerning the meaning and nature of these entities. Some key models of TCM theory are covered in Chapter 5, and Chapter 6 deals with issues of thei r testability and their usefulness for explanation and prediction. The final Chapter 7 briefly di scusses the influence of culture on the placebo effect in Chinese medicine. 15 For example, TCM concepts were called \" gobbledygook \" in \"Dangerous Science taught at Middlesex University\", April 2010, http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923; charges of \"quackery\" were made by Western doctors' objecting to alternative medicine being taught at Australian universities, eliciting retorts of Western medical \"dogmatism\" (Singapore: The Straits Times 4th Feb 2012). Even less elegant language is not uncommon when Western medical scientists debate Chinese medical theorists at conferences. 20 2. The Theory of Chinese Medicine: History and Issues 2.1 The Evolution of TCM Theory Chinese and Greek medicines in distan t antiquity were both dominated by the belief that illnesses were caused by sp irits and demons, and that cures required the intervention of mediums or deities. In the practice of 'temple medicine' in ancient Greece, patients slept in temples so that the Gods could appear in their dreams to heal their illnesses. In China, a paradigm shift occurred with the appearance of what came to be regarded as the greatest of all Chinese medical classics, The Huangdi Neijing (\"Neijing \"), also known as The Yellow Emperor's Ca non of Medicine, written in the Han dy nasty (206 BC-220AD).16 The Neijing was the distillation of ideas and knowledge compiled over seve ral hundred years by many scholars. Although its origin is attrib uted to the Han dynasty, it was continually refined, edited and expanded right up to China's final imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644- 1911). Hence many editions of Neijing exist. The Wang edition commonly used as a reference manual was compiled in the Tang dy nasty (618-907). The Neijing made a break with previous me dical thought by refusing to attribute disease causation to numinous agents. It focused instead on environmental conditions and emotional factors and emph asized the importance of natural laws in the explanation of illnesses.17 In particular, the Neijing brought to Chinese medicine the ideology of \"s ystematic correspondence\" by which all tangible and abstract phen omena could be categorized as manifestations of theoretical models of the human body (notably the yin-yang principle and the 16 \"The Yellow Emperor\" is an inept translation of Huangdi , the name of Huang emperor (\" di\"). \"Huang\" has two usages - it is the colour yellow, and it is a common surname in China. There was nothing yellow about the legendary emperor Huangdi, not any more than former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown had to do with the colour brown. He would (not) be amused at being called \"The Brown PM\". 17 Unschuld (2003), 319 21 \"five-element model\").18 The descriptions of an atomical and physiological systems in the body, which include five pairs of vital organs ( zangxiang ), acupuncture channels and collaterals ( jingluo ) (also known as meridians), and the key entities of ' qi', 'blood' and 'body fluids', were understood in relation to these models. (These en tities and the Chinese models of the human body will be explained and interpreted in the next three chapters.) Different schools of thought introduced interpretations and extensions of medical theory in the Neijing. These schools flourished from the Han dynasty to modern times, although in essence they did not depart from the core models of the Neijing . 19 Among the earliest of thes e schools was that based on The Treatise on Febrile Diseases (Shanghan Lun ) by Zhang Zhongjin g (150-219), which postulated that the harm caused by climat ic influences such as cold, wind and dampness travelled along meridians and brought about progressive changes of body state (pathogenesis). During the Song dynasty (960-1279), ideas from neo-Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism stimulated the de velopment of new medical doctrines. There followed vigorous contention am ong \"a hundred scho ols\" of medical thought. Among the influential schools we re those associated with Liu Yuansu (1120-1200) who founded the \"school of cooling\" ( hanliang ), stressing the elimination of excess 'internal heat '; Li Gao (1180-1251) who regarded the digestive system as the fundamental basi s for good health, hence founding the \"spleen-stomach school\" ( piwei pai ); and \" yin-nourishing school\" ( ziyin pai ) which claimed that man's body by nature tends to be deficient in yin, hence nourishing yin must the basis of good health. 18 Unschuld (1985)5,54 19 Ren Yinqiu (1986:5-6), who started the study of \"schools of thought in medicine\" ( ) in the 1950s, emphasizes that contending schools did not depart from the core models of the Neijing . 22 These contending schools introduced differing emphases in Chinese medicine that were in tune with the times and places in which they flourished. For example, the yin-nourishing school of Zhu Danxi was influential in the Yuan dynasty among wealthy offici als who over-indulged in food and sex, which was thought to harm the yin of their kidneys, hence the need to nourish yin. Late Ming and early Qing saw further development of medical thought, notably studies of infectious diseases co mmon in spring and summer in the south by the \"warm disorders school\" ( wenbing xuepai led by Wu This in contrast to the \"cold-damage model\" of the Shanghan Lun, written by northerners of the Han dynasty who endured harsh winters and developed more robust constitutions, in contrast to those of \"delicate southerners\".20 The Shanghan school consequently focused on disorders originating from exposure to cold and wind and their pathog enesis, whilst the Wenbing school were more concer ned with infectious dise ases and epidemics that broke out in summer mo nths in the south. The first serious challenge to an cient Chinese medical theory was influenced by philosophical trends simi lar to those associated with logical positivists and Karl Popper in Vienna. Like the logical positivists, Western-trained scholars like Yu Yan deemed unobservables in Chinese medicine as metaphysical hence meaningless.21 They regarded Chinese medical theory to be unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific. In defence, Chin ese physicians cited extensive historical clinical records of successf ul treatments using Chinese medicine. In addition they appealed to the authority of ancient Ch inese philosop hy on which medical theory was based. The clinical record of Ch inese medicine was difficult for Western doctors to dismiss, as many of them acknowledged the widesp read existence of prima facie evidence of the efficacy of so me Chinese medications and of acupuncture. But they insisted that the efficacy of Chinese methods be subjected to formal testing in accordance with the rigours of Western scientific tradition. As 20 Hanson in Hsu (2001), 262-292. 21 Yu Yuan (1933) 23 to invoking the wisdom of an ancient phi losophical system to justify medical theory, this convinced few detractors as it was seen as merely shifting the burden of proof from medicine to ancient philoso phy and implicitly admitting its scientific inadequacy. Following Mao's decision to modernize Chinese medicine, the first national textbook for instruction in TC M appeared in 1958, entitled Outline of Chinese Medicine (Zhongyixue gailun ).22 Subsequent texts, covering different subjects within medicine displayed de liberate similarity to their Western counterparts and they constituted a massive and unprecedented systematization of Chinese medical theory and practice. Re gulation of TCM practice was introduced through the licensing of medical practi tioners at the state level with common national examinations. Since modernizat ion, TCM universitie s in China have required about 30-40% of the student's time to be spent on studying Western medicine. Graduates can pr actice basic Western medicine in addition to TCM. They can read modern diagnostic test resu lts, prescribe Western drugs and perform simple surgical procedures. Research publications in TC M have yet to catch up in rigour and methodology with those in the West, but their increasing numbers and improving quality attest to the recognitio n by TCM scholars that their theories and therapeutic methods should be put to tests similar to those used in evidence-based medicine. Referring to the systematization of Chinese medicine, Sivin opines that such change had been \"most decisive over the past generation, with unmistakable influence from modern medicine.\" 23 Scheid notes that the transition was not without its controversies and contends that despite the apparent uniformity forced upon the TCM community by state-sanction ed textbooks and clinical practices, there remained a plurality of views among scholars and practi tioners. Scheid's observation is especially pertinent consider ing that conservative scholars like Liu 22 Scheid (2002:74). A 1972 text The Revised Outline of Chinese Medicine was translated into English by Sivin (1987). 23 Sivin (1987),124 24 Lihong continue to regard the classics as the ultima te authority on medicine despite their formal training in TCM as th e modern systematized form of Chinese medicine. They treat TCM as the prod uct of adulteration and distortion by Western interpretation. Such conser vatives seem to be a dying breed.24 As much as the systematization of Chinese medicine was considered a radical transformation in the 1960s, the truth of the matter is that Chinese medical thought has largely stagnated since the emergence of the Neijing , as if time has virtually stood still since the Neijing 's theoretical breakthroughs in the Han dynasty. Indeed, generations of modern scholars of Chinese medicine have continued to treat the Neijing as the source of all Chinese medical wisdom. Among conservative scholars, the presumption is that the ancients were gifted with special powers of discernment which allo wed them to see ultimate truths in medicine and record them accurately in th e classics. Understanding these ultimate truths would be all it takes to gras p the theory of Chinese medicine. 2.2 Diseases in West ern medical thought The history of Western medicine in an cient times was simi lar to that of Chinese medicine, but took a very differ ent route in modern times. Knowledge would come from challenging accepted truths of the past, and progress would come principally from scientific revolu tions that challenged and replaced old theories and the pathbreaking discoveries following the advent of scientific medicine in 19th-century Europe.25 Western medicine evolved from spiritu al beliefs in distant antiquity but underwent a transformation similar to that brought to Chinese medicine by the Neijing . After the Hippocrates Corpus (circa 350BC), diseas es previously thought to be linked to spirits and Gods were regarded as disorders caused either by external environmental factors or in ternal disruptions in the body. The Nature of 24 Liu (2003) 25 Porter (1997) , XI 25 Man (in Hippocratic Writings ), for example, states: \"When a large number of people all catch the same di sease at the same time, the cause must be ascribed to something common to all and which they all use; in other words to what they all breathe...However, when many different dise ases appear at the same time, it is plain that the regimen [that is, diet and exercise] is responsi ble in individual cases.\"26 This insight led to the distinction in modern medicine between diseases caused by infectious and en vironmental factors and illnesses caused by factors internal to the body. An influential medical sect, the Me thodists, introduced a new medical theory that dominated the Roman world for some three centuries from Themison (123-43 BC) to the time of the em peror Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD).27 Hippocratic medicine had earli er tied together the part affected by disease and the etiological theory to explain the diseas e, thereby allowing the physician to ascertain indications for therapy based on the locus of the disease.28 The Methodists rejected this epistemological approach and insisted that good medicine was simply effective therapeutic practice an d it was not necessary to search for the hidden causes of disease.29 Thus Methodists spoke of \"affections\" ( pathe ) rather than disease ( nosoi ) and did not concern themselves with etiology, convinced as they were that a good doctor should ne ver concern himself with the causes of disease.30 The Methodists emphasized notions of repletion, indicating excesses in the body, and depletion, in dicating deficiencies. These notions were somewhat similar to excess and deficiency syndromes in Chinese medicine (see Chapter 5). Galen (129-216CE), whose ideas were to dominate Europe up to the end of the 16th century, rejected much of Methodism but his view of human health was in principle not all that di fferent. Drawing inspiration from Aristotle and the Hippocratic Writings , he viewed organized human bodi es, like bodies in nature, as composed of the four elements of fire, wa ter, earth and air, wh ile the four qualities 26 Lloyd (1983) , 22-23 27 Nutton (2004), 188 28 Tecusan (2004), 190 30 Tecusan (2004) , 4,10-11 26 of these four elements are heat, moisture, dryness and co ld. Disease consists in abundance, scarcity or change taking pl ace in the humours, comprising blood, phlegm, and yellow and black bile. Hen ce diseases are classified according to which humour is in excess, or is scarce, or suffers a def ect in its movements, each of which requires a differ ent therapeutic approach.31 Such notions of excess and deficiency were to persist in Western medical thought right through to modern times, when their importance was eclipsed by notions of disease causation derived from discoveries in microbiology. That such notions continue to be central to Chinese medical thought is wo rthy of note. It is as if the dazzling discoveries of microbiology diverted Western medical sc ience to cells and ge nes and caused it stay along the nosological track, neglecting the perspective of the body as a whole within its (internal and external) environmen t. Chinese medicine on the other hand knew no microbiology and had little choice but to look at the body's external manifestations as a whole. We shall have occasion to re-examine this issue later in the dissertation. Ancient and pre-modern medicine in Europe focused on understanding the conditions of human bodies in the grip of disease, the pr ogression of these conditions (pathogenesis), and appropriat e therapies for healing. Less emphasis was placed on epistemological issues of ca usation - what made the patient fall ill in the first place. Before the 19 th century, etiological di scussions of disease in Europe revolved largely ar ound moral and social factors such as drunkenness, intemperance, gluttony, and dissipation. Bardsley (1845), for example, attributed diabetes to indulgence in excessive amounts of cold fluid, poor living, sleeping at night in the open air in a st ate of intoxication, sudden halting of perspiration, and mental anxiety. The Scientific Revolution of 16-17 th century Europe laid the groundwork for the systematic merging of the classi cal and experimental sciences in the 19th century: for example, the transformation of the Baconian science of heat into an 31 Nutton (2004), 202-215; Cumston (1926), 137 27 experimental-mathematical thermodynamics.32 By the second half of the 19th century, systematic experimentation took root in medicine , particularly in physiology, and the profession of medici ne gained new institutional forms and enhanced intellectual standards as it leveraged state resources for scientific research.33 Hospitals moved from Church to St ate, and the emergence of hospital medicine (first in Paris) was characterized by scientific observation, pathological examination and a detailed knowledge of anatomy. The shift from a stress on Galenic holistic views of humeral balan ce to the new \"anatomico-pathological\" model would eventually lead to the discoveries of modern etiology.34 A major step forward was made w ith research on childbed fever ( puerperal sepsis ) in 1846 when Semmelweis observed th at the mortality ra tes of women after childbirth varied with hygiene cond itions and used a hypothesis-testing methodology to infer that childbed fe ver was caused by \"cadaveric matter\" transmitted by doctors and students conducting autopsies in the hospital.35 Semmelweis' insight was not recognized initially; some 40 years later, a monocausal model of disease was proposed by Pasteur and Koch who had earlier isolated the tubercle bacillus . The Henle-Koch Postulates stated that a parasite \"occurred in every case of the disease in question and occurred in no other disease as a fortuitous and non-pat hogenic parasite\", in effe ct insisting on a one-to-one correspondence between disease and parasite.36 Koch called this approach to disease causation \" the etiological standpoint \".37 By the beginning of the 20th century, the etiologica l standpoint drove much of medical research. Bacteriology open ed up the vision of finding biological agents to destroy them and eventually to the development of the antibiotic penicillin through the work of Fleming and Florey.38 The use of antibiotics to 32 See Kuhn (1977), 63 33 Kuhn (1977), 60. 34 Porter (1999),306 35 Hempel (1967),3-8; Gyory (1905),94 36 Evans (1993),30 37 Carter 2003,1 38 Porter (1997) 454-7 28 combat disease-causing bacteria was a radical departure from Galenic (and Chinese) medicine that used medications only to restore balance and resolve internal obstructions. However, other important diseases defied such straightforward etiological explanations. One such disease was beriberi, whose cause required a new deficiency theory of diseas e. The etiological standpo int had to be widened to include deficiency of certain organic ch emicals essential to the body. Viruses presented a new set of problem s. When viruses were i nvolved, medical scientists found that causes of disease were more complex than could be explained by the simple etiological standpoint. For example, rhinoviruses are associated with only 20-25% of the common cold syndrome and are active mostly in the autumn. Furthermore, many viral infections are asymptomatic. Viruses are also known to be linked to some forms of cancer, but seem to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the cancers to occur. Looking at the br oad range of diseases, a single cause can result in a spectrum of cl inical syndromes, and the same effect could result from several different causes, de pending on the nature of the causative agent, the environment in which it operates, and the ch aracteristics of the involved host. In the case of chronic (non-infectious) illnesse s like heart disease, the complexity is such that epidemiologists prefer to talk about risk factors rather than causes.39 The situation is even murkier with su bclinical epidemiology. Subclinical illnesses in which the patien t experiences no obvious sy mptoms occur not only in infectious diseases, when infection occurs without disease, but also in chronic diseases. Many of the causes of disease are so ubiquitous that almost everyone has been exposed to them, and it is often not clear what makes disease develop in some but not in others. As the no ted epidemiologist Alfred Evan s puts it, it is the search for a \"clinical illness promotion factor\" for a given disease that poses the real challenge. He calls this the \"third ingred ient\" in disease causation, in addition to microbiological agents and deficiencies in the body. 40 39 A S Evans (1993),1, 46, 107 40 ibid, 213 29 The philosophical issues in disease causation and its relevance to TCM theory are discussed below. 2.3 Causation in Western medicine The etiological standpoint attributab le to Henle and Ko ch was based on what Henle termed \"necessary and univer sal causes\" by which he meant that a cause must always have the same effect; the cause must also be necessary for its effect.41 Applied to the tubercle bacillus discovered by Koch, this implied that anyone suffering from tuberculosis would have the tubercle bacillus in his body, and anyone with that bacillus in his system would suffer from tuberculosis; that is, the tubercle bacillus was necessary and sufficient for contracting tuberculosis. Henle seemed to want to use this to char acterize disease causa tion in general, but there was an unsatisfactory narrowness in his notion of causality. This was evident when he criticized doctor s in the following passage: Only in medicine are there causes that have hundreds of consequences or that can, on arbitrary occasions, remain entirely without effect. Only in medicine can the same effect flow from the most varied possible sources...For almost every disease, after a specific cause or the admission that such a cause is not yet known, one finds the same horde of harmful influences -- poor housing and clothing, liquor and sex, hunger and anxiety. This is just as scientific as if a physicist were to teach that bodies fall because boards or beams are removed...\" 42 Henle approved of the approach of physicists who sought a single common cause (gravitation) to explain each instance of a class of similar events (falling bodies) and felt that rationa l medicine should do the sa me. He criticized medical researchers of his time for attributing causation to events that immediately preceded the event instead of following ph ysicists in seeking universal scientific principles like gravitation. 41 Henle (1844) 42 Cited in Carter (2003),:25 30 One could argue that the Henle-Koch et iological standpoint often commits a similar sin. For example, the bacillu s that \"causes\" t uberculosis has an immediately preceding status, similar to that of the re moval of a board preceding the fall of a body. I would argue that it is more pertinent in Henle's example of falling bodies to identify the motivation for finding the cause of the fall. Depending on the motivation, the questions of who removed the board, and for what purpose, would be natural ones to ask. Indeed, if th e falling body was that of a human being working on a construction site and the co urts were trying the case of homicide after someone removed the board on which th e victim stood, no prosecutor in court would charge Newtonian gravitation with the crime. If an act of sabotage was involved in the removal of the board, th e cause of the fall, for purposes of ascribing reprehensibility and meting out punishment, woul d be the willful removal of the board by the saboteur. Henle's example for disease causation is symptomatic of the fact that the literatures of medicine and philosophy of science rarely intersect, even though accounts of causation in th e philosophy of science pote ntially could help elucidate the nature of disease causation. Conseque ntly the notion of disease causation is a subject with which modern epidemiologists have expressed difficulty. Stehbens, for example, laments that: \"(at) the crux of the issue is the use and meaning of cause in medicine...If epidemiology continues to disregard the misusage of terminology...it threatens the very survival of logic and science in medicine. 43 Carter declares that it is \"totally poin tless, hopeless and downright silly to think one can ever state precisely what it is for one thing to cause another.\" 44 As a matter of fact, the philosophic al problem posed by Koch, Henle, Carter and others arises from focusing on n ecessary causes and not paying enough attention to sufficient causes. 43 Stehbens (1992), 116 44 Carter (2003), 201 31 I shall argue below that a necessary cau se is often better viewed as the definition of the disease rather than its caus e. For example, the presence of the tubercle bacillus in the body merely defines tuberculosis as a disease: a person in whom the tubercle bacillus has taken hold suffers from tuberculosis, but this says nothing about how that bacillus came to ta ke hold in the patient's body i.e. the factors that combine and are sufficient, al ong with exposure to the bacillus, to bring about his disease. Among modern philos ophical approaches to causation, Mackie's INUS concept has been among the most help ful and was arguably the philosophical inspiration for the multicausality model advocated by epidemiologists like Rothman.45 Mackie extended Hume's idea that causes and effects are \"constantly conjoined\" and used the logic of necessary and sufficient cond itions to describe cause and effect relations. An INUS cond ition is an insuffici ent but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition. In Mackie's example of a fire following a short circuit in the house wiri ng, the short circuit alone would not have brought about a fire but it was an esse ntial (non-redundant) part of a set of conditions (presence of inflammabl e material, absence of sprinkler, etc) that were sufficient to cause the fire. The INUS model would be helpful fo r explaining cancers that can be attributed to specific pathogens as the trigger factor, for example the helicobacter pylorus bacterium that is associated with st omach ulcers that could develop into cancers. This bacterium is not sufficient to cause stomach cancer, nor is it necessary, as many victims show no signs of the bacteriu m. But clinical trials have shown that people who ha ve it in their stomachs have significantly higher chances of contracting can cer. For those who had th e bacterium and contracted stomach cancer, the presence of the bacter ium would be an INUS condition which, acting together with other \"unnecessary bu t sufficient\" factors such as stress, irregular meals and ingestion of foods with high levels of carcinogens, could be a contributing cause to the patient's succumbin g to cancer. In ge neral, the presence 45 Rothman (2002) 32 of the bacterium would thus be viewed as raising the probability of contracting stomach cancer. This has indeed been borne out by observational clinical trials and doctors now routinely administer antibio tics to remove it when it shows up in clinical examinations.46 Mackie's INUS concept helped ep idemiologists like Rothman and Greenland (2005) to propose multicausa lity models such as the \"causal pie\" illustrated in Figure 1 below: Figure 1 ( Source: Rothman and Greenland, 2005) Each constellation of component causes represented in Figure 1 is minimally sufficient to pr oduce the disease; that is, there is no redundant component cause. Each one is a necessary pa rt of that specific causal mechanism. A specific component cause may play a role in one, two, or all three of the causal mechanisms pictured. For example, exce ssive gastric secre tions could be the common factor \"A\" in all three causal mechanisms, but the helicobacter pylorus is 46 National Cancer Institute (2011): \"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacterium that is found in the stomach of about two-thirds of the world's populati on. H. pylori infection is a major cause of gastric (stomach) cancer and is associated with an increased risk of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma.\" http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/h-pylori-cancer. 33 present as \"G\" in th e causal mechanism II. 47 A given disease can be caused by more than one causal mechanism, and ev ery causal mechanism involves the joint action of a multitude of component causes. The purpose of this brief glimpse into the philosophy of causation has been to lead us to the idea that disease causation is not a si mple case of discovering one or more contributing factors, and that other considerations like motivation for identifying the cause may be involved. Th ere may also be a role for values, as discussed below. The relationship of these discussions to TCM theory will become apparent furthe r below (section 2.5). 2.4 Values and Disease Causation As a practical matter, medical scientis ts and researchers need to convey their findings on disease causation to he althcare and health policy managers who make decisions on allocation of resources to prevent and treat the disease in the communities that they manage. Multicausali ty models of disease are inadequate for this purpose. This may account for the appeal of the etiological standpoint to medical scientists, despite its inadequacies , as scientists need only to identify one cause for each disease and ar e spared the trouble of dealing with multiple and often mutually interacting causes. With multicausality mode ls, the scientific resear cher needs to exercise judgment as to which factors to includ e in the causal mode l for statistical investigation. To the extent that values come into play in these judgments, the identification of causes is value-laden. In practice, there ar e numerous candidates for causal factors but, as Nagel points out, the interest of the scientist determines what he selects for investigation.48 Different choices of factors lead to different causal pies. 47 This is my example. Rothman and Greenland use the example of a broken hip to make a similar point. 48 Nagel (1961), 486 34 (I have used the term \"value\" here in the manner that some philosophical discussions on the notion of scie nce being value-laden have used it.49 Some may prefer to use \"interest\" inst ead of value, as Nagel does in the above quote. I shall continue to refer to value with the caveat that it has a differe nt meaning from its other uses such as moral values.) Take our earlier tube rculosis example. Great strides in eradicating the disease have been made since Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus , but the disease has not been stamped out, and in many parts of the world its incidence is in fact increasing with mutations to strain s of the bacillus that are resistant to antibiotics (like streptomycin and rifampic in) commonly used for the treatment of the disease. The pharmacologist developing vaccines against the tubercle bacillus and antibiotics to kill it understandably regards the disease as being caused by a bacterium, as this would be consistent w ith his mission of creating agents to fight the bacillus and the value he therefore pla ces on discovering new antibiotics. But to the epidemiologist working in poorer countries where tuberculosis is still a serious killer, the cause of tuberculosis may not be the bacillus but rather the stresses of overwork, poor di et and unhealthy sanitary cond itions -- these provide the basis for the bacillus to spread and ta ke hold in the human body. Thousands in Asia and Africa die of the disease for very much the sa me reason that John Keats and Jane Austen are thought to have co ntracted the disease: poor nutrition and unhealthy living habits and conditions. Knowledge about the kind of tubercle bacillus associated with fresh outbreaks of the tuberculosis in some re gions of the world is of limited value for controlling the spread of th e disease, although it might lead to cures for those who have succumbed to it and are fortunate enou gh to receive treatment with antibiotics. Knowledge of the dietary factors and sanitary conditions that are associated with it, which may be obtained from epidemiologica l studies that includ e these factors in the causal pie, guides healthcare providers to determine optimal health expenditure plans. 49 See, for example, Rudner in Philosophy of Science (1953) and Douglas (2009) 35 Thus one can make the ar gument that effectiveness for achieving medical objectives would guide the researcher in th e inclusion of compon ents in the causal pie. This \"medical efficacy\" value favours rese arch programmes that focus on causes of illness that can in practice be ad dressed by public health policy. As we shall see later, a similar line of reasonin g applies to TCM notions of causality in illnesses, which is focused on those factors that a person can manage in order to avoid falling ill. 2.5 Illness and its causes in TCM theory We should distinguish between disease and illness . The term \"d isease\" as it is understood by Western me dicine is definable as, \"a disorder with a specific cause (which may or may not be known) and recognizable si gns and symptoms\". 50 It is therefore what the doctor diagnoses th e patient as having. On the other hand, as Lloyd suggests, illness is what the patient feels.51 Illnesses therefore form a separate universe that intersects with di sease. There are illnesses like the chronic fatigue syndrome that woul d not normally be treated as diseases. There are diseases like hepatitis B for which the carriers have the virus but do not manifest any symptoms of hepatitis a nd do not feel ill. The cr ude form of the etiological standpoint would treat all illnesses as di seases (or perhaps as chimeras, as some doctors regard chronic fati gue syndrome) although, as pointed out earlier, the etiological standpoint cannot properly inco rporate illnesses for which there is no necessary or sufficient cause. Chinese medicine, like much of anci ent Greek and Galenic medicine, has traditionally been more focused on the c ondition of the human body when it falls ill rather than on disease an d its cause. In most TCM co ntexts, it would be more appropriate to refer to the patient's illness than to his/her 'disease'. 50 Oxford Medical Dictionary (2007) 51 Lloyd (2003), 1 36 TCM theory regards the fundamental fact ors that lead to illness as being either external climatic factors (heat, co ld, dampness, wind, dr yness) or internal emotions (excessive pleasu re, anger, sadness, fear, an d excessive contemplation) as well as accumulated products of these factors like (phlegm and blood stasis). Even though modern TCM physicians are adequately schooled in microbiological sciences and are aware of the role that viruses, bacteria and cellular disorders play in disease, this does not change their adherence to the principle that the fundamental causal factors are climatic and emotional factors and their by- products. Examples of two common dise ases, the common cold and cancer, serve to illustrate this point. The Common Cold What causes the common cold? I once told a virologist friend that I was running a cold because I had \"caught a ch ill\", the implication being that it was caused by a chill. He disagreed and poin ted out that my cold was caused by a virus, not by a chill. When I asked where the virus had come from, he said that it was in the air and could be found everywhe re. But why had I caught a cold while he had not? He thought I might have been working too hard and my immune system was down. \"Since I caught th e cold because my immune system was down,\" I argued, \"and my i mmune system was down be cause I had been working too hard, would you not say that working t oo hard and a weaken ed immune system that succumbed to the chill were the real causes of my cold rather than a viral infection?\" The virologist was focused on the viral etiology of the common cold while I was focused on the environmental and intern al physiological factors. Both of us were guilty of what Lewis terms \"invidious discrimination\", each singling out a \"decisive\" cause of the cold and leavin g the others as \"causal conditions\".52 The virologist saw the rhinovirus as the cause of the common cold, and my weakened immune system only as a contributing cond ition. However, as a person interested 52 Lewis (1973), 556-567 37 in improving the health and fitness of pe ople, I was biased towards the holistic picture of internal body bala nce and the chill that broke the back of my immune system. I saw the presence of the rhinov irus in the human body as the definition of the common cold, not its cause. As there was nothing I could do to prevent people from being exposed to that virus, my value of medical efficacy led me to look for causes that I could manage or manipulate. My search for prevention of colds would thus focus not on the virus but on di etary, exercise and hygiene factors that could be managed. The clinical trials that I would advocate for the study of causation of cold would therefor e involve these causal factors. Cancer No other life-threatening disease is as common and cau sally complex as cancer. Some cancers are associated w ith specific pathogens, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) for cervical cancer, the helicobacter pylorus for stomach cancer and the Hepatitis B virus for liver cirrhosis, a fatal form of liver cancer. Other cancers are associated with living habits (smoking with lung and pancreatic cancers), and still others with environmenta l pollutants (insecticides with nasal- pharynx cancer). There is al so mounting evidence that ge netic factors (as in breast cancer), emotional stress (lym phoma) and high-fat diets (prostate cancer) exert significant influence. The interpretation of stat istical evidence for the impact of these varied factors on the probability of developing a malignant tumour is a treacherous enterprise as these factors exist together wi th a host of others that are potentially relevant. Setting up an y kind of clinical trial to id entify principal causal agents for specific kinds of cancer inevitably invol ves value judgments that determine the choice of factors to be included in the study. Such value judgments would be influenced by considerations of medical efficacy - that is by the judgment that in a given set of social and geog raphical environment, thos e causal factors that are controllable. 38 This seems evident in th e much-cited epidemiological study published by nutritional scientist Colin Campbell (200 4) at Cornell. Based on a 20-year epidemiological investigation of a large number of population samples in various regions of China, the study concluded th at a high animal pr otein diet (which includes dairy products, me at and fish) was the most important cause of many forms of cancer, as well as of cardiovasc ular disease and diabetes. Population samples in poorer parts of China that had very little animal protein in their diets showed low levels of cert ain cancers, even when peopl e were exposed to higher levels of carcinogens compared with th ose from other regions with high animal protein diets. For example, it was found that children fed on peanuts contaminated with the fungal product aflatoxin , associated with liver cancer, showed lower incidence of liver cancer if they came from regions where little animal protein or dairy products was consumed.53 As peanuts are an important source of protein and carbohydrates, and as the prevention of fungus moulds forming on peanuts requires impractical amounts of refrigeration and stor age facilities, the more effective alternative would be to discourage consumption of peanuts among populations with high levels of animal protein in their diet, or to discourage the consumption of animal proteins. From th is point of view, the principal cause of liver cancer in children is a di et rich in animal proteins. In using the methods of science to investigate the causes of disease, biomedical science is influenced by the va lues (interests) of the medical researcher and policy makers who seek the optimal us e of economic resources to achieve the objectives of health policy. That theory choice in medicine is value-laden, as some have argued it is in science, applies equally to TCM. Chinese medicine emphasizes the build ing up resistance to illness, as pointed out in the aphorism \" Zheng qi cun nei, xie bu ke gan \" (If the body is rich in healthy qi, it will not succumb to ex ternal pathogens.) In TCM terms, it would make mo re sense to regard the pres ence of the rhinovirus in the body as definition of a cold rather than its cause. From the viewpoint of 53 Campbell and Campbell (2004), 34-36 39 preventing colds, it is more useful to sa y that a cold is caused by exposure to weather and a weakened body defence sy stem, because you can do something about those but very little about rhinoviruses in the air. Alternatively, taking the causal pie approach, to emphasize the se gments of the causal pie relating to climatic and life-style factors would be more pr agmatic and value-driven. Likewise the TCM emphasizes the not ion that excessive emotion and inappropriate diet and living habits ar e the root causes of cancer rather than unusual cell growth and the rapid multip lication of cancer cells. The latter describes the mechanism by which can cers grow and take root but not the conditions that caused the cells to behave in this abnormal manner. 2.6 Translating Chinese medical terms In comparing the theories of Chin ese and Western medicines, another historically important issue is that of translating Chinese medical terms. This presents technical as well as ideological problems as th e choice of translation is inevitably affected by the view that one takes of the scientific nature of Chinese medical concepts. The issues of translation thus lie at the heart of the difficulties in understanding and interpreting TCM th eory within the framework of modern science and Western medicine. The translation to another language of ancient technical terms used in science and medicine presents special prob lems because many an cient concepts do not exist in modern theories. In the case of traditional Chinese medicine, which provides public health care to a signifi cant proportion of Chinese nationals and is also an important alternative medical syst em in many East Asian countries, the problem also has political and ideological dimensions. The translation of Chinese medical term s has a long history. The first original Chinese text to appear in a European language was a translation of the M`ai Ju\u00b4e (\"Secrets of the Pulse\") pub lished in French in 1671.54 In the 18th and 19th century, descriptions of Chinese medici ne continued to reach Europe, read by 54 See Wiseman (2000), 180 40 scholars who might not necessarily have taken the translated terms at face value and would have delved furthe r into their original mean ings. However, with the transmission of TCM to the West as al ternative medicine and the training of western practitioners through translated texts, translation became a professional medical issue. A study of two controversies over th e correct approach to translating Chinese medical terms may be instructiv e toward understandin g the problems of interpreting Chinese medical concepts in biomedical te rms. In describing and analysing these controversies below, I have to make reference to TCM terms like 'heat', 'fire', 'organs' and 'syndromes' that have meanin gs different from those in ordinary or Western medical language. Th ese terms will be ex plained in the next two chapters, and the re ader's indulgence is requested at this stage to focus on the issues of translation rather than on the specific meaning of these terms. The Needham-Porkert Controversy This controversy erupted in 1975 wi th the review by Needham and Lu (hereafter \"Needham\") of Po rkert's innovative work, The Foundations of Traditional Chinese Medicine . 55 The reviewers dismissed Porkert's attempt to create a whole new Western vocabulary fo r Chinese medical terms, calling it a \"courageous\" but failed effort. Porkert set out with the ambiti ous objective of providing a \"methodologically adequate, coherent, an d comprehensible account of the Chinese theories in a Western language (with) consistent use of a precise Western terminology to stand for that of the Chinese authors.\" He described his methodology as a \"normative\" translation ap proach in the sense that \"a given term of the foreign language is always rendered by one and the same word (or the same few words) of our language\". 56 Porkert appeared to be trying to construct a new Western vocabulary based on a scientific understanding of the concepts represented by the Chinese medical terms. The technical terms that he introduced 55 Needham and Lu (1975); Porkert (1974) 56 Porkert 1974:5-7 41 had a distinct Western medical flavour, co mplete with Latin roots, such as \"orb\" for zang (organs); \"orbisiconography\" for zangxiang (organ systems). Particularly interesting was his translation of a key term in Chinese medicine, qi (or \"ch'i\" in the Giles-Wade system of spelling.) 57 Based on lay language equivalents us ed in popular books, qi would be \"vital energy\".58 Porkert translated it as \"configurational en ergy\" and recorded 32 epithets of qi that are of greatest medical importance, such as qi orthopathicum for the Chinese term zheng- qi , the basic \"energetic resources for maintenance of physiological harmony\", and qi genuinum for zong-qi that resides in the thoraci c region that controls respiration and voice.59 Underlying these translations was the interpretation of qi as energy of one sort or another. This does not accord with the rich mo saic of meanings that the term carries in different contexts. In one Chinese scholarly study, it has been pointed out that in the Neijing alone, there are over 1700 mentions of the term qi with slightly different usages.60 Most things that appeared formless were regarded as some kind of qi, hence the rich use of qi for various aspects of the human body was inevitable, for example xie-qi (pathogenic factors), wei qi (defensive qi residing at the surface levels of the body) and yingqi (nourishing qi that moves through blood and organs for nourishment). Physiologically, qi in each of these contexts has a different meaning and function but these are related like members of a family as in Wittgenstein's family resemblances. 61 Most Western translators, cognizant of the rich and wide usage of the word qi, settled for using the transliteration \" qi\" centuries ago instead of trying to find equivalents for them from Western science and medicine. Porkert may have been 57 Porkert and Needham use the old Giles-Wade spelling; this dissertation will use the modern pin yin system throughout, even in quotations from authors using the old system. 58 See Reid ( 2001) 59 Porkert 1974:166-173 60 Wang 2001 61 Wittgenstein 1953:IX 42 seeking to dispel the ambiguities of qi by specific categorization into energy forms, thus taking a distinctly Western scientif ic interpretation of Chinese philosophy. Needham took the view that there were no equivalent words in the West for most key ancient Chinese medical terms. Ad opting terms of modern science or medicine as their equivalents would in Needham's view almost certainly be wrong or misleading, distorting the thinking or th e ancients: \"This was precisely the great danger to which Porkert is exposing hi mself to with his induction and energy models\". 62 Needham objected to Porkert's inventio n of a series of terms not found in previous TCM literature, preferring instead the simple literal translations of those terms complete with their ambiguities, as it was precisely because of these ambiguities that there had been \"vol uminous commentaries\" on the medical classics through the ages.63 example, Porkert us ed \"sinarteries\" (\"Chinese arteries\") for jingluo (meridians) used in acupuncture. In their celebrated work on acupuncture Celestial Lancelets , Lu and Needham (1980) used the more ambivalent term \"tracts\" for jingluo, leaving open the question of whether these were material conduits or fixed li nes like meridians in the human body. Needham conjectured that terms used in natural and medical philosophy contained \"an irreducible residue of ambi guity\" and questioned the feasibility of \"rendering ancient and medieval technical terms from their original languages into those understood by people living in the world of modern scie nce and technology\". At same time, they proposed a fresh approach, to create a vocabulary from semantic roots understood by international We stern readers: \"It could be that in the philosophy of science there is simply no way of incorporating earlier conceptual 'paradigms' in terms of later ones ... Perhap s the best solution will always be to refrain from seeking exact equivalents, in the case of Asian la nguages to coin new words from familiar ro ots when necessary.\" 62 Needham and Lu (1975), 498 63 Needham and Lu (1975), 499n69 43 In a rejoinder, Porkert branded Needham as a historian of science and medicine whose prime concern was \"the plau sibility and readability of his findings\" rather than \"the methodology of Chinese science in general and Chinese medicine in particular.\"64 Porkert's approach was norma tive in the sense of translating Chinese medical concepts in a way that he thought woul d help people use TCM to diagnose and treat illnesses. We find a similar divide in the debate three decades later between Wiseman and Xie. The Wiseman-Xie debate This debate began when the second edition of Wiseman and Feng's A Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medical Terms (2002) published in China received an unfavourable review from Western medical scholar Xie Zhufan at Peking University. He disagreed with Wi seman's translation- approach based on faithfulness of translated terms to thei r original intended meanings in ancient Chinese medical classics.65 The controversy culminated in a meeting of the Western region of the World Health Organization (WHO), at which terminological issues were debated amongst specialists from China, Korea and Japan among others. Wiseman, who wrote his PhD dissertation at Exeter on the translation of Chinese medical terms and taught medical translation at the Ch ang Gung University Medical faculty in Taiwan, shared with me an interesting insider perspective of the process for compiling the WHO list when I met him some years later. 66 Choosing the translations for many medical terms was ap parently the subject of intense lobbying not only among the Chinese, but also Korean and Japane se specialists, for whom certain English equivalents carried differe nt, sometimes negative, nuances in their own countries. The transl ation decision for each term was laboriously taken by majority vote. The final list was then not likely to produce methodological consistency, although in the main it repr esented a victory for the Xie Zhufan group 64 Porkert 1974:502 65 Xie and White (2005) 66 At Chang Geng University, Taiyuan (Taiwan) in Dec 2008 where he was teaching medical translation to students in TCM. 44 which had advocated extensive use of eq uivalent Western medical terms. The English Translation of Common Terms in Traditional Chinese Medicine (2004 ) was subsequently published with the en dorsement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the WHO Regional Of fice for the Western Pacific. Wiseman and Feng's starting point for the compilation of A Practical Dictionary of Chinese Medicine was \"the accurate transmission of original Chinese medical knowledge\", rejectin g Xie's argument that \"a pr e-modern medicine of a distant culture must undergo adaptation befo re it can be of use to modern Western society\". They rejected term transl ations that introduce Western medical connotations and terms that might \"invite interference of ideas alien to Chinese medicine\".67 This ideological stance may have echoed the resentment of conservative Chinese physicians towards the encroachment by Western medicine into their medical practices through the integration policies started by Mao in the 1960s. Insistence that translation of tec hnical terms be faithful to the original intent of the ancients amounted to rejectio n of efforts by modern Chinese scientists to find biomedical equivalents for the Chinese concepts, an approach thought necessary to integrate Chin ese and Western medicine. By advocating a \"source- oriented approach\", which he deemed necessary for dealing with the \"fuzziness\" of Chinese medical concepts, Wiseman opted fo r faithfulness to the concepts of the ancient culture.68 The most direct form of source-oriente d translations is the loanword, a word adopted from a foreign language with little or no modification.69 For example \"mucus\" in Latin is translated as \"mucus\" in English, and \" os sphenoideum\" as \"sphenoid bone\". Loanwords are rarely us ed in translations of Chinese medical terms, the notable exceptions being qi, yin and yang , which have gained currency and found their way into English dictiona ries. Another form of source-oriented translations is the loan translation, wh ich is an expression adopted from another 67 Wiseman and Feng (2002), 17,21 68 Wiseman 2000),1 69 It is similar to the transliteration, using \"the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet or language\" (Concise Oxford). For Chinese translations to English, the result is generally the same as the loanword. 45 language in a literally translated form, for example mucus in Latin translates to schleim (\"slime\") in German. Xie's approach was radically differ ent: \"Expressions proposed as the standard were carefully examined from the viewpoint of We stern medicine...the proposed standard terminology had to m eet the basic requireme nts of scientific nomenclature\".70 Xie set himself a daunting task, insisting that such nomenclature can be established only if they \"precisely reflect these concepts of Chinese medicine and at the same time are widely accepted th rough common practice\"71 To precisely reflect the concepts of Chin ese medicine with Western words seemed to be difficult enough (in fact, as I shall ar gue in later chapters, it is an impossible task) without insisting that they already have wide acceptance through common practice. This courageous attempt is remi niscent of that of Porkert, although this time it has the virtue of not creating awkward new vo cabulary but uses terms already familiar in clinical work. The diffi culty lies in constantly making mental adjustments and understanding those famili ar terms in quite di fferent ways when they appear in Chinese medi cal contexts. For example, as we shall discuss in Chapter 4.1, \"spleen\" as used in TCM has a different meaning from that of the same term in Western medicine: in TCM - it incorporates a family of functions largely to do with digestion, whereas in Western medicine the spleen removes worn-out red blood cells and other foreig n bodies from the bloodstream and also serves as a reservoir of blood. Xie's attack on the use of loan tran slations began with a condescending remark: \"Mr Wiseman believes that Wester n medical terms chosen as equivalents of Chinese medical terms should be words known to all speakers and not requiring any specialist knowledge or instrumentation ( sic) to understand or identify, and strictly western medical terms should be avoided...The English terms thus created...make ( sic) the English glo ssary in chaos... traditional Chinese medicine 70 Han in Forward to Xie's On Standard TCM Nomenclature (2003) 71 Xie 2003:1 46 is not regarded as a system of medicine but merely some Oriental folklore.\" 72 Wiseman retorted that Xie's approach to translation degraded Chinese medicine: \"Biomedicized translation of Chinese medicine destroys the integrity and independence of Chinese medical concepts; it devalues Chinese medicine. It also reflects a deep-seated sense of in feriority about Chinese medicine.\"73 The reference to an inferiority comple x about Chinese medicine would have touched a raw nerve in doctors like Xie who were trained in Western medicine before being required by the state to study Chinese medicine with the aim of integrating it with Western medicine. They would have found assimilation of TCM by Western medici ne more palatable than integr ation with it. At the same time they were viewed by th e traditional Chinese medical community as betraying Chinese culture, submitting it to foreig n domination because th ey suffered from an inferiority complex about the backwardness of Chinese science. Wiseman made a strong point w ith his example of the term feng huo yan , translated by him as \"wind-fire eye\", a red-eye symptom caused by a number of possible conditions, among which is having one drin k too many. In TCM terminology, alcohol stokes \"fire\" in the liver and mobili zes \"wind\" upwards to inflame the eyes. Xie's translation \" acute conjunctivitis\" sounded silly to the TCM physician as a red eye nor mally affects more than just the conjunctiva and is not necessarily associated with an infection or with allergy as is the case with acute conjunctivitis.74 This example indicates that Wiseman may be right to reject Western medical translations when these ar e clinically inaccurate. But it is does not necessarily support his more dubious (dogmatic) ideological position that being faithful to the ancients and not ad mitting modern biomedical interpretations of Chinese concepts make fo r more useful translations of Chinese medical texts. 72 Xie and Liu 2005:Abstract 73 Wiseman (2006), 225 74 Taber's Cyclopaedic Medical Dictionary lists 17 medical uses of the term conjunctivitis for inflammations of the conjunctiva. 47 Analysis of the controversies Needham's starting point was that translations should faithfully reflect the thinking of the authors of the Chinese medi cal classics, but this was not Porkert's primary objective. As pointed out in the last chapter, there is a clear difference between these classics and modern texts us ed in the instruction of students of traditional Chinese medicine in China. This drove different approaches to translation, depending on whether the intention was one of medical anthropology, to reflect the original thinking of an cients, or to communicate TCM theory incorporating modern uses of these conc epts that may have evolved since the ancient texts were written. If indeed Chinese technical terms have inherent ambiguities within the Western conceptual framework, as Needham claimed, then his proposal to create new words seems like a tall order: how does one create words to fit concepts that are ambiguous? To preserve th e thinking of the ancients is perhaps to make a case for the use of literal transl ations and to reje ct translations to Western medical equivalents based on modern interpretations. This would emerge later as a central issue in the debate between Wiseman and others on the use of \"source-oriented\" translations. Like the Needham-Porkert controversy, an underlying problem of the Wiseman-Xie debate is the failure of both to differentiate between translations of ancient texts and translations of technical terms used in modern texts of Chinese medicine. Wiseman's case for source-orient ed translations would appear to be a strong one for scholarly translations of ancient medical classics with a view to understanding the thinking of the ancients. It has the su pport of German sinologist and translator of ancient Chinese medical texts Unschuld who argues that even though Chinese terms have different mean ings when used in a Western medical context, they should have th e same translations simply because \"the conceptual interpretation of reality ca nnot be part of the transl ation of the generic term employed to designate this reality; otherwise, a translation would become 48 unfeasible ( sic), if not impossible.\" 75 For example, the term xue (blood) in the classics has some functions not found in We stern medical understanding of the term, xue should still be translated as \"blood\". Unschuld seems to be simply saying that such translations are not alwa ys very good, sometim es even silly, but they are the best available. On the other hand, modern textbooks in China were written to systematize the theory and practice of Chinese medicine and to ensure a level of uniformity in terminology for the teaching of TCM in co lleges. Key portions of ancient texts like Huangdi Neijing as well as later works by fa mous physicians like Zhang Zhongjing and Li Donyan were extracted and subjected to interpretations with fewer ambiguities than in the original. Pr eservation of the thinking of the ancients was already compromised by extraction a nd explanation in mo dern language. Even the vocabulary and concepts of Western medicine crept into the terminologies used in these modern texts. The extent to which Western medical te rms could be used as equivalents of Chinese medical terms ultimately has to be limited by the differences in the theoretical foundations of the two system s of medicine. For example, Chinese diagnosis revolves around \"zheng\" ('syndromes') as distinct from Western medical 'diseases'. Syndromes in TCM th eory are imbalances in the body caused by deficiencies or excesses in yin or yang , or by stagnati on of blood or qi. A TCM condition like bi , caused by blocked or stagnating qi, when translated as \"arthralgia\" would fail to include the vari ety of symptoms associated with the condition of bi. Arthralgia in Western medici ne is severe pain in a joint 76, and does not capture pain in the muscles and tissues nearer the skin, which bi includes. Wiseman uses the term \"impediment\", bu t this is not satisfactory either as impediment refers to the blockage of qi, whereas bi is the resultant painful condition felt by the patient. 75 Unschuld (1989), 100-102 76 Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary (2007). 49 More extensive use of loan words ca n go some way avoid such problems .77 For example, pi (spleen) should be tran slated as the loanword pi when it refers to the functional system involved in digest ion, which is what it principally means in TCM theory. A number of loanwords like qi, yin and yang have already entered English vocabulary th rough long usage. For studen ts of TCM in English to assimilate into their vocabulary a core number of loanwords for key Chinese medical concepts would not be unreasona ble to ask of people who intend to practice TCM, or of the serious reader of Chinese medical lite rature. With an expanded Chinese vocabulary among foreign readers of TCM texts in translation, there would be less need either to use inappropriate Western medical \"equivalents\" or to live with source-oriented translat ions that unnecessarily retain the deep ambiguities of the ancients. 2.7 TCM Theory: A Synopsis The core theory and concep ts in TCM were, as noted earlier, developed at a time when very litt le was understood about human anatomy and physiology. Unlike Greece and Rome in antiquity, an cient China forbade dissections as the human body was considered sa cred. Ancient Chinese de scriptions of the human body organs and substances contained therein were therefore simplistic and often conjectural. However the theory built ar ound these entities became more complex in order to explain observable physiol ogical phenomena, diagnose illnesses, prescribe therapies and contend with co mplications of changing symptoms as illnesses progress. As a prelude to the discussi ons of these issues in subsequent chapters of this dissertation, I provide a short statement of the essence of TCM theory to which the reader can refer from time to time to bring back into focus entities, concepts and models in TCM. The concepts and models mentioned ther ein will of course require fuller explanation; this will be provid ed in the rest of the dissertation. 77 See Buck (2000) 50 .................................................................. Brief Statement of the Essence of TCM Theory TCM theory consists of a number of models within which entities and concepts, and their mutual relationships, are presented in a manner that renders them applicab le to the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. The TCM picture of the human body is simple: besides skin, bone and connective tissue, the body comprises organs , three basic fluids (qi, blood and jingye ), and pathways ( meridians or channels) along which qi and other entities can travel. The healthy body is one in which there is internal balance and normal flow of fluids and energy. Illness is expressed as a condition, or conditions, under whic h these flows are impeded and/or a number of entities are not in bala nce. Such pathological conditions are known as TCM syndromes . TCM models attempt to explain the pathological conditions underlying illnesses. Diagnosis and therap y then consists of identifying the pathological co nditions and finding matching therapies for them. Th is approach is known differentiating the syndrome and applying a ppropriate therapy ('bianzhenglunzhi '). Thus, TCM treatment is basically directed at re-establishing balance and unimpeded flows, rather than at eliminating germs or correcting abnormal cell behaviour of cells as is the case for modern biomedicine. In other words, TCM treatment is directed at resolving syndromes rather than overcoming disease. ....................................... ............................ In line with the above, the basic theory of TCM may be stat ed in six parts: 1. The physical picture of the human body comprising organs, meridians and the three basic fluids, be sides muscle, ligaments, skin and bone. 2. The role of mind (spirit) and emotions in health and illness 3. Basic causes of illness: These are cl assified into external pathogenic and internal pathogenic factors. External factors comprise mainly climatic influences (heat, cold, damp ness, dryness, wind, summer 'fire') that can invade the body. Internal factors comprise harmful emotions and improper living habits. 51 External and internal pat hogenic factors upset balan ce and interrupt smooth flows in the body, causing illness 4. Patterns of progression of illne ss (pathogenesis). Progression consists of the development of syndro mes and changes in these syndromes as illness progresses. 5. Models in TCM. Thes e models attempt to explain relationships among physical components of the body as well as relati onship between mind and body, the conditions under which the body falls ill, and the meth ods used to restore health. They include the Five-element (or Five-phase) model, the mind-body relationship, and the functioni ng of a network of channels or meridians in the body along which qi and pathogenic fa ctors can travel. 6. Methods of clinical diagnosis of illness and therapies. The four major therapeutic methods are the use of medicinal herbs, acupuncture, medical massage ( tuina ) and qigong (breathing and medi tation techniques). (Parts 1-2 are covered in Chapter 3 and 4 and parts 3-6 in Chapter5.) 52 3. TCM Theory: Basic Entities According to TCM, the basic entities in the body comprise qi, blood and body fluids essentia l to the functioning of the body,78 and also, when the body is ill, certain pathogens like heat, phlegm and wi nd. I begin by describing the alleged entities as they are pres ented in Chinese medical text books, then provide interpretations of the mean ings and epistemic status of these entities. The objective is not to give a comprehensive account of entities in TCM theory but rather to identify and discuss epistemolo gical questions concerning their functions and existence and to provide biomedical interpretations of these entities to the extent that this is possible. Their descri ptions in Chinese me dical texts use terms and concepts that are part of TCM vocabulary and may not always have equivalents in biomedical science. Ho wever it is necessary to lay out these descriptions before attempting to interpret them. Three of these entities - qi, phlegm and wind - will be analyzed in more detail as each repr esents a special way of conceptu alizing physiological processes in the body. As the discussion of TCM entities will invariably involve mention of the vital organs of the body, whic h is the main subject of the next chapter, it needs to be pointed out at this stage that the organs in TCM are clusters of functions and not the somatic structures to which modern Western anatom y gives the same name. This in part reflects th e influence of ancient Chin ese thought which emphasizes functions and processes rather than the physical nature of the underlying entities. The apparent disregard for ontology will again be encountered in Chapter 5 when we shall see yin and yang being treated sometimes as a ttributes and at other times as substances. 78 Another substance, jing or essence, has a close relationship with qi. Qi and jing transform into each other, and jing can be interpreted as a primordial source of qi, and qi, as a form of energy, can be converted to jing in substantial form. Jing as a substance stored in the kidney and other organs will be discussed in Chapter 4. 53 3.1 Qi, blood and body fluids Although we ha ve referred to qi as a substance, the physical nature that TCM attributes to it is somewhat more ambiguous. In TCM theory, qi ( has a number of specific meanings de pending on context: it usua lly refers to the moving force behind virtually every physiological fu nction in the body. When stored in the vital organs, qi is a fuel-like substance waitin g to be conver ted to energy. The concept of qi also appears in the literature on the Chinese martial arts and the qigong art of healing. Practitioners of these arts claim to be able to transfer some kind of life force to anot her person for tonic and healing purposes; they also call this qi. TCM theory is silent on whet her such transfers are in fact possible. Whatever gets tran sferred by healers, if anyt hing, may not necessarily be the same qi with which TCM theory deals. Blood ( xue ) in TCM is functionally similar to blood in Western medicine. It is closely related to qi. Blood flow in the body is thought to be propelled by the qi of the heart. If this heart- qi is inadequate, blood wo uld become too weak to circulate and this can have an impact on the working of the mind, causing conditions such as restlessness and insomnia . Other internal or gans like the lung, spleen and liver are also involved in th e movement of blood. The lung is thought to be connected to al l vessels of the body hence the aphorism \"t he lung faces all vessels \"; it accumulates qi and blood from the whole body to assist the heart to propel bl ood movement in the body. The spleen is said to \"command\" blood, directing it to circulate normally and preventing it from flowing out of the blood vessels. The liver stores bloo d and regulates the volume of blood, smoothing the activity of qi to promote blood circulation. Factors that can affect bl ood circulation are the state of the vessels and the changes of the body's internal environment expressed in TCM terms like cold, heat, phlegm, dampness, blood stas is, and swellings and nodules. 54 Blood and qi are so closely related that th ey behave somewhat like two sides of the same coin. TCM theory puts it this way: \"Blood is the mother of qi and qi is the marshal of blood .\" Blood carries qi and is also essential to the production of qi by providing nutrients to the vital organs and the meridians. Qi is the driving force that en ables blood circulation; as we noted earlier, qi also plays a role in the production of blood. Body fluids ( jingye ) help maintain li fe activities in the body. Body fluids contain mainly water and nutrient substances. Th ey are components of fluid in the blood vessels and also flow outside the vessels in the vital or gans. Body fluids can be excreted as tears, nasa l discharges and saliva. Among the key functions of body fluids are moistening and nourishing and th e transportation of used (turbid) qi for excretion. By assigning a variety of functions to each of the three basic substances qi, blood and body fluids, TCM th eory tries to capture all the known and observable physiological processes in the body that involve the movement of these substances up and down and around the body, and from th e inside to the outside of the body. 3.2 Pathogens Besides the essential entities of qi, blood and body fluids in the body, pathogens of various kinds ma y reside in the body. Thes e are classified as either exogenous pathogens, origin ating from climatic fact ors outside the body, or endogenous pathogens that are created wi thin the body. Th e term endogenous pathogen used in its wider sense refers to primary internal factor s that cause organs to be dysfunctional, leading to illness. The term covers five pathogenic factors whose behaviours have simila rities to those of external climatic pathogenic factors, namely wind ( feng ), cold, dampness, dryness and heat.79 Phlegm ( tan ) and 79 Wu endogenous pathogenic factors\" neisheng blood secondary en dogenous pathogens as they are pathological substances created by en dogenous factors. We briefly describe these latter pathogens below. (The \"seven emotions\", which will be dealt with in Chapter 5, are sometimes also regarded as endogenous pathogens as they can also impair organ-function and physiological processes.) Descriptions of pathogens dr aw on the concept pairs of yin-yang and deficiency-excess. Yin and yang are opposing characteristics. Yin is soft, dark and cool, whilst yang is hard, bright and warm. (The next chapter will discuss the yin- yang principle in more detail.) Deficiency and excess are also referred to as asthenic and sthenic conditi ons, and are the rough equi valents of depletion and repletion respectively in ancient Greco- Roman medicine. Deficiency is usually characterized by inadequacy of energy and paleness of comp lexion, excess by restlessness and a reddish complexion. Th ese concepts will be discussed further in Chapter 5 under syndromes . Wind Wind that is part of the exte rnal climatic environment is exogenous wind and considered in TCM to be a source of illness as it can pene trate the skin and bring about a variety of conditions includi ng headache, joint stiffness and arthritic pain. In combination with cold, heat or dampness, it ca n lead to sore throats, coughs and colds and fevers. A characteri stic of ailments caused by exogenous wind is movement; hence arthritic pain th at moves from one pa rt of the body to another is thought to have wind involvement. Endogenous wind , because it is characteri zed by movement, may be regarded as an extension of the exoge nous wind concept to processes inside the body. In TCM theory, endoge nous wind is produced by pathological processes in the liver. It is usually referred to as \"liver-wind\" and its movement as \"internal disturbance of liver-wind\" ( ganfeng neidong ). 56 Cold and Heat Endogenous cold arises from deficiency in yang . As the kidney yang is the source of warming of the whol e body, deficiency in kidney yang is the predominant contributor to endogenous co ld. Endogenous heat , on the other hand, comes from a variety of sources, includ ing emotional stresses, deficiency of yin (causing yang to be dominant), and exogenous wi nd and cold that transform into heat. (Heat and cold will be further discussed under syndro mes in Chapter 5.) Dampness and Dryness Endogenous dampness is thought to arise from the spleen which in TCM theory has the function of transforming water into qi as part of the digestive process in the body. Dysfunction of the spleen causes fluid to accumulate and disrupt the spleen's 'food-tr ansforming and tran sportation' function; it can also produce phlegm. Endogen ous dryness is associated with deficiency of yin and/or blood, and is manifested in the observable dryness of the eyes, nose and throat as well as (by the TCM conceptual framewor k) in the intestines, lung and stomach where it is not observable except by its supposed manifestations. Phlegm Phlegm in TCM refers not just to sput um, the sticky viscous substance that lines one's throat and bronchioles, causing irritation and coughing as the body tries to expel it. Phlegm in TCM also takes th e form of nasty clear fluids that inhabit the vital organs, causing ai lments ranging from indigest ion, lassitude, insomnia and irascible moods to headaches, epilepsy and strokes, earnin g it the aphorisms \"a hundred ailments tan zuosui disturbances blood circul ation, leading to clots, subcutaneous 57 purpura or lumps. When stas is is not manifested in cl ots or lumps but is more widespread, it is thought to cause general pain, irregula r pulse and manic anxiety. It is caused by exogenous clim atic factors like cold that causes blood to stagnate or coagulate, or by emotional factors. Th e condition or pathol ogical process that leads to the formation of blood stas is is termed 'blood stagnation' ( xueye ) in TCM. It is thought to be caused by ex ogenous factors such as prolonged exposure to cold and by certain emotions that upset internal balance. As most TCM entities are complex and have multifarious meanings depending on the context of their use, and as many aspects of each of these entities are unobservable (in a sense similar to that of electrons not being directly observable whilst cells, gene s and neurotransmitters are), the familiar question arises as to the supposed ontological stat us of these concepts and entities. We address this key question now by a more de tailed analysis of three entities, qi, phlegm and wind. 3.3 Interpreting Qi () Qi is undoubtedly the central and the mo st pervasive entity in TCM theory. In ancient Chinese cosmology, qi was the primordial ether-like substance that constituted the universe at the beginning of time. It transformed into all the substances in the universe an d also became the moving force behind all physical processes, including physiological proces ses in living things. In the Chinese language, the word qi is to be found as a component of hundreds of compound words whose meanings cover almost ev ery aspect of the universe, from the weather ( qixiang ) and evil forces ( xiqi ) to glow of health on one's face ( qise ) and the spirit of an artistic work ( qiyun ). In distant antiquity, concepts of qi from philosophy fo und their way into the theory of Chinese medici ne, which came to regard qi as the basic constituent of the human body as well as the substance that maintains the body's life processes. Lay 58 treatments of qi in popular books on TCM commonly describe it as \"vital energy\" while also referring to its storability as a substanc e within the vital organs.80 In fact, ancient Chinese thought did not distinguish between matter and energy. Like ancient philosophy, Chinese medicine was more concerned with the functions and actions of qi than its intrinsic nature.81 Some scholars have interpreted qi as \"matter on the verge of becoming energy, or energy at the point of materializing\". This appears like fudging, inspired perh aps by the Chinese Doct rine of the Golden Mean that advocates seek ing a compromise between two competing claims.82 Qi presents two related epistemic ques tions pertaining to its observability and to the possible existence of an entity underlying its multip le manifestations. Because qi has so many meanings even with in TCM theory, questions regarding whether or not it is observ able, or measurable by scientific instruments, or its effects are testable, cannot be meaningfu lly addressed unless we are specific about which meaning of qi we have in mind. A common meaning of qi as an observable entity is air which in TCM theory is absorbed by th e lungs and converted into other forms of qi after interacting with other su bstances in the body. The many other meanings of qi are best explained by enumerat ing, in accordance with TCM theory, the various physiological processes that involve qi. After I have enumerated these physiological processes, I shall provide an interpretation of qi that eschews the classical Chinese notion of an entity underlying these processes. Qi is classified into vari ous forms in Chinese medical literature to describe specific capabilities. Th e classifications within the classical theory of qi are summarized below.83 80 eg. Reid (2001). 81 Some have made the argument that the absence of a matter-energy duality in Chinese thought presaged the discovery of the mutual convertibility of matter and energy in 20th century physics. It is more likely that the Chinese simply never bothered with these ontological distinctions and this turned out to be not far removed from the discovery of modern physics. 82 See Kaptchuk (2000) and the references to Sivin (1976) and Bennet (1978). 83 Based on the Huangdi Neijing , two college texts on TCM theory, Wang Xinhua (2001) Zhongyi Jichu Lilun (Foundations of TCM Theory) and the entry \" Qi\" in the Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine Zhongguo dabaikequanshu. 59 3.3.1 The Classical Theory of Qi Formation and classification Various forms of qi are classified by origin, function and location: By origin : Yuan-qi ( ), or primordial qi, is inherited in the first instance from parents and stored in the vital organs (mainly the kidney) and the meridians and collaterals. Acquired qi, on the other hand, is generated from air and food after birth throughout life. Part of it can be converted to replenish the body's stock of yuan-qi which is depleted by work, stress and illness. By function : The main forms are pectoral- qi, nutrient- qi and defensive- qi. Pectoral- qi or zong-qi () is situated in the thoracic area, warming the blood vessels and nouris hing the lung; an abundance of it gives a person a sonorous voice. Nutrient- qi or ying-qi (circulates in the body and nourishes the internal organs. Defensive- qi or wei-qi ( circulates in the outer layer of the body and forms an armour that defends against external pathogens. When it is weak, the body is vulnerable to harmful climatic influences like cold , wind, dampness and heat. Defensive qi also helps regulate sweat to maintain body temperature. By location : Qi is present in every orga n and along the meridians, hence the existence of such terms as heart- qi, spleen- qi, stomach- qi and lung- qi as well as meridian qi. Each kind of qi has one or more roles related to the functions of these organs and of the meridians. Physiological functions of qi The principal functions of qi are as follows. The propelling function that drives blood, en ables fluid passage within the body, and is the moving force behind digestion. 60 The warming function, with qi as a source of heat for body, carrying nourishment with it for body tissues. This function explains why an inadequate level of qi can be associated with cold hands and feet. The protective function, with circulating qi at the surface level of the body and so protecting it against invasions of external pathogens such as wind and cold. The nutrient function, with nutrient qi (ying-qi ) derived from digestive processes being converted into material constituents of the organs and meridians, as well as providin g the energy and driving force for physiological processes in the living body.84 The fixating or consolidating function, which ho lds back fluid to stay within blood vessels and tissues and prevents excessive loss of fluid by sweating and blood oozing out of blood vessels. The transforming function, converting food in to a kind of essence for nutrition, transforming one kind of fluid into another, and helping the excretion of waste substances. The intermediation function, connecting and harmonizing the functions of the various organs thro ugh the movements of qi along the meridians and collaterals as well as up and down th e trunk of the body and between the inner and outer layers of the body. 85 These functions are reflected by the action of qi in two core areas of TCM theory - in the mind-body relationship, an d in pathogenesis and related therapy. Qi's role in the mind-body relationship : The Neijing states that \"the five zang-organs...transform five kinds of qi to generate the emotions of joy, anger, contemplation, anxiety and fear.\" 86 Each kind of qi activity takes place in an individual organ and produces an emotion that in turn can cause harm to the organ or another part of the body. For example, anger harms the liver, causing 84 Wu Dunxu, ed. (2000), 43 85 Wang Xinhua (2001) , 71--72 86 Yellow Emperor's Tianyuanji Dalunpian , 731. 61 imbalances that result in headaches, con vulsions, dizziness or strokes, or a combination of these. Likewise, ex cessive 'contemplation' (amounting to brooding) results in impaired spleen- qi, leading to disorders in digestion.87 Qi's role in pathogenesis and therapy : Pathogenesis refers to the origination and development of an illness. Within the framework of TCM models, this is described in terms of the origination of syndromes and the dynamics of their transformation into other syndromes as the illness progresses (see Chapter 5 ). Two common qi-related syndromes are qi deficiency (low level of qi) and obstruction in the flow of qi. The former could be the result of physical stress or the depletion of qi because of illness; the latter can be brought about by the presence of dampness and phlegm in the body that impedes free qi movement, or by emotional factors such as anger or an xiety that cause st agnation of liver qi. Because of the close relationship between qi and blood, obstruction in qi flow is commonly accompanied by disorders in blood circulation such as blood stagnation. The appropriate therapy for an existing syndrome lies in restoring balance. In our examples, this involves correcting qi deficiency with qi tonics and restoring qi flow with qi-regulating medications or acupuncture treatments. Zheng-qi: Another common meaning of qi encountered in Chinese medical texts is zheng-qi ( ), an overarching term that encapsulates all forms of qi that drive the physiological proc esses in the body, protect it against disease-causing pathogens, and give the body the capacity to recover from illness. The function of protection against pathogens is similar to that of the immune system in Western medicine. Zheng-qi is translated variously as upright qi, true qi, genuine qi, vital qi and healthy qi. The Neijing 's prescription for preventing illness is captured in the famous aphorism \"If there is adequate zheng-qi , the body would not succumb to a pathogenic attack\" ( zheng-qi cun nei , xie bu ke gan \" ). As 87 \"...all diseases are caused by the disorder of qi. For example, anger drives qi to flow upwards, excessive joy slackens qi, sorrow exhausts qi, fear makes the qi sink, and excessive contemplation binds qi.\" Jutong lunpian (Discussion of Pains), 481. See Wang (2001), 467-472 62 zheng-qi is the totality of various forms of qi that drive the body and protect it, the Neijng 's medical insight lies in enjoining people to cultivate all the forms of qi that together constitute the body 's defences against natural external pathogens as well as internal pathogens produced by bad emotions and poor living habits. . 3.3.2 Issues in the interpretation of qi Even more meanings of qi than the principal ones enumerated above can be found in the literature of Chinese medici ne. According to one estimate, in the medical classic Huangdi Neijing alone, there are 1700 di fferent uses of the word qi.88 Questions that natu rally arise include: 1. Is qi a substance or a form of energy? 2. What if anything is the commonality underlying the vari ous meanings of qi in Chinese medical theory? 3. Is qi a real entity or a \"convenient fictio n\"? In other words, is the theory of qi meant to be interpreted re alistically or is the theory to be taken as talking about merely fictional entities, introduced to codify the phenom ena in a convenient way? On the first question, as pointed earlie r, the distinction between matter and energy tends to be blurre d in Chinese philosophy, and is reflected in the TCM concept of qi. Where these distinct ions are being made, qi is a substance in some of its roles and a form of energy in others. The second question arises only beca use believers in conventional TCM theory presuppose that a common entit y underlies all the functions that qi performs. This is the implicit commonly-accepted un derstanding of phys icians trained in TCM, and textbooks reflect th is understanding by enumerating the various kinds of qi and their functions, as wa s done above under \"The cla ssical theory of qi\". No common entity need exist for th e classical theory of qi to be meaningful or useful. 88 Wang (2001), 44 63 The commonality underlying the various meanings of qi in TCM theory seems to be that the notion of qi is invoked in descriptions of all physiological processes in the human body. Nothing moves or changes without some role played by qi. In effect, qi can be viewed as a con cept that covers all change and movement. Some kind of qi, or a form of qi, is involved in moving blood and fluids, in digestion of food, in excretion of waste matter, in gene rating emotions originating in the organs, in the production of blood, and so on. This view of qi as a generic term for the agen t of change would be in line with ancient Chinese philosophy's view of the world as beginning with qi, which materialized into animate as well as inanimate bodies, and which also drives all processes. Viewed in this light, questions regarding the observability and measurability of qi and its ontological status are m eaningful only with reference to the specific contextual meaning of qi. For example, pectoral- qi is the kind of qi that is presumed by TCM th eory to exist in the thoracic region, warming the blood vessels and nourishing the lung; an abun dance of it gives a person a sonorous voice. Orthodox Chinese phy sicians faithful to ancient texts would likely be comfortable with the claim, in the ma nner of Maxwell (1962), that pectoral qi exists in reality but scienc e has not yet found a way of detecting and measuring it. But the modern TCM physician well versed in anat omy and physiology might well find it more comfortable to see pectoral qi as a metaphor for th e ability of the lungs to do their work in assisting blood circul ation and generating voice. One could take the power of a person's voice as a proxy for his level of pectoral- qi and set up a measurement scale based on his vocal po wer. Indeed the ordinary language Chinese expression for someone with a powerf ul voice is that he is 'abundant in pectoral- qi'. Pectoral-qi in this context would merely be a way of expressing functional aspects of the lungs and diaphrag m that are involved in breathing, blood circulation and voice production. Viewed as a substance in the body, it is a convenient fiction, similar to the kind that the scientific instrumentalist has in mind for entities in physics. It is a representation not n ecessarily of some underlying real material entity but rather of a physiological capability of the body. 64 What matters ultimately is whether or not there is inde pendent evidence for the truth of those parts of TCM theory that invoke qi. Every observable situation involving a patien t can be given a post hoc interpretation in terms of the TCM categories and qi in particular. The pertinent question is whether once thus interpreted, predictions are made that can then be tested. (The answer is in the affirmative, and is the main subject of Chapter 6.) Likewise, the conc ept of spleen- qi is an attempt to capt ure the capability of the body's digestive system to transfor m food into a form for assimilation to provide energy and repair or create new ti ssue. The spleen in TCM theory is the organ responsible for digestive pr ocesses. A weakness of spleen- qi causes poor digestion, a bloated stomach, loose stool and a weakened constitution, manifested in weak pulse, pale tongue with whitish fur, softened voice and general lassitude. The body's digestive proc esses behave as if they were driven by a kind of internal vital energy (spleen- qi). Put in another way, to say that qi of the spleen is weak is another way of expressing the clinical cl aim that certain symptoms of digestive disorder can be alleviated by TCM interventions such as qi tonic herbs (or example, astragalus and ginseng root). The empirical basi s for such a claim must be clinical experience, and the acceptance of such a claim would be through clinical trials to show that these symptoms can be re lieved by herbs classified as spleen- qi tonics. In sum, the starting point is empirical observation: certain herbs are found to relieve a specific set of symptoms, and an explanation was found through defining these symptoms as those of a weakened spleen- qi and accordingly classifying these herbs as to nics for spleen- qi. 3.4 Phlegm ( tan): the ubiquitous pathogen Among the internal pathogens that disturb the human body, phlegm or tan () is arguably the most troublesome. Its importance in TCM theory and clinical work rivals that of qi, its antithesis and nemesis. 65 Phlegm is a difficult concept to expl ain and understand even within the framework of TCM theory, according to wh ich phlegm pervades most parts of the body and lies at the root of many internal disorders. Interestingly, what goes by the name of phlegm also played a key role in ancient Greco-Roman medicine: Galen listed it as one of the four humours alongside blood, choler and black bile, attributing one's temperament to the ba lance of these humours. He did not, however, give phlegm the wi de and powerful influence that it finds in TCM. In TCM theory, phlegm is generated in the internal organs as a result of the accumulation of dampness and fluids in the body. The ex planation of phlegm production draws on several aspects of TCM theory including the functions of organs (see next chapter). Various pathogenic factor s, including climatic and emotional factors, improper diet and exce ssive stress, can impair the internal organs and affect the activity of qi, leading to disturbances in the normal movements of body fluids, th e accumulation of these fluids, and the eventual production of phlegm.89 The spleen in TCM g overns transportation and transformation of water a nd dampness, the lung regu lates water passage, the kidney governs water, the liver promotes the metabolism of body fluid, and the trunk of the body serves as the main water passage in the body.90 A disorder of any of these organs may lead to retentio n of body fluids and accumulation of dampness, which turns into phlegm. Phlegm is in fact only one of a family of four pathogens that can transform from one form to another, namely, in in creasing order of vi scosity - dampness, water, rheum ( yin ) and phlegm. We deal here only with phlegm, the nastiest and most ubiquitous of the quartet, as a means of highlighting an ontological aspect of TC M pathogens. 89 See, for example, Wu Changguo (2002), 173 and Wu Dunxu, op cit , 133). 90 The trunk of the body in TCM is deemed a hollow organ (fu-organ), termed sanjiao or \"triple energizer\" 66 Phlegm that coagulates into solid form in the lung is observable as sputum. This process underlies the an cient saying, \"The spleen is the source of phlegm and the lung is the container of phlegm.\"91 Once it takes hold, phle gm (supposedly in fluid form) can spread and inhabit nearly all parts of the body, ca using a variety of troublesome conditions, including: 1. Hindrance of the flow of qi in the meridians and of blood throughout the body, l eading to numbness, limb inflexibility, subcutaneous nodules and abscesses. 2. Obstruction of the activity of qi in the internal organs. For example, in the lung, this causes coughs, chest tightness, and dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing); in the stom ach, it is associated with nausea and vomiting. 3. Confusion of the mind when it i nvades parts of the body from the chest upwards. This can be associated with dizziness, delirium, chest oppression or syncope. 4. An assortment of complex sy mptoms, depending on where phlegm accumulates ranging from num bness and arthralgia to vomiting, dizziness, palpitation and cerebral strokes. The physical nature of phlegm is descri bed in TCM literature as either 'with form' or 'without form'. The former is manifested in coagulated form as sputum in the lungs and respiratory track whilst the latter behaves like a fluid that permeates many parts of the body. 92 While phlegm in the form of sputum is easily definable and observable, its nature as a formless fluid is more obscure. The classic description in Chinese medical literature of formless phlegm is of a fluid that pervades many parts of a human body suffering from its ill effects, but a 91 Wu Changguo, op cit, 174 92 Wu Dunxu ( 2000 ) 67 modern TCM researcher would be hard put to isolate and collect formless phlegm from a vivisection of the orga ns that it is deemed to in habit. There are so many fluids to be found in these organs that it is doubtful th at any such researcher would be able to isolate phlegm from these fluids given that TCM theory does not define its chemical composition. It seems that the only defensible interpretation is that it be regarded merely as a 'fictional' pr oxy for the presence of certain classical symptoms of phlegm retention. Why did the ancients group all four of these appa rently disparate conditions (sets of symptoms) listed a bove under the category of i llnesses caused by phlegm? Would it not have been simpler to give a different name to each pathogen that caused a different set of symptoms? My conjec ture is that in the history of clinical experimentation with herbal remedies, it was discovered that certain herbs could be used to treat a variety of conditions. Because the four sets of symptoms listed above enjoyed the commonality of being tr eatable with certain herbs, and because one set of symptoms involves coughing out solid phlegm (sputum), they were grouped together as illnesse s caused by the presence of (solid or formless) phlegm, and the herbs classified as phlegm-resolving herbs. Th ese herbs became the main ingredients of herbal formulations to treat this group of conditions. Each formulation would be used to treat a di fferent condition, like a wet cough, or convulsions and dizziness, but the formulation would us e one or more phlegm- resolving herbs . In other words, the different pa thological conditions might have been grouped together because they appear ed to have something in common - they enjoyed relief from certain herbs or formulations containing these herbs. An example might help to el ucidate this point. The aged peels of Chin ese tangerines, have from ancient times been found to be effective in treating cough with white sputum. Banxia is a phlegm-resolving herb; jupi regulates qi to eliminate dampness 93; it also helps to 93 The term 'regulate' ( li ) has a specific meaning in TCM theory. It refers to promoting flow. Hence regulating qi is promoting its flow in the body. 68 prevent the formation of more phlegm tr ansformed from dampness. They are the main ingredients of the popular formul ation for cough with sputum called Erchen tang . This formulation also includes fuling (poria ), a diuretic that complements the dampness-eliminating gancao (liquorice), for harmonizing the ef fect of the other three herbs. By adding two herbs to the four already in Erchen tang , a different disorder could be treated, the so-called \"disharm ony between gall blad der and stomach\", a condition manifested in nervousness, dizzi ness, heart palpitations, vexatiousness, insomnia or restless sleep with troubl ing dreams and, in extreme instances, epileptic fits. The formulation Wendan tang comprises Erchen tang plus two herbs, the role of jupi in \"regulating \" (assisting in the flow of) qi and dispersing phlegm. Ingredients Functionality _______________________________________________________________________ Erchen tang Wendan tang banxia banxi resolves phlegm jupi jupi regulates qi and removes dampness fuling fuling removes dampness gancao gancao harmonizes the other herbs zhuru clears internal heat zhishi regulates qi and removes dampness The phlegm that is being combated with Wendan tang is not the coagulated phlegm in the lungs that causes cough, but the formle ss and unobservable phlegm in the organs and the head that causes quite different sy mptoms like vexatiousness, nervousness and dizziness. It is not the case that the latter symptoms are being 69 resolved by the other two ingredients zhuru and zhishi . Clinical experience indicates that these two herbs by themse lves are not able to achieve phlegm- resolving results, unlike banxia which can do so even actin g alone, although more effectively when combined wi th the other herbs. In ot her words, both illnesses can be treated by formulations that necessarily contain a phlegm-resolving herb, banxia in this example. Phlegm's explanatory burden covers a mu ltitude of sins. It is a proxy for those physiological factors th at bringing about clinical conditions classified by TCM as phlegm-related. Phlegm (except as sputum) is not directly observable because, from a biomedical standpoint, it do es not exist as a substance. I interpret it as an abstraction of a number of biomed ical substances in the body that work together to cause certain disorders in the body. The body suffering from the effects of phlegm behaves as if some substance ca lled phlegm was present inside. Are such abstractions either necessary or useful in TCM theory ? A social science analogy might be relevant here. Supposing there was disunity of staff in an organization, and the management sets out to rectify the situation by promoting cooperation and inculcating a common sense of purpose, thereby eliminating the entity of \"disunity\". At a different ti me and age, spiritual diviners might have attributed the bad humour of the staff to the invasion of the evil spirit of disunity. Acting as if this spirit existed, although not observ able by the common man (diviners might claim to see them), the management goes about boosting staff morale, providing financial incentives, and the like based on th e advice of the diviners who gain their insights through mediation wi th the bad spirit and also offer prayers to placate it and make it go away. The end result is that disunity is resolved. Steps are also taken to discourage or block its return. Had modern sociol ogical theory been applied instead, the remedy might have been very similar or the same (including the use of prayers, albeit to a different spirit). The ontologi cal status of the disunity spirit is of little relevance to th ose who merely wanted to know what to do to eliminate its influenc e on their organizations. 70 Phlegm is like a bad spirit that yields mischievous influe nces on the body identified by classical symptoms associated with its presence. These symptoms in effect define phlegm, and could be simply be called \"phlegm symptoms\" with the word \"phlegm\" in adjectival form to denote the particular family of symptoms that TCM theory associates with phlegm. TCM theory simplified the world to a limited number of pathogens; hence entities like phlegm carried the burden of blame for \"a hundred ailments\" and \"strange diseases\". Herbal remedies for phlegm-based disorders were found. A variety of leaves, roots and animal part s are available that clinical experience indicates are able to help in \"phlegm elimination\". They are combined with other herbs, drawing on the method of medical formulations th at consist of cocktails of herbs combined in such a way as to maxi mize the desired overall therapeutic effect. In such a cocktail one or mo re herbs play the principal (\" monarch\") role of directly addressing the medical condition. In the case of phlegm-related conditions, banxia is a commonly-used principal herb, as is the case with the two formulations Erchen Tang and Wendan Tang analysed above. 3.5 Wind : an ill that blows no good Exogenous wind, originating from the ex ternal environment, is thought to penetrate the skin and have the ability to move to vari ous parts of the body and a tendency to go to the head and face, with manifestations of h eadache, running nose, sweating and aversion to cold. It has hi gh mobility (as is the case with rubella which is marked by quick fluctuations in cutaneous pruritus or skin itch) and has no fixed location; hence the Chinese term fengzhen or \"wind rash\" for rubella. Because of its propensity for move ment and change, other external pathogens like dampness, cold, heat and dryness are regarded as tending to attach themselves to wind. For example, wind combined with dampness cause rheumatic 71 conditions ( fengshi ); wind and cold bring about the wind-cold syndrome (fenghan ) associated with colds and flu infections. Endogenous wind in TCM theory is created internally in the body, principally in the liver. Standard expl anations of how endogenous wind is produced draw on the concepts of yin and yang . When used he re to explain the production of wind in the liver, yin and yang are attributes describing contrasting states of the liver. Yin is a physical state characteri zed by moistness, coolness and quietness; yang by dryness, heat and activity; in a healthy liver, yin and yang are in balance. TCM theory deem s endogenous wind to be pr oduced under one or more of four conditions: (a) Extreme heat that scorches the yin of the liver and can lead to convulsions; (b) The yang of the liver is transformed in to wind, disturbing the upper orifices and causing dizz iness and convulsions; (c) The presence of yin deficiency causes yang to ascend, stirring up wind in the process and causing inadequate nour ishment for the tend ons and ligaments, leading to convulsions; (d) Blood deficiency result s in lack of nourishment for the liver and tendons, stirring up wind that is manifested as muscular peri stalsis and tremors. In the case of (a), when the yin of the liver is damaged by heat, balance is upset, yang gains ascendancy, becomes hyperac tive and brings about convulsions. In the case of (b) and (c), yin and yang behave like substances in the liver. When the yang of the liver is in excess, it can be converted into wind; when there is deficiency in yin, yang becomes relatively stronger an d ascends, stirring up wind in the process. Chinese medical theory has not always drawn a firm distinction between exogenous and endogenous wind. Before the Jin-Yuan dynasties, ex ogenous wind was regarded as a cause of zhongfeng or cerebral strokes. Later texts 72 attributed the condition to internal pr ocesses that are now described as by TCM theory as endogenous wind.94 There does not appear to be any particul ar relation between exogenous and endo genous wind. Symptoms of conditions associated with wind of either kind ha ve some similarities such as the tendency to move its locus (from skin to meridians, from live r to head and orifices, etc), but the similarity ends there. Yet exogenous an d endogenous winds are treated as though they were the same entity manifesting itsel f in different situa tions and locations. There is no basis for treating them as manifestations of the same underlying biochemical entity, and the explanation for TCM theory's use of the term to describe quite different ph ysiological phenomena must be sought elsewhere. A biomedical interpretation of wind would in deed be an interesting area for clinical research. Unlike phlegm, which is understood by TCM theory to be a substance that can at least sometimes be manifested extern ally - as solid sput um in the lungs, the ontological status of wind is even more ambiguous. Ex ternal atmospheric wind is considered to have penetrated the body's surface to bring ab out symptoms like a running nose and aching joints, whilst endo genous wind is thou ght to move from liver to head to cause dizziness and c onvulsions. But a mo dern TCM physician would be under no illusion that there ar e breezes blowing in aching joints and ligaments or, in the case of endogenous wind, gaseous movement in the head. Like phlegm, wind is a gh ost entity that is used to conveniently explain physiological symptoms in the body ma rked by movement and changeability. As was the case for phlegm described ear lier, there are herbs that have been found to relieve conditions with symptoms of wind , be it endogenous or exogenous wind. This may hist orically have lent strength to the idea that a basic entity wind is the common factor behind these conditions. For example, the herb fangfeng (radix saposhnikoviae ) literally means \"resistin g used to relieve \"exogenous wind sy mptoms\" like headaches and arthritic pains of wind- dampness. But is has also been used to treat ailments like infantile convulsions 94 Wang (2001), 455 73 attributed to endogenous wind. Since exogenous wind is readily observable, fangfeng is likely to have been discovered firs t for treating symptoms thought to be caused by exogenous wi nd. Later when it was also fo und to relieve symptoms like a form of arthritis in which pains are no t fixed in one part of the body but move from one place to another, mimicking the movements of wind, the arthritis would have been attributed to en dogenous wind. Rece nt clinical research has indicated that fangfeng contains anti-spasmodic ingredients that could play a calming role in conditions like headache, intestinal irri tability and convulsio ns, all of which are often accompanied by muscul ar spasms. Thus wind in TCM could well be a proxy for a family of conditions in which muscular spasms are present. Another common herb used to treat wind is Tianma (rhizoma gastrodiae ) of the orchid family. Tianma however is used for treating only endogenous wind, to \"arrest convulsi ons, calm the liver and suppress (an exuberant) yang \". 95 Combined with other herbs, it is used to treat conditions varying from convulsions and dizziness to tension headaches and hypertension. For example, the decoction Tianma Gouteng Yin , commonly used for certain types of hypertensive cond ition, comprises 10 herbs, with gouteng (ramulus uncariae cum uncis ) used commonly to treat \"endogenous wind\", play ing the monarch roles in the fo rmulation. This decoction also scutellariae ) which have the functions of clearing excess heat in the liver meridian. With endogenous wind as the primary un derlying condition, this decoction is commonly used for hypertension with accompanying symptoms of headache, insomnia and a reddened to ngue with yellowish fur. These symptoms, by TCM diagnostic methods (see chapter 5), are cons istent with the presence of endogenous wind with internal heat. 95 Tang (2003), 277 74 Summary of qi, phlegm and wind We note that all three concepts of TCM - qi, phlegm and wind - represent abstractions of physiological phenomena in human bodies, albeit abstractions of different orders. The principal comparisons are summarized below: Qi Phlegm Wind Form Formless sometimes liquid/solid as in Formless sputum, but possibly formless in the stomach and organs Substance When stored in organs Sputum is a substance, but other Never a substance forms of phlegm are ambiguous Energy At times as vital energy Never in energy form Appears to have energy to move like qi Flow Must flow to function Obstructs qi when stagnant Flows to cause harm It would appear that the concepts of qi, phlegm and wind were invented and modified over time with Chinese medical theory to take on the roles needed to explain the functioning of the body and the illnesses caused by deviations from the body's healthy balanced state and its rest oration by particular kinds of herbal agents Qi evolved to be a catch-all concept fo r all normal functioning of the body that involves change and mo vement. To account for the body's ability to produce qi continuously, the idea of storage in su bstance form in the organs was also necessary; hence qi is also portrayed in some contexts as a substance. The concept of phlegm was associated with symptoms that were persistent (sticky like sputum) and a tend ency to cause obstructions (of qi, blood and body fluids); certain herbs seemed to be able to alleviate these symptoms and were classified as phlegm-resolving herbs. As many illnesses are persistent and were understood to be the result of obstructions (for example obstruction of qi flow in the spleen and stomach, causing dyspepsia) , phlegm came to be associated with many illnesses, ergo the conclusion that phlegm causes a hundre d ailments. 75 Wind, on the other hand, is the pathogen that causes harm by movement. Hence illnesses with sudden onset, with dizziness and convulsions, tend to be attributed to wind. From a biomedical st andpoint, there is no reason to believe that any of these pathogens exists in a specific form that could be isolated and its properties properly recorded (other than sputum as a coagulated form of phlegm). In this narrow sense, they are all convenient fictions of scientific anti-r ealism. Yet each is consistently associated with clearly de fined symptoms that in principle have biomedical correlates. In fact, one of th e interesting areas of research in Chinese medical universities today is the search for biomedical markers that define a specific TCM condition, like the pres ence of phlegm, a deficiency of qi or the movement of wind. 3.6 Conclusion My interpretation of the ontological status of TCM entities has some similarity to that of the noted writer of Chinese medical apologetics Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard Medical School. Kaptchuk's classic The Web that has no Weaver: Understanding Chinese Medicine insightfully points out that the tendency of Chinese thought is to \"seek out dynamic functional activity rather than to look for the fixed somatic structures that perform the activities.\"96 I would add that Chinese thought is less concerned with ont ology than with functionality. Whether there is an underlying real entity called qi with many physiological manifestations, or qi is merely a convenient theoretical construct fo r interpreting physiological phenomena, does not matter to the practitione r of TCM, even if it is interesting to the philosopher. The important medical quest ion is whether, once thus interpreted, predictions can be made and clinically tested. Kaptchuk also likens Chinese medical theory to poetry, not to be understood literally: 96 Kaptchuk (2000), 76 76 In the West, since the scientific revolution, a theory must rest on a provable physical substratum of repeatable events and measurable facts. Each fact holds up the next level. William Ha rvey helped usher in this scientific revolution when...he overthrew the classic Greek notion of blood movement...The entire Greek medical edifice crumbled...Hard and substantial facts were to be the basis of the new knowledge. Qualities had to be reduced to quantities...speculation to experimentation. The Chinese theories, however, resemble those of Greek antiquity. This type of fact is speculative interpretation. For the Chinese, it is a sensory image, a poetic exploration of what is going on. The value of the Chinese theories is in aiding the organization of observation, discerning patterns, capturing interconnect edness and qualities of being. Can one prove a poetic image? It can be shared. It can be used. 97 I agree that TCM entities ar e interpretations, but am not sure that they are speculative or poetic, although admittedly from a pedagogical point of view this may be a good way for a new reader to be initiated into TC M entities without having to struggle with the conflict betwee n the literal descriptions of these entities and the reader's understanding of modern anatomy and physiology. I shall argue in Chapter 5 that TCM theory , as crude and as largely unproven by the standards of contemporary evidence-based medicine as it may be, is structured as heuristic empirical scientific models that are in principle testable. TCM entities are theoretical constructs that enable the formulation of TCM theoretical models. TCM entities represent a different way of organizing them for use in heuristic models. A similar view may be taken of anatomical systems in the body comprising vital organs and the meridians. The entities in the TCM picture of the human body portrayed in medical texts are abstractions of anat omical and physiological realit ies. They look like the convenient fictions of the scientific inst rumentalist, but are better understood as constructs of reality to employ in empi rical models. Although terms like blood and phlegm are used to deno te entities that resemble their referents in modern medicine, in fact they are part of an attempt to incorporate all the essential 97 Kaptchuk (2000), 97-98 77 functions of the body within a simple framework built on a small number of entities. By ascribing diverse functions to these basic entiti es, TCM is able to employ them in relatively simple models for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. The relevant question is whether this system of healing works well enough to be useful, and for what kind of ailments. 78 4. Organ and Meridian Systems This chapter critically examines what TCM identifies as two of the core systems in the body - the vital orga ns and the network of meridians ( jingluo ) covering the whole body. The intention is not to give a comp rehensive account of the TCM theory of these systems but rath er to propose a way to interpret that theory in the light of modern knowledge of anatomy and physiology. The description here of the TCM theory of or gan and meridian systems is necessarily sketchy, with more depth and detail provided for certain organs only for purposes of illustration of the kind of arguments adduced with regard to their ontological status and their biom edical correlates. The term \"meridian\" is used here ra ther than \"channels and collaterals\" only because it is shorter and more conven ient. Translators who prefer \"channels and collaterals\" to \"meridians\" object to the latter because it could mislead the reader into thinking that they have fi xed regular paths like the great circles covering the globe. In the light of the diversity of ways of translating TCM terms that I discussed in Chapter 2, this object ion may not carry much practical relevance. As mentioned in various places in earlier chapters, organs in TCM are different from organs with th e same names in modern anatomy. In the interest of clarity, one could either put quotation marks around the TCM organ name (eg. 'spleen') or italicize it ( spleen ) to indicate that it is a TCM organ. However, as nearly all the references will be to TCM organs, it would be less tedious to leave them without italics or quotation marks; but when I refer to the organ in the modern anatomy of Western medicine, I shall flag that to the reader with an appropriate qualification. The organs are divided into two categories, the five zangorgans (for example the liver) that store qi and other entities, and the six fuorgans (for example the small intestine) that are hollow and process food and body fluids as 79 these pass through them. The ontological st atus of organs has some ambiguity in TCM literature. At the time that the Neijing was written, little was understood about human anatomy as we now know it. Because of the prohibition of dissections of the human body in China, physicians tended to focus their attention on the external manifestations of organs through their pres umed physiological functions. The result was that functions we re ascribed to a number of key organs in such a way that they fitted an ov erarching model of hum an physiology and pathology (which would incl ude the Five-Elements Model, to be described in the next chapter.) For example, the kidney in TCM theory is involved not only in excretion but also in such diverse functi ons as growth, ageing, warming the body, sex drive and reproduction. Typically, TCM textbooks would refer to organs sometimes as somatic structures and at other times as \"functi onal units\". One te xtbook begins by as somatic structures: \"the five zang -organs and the six fu- organs are different from each other in functions and characteristics,\" but later clarifies that the concept of zang -fu organs in TCM is \"quite beyond the range of anatomical morphology\" as the functions of the zang -fu organs not only include part of the functions of organs with the same names in modern medicine but also cover certain functions of othe r related organs: \"Obviously the zang -fu organs in TCM are not concepti ons of anatomy but synt hetic functional units.\" 98 By \"synthetic functional units\" the author seems to be trying to say that TCM models of human physiology have ascrib ed functions to these organs that are at variance with modern knowledge of th ese organs. Such ambiguous treatments of organs is symptomati c of the tension between old concepts based on the Neijing of organs as somatic struct ures with multiple physiolo gical functions and modern anatomy and physiology whic h have established quite di fferent sets of functions for the organs bearing the same names. I first describe the organs and meridians as they are presented in standard TCM texts used to train TCM physicians, then 98 Wu (2002), 42 and 44 80 follow these descriptions with interpre tations of their meanings in modern biomedical terms and of their epistemic credentials. 4.1 TCM Organs In accordance with the Chinese medica l classification, the body's organs are divided into five solid storage organs known as zang and six hollow organs known as fu paired up as follows: Zang Fu liver ( gan) gall bladder ( dan) heart ( xin) small intestine ( xiaochan g ) spleen ( pi) stomach ( wei) lung ( fei) large intestine dachang kidney (shen) bladder ( pangguang ) (A sixth fu organ called sanjiao or the \"triple energizer\" is essentially the trunk of the body fr om thorax to abdomen.99 It does not pair with any of the zang organs, but for symmetry TCM theory brought in the xinbao or the pericardium as a quasi-organ in the zang category. The pericardium is conceived of as a tissue surrounding the heart to pr otect it from pathogen ic factors. In modern anatomy, the pericardium is the ou ter membrane that encloses the heart to which the major blood vessels emerging from the heart are attached. The significance of the pericardium in TCM will become apparent when we discuss below the 12 meridians, as each meridian is deemed connected to one of these vital organs. The zang and fu organs are paired in the sens e that they act in concert and support one another. For example, the spleen ( pi) and stomach ( wei) are both 99 It is called the \"triple\" energizer because it is divided into three parts, the upper, middle and lower sanjiao , forming a continuous conduit for the flow of qi and energy. 81 involved in digestion, and are usually jointly referred to by the compound noun piwei . Likewise, the kidney and bladde r act together in excretion, one processing and the other storing urine be fore it is passed out from the body. The functions of the zang -organs are described below together with a brief mention, where appropriate, of the role of the matching fu-organ. Two zang - organs, the spleen and the kidney, are examin ed in greater detail to illustrate how I propose to interpret organs and thei r functions within TCM theory. 4.1.1 The spleen ( pi) The spleen in TCM theory is totally un like the spleen in modern anatomy. It is described as being \"located in the abdomen\" and to \"govern transportation blood\" ( tongxue ).100 It is the source of qi, blood and body fluid and thereb y \"the foundation of life after birth\" ( houtian zhi ben ). In this respect, its role contrasts with and is complementary to that of the kidney, which stores qi and jing ('essence') inherited from parents and is theref ore regarded as \"the pre- natal foundation of life\" (xiantian zhi ben ). (Jing will be described further below.) The stomach works in concert with the sp leen in digestion. The function of the stomach in TCM is \"to rece ive and digest food; the chyme101 transformed in the stomach is then transmit ted to the small intestine\".102 This is quite similar to the stomach in modern anatomy whose func tion is to continue the process of digestion that begins in the mouth; its digestive juices and churning action reduces the food to a semi-liquid partly digested mass that passes on to the duodenum. 103 The TCM description of the spleen's function as governing transportation and transformation calls for further explanat ion. We first consider the meaning of 100 Wu (2002), 62-63 101 'Chyme' is the \"semi-fluid mass of partly digested food expelled from the stomach into the duodenum\" (Webster Collegiate Dictionary ). 102 Wu (2002), 75 103 Oxford (2007), 682 82 'transportation and transfor mation'; the significance of \"govern\" in Chinese medicine will be separately discussed further below in section 4.2.. 'Transportation and Transformation' In essence, this means transforming fo od and water into nu trients that are then transported to the organs and mu scles of the body. The standard TCM textbook description of ho w this takes place appears somewhat complicated and ambiguous. One text begins by saying that \"the spleen can digest food, absorb nutrients of food and water, and then transport them to the heart and the lung,\" but goes on to say that \"food is digested and absorbed by the stomach and small intestine but it must depend on the trans porting and transforming function of the spleen to transform into nutrients which, relying on the functions of the spleen to transmit and disperse essence, are distributed to the four limbs and other parts of the body\".104 The tendency for TCM texts to incorporate modern knowledge of physiology into TCM theory can lead to inconsistencies, for example saying that \"food is digested by the stomach and small intestine\" while maintaining the Chinese classical description that th e spleen governs transformation and transportation of food, nutrients and water. The problem may be that the classical portrayal of the role of the spleen in digestion is spelt out in terms that border on the metaphy sical: \"the spleen governs (zhu) transportation and transformation\", as if it were some kind of sovereign entity that orchestrated and regulated th e digestive work done by the stomach, small intestine and other organs of the body. The mechanism by which the spleen governs is laid out in detail by classical texts as well as modern texts and revolves around qi. The transformative and transporting function is divided into two parts: transporting and transforming food nutrie nts, and transporting and transforming water. Food that is absorbed though th e stomach and small in testine must depend on the spleen- qi to transform it into an intermed iate substance called \"nutrient 104 Wu (2002), 62 83 essence\" ( jingwei ) which is dispersed to the four limbs and other parts of the body. The rest of the water absorbed from the food nutrients is transported by the propelling function of spleen -qi to the lung and kidney wher e it is transformed into sweat and urine to be excreted out of the body. If spleen -qi is sufficient for its transporting and transforming functions, the organs receive enough nutrients and exhibit vitality; when spleen -qi does not perform its func tions adequately, the body is in an unhealthy state and symptoms of abdominal distension and pain and loose stool may appear; dampness and phle gm retention can occur, with the accompanying symptoms of dizziness and lassitude. In addition to governing transportation and transformation , the TCM spleen also \"commands blood\" by confining it to the blood vessels and preventing it from flowing to outside tissues. Th is aspect of the spleen is at variance with modern physiology for which the spl een is a major component of the recticuloendothelial system, producing lymphocytes in the ne wborn and containing phagocytes that remove worn-out red blood cells and other fo reign bodies from the bloodstream. It also acts a reservoir for blood.105 In ordinary language , the spleen helps clean blood and stores it, somewhat different from being the governor of digestion and the commander of blood. 4.1.2 Interpreting the functions a nd ontological status of the TCM spleen The legendary physician Li Dongyuan of the Song dynasty paid great attention to the spleen in health cultivation and therapy, and based much of his medical skills on the management of spleen functions. His classic Treatise on the Spleen and Stomach has been a reference manual for generations of Chinese physicians even up to the present day. This manual focuses on the spleen's transformative and transporting functions by which it replenishes primordial qi (yuan-qi ) in the kidney, thus making the spleen the fountain of post-natal health. If 105 Oxford (2007), 673 84 the functions of the spleen are compromi sed through illness, excessive emotion and/or poor living habits , the body undergoes progressi ve deteriorat ion as each organ begins to fail from lack of nourishment. What is the biomedical equivalent of the spleen? As pointed out earlier, and also alluded to in the literatu re on Chinese medical anthropology,106 ancient Chinese thought often not only fails to distinguish clearly between somatic structures and functions but also blur s the distinction between substance and energy (as in conceptions of qi), between entities and processes (for example, the five elements are also known as the fi ve phases) and between attributes and substances (yin and yang are attributes as well formless substances). Viewed in this light, the spleen in TC M is a set of functions closely related to the biomedical concepts of digestion and absorption of food and water and the distribution of nutrients and liquids to th e organs and tissues of the body. By picking a somatic structure to incorpor ate these functions, TCM theory has clustered them in such a manner as to be useful in TCM models for explaining observable physiological phenomena an d for the diagnosis of illness and specification of therapeutic prescriptions. From the point of the evolution of Chinese medical thought, it is likely that the ancients thought, incorrectly as we now know, that the somatic spleen had all these functions, as even a casual reading of Neijing would lead one to conclude. As knowledge of anatomy and physiolo gy advanced, particularly in the post-1949 Chinese revolution when Chairm an Mao ordered the modernization of Chinese medicine by drawing on the kn owledge of Western medicine, it would have become apparent that the functions associated by ancient Chinese medicine with the various organs were inaccurate if not grossly wrong. A shift to the idea of the organ as a representation of a set of functions would have been the only choice, short of giving up most of TCM theory, given that so much of the theory of diagnosis and therapy had already been built upon these functions. 106 See for example Farquhar(1994), Kleinman (1995) and Julien (1995). 85 Pragmatically, it does not matter for th e practice of Chinese medicine that these functions are clustered together under the same names as the somatic structures of modern anatomy, or even th at we imagine these st ructures really had these functions. The key to understanding the cluster of functions ascribed to a particular organ is that, as a theoretical construct, it must fit into models of health, diagnosis and therapy in Chin ese medicine. The TCM orga n is thus the result of organizing functional activities and cla ssifying them in such a way as to be consistent with and usable in TCM models. In the case of the spleen and stomach, between them these organs have to ca pture the processes of digesting and absorbing food and distributing nutrie nts to the rest of the body. In addition, herbal tonics for a weak ened spleen (manifested by digestive problems) were found to be useful for tr eating conditions such as hematuria (blood in the urine), hematochezia (blood in the stool), uterine bleeding and subcutaneous pupura, thought to be attributable to reduce d ability for blood to be confined to the blood vessels. The role of the spleen in \"commanding blood\" would be consistent with these empirical observations. Thus the spleen is, in effect, not an organ with functions, but the functions themselves. This may be the best way to interpret the awkward term \"synthetic functional units\" that we came across earlier in the TCM textbook explanation of organs. In sum, the spleen is a theoreti cal construct that captures various aspects of digestion and distribution of nutr ients and water described in modern physiology. As the functional activ ities of the spleen are driven by spleen -qi, the use of herbs and acupuncture techni ques in promoting health and in treating illness naturally make reference to thei r beneficial effects on spleen -qi (as well as the related stomach- qi). The action of herbs and acupuncture in relation to the spleen can broadly be divided into (a) being a tonic to strengthen spleen- qi, commonly abbreviated to \" tonifying spleen- qi\" 107; (b) assisting in the flow of qi (regulating 107 The word 'tonify', uncommon in English usage, is used extensively in the translated TCM literature to denote 'using a tonic for'. I have followed this practice throughout the dissertation. 86 qi). The main difference between (a) and (b) is that one is concerned with the stock of stored qi and the other with its smooth and unimpeded flow. To use an automotive analogy, tonifying qi fills up the tank whilst regulating qi clears blockages in the fuel line and carburetor. A deficiency in spleen- qi can compromise the spleen's function in absorbing and transforming food, leading to inadequate supply of nutrients to the rest the body and manifested in lassitude, bloated abdome n and loose stool. When there is poor regulation of qi, water retention tends to develop, leading to symptoms associated with internal dampness and phlegm . One way to interpret these disorders of the abdomen is that weakened spleen- qi or impediments to its flow are responsible for poor digestion, abdominal discomfort and many of the symptoms associated with the irritable bowel syndrome. TC M theory has taken such a pattern of abdominal disorder and at tributed it to the malfunction of spleen- qi. As we shall see in the next chapter, this is expressed in TCM models as patterns of illness (syndromes) bein g differentiated and ascribed to a malfunctioning spleen- qi mechanism. The ontologi cal status and physical properties of spleen- qi is not an issue in TCM theory , but therapeutic models based on these interpretations of the spleen are relevant and should be testable if they are to be regarded as scientific. As with the earlier interpretations of the nature of TC M entities, spleen- qi is in effect defined by certain patterns of symp toms when it is defici ent or its flow is impeded, just as the spleen itself is define d by the functions it is presumed to have. Any biomedical investigation to isolate spleen- qi and determine its physical properties, in the way one might isolate a body secretion and examine its cellular and chemical composition, is inappropriate. Likewise, a biomed ical interpretation of the spleen as being the combination of a number of organs like the stomach, small intestine and the pancreas, all of which are known in modern physiology to 87 be involved in digestion, is also inappropriate as it would stem from the erroneous notion of spleen as a somatic structure or a combination of several such structures. Different categories of herbs and ac upuncture procedures are used for tonifying and regulating (p romoting the flow of) qi. Qi tonics are among the most common in Chinese pharmacopeia. Among the general qi tonics are ginseng and astragalus, whilst tonics sp ecifically peel), and xiangfu (rhizome cyperi are often prescribed. Which came first in TCM theory: the spleen as an organ with specific functions or the observation th at certain herbs have the ab ility to resolve symptoms of illness like poor appeti te, lassitude, abdominal disten tion and loose stool that the theory associates with a dysfunctional spleen? The Neijing, with detailed and extensive passages on functions of the spleen and other organs, preceded Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Febrile Diseases, the first medical manu al to list a wide array of important herbal prescription s that today form the foundation for formulations used by Chinese physicians. This might suggest that the functions of the spleen were established first and the herbs for treating the spleen identified later. More likely, however, they evolved together. The Neijing was written and rewritten by more than one person during the 400-year history of the Han dynasty. A lot of clinical practice would have prece ded any written codification and clinical observation of the outcomes of different herbal treatments must have helped shape the theory. It is evident from case studies of physicians and ancient texts that TCM theory evolved gradually over time through clinical experience and experimentation with herbs and formul ations. There were no dramatic breakthroughs li ke the Koch's culture of the tubercle bacillus , Pasteur's development of vaccines, Fleming's discovery of penicillin, or Watson and Crick's double helix model of DNA structure. Ar guably the only con ceptual breakthrough 88 happened two thousand years ago when Chinese medical thought abandoned the idea of spirits and numinous agents as the cause of illnesses and the casting out of spirits as the cure for them. The Neijing laid down the empirical basis for Chinese medical science by tracing causal fact ors of illness to the outside natural environment and the body's host environm ent, especially the prevalence of harmful emotions, and developed models that led to diagnostic techniques and therapeutic methods using herbs and/or acupuncture. TCM uses the same approach to understanding and interpreting the functions of the kidney and the other organs. 4.1.3 The kidney (shen ) Besides excreti on, the kidney ( shen) in TCM plays the central role in growth and reproduction; it is also regarded as the source of stored qi, jing, body warmth, marrow and brain matter , and to hold the ability to resist illness. So wide and varied are the functions of the kidne y that many pathological conditions are attributable to a disorder of some aspect of kidney functions. In effect, the kidney is the seat of youth and vita lity. This explains why so much of the TCM approach to preserving good health in middle and old age has to with protecting and boosting the functions of the kidney. The main physiological functions of th e kidney to be fo und in TCM texts are stated briefly below, followed by an explanation of their intended meanings within TCM theory and, finally, an interpre tation of the theory. The functions are: 1. Governing of growth and development; 2. Governing of reproduction; 3. Governing of water; 4. Governing the reception of qi; 5. Production of marrow to enrich the brain and transform blood; 89 6. Nourishment and warm ing of the viscera.108 In explaining how the kidney carries out these functions, TCM theory makes extensive use of th e concept of essence or jing, thought to be stored in the kidney. Yet, the nature of jing is hard to define or unde rstand. It is usually given only brief mention in introductory TCM texts although it is dealt with at length in the Neijing . Jing in TCM is the key substance involved in development. One inherits a fixed amount of it from parents and carri es it through life. This is termed pre-natal jing. Post-natal jing, on the other hand, is produced from the synthesis of food and environmental forces, and the cultivation of emotional wellbeing and the intellect. An interesting Western interpretation of jing captures well this idea in almost poetic terms: \"Essence is the quality or texture that imbues an organism with the possibility of development, from conception to death. Essence is also responsible for the development of the d eepest awareness and wisdom.\"109 I shall take the more secular view that jing represents ancient Chinese thought's struggle with the notion of a person's gene tic make-up (nature) and the effect of post-natal influences (nurture) on his physical and mental development. Interestingly, post-natal jing in Chinese medicine has a corollary meaning: semen, usually treated as an external visible manifest ation (materialization) of kidney jing, just as sticky phlegm coughed out from the lungs is a visible materialization of phl egm. As semen, jing is greatly emphasized in Taoist manuals of health that advo cate its conservation (in sexual intercours e through withholding ejaculation) to enhance vitality and longevity. The kidney also stores qi, yin and yang ; these substances are also thought to be involved in growth and development. If the kidney ha s a deficiency of qi, or an excess/deficiency of yin or yang , development may be affected. 108 Wu (2002), 65-70 109 Kaptchuk (2000), 57 90 The reproductive function of the ki dney is related to growth and development. Jing, qi, yin and yang of the kidney are in volved in growth, the onset of puberty, menstr uation, and maintaining differences between the physiology of men and women. The kidney governs water in the sense of controlling the amount of liquid in the body by participating in its transportation within the body and in excretion through the bladder. \"Water \" is used in the sense of pure water; if it contains waste substances it is 'turbid'. TCM descri bes the filtering action of the kidney as \"qi-transformation\" by which it separates out the \"lucid\" part of the water and \"elevates\" it to the heart and lungs, while the rest is transformed into urine and transported to the bladder. The kidney's function in the \"reception of qi\" (naqi ) refers to its receiving (processing) fresh qi from the air inhaled by th e lung and storing it. It also participates in respiration in the sens e that it acts in conc ert with the lungs to ensure that respiration resu lts in the various organ and tissues receiving enough air (qi) for them to carry out their work. TCM classics as well as modern texts use the term \" gushe\" (fixate) for the role of kidney- qi in receiving qi from the lung, and guiding its transport to th e kidney and bringing about respiration. The lung is thus said to 'govern respira tion' but it can do so properly only with the cooperation of the kidney. If kidney- qi is weak in the body, diso rders like shortness of breath and asthma are thought to be possible outcomes. Kidney essence ( jing) produces marrow ( sui ) which, in TCM, has a wider meaning than it has in modern physiology. It includes bone marrow, the spinal cord and 'cerebral ma rrow' in the brain. Marrow nourishes the bones, while the spinal cord together with brain ma rrow nourishes the brain. The brain is recognized in TCM as an or gan that governs the five zang -organs, mental activities and the motion of th e limbs. If there is deficiency of kidney essence, cerebral marrow production is impaired and pa thological changes such as headache, dizziness, amnesia and retarded respon se to external stimuli may result. 91 Kidney essence is also th ought to be transformable into blood and therefore constitutes a source of blood in addition to that derived from the digestion and transformation of nutrients by the spleen . Blood can also be transformed into (post-natal) kidney essence. Finally, the kidney in TCM nourish es and warms the viscera (ie the zang and fu organs). Kidney-yin, also known as primordial yin (yuan yin ), nourishes the yin of all the viscera and also supplies them with yin fluid. The concepts of viscera yin and yin-fluid are peculiar to TCM, capturing the idea that organs need to nourished and bathed in fl uids to keep them functioning strongly. Kidney-yang, also kn own as primordial yang (yuan yang ), warms the viscera. Yin and yang in the kidney have to be in balan ce for the body to be in good health. Deficiency in one leads to a corresponding deficiency in the other zang -organs. For example, a deficiency in kidney-yin le ads to deficiency of liver-yin, heart-yin and lung-yin, and a deficiency in kidney-y ang brings about deficiency of spleen- yang and heart-yang. On th e other hand, deficiencies of yin and yang in other viscera can also deplete the kidney of its own stock of yin and yang and, if sustained and prolonged, l eads to the \"exhaustion of the kidney\" and the eventual impairment of all five zang -organs.110 It can seen from the above that the kidney in the TCM theory of health cultivation plays a central role in the pr omotion and maintenance of vitality and hence in fostering longevity. One can th us understand why Chinese tonics have largely revolved around the kidney for growth, sexual activity, reproduction, resistance to cold weather, and delay of the ageing process. Together with the spleen, it forms the foundations of life, hence the aphorism that the kidney and spleen are respectively the pre-natal and post-natal fou ndations of life. 4.1.4 Interpreting the kidney in TCM 110 Wu2002,70-71 92 As in the case of the spl een, the kidney as an \"org an\" in TCM is really a cluster of functions, indeed a verita ble hodge-podge of apparently unrelated functions. Why the ancients thought it fit to make the kidney the repository of so many functions is an interesting question for the Chinese medi cal anthropologist. It may have something to do with the kidney of Western anatomy, situated towards the back of the body around the waist area, being the site of soreness following vigorous sexual activity, an d with a chronic aching back being a leading indicator of physical decline that comes with ageing, ergo the sexual, reproductive, and growth functions of the kidne y. Alternatively, as I observed in the discussion of the concepts of wind and ph legm in the last chapter, the clustering of processes sometimes has to do with the herbal medicat ions that have been found to work on a family of apparently unrel ated conditions; the conclusi on is thereby drawn that the conditions arose from the same origin . Kidney-yang tonics like cordyceps, ) are recorded in the Chinese pharmacopeia as sex tonics, but are also used for the prevention of premature graying as well as the tr eatment of children who are slow in growth and development. This clustering of uses, which might appear to have no theoretical basis from the standpoint of biomedicine, could have arisen in TCM simply from clinical practice in which the same medica tions appeared to be effective for these different uses, hence the f unctions that were being treated with the medications were grouped together under the kidney. What biomedical science now terms the genetic characteristics of an individual were in effect he ld by Chinese theory to be carried in pre-natal essence (jing). The storage of jing in the kidney and its role in growth and reproduction would appear then to quite naturally fall into place. The connection between the kidney and the br ain is a little harder to explain. One conjecture would be that Chinese me dicine observed that the neurological aspects of motion, thinking and sensory per ception are controlled by the brain, and 93 these functions decline with age. As the TCM kidney is supposed to govern ageing as a phase of growth and developm ent, it would make se nse to cluster brain functions with ki dney functions. Finallywe note that the urinary function of the kidney in TCM seems to have little to do with the other kidney functions in the clus ter. Why then did Chinese medicine put them together? My conjecture is that the Chinese discovered the sexual functions of the adre nal glands covering the superior surface of the kidneys. To the unobservant eye of those in China involved in illegal dissections, the gland could ha ve been regarded as part of the kidney. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived embryologi cally from the mesoderm (the middle germ layer of the early embryo) and is stimulated by the pituitary gland (which regulates post-natal growth) to produce various hormones, among which are those secreted by the sex glands, ma inly estrogen and androgen. An association between the kidney and sex and reproduction woul d therefore be quite natural. A less sophisticated explanation would be that urine is discharged through the same orifices involved in sex and reproduction. For the sake of completeness, I shall deal with the other three zang -organs albeit somewhat cursorily as the descri ptions of the TCM un derstanding of the spleen and kidney are already sufficientl y rich for the purpose of illustrating how TCM organs differ so radically from orga ns in modern anat omy and adequately provide a basis for a biomedical interpreta tion of TCM organs. I have made only passing mention of the fu-organs as these tend to be closely associated with their corresponding zang -organs and discussion of the fu-organs and interpreting their functions would not add to the basic approach of understanding the ontological status of organs in TCM. 4.1.5 The Liver ( gan) The principal activity of the liver in TCM is to \"dredge and regulate\" ( ), which is the idea of clearing an d smoothing the routes along which qi flows, 94 as well as regulating the flow and activity of qi. It is a concept peculiar to TCM. In Chinese therapy for prob lems in liver function, shugan is used, meaning \"dredging and regulating the liver\". \"Soothing the live r\" is the more common alternative translation for shugan. By regulating the activity of qi, the liver also regulate s the activities of all other vital organs and tissues. Among the im plications of this principal function of the liver is that it promotes circulation of blood and metabolism in the body, and also assists the spleen and stomach in digestion. As with the liver in Western medical anatomy, the liver also stores blood. 4.1.6 The Heart ( xin) The heart in TCM has two main function s: to \"govern bloo d\" and to control the mind. The first function is similar to the heart function in Western medical physiology in the sense that it propels blo od to circulate in the vessels; but it also has the implication that the heart is invo lved in the producti on of blood. The second function implies that the heart stores an entity called \"spirit\" ( shen ), which has the function of cogn ition and consciousness. In this sense, the functions of the heart in TCM include the mental fu nctions of the brain in Western medical physiology. 4.1.7 The Lung ( fei) The lung has the func tion of governing qi by controlling respiratory movement as well as regulating qi activities in the body. This includes the production of pectoral qi (zong-qi ). The lung in TCM also regulates water passages in the body for transmitting and discharging water, thereby propelling, adjusting and excreting water from the body. Another important aspect of the lung is that it assists the heart in blood circ ulation. In TCM theory, blood from vessels converges on the lung and is redistribu ted to the rest of the body; hence Neijing 's famous aphorism: \"The lung is co nnected to all blood vessels\" ( ). This has implications for the Chines e interpretation of lung cancer. It is consistent with 95 the fact that a malignant tum our in the lung tends to me tastasize more readily than other tumours and to spread to the bones, brain and liver. Chinese medicine views the body as an organic whole, hence the functions of organs do not exist in isolation but must always be understood in relation to other organs and the network of meridians that connect them. The principal model that connects the organs is the model of the Five Elements, to be covered in the next chapter. 4.2 On \"governing\" ( ) The preceding paragraphs ha ve put forward the case for treating an \"organ\" in TCM as a cluster of functions. Histor ically these functions were ascribed to a physical organ recognizable in modern an atomy as a somatic structure. Modern TCM texts tend to be ambi valent, sometimes referring to the organ in modern anatomy while at other times treating it as a \"synthetic functio nal unit\", thereby shifting emphasis to functions. There is a possible tensio n between classical Chinese thought, which believed that the ph ysical organs had these functions, and modern TCM theory, which can scarcely ignore the biomedical evidence for the proven physiological function s of these organs. Such tension is totally unnecessary once we interpret the TCM or gan as an abstraction that represents a cluster of functions or, more simply, treat an organ as the cluster of functions. This tension is reflected also in the ubiquitous re ference in Chinese medical literature to an organ as \"governing\" a numbe r of functions. The word \"govern\" is the translation of \" zhu\" which in Chinese has seve ral meanings. As a noun, zhu can denote the host to guests as in binzhu ; it can refer to the master or boss as zhupu (master and servant); it is also the term fo r a monotheistic God. As a verb, zhu can mean 'manage' as in zhuguan (manage an organization); it can mean 'advocate' (a cause), or 'pr opose' (a course of action). In modern TCM texts, zhu is translated into English as \"g overn\", implying that the somatic 96 structure acts like a master directing certain activities in the body. Thus when TCM says that the kidney governs growth and development, the implication is that this organ directs its stock of jing, qi, yin and yang to carry out tasks in accordance with the biological program built into its pre-natal essence. Using the notion of governing like a human-like person directing operations in the body helps conceptualize physiological activities. Such use of language is similar to the use of the term \"design\" in describing functionality in biological teleology. One approach to functionality in evolutionary biology is to separate th e notions of design and function as in: 1. X is a biological function of T and 2. T is the result of a process of change of structure due to natural selection that has resulted in T being better adapte d for X than ancestral versions of T. For example, to say that an eagle's wings are designed for soaring is to claim that the ability to soar explai ns why some ancestral eagl es had higher reproductive fitness than others, and that eagles' wings are better adapted for soaring than were those of their evolutionary ancestors. 111 Design can also imply the existence of a human desi gner, or a spiritual one if we subscribe to religious teleology. In biomedical sc ience, the designer is the adaptive process of evolution among livi ng organisms, orchestrated by the principle of natural selection. Th e designer is the natural selector. Similarly, when we say that the spleen governs tr ansformation and transportation, we give human- like status to an organ whic h in fact is no more than an abstraction of the physiological forces that combine in some orderly manner to bring about absorption and digestion of food and water and their transportation to other parts of the body. How the functions came to be clustered in this particular manner is a matter of historical interest . In most instances it was influenced by lack of understanding anatomy, such as the combining the kidney and adrenal 111 This passage is borrowed and adapted from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ (4 of 12) [1/11/2012 12:47:36 pm 97 glands as one organ. In all likelihood, the clustering was also influenced by cosmological models from which ancient Chinese models drew inspiration. For example, the number of key zang -organs was limited to just five to fit the model of the five elements, and organs like the brain, pancreas and uterus had to be relegated a special class of \"extraordinary organs\". Orthodox thinkers in Chinese medicine ho ld the ancients in high regard as they are deemed to have gained divine insight into the work ings of the body by cultivated introspection.112 That they hold such beliefs does not necessarily imply that their diagnosis and prescribed therap y for a patient would be different from that of a modern TCM practitioner who foll ows the same models because he thinks that they work for his purpose and does not particularly care about how those models came about. The pertinent question is whether or not such a system of clustering serves a useful medical purpose: does it yield dia gnoses that can be used to administer effective therapies? Practitioners have found that such a clustering of functions when used with TCM models seems to be us able for their clinic al work. (Whether in fact these models do indeed work should be and can be subjected to clinical trials.) Failure to understand the meaning of organs and their functions is the cause of considerable confusion among those who adhere to the literal interpretation of Chinese medical entities and systems and see th is as in conflict w ith the findings of biomedical science, resul ting in unnecessary internal tension in their thought processes. TCM physic ians who have not learned to re solve this conflict need to make what one observer terms \"epistemol ogical leaps\" as they try to mediate ancient wisdom and biomedical knowledge in their daily practice. 113 The arguments I have presen ted here offer a way out of this conflict. 112 Liu Lihong (2003), 14-16 113 Lo (2002), Introduction, xlix 98 4.3 meridians collaterals The \"meridian system\" ( jingluo ) in TCM theory is a system of passages that transports qi, blood, jing, yin and yang throughout the body.114 It connects the zang -organs among themselves an d with their counterpart fu-organs, and links all other parts of the body including the bone , skin, muscles and tendons and the nine orifices, allowing the bod y to function as an organic whole.115 The system also maintains communication between the body and its external environment by carrying information sign als as well as energy and materials derived from nature, thereby achieving a balance between the body and its host environment. The meridian system is ther efore much more than the simple idea of a neurological network that enables the acupuncturist to treat pain by inserting needles into appropriate points in the netw ork. So broad is the concept of the meridian system that the functions some times claimed for the system rival in importance those of the organ system. The term \"meridian\" is us ed in two ways in TCM theory. It could refer to the entire system, or it could refer to the main trunk routes in the system; the context of use usually makes it clear whic h is being referred to. The meridian system ( jingluo ) comprises main trunk routes, the meridians ( jing ), and smaller branches called collaterals ( luo) that criss-cross to form an intricate network. The meridians run at the leve l of muscles and orga ns and hence at a deeper level than the collater als, whilst the coll aterals mostly run at the level of or just below the skin. All the meridians, with the exception of the dai () meridian, run vertically, and the dai meridian runs transversely around the body. The meridians in TCM are analogous to roads and highways that link villages, cities, farms, and industrial inst allations in a countr y. They have an existence in their own right: they contain qi and can become diseased when invaded by pathogens, or they can develo p obstructions that hinder the flow of qi 114 It is not entirely clear in what ways the blood that flows in the meridians is different from blood that flow in blood vessels. Chinese thought seems not to have differentiated between the two but regard them as playing complementary roles. 115 The nine orifices comprise the eyes, nose, ears, mouth, and the sex organ and the anus. 99 and communication signals along them. The meridians ther efore behave as if they were a parallel set of organs; they can be come ill or dysfunctional, and specific meridian-based pathological conditions can be identified. The principal components of the ne twork are the 12 main meridians (jingmai ) and 8 \"extraordinary\" meridians, commonly \"extraordinary vessels\" ( qijing bamai ). Each of the 12 main meridians is connected to a particular organ and is named after that organ. Hence one speaks of the spleen meridian, the bladder meridi an, and the like. As mentioned earlier, the pericardium was introduced so that there would be six zang -organs matching 6 fu-organs, each of which would be connected to one of the 12 main meridians. The 6 meridians associated with the zang -organs are deemed to be yang in nature, and the others associated with the fu-organs yin in nature. These classifications reflect the Chinese propensity for balance and symmetry. Among other things, the yang meridians run along those parts of the body that face the sun (the back and the outside of the limbs), while the yin meridians are on the chest and the inside of the limbs, which are usually shaded from the sun. The meridian associated with the sanjiao (triple burner) fu-organ is paired with the pe ricardium meridian which, in this context, acts like a zang -organ. The 8 \"extraordinary vessels\" have no direct connection to the zang and fu- organs. The most commonly used extraord inary vessels for therapy, particularly acupuncture therapy, are the governor vessel ( dumai ), the conception vessel (renmai ( chongmai ). The dumai is thought to \"govern\" the yang meridians and the renmai the yin meridians. The chongmai is termed \"the sea of blood\" as it is deemed to be the place where all qi and blood in the body converge. The relevance of the meridians in TC M goes far beyond therapy for pain. Their main use lies in their association and connection to particular organs. For example, acupuncture needles applied to points along the spleen and stomach channels can have a tonifying effect on these organs, hence are often used for 100 patients with digestive disorders. Acupuncture of points along the renmai and chongmai are used to treat gynecological pr oblems as there is thought to be a connection of these extraordinary vessels to the female uterus. Despite their importance within the TCM theoretical framework, in practice the meridian functions are not emphasized as much in diagnosis and therapy as are those of the organ system. This may well be because there is enough in the TCM framework involving the organs and the basic entities of qi, blood and body fluids to cover most cases of diagnosis and treatm ent. Emphasis on the use of meridian theory to diagnose and treat disease prob ably reached its height shortly after the publication of Zhang Zhongjing's Shanghan Lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases ) in the Han dynasty. Today many of the febrile conditions identified by the Shanghan Lun carry their original designations in terms of the meridians, such as taiyang bing ( ), a condition arising from injury to the small intestine meridian, but their diagnoses and treatments use he rbs that address the concomitant qi and organ disorders. 4.4 An interpretatio n of the meridians Among practitioners of acupuncture, a distinctio n is made between TCM acupuncture and Western acupuncture . The latter is used somewhat loosely to refer to acupuncture carrie d out by those who follow the scientific method established by Galileo and others in the 17th century when they introduced \"systematic verification through planned experiment s to the existing ancient methods of reasoning and deduction\".116 Putting aside the debatable issue that Europeans before Galileo, and the Chines e before the 1949 revolution, did not use the scientific method, the basic idea of Western acupuncture is that the diagnosis should follow the principles of Western medicine: treatment efficacy should be verified through clinical trials, and phys iological accounts should be found for the mechanism by which needling imparts therap eutic effects. As I shall argue in the 116 Filshie and Cummings (1999), 31 101 next two chapters, given an appropriate interpretation, TCM theory in general and acupuncture in particular are no t at odds with science in the wide sense. Its major methods and practices can in principle be the subject of clinic al trials, albeit not always in accordance with the requirements of a generation of medical scientists brought up on the ideology of randomiz ed controlled trials being the only acceptable protocol for evidence-based medicine. Using evidence-based methods, much work has been done on the physiological interpretation s of Western acupuncture and on identification of points that can be used for specific therapie s. The result has so far been that many of the acupuncture points (acupoints) identified by TCM acupuncture coincide with myofascial \"trigger points\"117 but Western acupuncture does not generally subscribe to the configuration, indeed to the existence, of the meridians used in TCM.118 Conjectures regarding the effi cacy of needling are made in neurophysiological terms, fo r which there is a burgeoning literature triggered by President Nixon's visit to China in 1972 wh en television documentaries of surgical operations conducted on fully conscious patients treated with acupuncture needles.119 For pain relief or acupu ncture analgesia, biomed ical explanations have focused on neurophysiologi cal and neuropharmacological mechanisms. The discovery of transferable analgesia from animals treated with acupuncture to untreated animals by cross-circulation of blood and cerebrospinal fluid led to more intensive research into a cast of neurophysiological players like endorphins, serotonin and encephalins.120 Placebo effects are thought to be equally powerful and are the subject of extensive research.121 117 \"myo\" is a descriptive for muscle; \"fascia\"pertains to the fibrous membrane separating muscles and also forming the layer between the skin and the muscles. See Taber's (2001), 775. 118 Filshie and Cummings (1999), 38-42 119 See for example Ernst and White (1999). These procedures have since been challenged and there have been claims that other analgesia/anaesthesia may have been involved. What is not in doubt is that they aroused the attention of the medical world to acupuncture. 120 See Fishie and Cummings in Ernst and White (1999), 36 121 See for example Kaptchuk (2000) and Evans (2003). 102 In sum, Western acupunctu re has offered biomedical explanations for its alleged efficacy, and has been extensively su bjected to clinical tr ials. It does not depend on the TCM theory of meridians. In co ntrast, meridians play a central role in TCM acupuncture as needles are usually in serted into selected acupoints that lie along one or more of the meridians. Historically there has been sustained Western interest in the nature of meridians -- whether they exist and, if they do, whether they are neurological networks, paths of low resist ance to flows of energy, or the paths for some other kinds of flow. The meridian s, conceived as a physical network like nerves and blood vessels, have never been isolated, nor has thei r biomedical nature been determined despite many attempts by Ch inese and Western sc ientists. Lu and Needham reported in 1980 that attemp ts to demonstrate a physical or sub- anatomical substratum for th e system were inconclusive.122 Leung et al cite other hypotheses in 2003, including one postulat ing them as low electrical impedance paths, none of which have been confirmed.123 Within TCM theory, there are two dist inct questions over meridians that are of interest. The first concerns its role to convey qi and blood and its use to relieve pain. Pain in TCM theory has to do with obstr ucted flow, as captured in the aphorism \"Where there is no flow ther e is pain; when there is no pain, there is flow\" ( ). The TCM explanation is that the acupuncture needle stimulates the flow of qi and blood. Pain is therefore mitigated by promoting better flow with a needle at the locus of pa in or, more commonly, at a receiving point and transmission po int along one of the meridians. The second aspect of meridians is th eir connection to the organs and their therapeutic use for illnesses associated with the organs. For example, TCM theory would prescribe acupuncture on points al ong the spleen and stomach meridians to stimulate the production and flow of spleen- qi and stomach- qi, which are needed to alleviate problems of digestion, bloated stomach, or lack of appetite. This 122 Lu and Needham (1980),186 123 Leung, et al (2003), 176-177 103 function of the meridians is the more impo rtant one for TCM theory as it is an integral part of the overall holistic framew ork of explanation for illness, diagnosis and therapy. In the light of the modern TCM concep t of the organs as a set of functions rather than somatic structures with fixed loci, the notion of meridians leading to organs becomes suspect, and the conventiona l maps showing the intricate paths of each meridian with an end point in a (Western anatom y) organ could conceivably come to grief. An escape from this dile mma is to interpret the meridian maps as being merely schematic once a meridian enters the visceral region, where it somehow interacts with the function of the organ with which it is supposedly linked. This is not entire ly satisfactory and a consideration of the ontological status of meridians seems appropriate. My conjecture is that the intricate ne twork mapped out in ancient Chinese texts, which continues to be used by modern TCM phys icians in clinical work, does not exist as a set of ph ysically isolatable pathwa ys. Attempts to map the network using electrochemical and other techniques are likely to be doomed to failure, for the same reason that it does not make sense to isolate qi, phlegm and wind for chemical analysis. The meridian system is an explanatory model that experience has found to be useful in the se nse that in clinical situations the body behaves as if these pathways existed when the phy sician applies his needle. The biochemical mechanisms, as has been found from recent research on pain treatment with acupuncture, are vastly co mplex and unlikely to be adequately captured in a system of 12 meridians and 8 extraordinary vessels. As one Western researcher speculates , the ancients found that pressure on certain points led to pain relief in other areas of the body and, based on their belief in the flow of qi, proceeded to map out paths to ex plain those effects. Over time, these putative paths grew into a large ne twork, parts of which may have been merely hypothesized and not subjected to te sting in clinical work. The result was an unwieldy meridian network. On e should add that in one of the Neijing 's 104 volumes called Lingshu , many organ disorders were treated with pressure with fingers or sharp stone implements on ac upoints, and a holistic picture emerged which reflected the influence of Chinese co smological models. These emphasized symmetry and correspondence; in particular , the model of the five elements led to the association of meridians with the zang -organs. The truth of the matter in clinical prac tice is that experienced acupuncturists constantly improvise new acupuncture po ints that may not be related to the mapped meridians. These are known as \" a shi \" ( or \"Oh yes!\" pronounced ah shhhh...) acupoints, based on the experienced acupuncturists eliciting positive responses from their patients when th eir needle hits a sweet spot. These a shi points would appear to have little relation to the meridian system. To ancient medical thinkers the huma n body was a black box whose content could only be conjectured on the basis of its external manifestations. Models of the workings of the internal component sy stems in the black b ox were invented by observing output responses to inputs. Th ese models were ofte n guided by Chinese cosmology and a rich metaphysical poetic tradition, as well as the belief that the human body was a microcosm of the external universe. This is a subject of the next chapter. 105 5. TCM Models in Expl anation and Prediction The principal aims of this dissertati on are (a) to show how TCM theory may be reconstructed to be un derstandable from the vant age point of biomedical science and (b) to assess the evidential cred entials of the thus reconstructed theory Toward aim (a), I have argued in the last two chapters that TCM entities are a combination of real entities and theo retical/fictional constr ucts, and that the systems of organs and meridians are mere ly ways of classifying and organizing physiological activities to fit into the m odels of TCM theory. In this chapter, I present a number of key models in TC M theory and interpret them from a biomedical standpoint, thereb y taking a first essential st ep towards reconstructing TCM theory. In the next chapter, I address aim (b), proposing how TCM's evidential credentials may be evaluated. Before examining the principal models us ed in TCM it is necessary look at the concepts of yin and yang that lie at the base of much of Chinese philosophy and Chinese medical theory. 5.1 Yin-Yang : the principle of balance as the basis for health The concepts of yin and yang were introduced in distant antiquity, before Taoism and the I-Ching or The Book of Changes (circa 600BC). There are extensive discussions of yin and yang in the I-Ching and it undoubtedly was a major source of philosophical insight in Taoism, which gave it full expression in poetry, metaphysics, statecraft and medicine. The ideas in yin and yang in Chinese philosophy and medicine are usually presented as Yin-Yang Xueshuo ( ), the doctrine (or theory) of yin and yang . The doctrine reflects a di alectical logic that attempts to explain relationships and change. Stripped to its bare essentials, yin and yang are not much more than labels that describe the perception of du ality in nature - li ght versus darkness, 106 hardness versus softness, male versus female. Thus the yin-yang doctrine is a way of viewing the world, a way of thinking that places all en tities as part of a whole \u2014 entities that cannot have existence independent of th eir relationship to other entities. Chinese medicine took these concepts from cosmology and, viewing the body as a microcosm of the universe in which ideally things are in harmony and balance, it regarded hum an health as being based on a balance between yin and yang in the body. As such, the yin-yang doctrine is not so much a scientific theory as it is a conceptual fram ework for the models in TCM theory. The models themselves are used for explanation and prediction and, if they claim to be scientific models, must be capable of yielding testable hypotheses. The basic idea of yin and yang is simple and might appe ar to be an unlikely source of medical wisdom. Dualism of natu ral states and attrib utes means that an attribute like brightness ha s meaning only relative to darkness, as does beauty relative to ugliness.124 Objects and states can be si milarly classified: day and night, summer and winter, hard and soft Attributes come in contrasting pairs: male and female, transparency and murkiness, an d so on as the following sample list illustrates: Table 1 Yin and Yang Attributes Yang Yin Strong Mellow Bright Dim Rigid, unyielding Flexible, yielding Hard Soft Transparent Unfathomable Hot, dry Cool, moist Fast, hurried Slow, patient Analytical Discursive Insensitive Sensitive 124 Laotze, the founder of Taoism, explains it in terms of recognition of attributes: \"It is because everyone under Heaven recognizes beauty as beauty that the idea of ugliness exists\" 107 The correlation of these attributes to male and female stereotypes is rather obvious. Social stereotypes can be simi larly viewed. For example, Nisbett classifies the West with its predilection for transparency and the rule of law as yang and the East with its penchant for subtlety and flexibility as yin.125 Yin and yang are attributes but also substances in the human body; for example, we speak of the yin and yang as substances in th e kidney, but also of jing (essence), a s a substance with yin attributes, and qi, a substance with yang attributes being stored in various organs . This blurring of distinction between substances and attributes, and also betwee n action and physical state, is common in ancient Chinese thought and often refl ected in the gramma r of the Chinese language. For example, the word gandong can be a verb meaning to move someone emotionally, or a n oun to denote the action of moving someone, or an adjective describing the person's emotional state of being moved. Yin and yang are attributes in some contexts, but in other contexts they are substances having yin and yang characteristics. This apparent disr egard for ontology needs to be borne in mind when evaluating Chinese medica l theory, which is influenced by the emphasis of ancient Chinese thought on functions and processes rather than on the physical nature of the underlying entities. While a balance of yin and yang is the ideal in nature, there have been philosophical debates over which was intrin sically stronger (much as the West has had debates over which is the weaker se x among human beings ). Legend has it that the debate over which was mightier, yin or yang, was settled by Laotze when the young moral philosopher Confucius made a long journey to have an audience with the older sage in the latter's declinin g years to seek guidance on the subject. Laotze had little time for Confucian moral absolutism, believin g instead in going with the flow and a balance of all extrem es. Laotze was a man of few words, the extant record of his entire philosophical output being a tract of a mere 5000 words, the Daode Jing. When Confucius raised the yin-yang question, the aged sage cast him a disdainful look, ope ned his mouth wide and po inted his finger at his 125 Nisbett (2003) 108 decaying oral cavity. The conversation e nded there, leaving Confucius profoundly puzzled. Only the long track back to his lodgings cleared his mind: Laotze's hard teeth were all long gone but the soft tongue was alive and well. The Chinese regard for yin carries over to medical thought: gradual cures are more lasting than quick fixes; soft methods will eventually triumph over hard ones; the nourishing of yin is, in most instances, a better way to go than tonification for yang , and the soft gra ceful movements of Taiji shadow boxing in misty country air superior to vigorous aerobic exercises in a bright urban gym. Certain principles govern the relationship between yin and yang . They complement each other but also oppose each other, a combin ation of mutual support and check and balanc e. The idea of mutual dependence and mutual opposition is captured in the cl assic graphic presentation of yin and yang. Yin and yang wrap around each other, providing mu tual support but also each holding the other in check. Yin Yang YIN YANG Yin is needed for generation of yang , and vice versa. For example, blood (a yin substance) is needed for the production of qi (a yang substance), and qi is also involved in the production of blood. Qi is also the driving force for the movement of blood. 109 Yin and yang wax and wane. For example, in the diurnal cycl e of the world outside the body, yang starts growing stronger af ter midnight and by dawn it dominates over yin, continuing to grow until it reaches a peak at noon, then declines and gives way to yin which gains ascendancy after dark and peaks at midnight. A similar cycle is thought to exist in the human body, with the body rising in vigour from dawn and turning passive after dark. The seasons likewise see yang growing rapidly in early spring and reaching a peak in mid-summer; by the autumn yin is ascendant and finally reaches a maximum in winter. The healthy body is conceived by TCM as one that is in perfect balance. Balance implies that yin and yang as mutually opposing fo rces are in harmonious coalition and in equilibrium. A principa l cause of illness is an imbalance between yin and yang , and therapy consists in restoring balance . There have been attempts to relate the concept of balancing yin and yang to underlying biom edical processes. One of these is homeostasis, a process by which the internal environment of the body comprising such factors as temperatur e, blood pressure and acid-base balance is maintained in dynamic equilibrium under conditions of a varying external environment. This is achieved by an ever-changing process of feedback and regulation in response to external or internal changes. Yin and yang have also been compared to anabolic and catabolic forces in body metabolism as underst ood in Western medicine. Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules such as proteins and fats from simpler ones, and an anabolic force is one that promotes tissue growth by increasing the metabolic processes involved in protein synthesis. Catabo lism is the chemical decomposition of complex substances in the body to form simpler ones, accompanied by the release of energy. The substances being broken down include nu trients in food such as carbohydrates and proteins as well as storage products such as glycogen.126 Anabolism is thought to be yin and catabolism to be yang . One claim is that every cell and every bodily syst em alternates between yin anabolic activity and yang catabolic activity: if a cell is excessive in its catabolic yang activity, then an 126 Oxford Concise Medical Dictionary (2007) 110 anabolic yin activity will be instituted to bala nce the action to ensure continued healthy cellular activity.127 Duality in body systems su ch as the sympathetic nervous system (which is involved in fight) and the pa rasympathetic system (which calms down the body) have also been compared to yang and yin forces respectively.128 While such comparisons may have some superficial appeal, there is little to support them beyond their being helpful an alogies for TCM pedagogical purposes. Within Chinese medicine, yin and yang have clinical meaning mainly with respect to models in TCM theory that attempt to define physiological and pathological states of the body. A set of symptoms may be identified as belonging to a particular imbalance. For ex ample, \"weakness of kidney yang \" is a condition that arises from yang being weaker than yin in the kidney functional system, possibly the result of poor nutrition, overwork or sexual excess. It manifests itself in symptoms of lassitude, a pale complexion, fear of wind and cold, a thin pulse, chronic back pain, frequent urination and sexual dysfunction. The treatment is with yang tonics for the kidney. (The role of yin and yang in clinical diagnosis and in the choice of therapies will be clearer when we deal with differentiation of syndromes further below.) The yin-yang principle does not amount to very much more than the common observation of dualism in nature, th at attributes mostly come in pairs. The mutual dependence of yin and yang for generating each other can be seen as the need for some kind of homeostasis-like equilibrium in physiological functions. As for the waxing and waning of yin and yang , these were originally derived from the cyclical character of natural phenomen a - the diurnal cycle, the seasons, and circadian rhythms of the body. They became useful tools for analysis of the workings of the body, and their meanings expanded as early me dical thinkers tried to explain physiological phenomena inside the body . TCM models use these 127 http://www.drmarkholmes.com/pdf/Homeostasis.pdf 128 http://drlwilson.com/Articles/CATABOLISM.HTM 111 concepts to capture what were perceived to be attributes of various entities in the body and their dynamic states. 5.2 TCM Models The term \"model\" as used in science, and in the philosophy of science, has many meanings, and is sometimes a source of confusion. In the discussion that follows, I shall use this term only becaus e it facilitates refere nce to observed or postulated regulariti es in TCM theory. Chinese medical classics hardly if ever use this term. However some modern interpreters of TCM theory have used the concept of the model to characterize the theory's basic princi ples and observed regularities. Zhang, for of TCM theory as comprising inviolable natural laws into which ancient wisdom had somehow gained special insights.129 There is no universally-accepted definiti on of a model. Frigg and Hartmann describe models as one of the principal instruments of modern science, lament the \"incredible proliferation of model-types in the philosophical literature\", but stop short of defining the term.130 Psillos calls it a \"term of art used in understanding how theories represent the world.\" 131 Duhem, Mach and others held that theoretical models in science are merely dispensable aids to theory construction and can be \"detached and discarded when the theory is fully developed\". Campbell sees models as analogies that ar e essential parts of theories, as in the case of the theory of gases which uses the model of point particles moving like billiard balls at random in the vessel containing the gas.132 Such analogies might merely serve as inadequate stepping stones to better theories, as was the case when 129 Zhang Qicheng (1996,1999) 130 Frigg and Hartmann (2006) 131 Psillos (2007) 132 Hesse (1967), 357 112 statistical mechanics eventually learnt to stand on its own two fe et and the billiard ball model was no longer needed. In the social sciences, particularly in economic science, models are used to represent idealized situations that appr oximate to real economic conditions at particular places and times. For exam ple, Adam Smith's model of economic efficiency in competitive markets hold s true provided that the conditions for perfect competition obtain. These in clude free markets, absence of state intervention, perfect information, and the absence of transactions costs. In the demand-supply model, consumers are pictured as seeking a fictitious entity called utility, yielding an equation for an objec tive function to be optimized under supply and budgetary constraints. For the purpose of reconstructing TC M theory, which can be viewed as having a number of models asso ciated with it, it is conven ient to use that term in a similar manner to Ronald Giere. A scientif ic theory comprises a cluster of models, together with a number of hypotheses about real things claimed to be similar to one or another of the models. \"A theore tical hypothesis is ... a statement asserting some sort of relationship between a model and a designated real system... Hypotheses, then, claim a similarity between models and real systems.\" 133 Whether TCM models qualify to be called scientific models must then depend on whether hypothes es regarding illness can be derived from these models and whether these are testable in principl e and preferably also in practice. To establish the scientific nature of TCM models, one must therefore be able to present testable hypotheses based on th ese models. This must mean that the methods of diagnosis and treatment can be put to clinical test. If these hypotheses can be put to the test, the claim that TC M is scientific can begin to be made. Testing may lead to a reject ion of most of TCM theory. However if some parts of the theory were confirmed through hypothesis testing, it would give TCM more scientific credibility although, like economics and evolutionary biology, it would 133 Giere (1988), 80 113 probably never enjoy the same level of a cceptance as theories in the physical sciences because of its complexity and the practical (but not insurmountable) difficulties of conducting clinical trials. Giere's allowance for similarity rather than a strict correspondence between models and what they represent coheres wi th my view that TCM theory comprises mainly (crude) heuristic models that, lik e many models in the economic and the social sciences, are thought to be useful for practical purposes, even though they do not seem to work all the time. (Witness the succe sses and failures of Keynesian economics in different times and economic environments.) 134 It is worthwhile reiterating at this point that in describing TCM theory as using models that may be put to scientific test, one should not regard TCM itself as a science or a potential science. Lik e architecture, engineering and economic management, TCM is a practice that makes use of the knowledge that science offers. It is a human enterprise to heal disease and promote health. It makes use of (alleged) science, employi ng what it believes to be sc ientific models just as the profession of architecture uses physics and chemistry to design structures and select building materials. Unlike the ph ysical and biological sciences, TCM does not primarily seek the truth and reality underlying natural phenomena. Instead it tries to find rules and regularities in nature that help explain h ealth and illness, and employs suitable methods to achieve its objective to heal illness and promote human health. In this resp ect, it is not different fr om modern Western medicine. A cluster of models together collecti vely make up the theory of TCM. Some key models are examined below. 5.2.1 The Five Elements: the mo del of physiological interaction Wuxing is translated as \"the Five Ele ments\" or \"the Five Phases\" depending on whether one take s it to describe relationships among substances or 134 However, I do not necessarily subscribe to Giere's more radical position that science can do without laws of nature, arguing that \"it is models, not laws in the traditional sense, that do the important representational work in science.\" Acceptance of this viewpoint is not essential to adopting his framework of theories, models and hypotheses. See Gierre (1999) Science Without Laws . 114 relationships among dynamic processes. For example, one of the main applications of the model is in relation to the five zang organs, which in TCM usually represent clusters of functions but are sometimes treated like somatic structures. I shall use the term \"five elements\" as it is more common in the translated literature. Wuxing Xueshuo ( ) is usually translated as the theory of the five elements. However, \" xueshuo \" more commonly means \"teachings\", implying that there may be a doctrinal aspect to it. Hence it is also translated as the Doctrine of the Five Elements. I call it the model of the five elements as this is more in line with my view of TCM theory as comprising he uristic models. The Five-element model is related to an cient thinking that all things in the natural world are derived from wood, fire , earth, metal and water. The model places wood, fire, earth, metal and wate r in a clockwise ring combination to capture their mutual relationships and interactions. Each zang -organ is associated with one element, and elements and organs are matched up as follows: wood-liver, fire-heart, earth-spleen, lung-metal and ki dney-water. The model thus places the five zang-organs in the same ring combination (Figure 2). Wood (Liver) Water (Kidney) Fire (Heart) Metal (Lung) Earth (Spleen) Figure 2 The Five-Element Model The model describes relationships among the five elements that can be applied to the selection of therapeutic me thods in TCM. The first relationship is 115 that of \"promotion\" ( sheng ). Each organ promotes the one next to it in the clockwise direction in the sense of nouris hing, strengthening, or \"giving birth to\" to it, and in that sense it is the \"mot her\" of that organ. For example, \"earth promotes metal\" implies th at strengthening the spleen is one way of nourishing and tonifying the lung. A patient with weakness in his lung (functions) can be treated with a spleen tonic, which in turn strengthens the lung to overcome imbalances within that organ. In TCM clin ical practice, this is indeed one of the most commonly-used therapies for lung problems. By nourishing the spleen (digestive system), a weak lung can be st rengthened. This approach is especially useful for patients who, for one reason or another, are unable to accept medication directly for lung disorders: giving tonic to the spleen would mo re gently build up their lung functions. There is a similarity here to the practice in Western practice, in the pre-antibiotic age, when diet wa s the major component in the regimen for treating consumption (tuberculosis of the lung). The second main relationship in the five -element model is that of \"restraint\" (ke). Each element restrains the next one two steps down the clockwise ring; for example, wood (liver) restrains earth (spleen), and fire (heart) restrains metal; in familial terms, grandmother restrains th e grandchild. In the healthy human body, this acts like check and ba lance: mother promotes the child, whilst grandmother guards against excesses in the grandchild. This relationship is useful in TCM for explaining instances when restraint is over-done. For example, an excess syndrome (\"exuberance\") of the liver, such as may be induced by pent-up anger or excessive consumption of alcohol, suppre sses (over-restrains) the functions of the spleen, causing it to under-perform its func tions. It also suggests that certain problems of the spleen arising from over-s uppression by the liver can be treated by calming the liver. The five-element model has long been a pillar of Chinese medical thought, but in recent decades it has become the subject of debate . It has been estimated that in reality about half the permuta tions of relationships among the organs implied by the five-element theory are not used in clinical practice, probably 116 because they have not been found to work.135 For example, a method of tonifying a weak spleen termed \"Strengthe n fire to tonify the earth\" ( yihuobutu fa ) would, by the five-element model, im ply strengthening the mother heart organ to tonify the spleen. In pr actice, this is rarely done. Another source of \"fire\" is deemed to be the kidney which, which also has a warming functi on for the rest of the organs. In clinical practi ce, physicians strengthen kidney yang , rather than the heart, to tonify the spleen ; this is not in accordance with the five-element model.136 Another example of inconsistency within the five-element model is the common method of \"Mut ual reinforcement of metal and water\" ( jinshui xiangsheng fa ) for treating deficiency in lung -yin, a condition common in dry autumn weather in Northern Ch ina and occurring in post-influenza dry coughs generally. Beside s directly nourishing lung- yin, the five-element model would prescribe that the physician should also strengthen the mother organ of the lung (the spleen). Instead a \"mutual rein forcement of metal and water\" unrelated to the five-element model prescribes strengthening kidney- yin. The rationale behind this is that the kidney is believed to be a source of yin for all organs. Such inconsistencies have led prom inent Chinese medical thinker Deng Tietao at the Guangzhou University of Chin ese Medicine to advocate that the five- element model be modified to the more practical \"the five-organ set of relationships\", which merely sets out th ose relationships among organs that are thought to be useful based on clinical experience without the constraint of conforming to some ancient cosmological model. 137 This in effect amounts to giving up the five-element model and instead just sett ing out a list of those relationships among the organs that have been found to be helpful in clinical practice. Such a step would replace an ancient model drawn from cosmology with a more practical one based on empirical experience. This change would be in line 135 See Ou ( 2005) 136 It is instead in accordance with the mingmen or 'gate of life\" theory which places the kidney in the central role of warming the body's organs. See Wu (1995) Zhongyi jichu xue , 31 137 Deng Tietao (1988) 117 with my view of TCM models being heuristic models based on empirical experience rather than being deri vable from ancient cosmological laws. 5.2.2 Climate and Emotions: the model for illness causation Ancient Chinese texts cite six exog enous (climatic) factors and seven emotions as causes of di sease (or pathogenic factors) . Modern TCM texts add toxic chemicals, microbiological agents (v iruses, bacteria, fung i etc), parasites and harmful dietary and living habits. Alt hough it recognizes the existence of microbiological agents, modern TCM practi ce defers to Western medicine to deal with these matters and views climatic an d emotional factors an d poor dietary and living habits as providing the grounds for the invasion of these agents to cause illness. As noted earlier (C hapter 2), this understanding of causation is in accord with the Chinese medical emph asis on the value of prev ention over cure. Hence, protection against adverse climatic influences and moderation of one's emotions are the key principles for th e cultivation of health; fro m a biomedical standpoint they may help prevent harmful microbiolog ical agents from affecting the body. Climatic influences are usually referr ed to as the six exogenous factors ( ): Wind Cold Summer Heat Dampness Dryness Fire When these climatic factors invade th e body and are not expelled, they can become internal pathogenic factors with characteristics similar to their external counterparts. We have also (Chapter 3) dealt with their endogenous counterparts bearing the same names. 118 Wind is blamed for the largest variety of illness. It is characterized by movement; hence a form of rheumatism with pain moving to different parts of the body is thought to be due to wind within the body. Cold and heat in the weather have parallels internally in pathological conditions of h eat and cold. Summer heat is extreme heat (fire) often accomp anied by dampness as well. Dampness is high humidity when it is external , and is associated with sy mptoms of stickiness (being difficult to eliminate) when it penetrates the superficies, slowing a person down and causing stagnation in digestion when it is present in the spleen. Dryness, on the other hand, is present typically in autumn and winter mo nths in temperate countries and air-conditioned rooms in the tropics. The seven emotions ( ) in TCM are pleasure, anger, anxiety, grief, fear, shock and melancholy of which the first five are more commonly encountered. Each of the seven is thought to be a ssociated with a specific zang organ: Emotion Organ damaged by this emotion Pleasure Heart A n g e r L i v e r Anxiety Spleen G r i e f L u n g Fear Kidney S h o c k H e a r t Melancholy Lung, Liver 'Pleasure' here refers to excessive indulgence in pleasurable activities, including excessive sex. Anger damages the liver, which explai ns why a sudden fit of anger can cause wind or fire to rise from the liver to the head and cause headaches, dizziness, 119 red eyes or elevated blood pressure. Likewise, frequent anger stirs up the liver, manifested in \"wind\" that travels to the h ead (causing hypertension and strokes) or suppression of the spleen, causing gastric pains. \"Anxiety\" is often translated inappropriately as \"contemplation\" but is more correctly interpreted as constant and unrem itting thinking and worrying (brooding), a state which I prefer to call (chronic) anxiety. It acts slowly on the spleen, gnawing away at one's health at the basic level of digestio n and nutrition. It is the most insidious and damaging form of emotion, wearing do wn the body and eventually leading to more serious illnesses as the other organs are affected by the poor functioning of the spleen . The rate of disorders of the (TCM) spleen tends to be higher in societies and in professi ons where there is pressure for high achievement and people are constantly and often unconsciously in a state of anxiety (they look at their smart phones at meal times and allow them to intrude freely into time sp ent with friends and family). This is manifested in such problems as the irritable bowel syndrome, bloated stomachs and general dyspepsia. Grief damages the lung and TCM explains that this is the reason we sigh a lot when stricken with grief. Fear affects the kidneys, and is though t to be the reason that extreme fear can cause incontinence and also affect reproductive function and damage fertility. The model for causation of illness is us eful more as a guide to cultivating health rather than for diagnosis or treatmen t. As we shall see below, diagnosis and treatment revolve around recognition of pa tterns of symptoms that are manifested by the underlying disorder. 5.2.3 Syndromes: the model for diagnosis and therapy The \"syndromes\" model for diagnosi s and therapy is central to TCM theory and constitutes an important dist inction between biomedicine and TCM. The former emphasizes the diagnosis of dise ases and identificati on of their causes (usually specified at the level of blood components, cells, genes and 120 microorganisms) whilst the latter is focu sed on discerning constellations of symptoms that are classifi ed into patterns of illn ess known as \"syndromes\" or zheng (). Zheng is also translated as \"pattern\" or \"manifesta tion\". We shall use \"syndrome\" as the more common translation.138 The TCM syndrome or zheng () has similarities to, but is fundamentally different from, a syndrome in Western medi cine. The latter is \"a combination of signs and/or symptoms that forms a dis tinct clinical picture indicative of a particular disorder\": for example, th e chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes.139 As will be explained further below, a TCM syndrome is one of a number of defined recognizable patterns . It is not a disease in the Western medical nosological sense. It may be associated with more than one disease, and a disease can exhibit different syndromes in the course of its progression (pathogenesis), hence the ap horism \"different treatmen ts for the diseases\" (tongbing yizhi, yibing tongzhi ). 140 For example the syndrome of qi weakness is a common condition in coronary heart disease, but may also be observed in patients with stomach ulcers. A disease can be associated with different syndromes, and these syndromes can change over time as th e disease progresses. For example, tuberculosis is a disease with symptoms of blood in the sputum, daily fevers, lassitude, and loss of weight. A pers on with the disease might exhibit yang deficiency in the lung at one stage and qi stagnation of the spleen at another. These require different TCM treatment regimens, even if the patient was concurrently being treate d with the same Western antibiotics throughout these stages.141 138 See Farquhar (1994), Scheid (2002), 201 and Sivin (1987),109. 139 Oxford (2007): A syndrome is \"a combination of signs and/or symptoms that forms a distinct clinical picture indicative of a particular disorder\", eg. chronic fatigue syndrome. 140 The translation of \"disease\" here for bing () is not totally satisfactory as the Chinese bing has a wider meaning that includes the universe of disease and illness in the Western sense as described in Chapter 2.5). 141 Scheid (2002) notes that while the differentiation of syndromes was discussed in various parts of Neijing and The Treatise on Febrile Diseases , and were used at various times in the history of Chinese medicine, there was also emphasis on diseases and symptoms rather in addition to syndromes. It was only in the Republican era that, under the influence of classifications seen in biomedicine, TCM underwent the \"wide- 121 The identification of syndromes in a pa tient through a process of diagnosis recognizing the patterns associated with the syndrome(s) is termed bianzheng (differentiation of syndromes). Th e therapy administered is termed lunzhi (applying principles of ther apy). Combining the two, the model of diagnosis and treatment, central to TCM theory, is bainzhenglunzhi , or \"differentiation of syndromes and trea tment accordingly\". There are several classification systems for the differentiati on of syndromes, but the commonly used ones are: a) bagang : classification by the eigh t principles or the eight basic syndromes b) zangfu : classification by the visceral system c) wei qi ying xue : classification by the level of penetration of the pathogen, at the superficies, qi , nutrient qi and blood levels d) qi xue jingye classification by qi , blood or body fluid being involved e) bingyin : classification according to external climatic causes - heat, cold, dampness, wind, etc f) liujing : classification by the six meridians Some Western writers, notably Sivin, Farquhar and Kaptchuk, prefer to use more exotic terms like \"the eight rubric s\", \"the four sector s of the warm illness school\" and \"the six warps\" for (a), (c) and (e) respectively.142 Modern textbooks usually explain that the different classification systems can be used together, mutually \"supplementing\" one another.143 Historically, however, there have been rivalries among va rious schools of thou ght. For example, scale systematization of the presentation of diseases, patterns and symptoms and signs\" that was needed to make differentiating syndromes a distinguishing feature of contemporary Chinese medicine. 142 Sivin (1987), Farquhar (1994), and Kaptchuk (2000) 143 Wang (2002), 2 122 the six meridian system is emphasized by the \"Cold Damage School\" based on the Treatise on xue system. As Ren Yingqiu puts it, all schools of thought are derivative s of the basic tenets of the Neijing and have varying emphases that reflect the living envi ronments at different historical periods and in diverse geographical regions.144 For example, the warm pathogens school became influential in late Ming and Qi ng dynasties when medical thought was stimulated by studies by Wu Youxing (1582-1652) of in fectious diseases common in spring and summer in the south. This became a comp eting school of thought to the cold-damage school of the Shanghan Lun from the ancient Han dynasty when climate-related illnesses were brought about largely by exposure to winter cold. In practice several of th e classification systems are used simultaneously to differentiate a syndrome. Typically, a sy ndrome is differentiated by specifying the locus of the illnes s and the state of the body at th at locus. The locus could be a viscera, in accordance with (b) above , or meridians (e), or generalized throughout the b ody at a certain level of penetration (c) and involving a particular substance or fluid (d). The state of the body is described by one or more of the 8 basic syndromes in bagang (8 rubrics) comprising: exterior and interior, yin and yang, heat and cold, and deficiency and exce ss. \"Exterior\" in this instance refers to the locus of illness being at the level of the superficies, and in terior the rest in increasing depth, from qi to blood. The concepts of heat/cold and defi ciency/excess are different from those of ordinary language. \"Heat\" in TCM has little to do directly with temperature. It is a basic syndrome defined by a set of symptoms - a red tongue, a quickened pulse, a redder complexion possibly with redder eyes, a feeling of warmth and vexatiousness, sore throat and preference for cold over warm drinks. An elevated body temperature may or may not be pres ent, and is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for having heat in the TCM sense. 144 Ren (1986 ) 123 Deficiency ( xu) and excess ( shi), also translated as asthenia and sthenia respectively, are described in the Neijing as follows: When pathogenic breaths [from wi thout] shi; When a person's e ssentials breaths ( jing and qi) are depleted, that is xu.145 The concepts of exces s and deficiency have a close similarity of to those of repletion and depletion respectively in ancient Greco-Roman medicine, in which the notion of repletion is associated w ith over-indulgence in food and drink and depletion results from stre ss, sexual exhaustion, or inadequate nutrition.146 In TCM, deficiency can also be the result of pathological processes that weaken the body, as in the case of so meone who suffers from a chronic debilitating illness or has just recovered from an acute infectio n. The excess syndro me is also observed in TCM when the body confronts an invading pathogen and has adequate zheng-qi (healthy qi) to put up a fight. This result ant struggle between pathogen and zheng- qi is manifested as an ex cess syndrome. If however zheng-qi is low and body's defences are therefore weak, the body su ccumbs quickly to the pathogen and exhibits a deficiency syndrome. Excess is often but not always correlated with surplus yang and heat, and deficiency with yin and cold. In the course of the prog ression of an illness (patho genesis), the prevailing syndromes are in a dynamic state and can change over time, as the following example illustrates. A patient is subjected to cold hars h weather and his body defences break down. He catches a chill that develops into a fever. He has a runny nose, a mild cough and a headache, and is averse to cold and wind; his tongue is pale with little fur, and his pulse is \"floating\". In TC M thought, these are symptoms of \"cold damage\" affecting the outer layers of the bo dy. The patient's syndrome is \"cold at the exterior (surface) level\" ( biaohan zheng ). At this stage, if he has sufficient zheng-qi , the body can be assisted to resolve the condition with a warm diaphoretic medication like the Ephedra 145 Neijing: Suwen, ch.28. \"Essential breaths\" here refers to essence ( jing) and qi. 146 See, for example, Nutton (2004), Alternatives , 202-215 expels the surface cold pathogen by inducing perspiration.147 The patient should achieve full recovery in 1-3 days. Without treatment and proper care, hi s condition could progress to a more serious stage when he develops a fever and sore throat, hi s tongue is red with thick yellowish fur, his pulse is ra pid, his face is flushed an d he feels warm. His cough has worsened, accompanied by thick yellow ish phlegm. The pathogen is thought to have penetrated deeper into the body, an d he now has the synd rome of internal heat with dampness ( ). Medications for clearing heat and resolving dampness would need to be administered. The recovery period would be longer. After the internal heat and dampness have cleared, he feels weak an d exhausted, his face is pale, his tongue is pale red with little fu r, and he has a persistent dry cough. His syndrome is that of combined deficiency of lung- qi and of deficiency of lung yin ( ). He needs a qi tonic to strengthen his lung functions and a yin tonic to nourish the lung; the former promotes air movement in and out of the lungs, and the latter encour ages secretions of body fluids ( sheng jin ), moisturizing the drug phlegm in his lungs and enabling it to coagulate so it can be easily coughed out as white ph legm. This tonification tr eatment could take over a week, or several weeks if the patient was elderly or had a weak constitution. In the above example, the syndrome of \"cold at the exterior level\" invokes the classification system (a) for cold, and (c ) for exterior level. The next stage of pathogenesis was \"internal heat with damp ness\" which draws on (c) for internal, (a) for heat and (e) for dampne ss. Finally, in his weaken ed state his syndromes are \"deficiencies of lung- qi and lung yin\", drawing on (a) for deficiency and yin, (b) for viscera, and (d) for qi. A physician's ability to differentiate syndromes and apply appropriate treatment accordingly requires experien ce as sometimes several syndromes are 147 TCM considers perspiration as resolving both cold and warm conditions at the exterior level. If the condition is that of heat at the exterior level, a cool diaphoretic like dried chrysanthemum flowers ( juhua ) would be used. 125 present and complications arise from patients' having different natural constitutions (such as some tending to ha ve more heat or more dampness than others in their normal state). Detailed guidelines are provided by a system of diagnosis and therapy, which is outlin ed below, albeit onl y briefly since the primary interest is in the epistemologi cal issues in models of diagnosis and treatment. The Four Examinations The method of diagnosis to enable the physician to differentiate syndromes is known as the Four Examinations. The basi c principle of the four examinations is to make inferences about the body's in ternal condition based on symptoms observable by the physician and described by the patient. In ancient times, the physician did not have diagnostic tools su ch as X-rays, laboratory blood tests, ultrasound and MRIs that are now the common fare of Western physicians. The modern TCM physician continue s in the tradition of the ancients by relying on the four examinations to enable him to draw conclusions about the patient's syndromes. The procedure of the four ex aminations is akin to a mapping process in which each observation fixes a coordina te on a multi-dimensional symptom map. The overall map so derived yields a pa ttern that enables the physician to differentiate the syndrome. The four examinations (\" wang wen wen qie \" ) consists of : 1. inspection or visual observation (wang ) 2. listening and olfaction (wen ) 3. inquiry (wen ) 4. pulse-taking and palpation (qie ). Inspection (Visual Observation) Inspection means observing the patient's face, tongue, the colour of his skin, the glow (\"spirit\") in his eye, his gait a nd his posture. Inspection alone tells as 126 much as half of the diagnostic inputs to the experienced physician who can often do a fairly accurate diagnosis based only on inspection. The patient's face is observed in detail for such manifestations as the colour of the skin, the presence or absence of a healthy glow, the spirit in his eyes (whether full of life, dispirited, filled w ith anger or sadness, etc), and the presence of unusual growths or pigmentation of the skin. The patient's manner of walking is also observed as he walks into the phys ician's clinic, and anyt hing unusual in his posture and gait is noted. His whole body is also examined if the physician felt that was necessary. The examination of the tongue is an ex tremely important part of the visual observation. Several aspects of the tongue are noted: its size (whether thin and withered, or swollen with tooth indentations, or normal), its colour and, very significantly, the texture and the colour of the fur on the tongue. A slightly red tongue is normal but a deeper red could indicate internal heat, whilst a dark tongue with a purplish hue is often associated with poor blood circulation and blood stasis. A person of normal heal th would have thin whiti sh fur on the tongue. Thick greasy furs indicates presence of dampness, while unusually thin fur, or no fur at all, may im ply the presence of yin deficiency resulting in asthenic internal heat. Thick yellowish fur is usually associated with intern al heat of resulting from an excess syndrome. Listening and Olfaction Listening and olfaction provides additi onal information -- the voice of the patient, any unusual odour he emits, and the sound of hi s breathing (being clearly discernible if he is sufferin g from retained phlegm in hi s bronchioles, a sore throat, or an asthmatic condition.) The physician listens to th e patient's voice to determ ine if it is weak or strong, smooth or hoarse, clear or slurred. His manner of brea thing, whether slow or hurried, smooth or labored, shallow or deep, and the presence of cough are all noted. The power of his voice is an in dicator of the level of his pectoral qi. 127 Inquiry Inquiry can be a fairly long process, la sting for over half an hour for a new patient. For the first visit to a physician, the patient sh ould be asked a long list of questions concerning his past medical history, bowel movements, urination, appetite, sleep, adaptability to hot and cold environments, aversi on to wind, sexual activities, eyesight and moods. The patient is also asked to describe how he feels, and the main medical complaint that led him to consult the physician. An experienced physicia n can ask searching and pe netrating questions that allow him to accurately narrow down th e range of conditions with which the patient might be afflicted. In a sense, the inquiry part of the four ex aminations is the most challenging but re warding one as a tremendous amount of information can be extracted from this process. Some modern Western doctors, who rely heavily on laboratory diagnostic tests and spend less time understanding how the patient feels, could be missing crucial information that can help the doctor determine the patient's condition. Pulse-taking and palpation Finally, pulse-taking or feeling the pulse reveals further information about the inner condition of his body. TCM differentiates betw een dozens of different pulses, determined by placin g three fingers on the patient's wrist (left and right in turn). Information is also obtained by pa lpation, or tapping on different parts of the body, for example the abdomen, to de tect accumulations of gas or liquid. There is a popular belief that a good Chinese ph ysician can know everything about a patient, including the detection of early pregnancy, by taking the patient's pulse. There ar e even stories of physicians who took pulses by tying a string to their wrists and detecting puls e through the string without touching the patient, then go on to make an accurate diagnosis of the patient's condition. Legend has it that the empress and concub ines of a Chinese em peror could not be physically touched by the royal physician who therefore had to rely on this unusually discreet method of pulse-taking. 128 It is true that experienced physicians often make quite accurate judgments of the patient's syndromes through pulse-taki ng, but the reality is that by the time he takes the pulse he has done some of th e inspection and listening/olfaction of the 4 examinations. The ordina ry physician would treat puls e-taking as just another dimension of information to be added to the other three. Although an important indicator, it need not be the most crucial one; neither is it normally sufficient to allow the physician to determine accurately the syndromes present in the patient. Nevertheless it cannot be denied that pulse-taking is a crucial part of the examination process for a patient. Pulses are classified into more than 20 categories taking in to account texture, depth (how hard one needs to press with the fingers to feel it), and the perceived waveform. Some of the common pulses en countered in clinical practice and their usual indications are listed in th e Annexure to this chapter. Therapeutic Methods After a diagnosis is made and the sy ndromes differentiated, therapy, the second part of bianzhenglunzhi is applied. The principle involved is simple: treat a condition with opposing and balancing force, for example: When there is heat, use cooling methods. When there is cold, use warming methods. When there is deficiency, tonify. When there is excess, purge. When there is impediment to flow qi, promote the flow of qi. When there is blood stasis, \"liven\" the blood flow and resolve the stasis. When there is dampness, use diuresis and/or drying methods. When there is wind, calm and extinguish it. When there is phlegm, resolve it. The application of therapeutic methods is mainly by the use of herbs, acupuncture and medical massage ( tuina ); they can each be used singly or in combination. The last method, tuina , may be used in place of acupuncture for 129 patients (like children and the elderly) wh o cannot take acupunct ure or in place of herbs for those who cannot tolerate the side effects of some herbs.148 The Chinese pharmacopeia comprises thousands of materials of natural origin, inclusive of plant parts, minerals and animals part (c ollectively known as materia medica or simply \"herbs\"). There are also hundreds of complex formulations of these herbs to achieve th erapeutic effects like cooling, warming, purging and tonification. For example, a patient who is diagnosed with the syndrome of a deficiency in kidney yang can be given yang tonics for the kidney such as cordyceps and lurong (deer horn). Heat syndrom es can be cleared with a wide variety of herbs. The choice of herbs must take into account their effectiveness for heat in particular parts of the body: for example, shigao (gypsum) and huangqin (radix scutellariae ) are commonly used for internal heat in the lung, mudanpi (the bark of the peony pl ant) for heat in the blood; bohe (peppermint) and juhua (chrysanthemum tea) for expel ling heat at the superficies. The proper use of herbs and herbal formulations is a large subject that incorporates several thousands of years of clinical experience and experimentation with their use. The theory of using of herb s and herbal formulations is an essential part of TCM theory, drawing on concepts fr om the other models like the meridian and organs systems, the 8 rubrics, and the characteristics of entities like qi, blood, jinye (body fluids), dampness and wind. (T he TCM theory of herbs is further described in the Annexure to this chapter.) The model of the five elements can be used to give th e physician a wider repertoire of therapeutic options. If ther e is deficiency in on e organ, the physician can choose to tonify the mother organ, as we observed earlier in the case of tonifying the spleen to streng then the lung that suffers fr om a deficiency syndrome. For example, if lung qi is in a state of deficiency, a tonic for the spleen- qi is deemed an effective remedy. 148 Qigong therapy, involving meditation and breathing exercises, is used in some circumstances, although some forms of qigong are shrouded in mystique and have possible spiritual or psychiatric dimensions. Most TCM physician do not practise it. 130 5.3 Epistemological Issues in TCM Models As components of a scient ific theory, TCM models mu st be able to explain physiological phenomena and the causes of illnesses. Th ey must also be applicable to the diagnosis of illnesses and to the ther apeutic methods used. They should be capable of making predictions that can be tested by experiments. Preferably there should also be descriptio ns of the underlying physical nature of TCM entities and how they can be de tected, identified and measured. The last point was addre ssed earlier in Chapters 3 and 4 on TCM entities, and organ and meridian systems. I suggested that some TCM entities are abstractions of underlying bi ochemical entities and proce sses, in effect theoretical constructs to fit TCM models of explanation and prediction. Qi, for example, is a generic term that can be a substance or a driving force for most physiological processes in the body, depending on th e context of use. Some meanings of qi such air or breath can be identified and measured. The qi of an organ represents the ability of that organ to carry out its functions, as in spleen- qi for the digestive function. In principle, measures of the adequacy and level of spleen- qi can be devised based on biomedical indicators of how well the body is absorbing and converting nutrients to nourish the body. Organs in TCM are clusters of functions and not necessarily identified with particul ar somatic structures. As abstractions, many TCM entities like jing (essence) would not appear to lend themselves to detection and measurement, but their biom edical correlates, like a sonorous voice for strong pectoral- qi, could serve th at purpose. Historically, TCM theory evolved la rgely from the belief that the human body is a microcosm of the universe; hence the search for truth in medicine should start from cosmology. Th is appears to have be en the case with the yin-yang concept and the five-element model. In the case of the five-element model, Needham notes that it goes back to between 350 and 270 BC, to the time of the philosopher Tsou Yen, whom Needham regard s as the \"real founder of all Chinese 131 scientific thought\", although similar ideas had been in circulation for a hundred years or so before him. The Shih Chi (Book of History ) records that Tsou Yen despaired over rulers becoming dissolute an d lacking in virtue, and sought wisdom in the writing of the great sage s. He invoked the cycles of yin and yang to classify natural phenomena and proposed the idea of the Five Powers (Virtues) that guide the course of history. Changes in histor y would be viewed as manifestations of changes at the lower inorganic levels of fire, wood, earth, water and earth. Every ruling house reigned only by virtue of one of the elements of the series. Lloyd and Sivin point out that while the five elements show some superficial similarity to the four elemen ts of Aristotle, there are really no counterparts in ancient Greek medicine. In their view, the te rm \"five elements\" originated in the sphere of morality and be came part of cosmological thought only in 240AD. 149 In the Han dynasty (206BC-220A D), the five elements gradually came to be associated with every conceivable category -- five grains, five senses, five seasons (with the additi on of the peak summer month) and, for physicians, the five zang -organs and their relationship to human emotions. The historical origins of Chinese medi cal beliefs as contained in classics like the Neijing and the Treatise on Febrile Diseases should be of interest primarily to the medical anth ropologist, but is often used by detractors to attack TCM theory. This was one of the main points of the criticism in the 1920s and 1930s following the May 4th Movement of 1919. The validity of models deri ved from or inspired by an cient beliefs should be assessed by the methods of science and not by the antiquity of their origins. The fact that the bear is a powe rful animal may have influen ced the choice of the bile of bears, rather than rabbit s, to be used as medicine for the relief of high fevers. 150 There were, however, other strong animals av ailable, like the wild boar, tigers and elephants. The Chinese pharmacopeia's se ttling for bear bile for certain types of 149 Lloyd and Sivin (2002), 259 150 This point was used by Fang (2007), a trained biochemist and a rabid critic of Chinese medicine, as a ground for concluding that Chinese medical theory and practice are superstitions. 132 fevers would be based on it s perceived efficacy learned from clinical experience, after having tried out secretions from ot her animal sources. Animal parts are regularly used in folk medicine but most are not accepted in the Chinese pharmacopeia. For example, sorghum wine with a tiger penis im mersed in it to enhance male potenc y does not appear in the Ch inese pharmacopeia, no doubt because of its failure to deliver results. Unfortunately the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its bone and other body parts deemed by superstition and folk medicine to have medicinal value. Such beliefs have no place in TCM and do little for its scientific image. Regardless of their orig ins, the models of TCM derived from cosmology, folklore or plain superstition were over ti me subjected to test through the clinical work of physicians. They would have been refined, amended and expanded to best fit clinical experience. Hence the prevailing ideology in TCM is that empirical observation should be the ultima te guide for medical theory. In this sense, TCM is evidence-based medicine in basic if rudimentary form. As a young medical anthropologist re searching in Guangzhou in 1982, Judith Farquhar innocuously asked how doctors knew which medical explanation was correct, and was cryptically told: \"We take experience ( jingyan ) main guide and practice ( shijian ) to be the main thing.\"151 Such a response is in accord with the current pragmatic empiricism governing Chinese political and economi c ideology, captured in the dictum: \" Gain truth from the facts \" (shishi qiu shi ). Deng Xiaoping, who la unched the Chinese economic transformation from socialist central pl anning to a market ec onomy in 1978, was the prime proponent of this philosophy. Hi s oft-quoted remark made during a state visit to Texas, \"It does not matter if a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice,\" has obvious implications for medica l scientists obsessed with ontological issues of TCM entities and epistemic cr edentials of TCM models. In medical practice as least, the truth is what works. 151 Farquhar (1994), 1 133 Heuristic Models TCM practice uses heuristic empirical models which are the results of attempts to arrive at useful framewor ks for explanation and prediction that translate into diagnosis and therapy. Diagnosis of symptoms allows them to be classified under patterns of illness or synd romes. Therapeutic methods predict that the administration of appropriate herb s and other therapeutic procedure like acupuncture and tuina would bring about relief from these symptoms. The models are heuristic in the sense of being design ed to best fit empirical experience. This is analogous to curve-fi tting, drawing the best straight or curved line through a set of observat ions plotted on a two-dime nsional graph. After the curve is drawn, one finds a mathematical formula to best describe the curve over a relevant range. The formula could be as si mple as a straight li ne a+bx, a quadratic function a+ bx+cx2, or one of an infinite numbe r of other more complicated functions. The starting curve fit is often a straight line; a more sophisticated one could involve exponential, logarithmic and more comp lex functions with boundary conditions. TCM models are like straig ht lines, often crude and lacking in accuracy but modified and refined over time to better fit clinical situations encountered over the history of Chinese medicine. The analogy of the black box in cybernetics may also be appropriate. Observers cannot see what is in the bo x but are able to measure its external manifestations. By measuring inputs an d outputs, one makes conjectures about what is in the box and tries to find the mathematical equation that best relates output to input.152 Some orthodox Chinese medical thinke rs do not necessari ly subscribe to this empiricist view of TCM models, believ ing that the ancients had divine visions and were able to relate cosmological models to th ose of the human body. An important part of the working of these visions was the ability, through 152 Huang (1995) 18-21 discusses this analogy in some depth. 134 introspection, to gain understanding of the inner workings of one's body.153 There is no reason to believe that introspectio n has such epistemic powers, or that the ancients had special insights other than those gained by ordinary mortals using reasoning and conjecture and appealing to the weight of clinical evidence from medical practice. Admittedl y, a large proportion of pr actising TCM physicians is orthodox; most of them may not agree with my view of the heuristic nature of TCM models. Summary The model of therapy based on sy ndrome differentiation classifies constellations of symptoms into categori es of excess, deficiency, heat, cool, obstructed flow and into sub-categories depending on the locus of the pathology (for example, \" yin deficiency of the kidney\"). Such classifications allow illness patterns, or syndromes, to be identified by diagnosis. Therapeutic methods are then applied in accordance with the syndromes thus di fferentiated, for example applying cooling methods to heat synd romes and tonification for deficiency syndromes. That these therapeutic models are testab le, and indeed should be tested if TCM is to make scientific claims, is the subject of the next chapter. 153 See Liu Lihong (2003), 14-16 135 Annexure A.

Theory of Herbs Chinese Materia Medica (\"herbs\") Medicinal herbs have been used in Chinese medical practice for health promotion and treatment of illnesses for th ousands of years. The properties and nature of these herbs and their therapeuti c effects have been carefully studied and documented by over a hundred generations of herbalists and physicians. The earliest extant manual on herbs was written by the legendary Shen Nong of the Western Han dynasty (201BC-AD24) in the classic Shennong Herbal Manual ( ). This contained detailed descriptions of 365 herbs which he came 136 across in his travels over fields and mountai ns all over the coun try. Shen Nong personally tested these herbs on himself for toxicity and side effects at considerable risk to his life and health. During the Ming dynasty in 1578, the most comprehensive record of Chinese herbs to date was compiled, which has since then served as a reference text by Ch inese physicians and pharmacists. The Compendium bencao gangmu ( ) covered 1892 herbs (inclusive of those of animal and mi neral origins). The encyclopedic nature of these scholarly works testifies to the empirical scientific tradition in Chinese medicine which relies on clinical evid ence provided by deta iled observation, record and analysis. In modern times, most of these herbs have been analysed in the laboratory and in clinical trials for therapeutic prop erties, toxicity and side effects and the accumulation of these studies and the experience of earlier generations of physicians have been carefully documented in modern texts on Chinese medicinal herbs. Much work remains to be done as the variety of herbs is very large and their complexity of a much higher order of magnitude as a sing le herb typically contains dozens and sometimes over a hund red different ingredients and molecules in contrast to Western drugs that mainly comprise a single eff ective chemical (the \"active ingredient\") for each drug. Classification of herbs Herbs can be classified according to their natural characteristics, or according to their therapeutic effects. Classification by na tural characteristics The natural characteristics of herbs include their properties, flavours and meridian tropism , the latter being an indication of the meridians along which the herb's therapeutic ef fects prefer to travel. The property of a herb refers to its warming or cooling effect on the body. More specifically, herbs are classified a ccording to hot, warm, neutral, cool and 137 cold. As indicated in the last chapter, these warm and cool properties do not refer to their temperature but the effect on pathogenic heat and cold. Thus peppermint and chrysanthemum are cool, whilst cinnam on and ginseng are warm. Herbs that are hot have stronger effects than warm herbs and can have more serious side effects like internal heat if taken in excess. Examples are Fu Zi and dried ginger. Conversely, herbs that ar e cold like gypsum and Mu Dan Pi (made from the root of the peony plant) are used to remove intern al heat, but can have the side effects of harming the stomach and spleen if inappropriately used. The flavour of a herb is akin to its taste, except that in Chinese medicine certain actions are associated with the fl avour classification, hence there is not always an exact corresponden ce between flavour and taste. The five flavours are ), sweet ( ) and their common actions are shown below: Flavour Action E x a m p l e Pungent Dispersing and promoting circulation of qi and blood Bo He (herba mentha) Sweet Nourishing, harmonizing and moistening ginseng Sour Absorbing, consolidating and astringent action Wu Mei (dried plums) Bitter drying or resolving dampness, purging Da Huang Salty Softening hard nodes or masses and promoting defecation Mang Xiao Each herb is thought to have one or more preferential routes along the meridians for their actions to affect specific orga ns. Chrysanthemum and wolfberry seeds both prefer the liver meridian, and are often used in therapies involving the liver; they also have a preference for the lung meridian and are used in some cough medications. Classification by therapeutic effect Herbs are also classified according to their principal therapeutic effects. Some of the main classifications are listed below. 1. Diaphoretics : removing either warm or cold pathogens at the surface (exterior) level 138 2. Heat-Clearing : clearing internal heat 3. Purgatives : lubricating the last intestine or inducing diarrhea to move bowels and relieve constipation 4. Removing Dampness : eliminating dampness within the body and promoting diuresis 5. Warming Interior : warms interior of body and dispels cold 6. Regulating Qi : promoting the movement of qi. 7. Relieving Food Retention : helps in digestion and relieves food retention 8. Hemostatic Herbs : these assist in stopping bleeding internally and externally, be cooling the blood, warming the channels, or astringent action 9. Invigorating Blood and Removing Stasis : promotes better blood flow and removing stasis 10. Resolving Phlegm : removing phlegm in your body 11. Tranquilizers : calms the mind 12. Calming liver and wind : calming the liver and suppressing hyperactive yang, or calming liver-wind 13. Tonics - tonics for qi, blood, yin and yang 14. Astringents : arresting discharge of, such a excessive perspiration, diarrhea and excessive urination Although a herb may be cl assified accordi ng to its main action, most herbs have several other actions. This is be cause a herb contain a large variety of components and molecules, and its action cannot be captured by just one classification. For example, wolfberry seeds or Gou Qi Zi ( ) has the main therapeutic effect of tonifying the yin of the liver and kidney; it also improves the eyesight and nourishes the lung. Medical Formulations Fang ji ( ) is the TCM term for a medical formulation or prescription. The word fang means method; in ordinary language, youfang 139 means having the right method, or the correct approach, to a problem. Ji means medicine; hence fangji denotes medicine formulated by a good method, i.e. a good prescription. Chinese physicians have found over the years that herbs ca n be combined in a certain way to achieve th e best desired result; much like a cocktail has a combination of ingredients to yield the best taste, or a food recipe to give us an appetizing and nutritious dish. Unlike west ern medicine, Chinese prescriptions are customized for the individual, taking into account the type and severity of his syndromes as well as his const itution and state of health. However, Chinese medicine has over thou sands of years also developed a large number of standard prescriptions that ca n be used for patients falling within a category of syndromes. In practice, thes e standard or classi cal prescriptions can and often are modified by the physician to suit the individual. The standard prescriptions are classified by therapeu tic effect, similar to the way herbs are classified. Because the prescriptions cont ain several herbs each playing a different role, a better result is usually obtained th an by using just one herb. This is in contrast to Western drugs, which generally contain one active chemical ingredient with other ingredients only providing a base for the delivery of that active ingredient; to deal with co-m orbidities, a number of drugs would be taken together. The general principle for combining herbs in Chinese medicine is based on one of four possible roles that each herb can play, namely the monarch, ministerial, adjuvant and guiding roles, known as jun , chen , zuo , shi respectively. 1. The Monarch or jun herb plays the core therapeutic role 2. The Ministerial or chen herb enhances the latter's effect 3. The Adjuvant or zuo herb plays a complementary role, supporting the monarch herb by working on a related concomitant condition, or reducing toxicities and side effects, if any, of the monarch and ministerial herbs. 140 4. The guiding or shi herb helps direct the other herbs to the particular organs and harmonizes their joint action. For example the classical prescription called The Decoction of the Four Nobles Herbs sijunzi tang contains ginseng (monarch herb), Bai Zhu (minister herb), Fu Ling (adjuvant herb) and Zhi Gan Cao (guiding herb). A common tonic for the spleen and stomach, this prescription replenishes qi and strength ens the spleen. It takes into account that spleen problems usually are accomp anied by dampness. In this prescription, ginseng is a strong qi tonic, Bai Zhu is also a qi tonic that enha nces ginseng's qi-replenishing action, whilst Fu Ling both adds to the qi tonic effect and removes dampness. Zhi Gan Cao harmonizes the combination; it is also in itself a mild qi and spleen tonic. Not every prescription has herbs playing all the four roles in combination. Many prescriptions ha ve two or more herbs playing same role. For example the classic prescription \"Pill of Six Ingredients with Rehmanniae\" or liuweidihuang wan, a popular yin tonic for nourishing the kidney, comprises one monarch herb (rehmannie or Shu Di Huang ), two ministerial herbs ( Shan Zhu Yu and S han Yao ) and three adjuvant herbs ( Ze Xie, Mu Dan Pi and Fu Ling ). The monarch herb is a strong kidney tonic, whilst the two ministerial herbs also nourish the kidney with Shan Yao also strengthening the spleen to co mplement the kidney function. The three adjuvant herbs play varying roles of reducing dampness, clearing heat arising from yin deficiency of the kidney and improving the transportation and transformation function of the spleen. In combination, they t onify the kidney and spleen as well as dissipate internal heat in a balanced and gentle manner, making it one of the most successful prescriptions in the history of Chinese medicine, used equally by physicians treating illnesses as well as the commo n man as a dietary supplement to combat the weakening of the kidney functions that come with ageing and with daily stresses. To customize a prescription, physicia ns often use one of the standard formulations and modify it to suit the individual's pa rticular condition. For 141 example, liuweidihuang wan can be modified for so meone with kidney yang deficiency by adding warm herbs like Gui Zhi (cinnamon) and Fu Zi. If, in addition he wishes to boost the patient's qi level, he could choose to add some Huang Qi (astragalus) and Xi Yang Shen (America ginseng). As each standard prescription is targ eted at a particular syndrome, patients with several syndromes coul d have several standard prescriptions combined into one, with suitable adjustments to avoid duplication of herbs that are used in common by the different prescriptions, as well as modifications that reflect which syndrome is being treated as priority with larger amounts of the ingredients aimed at that syndrome, and which others are being treated more gently with smaller quantities of the relevant herbs. Thus the formulation of a prescription for a particular patient at a given time requires judgment and experience and, in a sense, is both a science and art, in so me respects like a culinary recipe. 142 6. Evidence for TCM Theory Evidence for TCM theory can broadly be divided into two categories: (a) evidence for the existence of TCM entities and the dete ction/measurement of their properties; (b) evidence for the useful ness and efficacy of TCM diagnostic and therapeutic methods. With regard to the first category, I have argued that TCM entities are a motley collection of observable bioche mical substances li ke blood and body fluids as well as abstractions and theoretical constructs ( qi, jing, wind, organs, meridians etc) representing underlying biochemica l entities and processes to fit TCM heuristic models. Viewed in this way, seeking direct evidence for the existence of a TCM entity is not a sensible enterprise. The second category, evidence for TCM models in explanation and prediction, should be the core of any en quiry into the scientific usefulness and validity of TCM theory. TCM does not pr ovide explanations in the reductionist terms of biomedical science. It does not explain the behaviour of such entities as qi and phlegm using knowledge in molecula r biology; nor does it reduce these to those found in the physical sciences, not withstanding various innovative if bizarre efforts to do so; for example, the attempt by some modern physicists to interpret entities like qi in terms of quantum theory.154 TCM models do attempt to provide ex planations for illnesses and their progression into various syndromes, an d prescribe treatment according to syndrome diagnosis. These treatments are in principle testable and should form the focus of investigations into the validity of TCM models. Before discussing method s of finding evidence for the TCM models of therapy, it is necessary first to dispose of the contention that TCM is a different 154 for example, Lo (2004) 143 Kuhnian paradigm from Western biomed icine and therefor e should not be subjected to the same testing met hods of evidence-based medicine. 6.1 TCM as evidence-based medicine Some researchers express the view that the nature of TCM does not lend itself to the testing methods of evidence-based medicine. In a 2006 British Medical Journal paper, Tang treats Chinese and Western medicines as two different Kuhn ian \"paradigms\" between which \"incommensurability\" arises. Fo r example, Tang points out that hypertension is manifested as a symptom pr esent in several different syndromes in TCM, whereas Western medicine treats it like a disease.155 Among the TCM syndromes that can exhibit hypertension are the \"exuberance of the yang of the liver\" (cited by Tang), \"stagnation of liver- qi\", and the presence of phlegm in internal organs. Tang seems to argue that the two systems of medicine look at hypertension differently because they belong to separate paradigms. Tang does not use the term \"paradigm\" as exemplars in the manner prescribed by the later Kuhn (1977). If, more correctly, we use Kuhn's later preferred terminology, the two systems of medicine each contains its own paradigms (exemplars), and indeed may share some paradigms in common. For example, most TCM researchers today shar e with their Western counterparts the paradigm of evidence-based medicine to va lidate the efficacy of treatments. They also recognize the existence of microbio logical agents, cells, blood components and endocrinal secretions and, while un able always to relate these to TCM concepts, accept that the reductionist appr oach to disease causa tion and therapy is one path towards healing. Viewed in this light, paradigms of the two systems of medicine are not all incommensu rable in the sense of Kuhn. 155 Tang (2006). Western medicine usually refers to hypertension as a \"condition\" (for example associated with diabetes). See, for example, Tabers Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary entry on \"Hypertension\". 144 Granted that TCM healing focuses on syndromes exhibited by a patient rather than on disease and that the differ entiation of syndromes is distinctive to Chinese medicine and not used in West ern medicine, should it follow that TCM methods are absolved from clinical tests to establish their useful ness and validity? The only escape from evidence-based medici ne is to take the view that evidence- based medicine is itself a Western paradi gm and not a traditio nal Chinese one, and therefore not applicable to truth in Chines e medicine. Such an ideological position is tantamount to rejecting the conventional wisdom among modern scientists that the scientific experiment is, as Krauss puts it, \"the ultimate arbi ter of truth\" about the world.156 The counter argument that Tang might adduce is that science itself cannot prove the propos ition that all truths about th e world should be established by its methods -- That is, the theory about science as the only path to truth is not capable of proof by experimentation. (A similar popular argument has sometimes been advanced against Popper's falsifiabili ty criterion for scientific theory.) Truth in Chinese medicine, the ancient thinkers believed and traditionalists accept, can also be obtained by introspect ion or what one coul d term \"spiritual discernment\". 157 Acceptance of either the scie ntific method or the spiritual discernment alternative each requires a leap of faith. Interestingly, in advocating a more pluralistic view of the avenues to truth, the distinguished medical anthropologist Arthur Kleinman postul ates that monotheism in the Western tradition has had a determinative effect on biomedicine: the idea of a single god legitimates the idea of a single unde rlying truth and dest roys tolerance for alternative paradigms.158 The claim that only the reductionist methods of biomedicine can explain disease and its cure is one consequence of this mindset. While recognizing that Tang's ideol ogical position of Chinese and Western medicine belonging to two incommensurabl e paradigms has a si gnificant scholarly following, I have a different objective, that of ascertaini ng how TCM can be understood by modern science an d, if it wishes to gain acceptance by scientists of 156 Krauss (2012) A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing. 157 See for example Liu Lihong (2003) whose views were summarized in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. 158 Kleinman (1995) Writing at the Margin: Discourse between anthropology and medicine. 145 some its therapies, how the methods of ev idence-based medicine may be applied to it. This line of argument, while it would appeal to a large number of TCM researchers who are well-versed in mode rn science and but not willing grant it exclusive access to truth, cannot in any way help West ern science understand and accept those parts of TCM, if any, that can be shown to be efficacious by outcome measures of clinical trials. It is therefore more useful and re levant to keep our focus on how TCM therapies can be subjected to the testi ng methods of evidence-based medicine. 6.2 Clinical trials on TCM therapies The key model to test is that of ther apy based on syndrome differentiation, from which hypotheses concerning appropriat e therapies to be applied are derived and testable by the hypot hetico-deductive method. It is first necessary to differentiate be tween two kinds of c linical trials for therapies that have been attributed to Chinese medicine: a. Clinical trials on herbs or combinat ions of herbs for specific (Western) diseases, and of acupuncture for relief of pain or specific symptoms like pain and dizziness. Examples are the use of the herb danshen (salvia miltiorrhiza ) for ischemic coronary hear t disease and acupuncture at points on the head, face and hands for migraine headaches. b. Clinical trials on the use of he rbs and herbal formulations, or acupuncture points, for treating TC M syndromes. Exam ples would be the use of liuwei dihuang wan for treatment of the syndrome of deficiency in kidney yin, and a combination of acupuncture points along 146 the spleen stomach meridians to tr eat syndromes of weakness in spleen- qi and dampness in the spleen. a) Clinical trials on Western herbal medicine and Western acupuncture The first category is best viewed as tr ials of Western medicine methods of therapy using materials and techniques borrowed from Chinese medical sources. These trials are part of th e process of developing new drugs from Chinese sources and in the validation of acupuncture pr ocedures for therapeutic purposes. Traditionally, drugs in the West we re discovered by identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies and occasionally by serendipitous discovery.159 With advances in the knowledge of disease and infection at the molecular levels, scientists now more commonly try to find compounds that specifically modulate those molecules and thereby design new drugs. These processes of drug discovery , whether by traditional methods or by modern methods of design, involve the iden tification of candidates and their characterization, screening, and assays for therapeuti c efficacy. Once a substance has shown its value in these tests, the process of drug development proceeds to clinical trials. Chinese herbal medicatio ns provide a potentially rich source of drug discovery from traditional natural sources. Clinical trials on herb al medications have been carried out mainly by Western researchers in Europe, North Am erica and Australia, and increasingly in China as well. These trials are done on the raw herbs as well as ex tracts. They typically follow the protocol and meet to varying extents the standards of rigour for evidence-based medicine. Most of them use randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and treat a Chinese he rb, or a prescription consisting of a number of herbs, like a Western drug or a cocktail of drugs. 159 Serendipitous discovery occurs when one finds a cure for a disease while looking for a cure for another. See, for example, Ban TA (2006), 335-44. 147 Such trials should be viewed as testin g the efficacy of Chinese herbs used like Western drugs to relieve symptoms or tr eat disease. In mo re advanced stages of drug discovery, chemical constituents of the herbs are found that have the desired therapeutic effect. These are then are extracted and made into the active ingredients for regular Western drugs (or synthesized so that the herb is redundant). Examples are Ginko bilova , an extract of the ginko leaf, now prescribed by Western doctors for impr oving blood circulatio n in the brain, and Crataegutt , an extract of Hawthorne leaves and flowers, used as a vaso dilator for patients with coronary heart (such as aspirin and digita lis). Both were de veloped in German pharmaceutical laboratories. Of course many Western remedies like aspirin and digitalis also come from natural sources other than those of Chinese medicine.) Trials of such Chinese herbal medications and their subsequent development and adoption as Western dr ugs lend credence to the notion that Chinese herbs have medicinal value, but such trials do not in themselves directly validate TCM theory . The drugs discovered in this way make a contribution to the pharmaceutical industry's role of provid ing new and better modern drugs. But they do not endorse the practice of Chin ese medicine any more than the use of quinine, an extract of a bark used by Sout h American natives to treat malaria, is a validation of South American native medi cal theory. For c onvenience we term drugs developed by pharmaceutical firms using herbs or herb extracts for the treatment of specific diseases or symptoms as parts of \" Western herbal medicine\" . Likewise, trials on acupuncture points for symptomatic relief of pain and dizziness are validations of \" Western acupuncture\" . Where these tr ials suggest the efficacy of these acupuncture methods, bi omedical explanations are usually sought by researchers of physiological resp onses of the body to needling.160 T h e s e explanations do not necessarily support or even relate to the TCM meridian system that forms the basis of the selection of TCM acupuncture points for treatment of specific conditions. To test TCM acupunctu re theory, one needs to investigate if it produces better results than Western acupuncture not based on the Chinese 160 See, for example, various papers in the volume by Ernst and White (1999). 148 meridian system, or is better than \"sha m acupuncture\" (when needles are inserted in the wrong places or only appear to the patient to be inserted). b) Clinical Trials on TCM tr eatment of TCM syndromes The second category of clinical trials tests hypotheses on TCM methods of treatment based on the differentiation of syndromes. Such trials have yet to be carried out to any significant ex tent. I propose below how th ey may be carried out using the classical hypothetico-dedu ctive method using two examples. Example 1 : Patients with a cons tellation of symptoms P are diagnosed with syndrome S and are treated by therapy method T which TC M sees as correct given its principle of syndrome different iation and corresponding treatment. Main Hypothesis : Syndrome S can be tr eated by use of therapy method T Initial condition: The patient exhibits the set of symptoms P Initial condition: Syndrome S is identified (\"differentiated\") through TCM diagnosis of symptoms P _________________ _____________________ _________________ Observational prediction : Applying therapy T results in a reduction in the symptoms P in the patient An example of syndrome S woul d be deficiency of kidney yin which is identified (differentiated) by a physicia n as a constellation of symptoms that includes aching and weakness of the loin s and knees, dizziness and tinnitus, night sweats, dry mouth and throat, afternoon fl ush in the cheeks, insomnia, thin rapid 149 pulse, red tongue with little fur.161 A tonic pill like liuwei dihuang wan (\"pill of six ingredients with rehmanniae \") is used for two weeks on a randomized sample of patients, with a control group offered placebo pills of the same appearance and similar taste. If there is a significant difference in the improvement of the symptoms of the first group compared to those of the second, the main hypothesis is confirmed. Example 2 : The five-element model is used together with the method of syndrome differentiation and treatment for patients with a constellation of symptoms P Main hypothesis : Syndrome S in organ C can be treated by use of tonic therapy T for the mother organ M Auxiliary hypothesis: Tonic for the mother organ helps the child organ (applying the fi ve-element model) Initial condition: The patient exhibits symptoms P Initial condition: Symptoms P are differentiated as syndrome S in organ C Observational prediction : Applying therapy T to the mother organ M heals syndrome S in the child organ C Syndrome S could be deficiency in lung- qi differentiated by the method of the four examinations. The prescribed therapy T consis ts of treating the mother organ M (spleen) with a spleen- qi tonic such as \"The decoction of the four noble herbs \" (sijunzi tang ). The two examples above co uld then, in principle, be the subjects of double- blind RCTs. Patients and physicians employed to conduct syndrome differentiation would be bli nded with regard to which patients received the 161 See for example Wang (2001), 234 150 treatment T and which receive a plac ebo. There are however potential methodological challenges in conducting such trials. 1. Syndromes are in a dynamic state, hence for practical purposes clinical trials should be limited to those sy ndromes that are relatively stable and that do not change without intervention within the duration of the trial. For example, deficiency of kidney yin tends to be chronic and come with ageing and prolonged st ress; prolonged damaged kidney yin also frequently occurs for patients who have recovered from severe fevers and infections, or have received strong Western treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. TCM treatments that claim to be able to resolve this condition may take many weeks or months, hence these cases would be suitable for RCTs carried out over a relatively long trial periods. But there ar e also cases of kidney yin being damaged with inadequate sleep and st ress. Most of these are claimed by TCM to resolve within a week or two with suitable medication, hence a RCT spread over about a week would be an appropriate test for this TCM claim. An appropriate refinement of the clinical trials would employ samples of people that belong to the first category (chron ic cases) or the other (shorter-term cases), but not a mixture of the two. This would naturally reduce the sample sizes available 2. Patients often have more than one syndrome present. For example, patients with kidney yang deficiency may also have weakness in spleen- qi. Some of the ingredients commonly used in prescriptions for kidney yang deficiency have the side effect of further weakening spleen- qi. For such patients, the physician would us ually modify the prescription to mitigate the side effect, but this mi ght result in a diminution in the effectiveness of the prescription for kidney yang . This could not be done in a clinical trial for a single medication and certainly could not be done if the physician were blinded and eith er could not detect the side effect 151 to administer the modified prescrip tion, or detected it and became \"unblinded\". 3. The physician's diagnosis based on \"t he four examinations\" described in the last chapter is the standard met hod for determining the presence of a syndrome. This is subject to human error and erroneous judgment as the complex mixture of symptoms when there is more than one syndrome present can make different iation of syndromes trickier and require more highly-skilled and expe rienced physicians. When multiple syndromes are present, the physicia n sees a basket of symp toms from which he has to sort out several constellations, ea ch corresponding to a syndrome. With many of the syndromes having one or more symptoms in common, like a rapid pulse or a pale ton gue, there may be more than one permutation of syndromes to produc e the same basket of symptoms. (The complex basket of symptoms could be mu ltiply-realized at the level of underlying synd romes.) Sometimes the symptoms are hard to determine, for example the colour of the face and tongue, which are already different across individuals in healthy states: a pale face may be healthy for one with a fa ir complexion but sickly for one with a ruddy complexion. Hence, it is possible for experienced physicians to disagree on the syndromes when they observ e the same symptoms. A similar situation exists with the diagnosis of , for example, clinical depression in Western psychiatry. A patient is deem ed to have depression if he has more than an arbitrarily-fixed number of symptoms. In practice, psychiatrists can differ on the diagnosis after observing the same patient, even if there was no disagreement on the symptoms observed, and divergence of opinion was only on the interpretation of the symptoms. But such situations are much less co mmon in Western medicine than in TCM. 162 162 For animal studies in which the application of the four examinations is not feasible, Lu, Liu and Ding (2009: 501-505) propose the method of determining the presence of a syndrome by observing the animal 152 These methodological problems are not peculiar to TCM, but tend to be more troublesome with TCM therapies. Clinical trials for Western medical treatments also face problems of unstable disease symptoms and multiple diseases in the same person, but the problems are more challenging for TCM clinical trials because TCM syndromes are of a more dynamic nature, generally changing at a faster rate than conditions classified as diseases in Western medicine. It should be noted that when we sp eak of TCM syndromes being of a more dynamic nature, we refer to the syndromes as differentiated (identified) by the methods of TCM diagnosis for which a pa rticular constellation of symptoms defines the syndrome. Henc e perceived dynamism is a matter of observation of changing symptoms. TCM physicians are also accustomed to providing individualized treatment, adjusting the dosage and composition of medication to the person's constitution, the severity of his symptoms and the appearance of other syndromes as his condition evolves. This c ontrasts with Western medicine , which tends to stay with a fixed dosage of single-ingredient me dication over a prolonged period of the patient's disease. For example, a person with early chronic Type II diabetes is prescribed the drug metformin (500 mg tw ice daily) to control blood sugar level, taken over a period of mont hs or years. A Chinese physician treating the same condition (with herbal medications rather than metformin) wa tches the syndromes of the patient such as yin deficiency of the lung; this causes thirstiness and frequent urination and qi stagnation of the liver, which is accompanied by vexatious moods. He is likely to modify the prescription, co mprising a cocktail of herbs, every one or two weeks in accordance w ith the patient's evolving syndromes at each visit. If lung- yin deficiency has improved but liver- qi stagnation has no t, the physician might reduce the dosage of those herbs that address yin deficiency and increase it for herbs that treat qi stagnation. Using RCTs to test TCM treatment constrains the responses to a standard Chinese herb prescription for that syndrome: those that respond are then deemed to have the syndrome, and biological biomarkers of thes e are then studied compared to those that do not respond. Such a methodology presumes that the efficacy of the prescription for that syndrome, something that needs to be separately established. 153 physician to one prescription for all patients in the treatment arm, resulting in what the TCM physician would deem to be comp romised efficacy of the treatment. Hence the argument could be made that the conventional protocol of RCTs constrains the efficacy of TCM treatments to be tested, and is therefore biased against the validation of the true effi cacy of TCM therapies. Conceivably, however, the protocol could be modified for periodic diagnosi s by physicians of patients in both the treatment and control arms of the trial and suitable changes in the prescription for the trea tment arm patients (and a ch ange to the appearance of the placebo given to the co ntrol arm patients.) But physicians would perforce no longer be blinded. The problem of human error arising fro m the key role of the diagnosing physician applying the four examinations is a more troublesome one. One could with justice make the counter argument that diagnostic error is also perfectly possible in the Western approach. However it should be recognized that with a large arsenal of diagnostic tools from blood tests to CT scans and separate professional expertise for reading and inte rpreting test results for the physician, Western diagnosis leaves less room for human error. One could interpret this as indicating that Western diagnosis is scie ntific; it could certainly claim to more objective because of the lower risk of human error. Biomarkers Although there is in practice a high degree of consistency in the diagnosis of common syndromes by TCM physicians, this would not be the case for multiple syndromes, as pointed out earlier. If there were established biomarkers for determining the presence of any particular syndrome, this would greatly simplify the problem, but to date th e use of biomarkers for differentiating syndromes has not been achieved. Some researchers have tried using statistical data mining methods to develop these biomarkers. 163 Such methods are not without problems. 163 Guo, Chen et al (2009), 531-546 154 The use of biomarkers makes the presum ption that there is an exact set of biological states, such as the presence of microbiological pathogens or changes in the level of blood component or endocrin al secretions, corre sponding to a TCM syndrome. But is every syndrome associat ed with a unique se t of biomarkers? There is no reason to believ e that this would in fact be the case of all syndromes, or even any syndrome. There is simila r issue in Western medicine for more complex conditions like rheumatoid ar thritis, for which the RA (rheumatoid arthritis) factor measured from blood sample s is used as a probabilistic indicator of the presence of the disease, but the correlation is notoriously imperfect. A person with a high RA factor may have no sy mptoms (false positive), and an acute rheumatoid arthritis suffer exhibiting cl assical symptoms of inflamed joints and connective tissue may have a normal RA fact or (false negative). Recent research findings indicate that the PSA index used for detection of prostate cancer is similarly flawed.164 For most diseases in biomed icine, however, the biomarkers are unambiguous. For example the presence of lung lesi ons seen in chest x-rays and the presence of the tubercle bacillus in the blood is a definitive indicator of tuberculosis, or the presence of the rhinovirus in blood and nasal discharges of the common cold. In the case of TCM syndr omes no accepted set of biomarkers has been established for any syndrome. The nature of TCM syndromes may well be such that finding a unique set of biomarkers for each syndrome is not feasible. Interestingly, some of the conditions for which Western medicine uses the term \"syndrome\" are also diffic ult to pin down consistent ly with biomarkers, for example chronic fatigue and irritable bowel syndromes. This may well be the reason that the same English term \"syndrom e\" has been used in the translation of the TCM term \" zheng\" (). The fact that most diseases recorded in Western medicine have clear and unambiguous biomarkers wher eas TCM syndromes are (at least currently) totally lacking in biomarkers could subject TCM to the charge that TCM is unscientific 164 Damber and Aus, Lancet (2008) 155 and merely hiding behind subtlety and comp lexity to account for lack of evidence in its favour. The emphasis on biomarkers follows from a reductionist approach to medicine, something that modern TCM physicians readily concede has many advantages over ancient Chinese methods of diagnosis. But th ese same physicians would argue that medicine is not necessa rily entirely reduci ble to biomedical parameters, nor are the methods biomedicin e the only or even always the best route to achieving effective therapy. Such a defence of TCM can be and indeed is often made, and leaves open the question of which method of diagnosis yields better information for prescribing ther apies. While Western diagnosis has a proven record of providin g reliable information on which suitable therapeutic interventions may be prescr ibed, this is not the case with TCM. For TCM the priority remains that of prov iding evidence throug h clinical trials that it has real therapeutic capabilities. 6.2.1 Suitability of RCTs for TCM With the objective of bringing abou t better acceptance of TCM in mind, some researchers are prepared to accept th e principles of evidence-based medicine but are convinced that, as the core of TC M therapeutic method, the differentiation and treatment of syndromes cannot be subjected to RCT s. Shea (2006) summarizes their views as follows: Discussions of the difficulty of applying the RCT design to Chinese medicine stress that while biomedicine assigns standardized treatment based on disease categories such as diabetes, Chinese medicine tailors individualized treatment based on syndromes... RCT detractors assert that it is impossible to co nduct valid RCTs on Chinese medicine because if syndrome differentiation was used, its radi cal individualization would result in small numbers in the same treatment group, yielding results lacking statistical significance. Yet, if, to avoid the N=1 problem, Chinese medicine treatments were tested within a 156 biomedical diagnostic framework, the results would be equally meaningless because Chinese medicine's fundamental essence would be violated.165 By ruling out RCTs for all clinical tria ls of TCM therapies, \"RCT detractors\" run the risk of being dismissed by \"TCM detractors\" who would charge that since TCM cannot be subjected to RCTs it is therefore not scientific. Either polar position leans toward the dogmatic and is at variance with th e more enlightened views and cogent arguments offered by Ur bach, Worrall, Rawlins and others that RCTs are not the only useful means for va lidating the efficacy of interventions; in fact oftentimes they are neither the be st means nor even a feasible way of testing. 166 As Rawlins puts it, \"the notion th at evidence can be reliably placed in hierarchies is illusory\" and such hierarch ies with RCTs at their summit and various forms of observational studies \"nestling in the foothills\" put RCTs on an \"undeserved pedestal\".167 I think \"RCT among TCM researchers are correct to de- emphasize RCTs but are being overly pessimistic to rule them out in all situations. While RCTs need not be the only way to co nduct clinical trials and while there are considerable methodological difficulties dealing with syndromes for clinical trials as pointed out above, they can in princi ple be conducted when available samples are large enough. They do not violate any \"fundamental essence\" of TCM if the trials were conducted on differentiated syndromes and therapies applied according to TCM principles rather than on Western herbal medicine and Western acupuncture. TCM does emphasize individualized trea tment by virtue of focusing on multiple syndromes in a dynamic state, which makes each patient potentially different from most others. This militates against the us e of RCTs. But it can be argued that patients are all different anyw ay, whether looked at from the point of view of TCM or Western medicine. It is for RCTs to be designed in such a 165 Shea, JL (2006) Applying Evidence-Based Medicine to Traditional Chinese Medicine: Debate and Strategy. Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine , Volume 12, Number 3, 2006, pp. (2008) 167 Rawlins (2008)1-2. 157 manner as to average out these differences such that the patient samples in the treatment and control arms of the RCTs are statistically as close as possible. This may not always be possible, which is why observational studies and case studies (covered further below) shou ld also be considered and used when appropriate. In sum: clinical trials based on synd rome differentiation tend to be more difficult compared to those for Western me dicine, largely because of the highly individualistic approach of TCM therapy. In practic e, no two persons suffering from the same disease are likely to be given the same prescription by a TCM physician, in part because they have diff erent constitutions but largely also because they are at different stages of the evol ution of the disease and exhibit different syndromes in a dynamic state. Though not offered as a defence for the paucity and relatively poor quality of te sting TCM theory through clin ical trials, this suggests that alternative avenues for seeking ev idence in TCM should also be actively investigated; particul arly observational trials based on properly recorded patient data such as are now availa ble in modern TCM hospitals in China. In my view, this is the most likely source of sign ificant evidence supporting or invalidating TCM based on therapies administered to la rge number of patients in modern times, and is a pressing area for future research. 6.2.2 Recent Clinical Trials In recent years there have been a nu mber of preliminary studies on the treatment of syndromes by TCM methods. Their findings are tentative and their methodologies leave much to be desire d, leaving room for more and better research.168 In effect, no rigorous clinical tr ials have been co nducted (that I am aware of) on TCM therapies based sole ly on differentia tion of syndromes.169 There are two possible reasons for this. 168 Lu, Liu and Ding (2009), Zhang (2005). 169 One attempt was in Zheng Xian (1985) 158 First, the methodological difficulties that I outlined above have not yet been effectively addressed, leading to the phenome non of \"RCT detractors\" cited earlier. Second, at a more fundam ental level, TCM researchers are driven by the more practical objective of showing that Chinese medications ca n heal disease and acupuncture can provide symptomatic relief (mainly of pain). Success in such clinical trials draws attention from the medical community and opens up opportunities for drug discovery by West ern pharmaceutical companies. From the point of these researchers, TCM theory guides them toward the particular acupuncture or herbal interventions to treat a disease (by addressing the syndromes commonly associated with that disease, e.g. weak spleen- qi for gastritis). Few feel motivated to convince Western science of the validity of TCM theory by focusing on syndrome differentiation and therapy. Like the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, they are more concerned to show that the medicine works rather than to validate a particular theory explaining why it works. Hence it is not surprising that near ly all clinical trials on Chinese medications and acupuncture points have b een in the categories of Western herbal medicine and Western acupun cture. For example, in the 2010 international meeting of the Committee for the Glob alization of Chinese Medicine (a multinational East-West organization), over 300 papers in covered clinical trials; among these fewer than 10 were in the category of testing TCM therapies, and even those dwelt mainly on unre solved methodological issues.170 From the point of view of validating TCM th eories clinical trials sy ndrome differentiation and treatment need to be conducted. But even for clinical trials on Chin ese medications and acupuncture for the treatment of diseases defined by Wester n medicine, the quality of work has not generally been satisfactory. Several Western researchers have conducted meta- analyses for trials for TCM treatments an d concluded that the results are patchy, suggesting that certain condi tions respond to TCM treatments but most others were 170 A summary of such papers is presented in Bian (2010) \"TCM concepts in the Trials\", CGCM August 2010 presentation. The same pattern was seen in the 2011 meeting. 159 either negative or li kely placebo response.171 In general, research at Chinese and other East Asian universiti es tend to validate the e fficacy of TCM treatments, while those carried out by Western resear chers are largely negative. At the same time, it has been pointed that the standard of scientific rigour in the Eastern studies did not meet Western standards. Lai, a medical statisti cian at the Guangdong University of Chinese Medicine, conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials in China on Western herb al therapies as well as TCM therapies and found most of them inadequate in me thodological rigour.172 A recent study by Shang et al was only slightly more positive, concluding that the clinical evidence for the efficacy of Chinese medicine had \"yet to be rigorously established\".173 I end this chapter with a brief disc ussion on observational trials for TCM and the extreme difficulty of finding usab le observational evidence from Chinese medical case studies. (The rationa le for case-based reasoning and the methodology of case studies is an interest ing subject in its own right. It is separately covered in the annexure to this chapter.) 6.3 Observational trials and medical case studies Given that evidence-based medicine is thought by some to have begun only in the 1950s with the advent of RCTs, on e might ask: what wa s medicine based on before?174 The answer seems obvious - observ ational studies, mostly, for Western medicine, and case studies, mos tly, for Chinese medicine. Case studies have historically been an important form of transmitting knowledge in medicine as they contain a wealth of medical records. In China such studies date back to the Han dynasty a nd in Greek medicine even earlier to 171 See for example Tang, Zhan and Ernst (1999) Review of Randomised Control Trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, British Medical Journal , 1999, 319:160-161; Kaptchuk (2000), Appendix E. 172 Lai (2001, 2010). 173 Shang et al (2007) 174 As asked byWorrall (2002) 160 Hippocrates (Epidemics) . In the 16th century, physicians in China started to write medical cases in a formal di sciplined format, detailing th e symptoms of the patient and the physician's diagnosis, and the ra tionale for the prescribed treatments.175 Can one find valid evidence for TCM theory in the tens of thousands of classical case studies recorded by famous physic ians from ancient times, for example by extracting data to form observational trials? It would be difficult for these classical case studies in TCM to be sources of evidence for TCM methods. For a start, th ere have been lurking suspicions, even among TCM physicians. Why are nearly all the cases thos e of successful treatments and how many cas es of failure have not b een recorded? Were the putative cures permanent, or were there relapses among patients who sought treatment from other physic ians, or whose illnesses progressed and eventually killed them? Were they mainly guilty of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy? Because the patient got better following the application of a particular treatment method, we add it to the data base of successful cases, precisely the kind of fallacious reasoning that RCTs are designed to avoid. Fi nally, there is the unhappy history of therapies like blood-letting that were thought in the past to have been validated through case studies for a variet y of illnesses and la ter turned out on more rigorous examination to be useless in nearly all of them. The situation is different, however, for recorded cases of modern Chinese physicians working in clinics where data is available on the progress of each patient through a complete co urse of treatment, sometimes lasting several years of treatment, until the patient has got well or has moved on.176 With more reliable data are now available from large numbers of patients at state-run TCM hospitals and clinics in China and with TCM physic ians assisted by technical staff and obliged to keep detailed and accurate records, there is potential for rigorous observational studies with adequate sample sizes to be cond ucted. The data 175 See, for example, Cullen (2001), 309-321 176 See, for example, cardiovascular disease cases treated with Chinese medicine in Becker, Flaws and Casanas (2005). 161 studied must of course include cont rast classes within which a medical intervention under study is not applied. In principle, observational studies ba sed on medical cases are possible using statistical and data mining tech niques of the social sciences.177 As a simple example of statistical analys is of case data, one can te st the hypothesis that the herb huangqin (radix scutellariae ) clears internal heat in the lungs. A random sample is used of past cases in which huangqin was used as part of various formulations for treating patie nts with internal heat in the lungs. A suitable method of statistical analysis would then be used. For exampl e multiple regression analysis could be used to determine the statistical significance of the huangqin factor in reducing lung heat. The regre ssion methodology implicitly builds in a contrast class into the study. If huangqin emerges as a statistically significant variable, this would lend support to the proposition that using huangqin is more likely to achieve a heat reductio n outcome than if it is not. It is to be hoped that more research re sources will be put in to such studies. As for ancient case records of famous physicians, it is likely that these cases be taken on faith by TCM phys icians and employed as tools for training new physicians rather than regarded as a valid source of evidence TCM theory. Conclusions on evidence for TCM TCM models of therapy based on syndr ome differentiation constitute the core theory of TCM can and sh ould be put to the test thro ugh clinical trials if TCM is to be considered a scientific system of healing. There ar e some methodological difficulties in using double-blind RCTs to test TCM interventions, but they do not amount to a need to reject them for te sting TCM. Rather th ey should be used selectively, as should observational tr ials. Classical case studies of famous physicians are useful as pe dagogical tools for training TCM physicians, but they 177 Data mining is the process of applying computer science methods such as neural networks, cluster analysis and decision trees to data with the intention of uncovering hidden pattern in large data sets. 162 do not provide a reliable data base for observational trials. Properly-kept records of modern TCM clinics and hospitals with large patient bases are more promising for this purpose. 163 Annexure Methodology and rationale for case studies The use of cases as an analytical and pedagogical tool was institutionalized at Harvard Law School in the 19th century and over a hundre d years ago at Harvard Business School. Case-based reasoning ve rsus rule-based reasoning has been a subject of discussion in the recent philos ophical literature. Case-based reasoning does not attempt to solve a pr oblem from first principles or a set of accepted rules or laws, as a rule-based system would. Instead, as Nickle s argues, it employs \"some sort of similarity metric to find on e or more cases similar to the presented case\" in attempting to find a re solution to a problem at hand. 178 Case-reasoning is not among Hacking's six mode s of human reasoning: po stulation and deduction, experimental exploration, construction of models by analogy, ordering of variety by comparison and taxonomy, st atistical analysis of regu larities, and historical derivation of genetic development, but one could argue that it should be added to the list.179 Case-based reasoning is an altern ative to rule-based reasoning as exemplified by, for example, the hypothetico-deductive method . Instead of solving each new problem starting from some set of fundamental rules, we match the new problem to one or more problems and solutions sets already available in case archives. Instead of trying to solve a problem by applying some abstract rule, appeal is made to the contex tually rich practical problems of the past. Routine or near-identical problems can be solved im mediately, and less ro utine ones require judgment to combine previous cases in such a manner as to ge t a suitable fit with the new problem. Critics of case-based reasoning could argue that such r easoning does not really eschew rules but simply conceals them by incorporating them in \"the abstraction procedures and the corr esponding indexing and retrieval 178 Nickles (1998), 70 179 Hacking (1990), 2 and Forrester (1996) 164 mechanisms\"180. In other words, there is some hidden adherence to underlying rules in the way the relevant cases are se lected for reference and applied. The classic Johnson and Johnson case at Harv ard Business School involved the chief executive of the company taking the toug h decision to make a nation-wide recall of Tylenol tablets that had been criminally laced with arsenic. It was a costly decision for what appeared to be only a very minor number of Tylenol tablets so affected, but it restored confidence in the company, whose public image subsequently soared to gether with its profitability. Certain rules emerge that can be used for dealing with future recall case s: accept responsibil ity, come clean with the media. Several decades later, the motor industry giant Toyota, to their everlasting regret, did not heed these injunctions, and suffered permanent damage to its reputation following thei r recall crisis in 2010 caused by a faulty accelerator pedal. That cases have hidden ru les does not however reduc e the case to a set of rules because of the rich and complex c ontext of business situations. This non- reducibility to a set of rules means that there will not normally be a correct or standard solution to a case, as there is in solving a problem in mechanics or chemistry. If another case of Johnson and Johnson genre we re to occur, the extent to which responsibility should be accepte d and how the media should be handled are not reducible to rules but requires a visionary and decisi ve CEO to manage, using the past case as a guide but adding his judgment of the present context and complications to decide on a solution. The past case thus gives clues to similar approaches and methodologies to use rath er than a fixed pres cription for action. The former chief executive of British Pe troleum Tony Haywar d would agree from his experience with BP's oil drilling disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. He could not have followed Johnson and Johns on in recalling spilled oil. But it did help him, albeit not decisively, to come clean and admit responsibility early in the saga, something that the management of Toyota failed to do. In sum, there are broad 180 Nickles (2003), 162 165 hidden rules in cases, but this does not re duce a case to a rigi d set of rules, nor does it bind the decision-maker in each situation to follow all the rules. The applicability of case-based reason ing to medical diagnosis and choice of therapy seems obvious. The experien ced medical practitioner, East or West, builds his competence on having compiled a library of cases in his own memory bank to which he can turn almost intuitively as a ha bit of reasoning . To charge these cases with the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy would seem to be too dismissive. Does it me an that experience gained from treating patients and observing experienced physicians treat their patients is of no help in improving a doctor's medical judgment, un less that experien ce is validated by controlled trials? This would fly in the face of common sense. This reductio ad absurdum argument however atta cks a straw man. The experienced physician would have seen cases in which the same or similar treatments were not given and noted the negative outcomes. In effect, each past case se en by the physician (or by others whose reports he has read) is a member of a sample for implicit observational trials. Hence the value of ca ses is in providing samples of patients that receive a given treatment co mpared to those who did not. Cases, therefore, when properly reco rded and analyzed, potentially contain data for the methods (other than RCTs) of evidence -based medicine. 166 7. Placebo Effects and Cultural Factors in TCM Placebo effects exist in Western interventions as they do in TCM interventions and RCTs, among other things , aim at determining if the effects of interventions are significantly higher than those of placebos. This chapter discusses the placebo eff ect in TCM and how cultural factors might play a role in pati ent response to TCM interv entions. The arguments and observations made here do not directly impinge on the core theme of the last chapter, which stated the case for conduc ting clinical trials on TCM models of therapy by the protocols of evidence-based medicine as the means of establishing the scientific validity of otherwise of th ese models. Instead they are aimed at elucidating a cultural aspect of TCM that makes the placebo effect possibly stronger in many conditions than Western intervention. 7.1 Discovery of placebo effects Although placebos in the past were originally de fined by their inert content and their use as controls in clinical trials, recent research suggests that placebo effects are real physiological events oc curring within a therapeutic context. Placebo effects can also exist in clinic al conditions even if no placebo is administered.181 There is an extensive literature on pl acebo effects found in clinical trials and on the theoretical mechanism of acti on of the placebo. Before the Second World War, the term 'placebo' referred to the harmless (sugar or bread) pills and tonics that doctors sometimes used to humour patients who had no illness but still requested treatment. This practice was just ified on the grounds that it did no harm even if it did nothing physic ally to help the patient ge t better. After the war, and with the rise to prominence of the double-blind RCTs, there was increasing recognition that the placebo could have po werful therapeutic effects at least in 181 Finniss, Kaptchuk, et al (2010) Lancet 167 some circumstances and for some condit ions. Beecher in fact claimed that placebos could induce \"gross physical ch ange\", including changes at which \"may exceed those attributable to potent pharmacological action.\"182 Kaptchuk notes this change of the status of the placebo from the \"humbl e humbug\" to potent stuff with occult-like powers that th at could mimic potent drugs. 183 The thesis of placebos having ther apeutic effects was challenged by a number of studies, one of which pointed out a methodological flaw in Beecher's paper: nearly all his cases compared a pr escribed treatment with a placebo and did not include a group with no treatment, leaving open the possibility that the observed supposed placebo eff ect was merely a result of the natural progression of the disease, that is, it would have happen ed even without the placebo. Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche subsequently conducted a meta-analysis of 130 clinical trials involving both a placebo group and a no-tr eatment group. Because a sufficiently large number of conditions studies did not respond to the placebo, they concluded that there was no statistically significan t evidence that placebos have clinical therapeutic effects.184 But as Dylan Evans points out, all that the authors succeeded in showing was th at the placebo is not a pa nacea that works for every conceivable condition or even a majority of conditions. (For that matter, no conventional drug claims to be a panacea for all ills.) 185 To establish the placebo effect, one only has to single out the pa thological conditions for which a placebo would make a significant difference. Thus , although Beecher's st ronger claim that the placebo can affect every medical condit ion was not borne out by evidence from later studies, this left open th e possibility that there are a range of conditions that are placebo-responsive. In fact, in the Hrobjartsson and Gotzsc he study, pain was a condition that quite consistently responded positively to a placebo. This point is worth noting when we consid er acupuncture for the treat ment of pain, undoubtedly 182 Beecher (1955), Journal of the American Medical Association . 'The powerful placebo' 183 Kaptchuk (1998), Lancet 184 Kienle Kiene H. The powerful placebo effect: fact or fiction?. J Clin Epidemiology 1997;50(12):1311-8. 185 Evans, D Suppression of the acute-phase response as a biological mechanism for the placebo effect. Elsevier: Medical Hypotheses (2005) 64, 1-7 168 the most common application of acupuncture procedures. For certain conditions, such as anxiety, the results were variable and did not permit a firm interpretation. Thus, meta-analyses involving the pooling of results of studies of a variety of medical conditions tend to obscure the true profile of the placebo response. Placebo mechanisms can interact w ith active treatments since every treatment is given in a therapeutic cont ext that may activate placebo mechanisms working through similar biochemical pathwa ys to the actual drug. Finniss, Kaptchuk et al report an experimental trial d one on post-operati ve pain during which patients were given intravenous sa line as placebo in addition to routine analgesic treatment. One group was told that the infusion was merely a rehydrating solution and anothe r group told that it was a strong painkiller. The group who believed the soluti on was assisting in analgesi a took 33% less analgesic for the same pain control than did those in the control group, suggesting a clinical placebo effect working in conjunction with an active treatment to reduce the patient's overall drug intake.186 Various explanations have been offe red for the action mechanism of a placebo. Evans has offered the controve rsial thesis that the placebo response involves the suppression of \"t he acute-phase response\". This refers to the classic signs of inflammation (swelling, heat, redness and pain) together with the psychological symptoms of sickness behaviour (lethargy, apathy, loss of appetite and increased sensitivity to pain). Evans ar gues that this explanation is backed by his observation that the most freque ntly encountered placebo-responsive conditions are pain, swelling, stom ach ulcers, depression and anxiety.187 Finniss, Kaptchuk et al list a dozen or so mechanisms th at could be involved in the placebo effect, ranging from the release of e ndogenous opioids an d dopamine for pain reduction to the conditioning of immune system mediators like lymphocytes. For a given medical condition, one or more, or all, of these mechanisms could be at 186 Finniss, Kaptchuk, Miller and Benedetti (2010) Biological, clinical, and ethical advances of placebo effects. Lancet 2010; 375: 686-95 187 Evans (2003), 44-69 169 play. For each situation in which there is a placebo effect at play, a certain number of these mechanisms are sufficient to bring about therapeutic effect. In terms of the INUS concept and causal pie model (Chapter 2), we can view the placebo effect to be the result of the ability of th e mind to trigger a certain constellation of psychobiological mechanisms, each of whic h is an \"insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient (INUS) condition\". 7.2 The placeb o effect in TCM The placebo effect in alternative me dicine in general, and in TCM in particular, has been the subject of considerable empirical research.188 Studies involving placebo-controlled trials vary widely in me thodological rigour and comprehensiveness. Many claim to have detected placebo effects, and a large number suggest that the placebo effect might be the only one that is significant. A study by Shang et al (2010) of 136 placebo-controlled clinical trials concludes that \"the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine remains poorly documented.\" Kaptchuk observes that Western medical scientists often suspect that the effectiveness of Chinese medici ne is due to the placebo ef fect but contends that in China it is Western medicine that has the prestige and \"an aura of the mysterious and foreign\" and therefore may enjoy an advantage when it comes to inducing a placebo response. 189 I think the cultural factor cu ts both ways depending on the illness and the kind of patient involved. Among the Chinese wh o believe in TCM - and these include a majority with schooling in modern science - there is the perception that Western medicine is powerf ul and fast-acting, but often toxic - usually eliminating symptoms but not the underlying (root) cause. Unless the body is able to readjust its balance inte rnally and overcome the underlying cause, the illness is likely to return. Examples of such conditions would be the chronic 188 Shang et al (2007) surveys of some of the recent findings: Placebo-controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicine and convent ional medicine\u2014comparative study. International Journal of Epidemiology 2007;36:1086-1092 and Wu (2010) Placebo control and clinical trial of Chinese Medicine, Journal of Integrative Chinese Medicine , Oct 2010, vol 8 no 10. 189 Kaptchuk (2000), p33 footnote 27. 170 headache which an analgesic like paracetam ol can relieve but only for a couple of hours, and gastric pain reliev ed by an antacid that returns once gastric secretions rise again. TCM believers view it as at tacking the root of the problem, taking longer but bringing about a more perman ent cure. For example, TCM theory attributes headaches to a variety of underlying syndromes, among which are deficiency of qi, causing inadequate nourishment to the head, and liver heat which rises to the head to cause pain . TCM treatment would provide a qi tonic for the first case, and dissipa te heat in the second; in each case it would claim to be removing the source of the pain rather than suppressing the pain. For TCM patients, it could th us be argued that the pl acebo effect is stronger with Western medicine for short-term re lief of acute conditions but not so for chronic illnesses. This might well be an explanation for conventional wisdom among TCM users that one should go to a Western doctor for an acute illness and to TCM physician for chr onic conditions. If indeed the placebo effect was stronger in TCM interventions for chronic il lnesses among believer s, it does not of course rule out the existence of real ther apeutic effects as well. Alongside strong placebo effects, such real effects would further in fluence TCM believers towards TCM interventions for chronic illnesses. There may be other reasons for thinking that the role of the placebo effect may be stronger for TCM than it is for Western medicine: 1. Patients who have not obtained satis factory results from Western therapy often seek alternative therapy with the hope (and wanting to believe) th at it would work for them. For example, many TCM patients suffering from neck, shoulder and back pains do not recover by using an ti-inflammatory drugs, or their bodies cannot tolerate the side effe cts of these drugs (usually on their digestive systems); or they do not find relief in conventional physiotherapy . They seek the help of alternative medicine after hearing favourabl e anecdotal reports from others. These patients tend to cling to the hope and co me with a higher level of optimism that acupuncture and related alternative therapie s would give them the relief that has 171 eluded them with conventional therapy. Another common example (cited in Chapter 1) is the influenz a patient who recovers after treatment by a Western doctor with an antipyretic for fever a nd antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection but suffers post-flu chronic dry co ugh and lassitude. He believes that the TCM would fix his problem. The TCM ph ysician treats for his dry cough as a deficiency syndrome in the lung- yin and lassitude as arising from damaged qi and if he recovers quickly, he might be inclined to regard this as a vindication of TCM for chronic conditions. 2. Alternative therapists tend to spend more time with their patients than do conventional doctors (40 minu tes versus 17); they also engage in more direct physical contact than doctors who prescribe pills after a quick examination.190 The higher perceived level of empathy for their patients is likely to evoke a stronger placebo response. 3. In Eastern cultures, the users of TC M tend not only to be strong believers in TCM therapy, but can al so relate better to the terms and language used by Chinese physicians without the problems of translation of these terms that a non- Chinese speaker would experience (Chapter 2.6). This is particularly so with respect to the differentiation of TCM s yndromes and their treatment. The average Chinese patient in China or Singapor e, for example, has little problem understanding the physicians who te ll him that he suffers from qi deficiency or damp heat, but may have mo re difficulty understandin g blood test results that show a low platelet count or an elevated ESR. Explanations offered by the TCM physician to the patient of the underlying problem of his illness and the method adopted to tackle it builds confidence of the patient in the physician and may well evoke a stronger pl acebo response. If indeed it is true that the placebo ef fect on average is much stronger with TCM treatments than Western medical treatments, then th e true therapeutic effect of the TCM treatment would be harder to tease out from clinical trials because of 190 Evans (2004), 157-158 172 the swamping effect of the placebo resp onse and because the two effects may not be additive. For example, suppose on a s cale of 10 to 1 the placebo effect acting alone reduces the pain level from 10 to 5. Suppose further that the prescribed TCM treatment acting alone reduces it from 10 to 7. The co mbined effect of placebo and treatment would not necessarily reduce pa in level from 10 to 2, perhaps only from 10 to 4. (By analo gy, two teaspoonfuls of sugar would not necessarily make your tea taste twice as sweet as one te aspoonful, and for people who do not like sugar in their tea it might taste just as awful; nor would a punch of the face with half the force of a boxer's fist be felt as only half as painful as one received with full force.) In the above example, the ad ditional 1 point reduction from TCM treatment would be that much hard er to isolate by statistical inference. One can only speculate wh ether or not the forego ing observation is an explanation for a plethora of Western studies pointing to pain as among the conditions most placebo-resp onsive to Chinese acupuncture. For ex ample, a series of large trials in Germany compared Chinese medical acupuncture, sham acupuncture (needling at non-acupuncture points) and no trea tment for conditions varying from migraine and tension headaches to chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee. 191 Generally across the various trials, outcomes did not differ between Chinese and sham acupuncture groups although bo th of these fared better than the no-treatment group. In four of these RCTs, the patient's expectation of pain relief was the best predictor of efficacy of treatment, irrespective of whether genuine Chinese or sham acupuncture was applied.192 In contrast, most studies in China and East Asia (notably Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and South Korea) suggest that there was more than a placebo effect at play with genu ine Chinese acupuncture. Su ch studies are regularly reported in Chinese journals like the Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine , American Journal of Chinese Medicine , and dozens of official journals of TCM 191 Linde K, Streng A, Jurgens S, et al. (2005), Melchart D, Streng A, Hoppe A, et al. (2006), Brinkhaus B, Witt CM, Jena S, et al. (2006), Haake M, Muller HH, Schade-Brittinger C, et al. (2007), Brinkhaus B, Jena S, et al. (2006). These studies were cited in Finniss, Kaptchuk, et al (2010). 192 Linde K, Witt CM, Streng A, et al. (2007) 173 colleges and universities in the country. Kaptchuk's observat ion regarding doubts over the reliability of scientific eviden ce from these studies may be relevant here.193 While no one is likely to deny th at pain is placebo-responsive to acupuncture, more work remains to be don e using common accepted clinical trial protocols before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the existence of significant non-placebo effects of acupuncture. 193 Kaptchuk (2000) Appendix E, 357 174 8. Conclusions Chinese medical theory has been under attack as unscientific since the May 4th movement of 1919 in China, first by Chinese youth newly armed with Western science and technology, and later by scientists in th e West influenced by the positivist tradition. Part of the proble m for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been the terminology used, which is not he lped by the difficulties in translation, but the main difficulty is the lack of un derstanding of the underlying meanings of TCM concepts and entities. The other major problem has been the paucity of evidence that Chinese therap eutic methods actually work - evidence that would be acceptable by the standards and methods of so-called evidence-based medicine. The problem has been exa cerbated by some defenders of TCM theory who have tried to avoid the rigours of evidence-ba sed medicine with the excuse that TCM theory is a different paradigm from West ern medicine and therefore absolved from its rules of evidence. The objectives of this di ssertation have been to show how TCM theory may be reconstructed to make sense to biomedi cal science and to assess the evidential credentials of the thus reconstructed theory, in particular, to see if the efficacy of the therapeutic methods derived from the theory can be put to scientific testing through clinical trials. I began by showing in Chapters 3 and 4 that one does not need to be burdened by the thought of TCM entities like qi, phlegm and meridians being ambiguous and unobservable, or by the fact that a vital organ like the kidney in TCM is very different from the kidney in modern anatomy. One should treat TCM entities as being a mixture of real substa nces, like blood and bone, and theoretical constructs/ abstractions of real underlyin g biomedical substan ces and processes, like jing and qi. TCM organs are systems of functions rather than the somatic structures of modern anatomy. These abstractions and theo retical constructs 175 evolved over the history of Chinese medica l theorizing and prac tice and constitute building blocks for TCM m odels that are used for explaining, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses (Chapter 5). To speak of these abstrac tions as if they were real observable entities accounts for the conceptual distress en countered by new Western readers of Chinese medical literature. On the other ha nd, terms like \"analogies\", \"metaphors\" and \"convenient on TCM entities may be helpful for inducting the lay reader into TCM thought. But when used as general characteriza tions of TCM entities they are often inaccurate and in some instances misleading. The problem is further co mpounded by the habit in Chinese culture of using language in more flexible ways than is encountered in English grammar, coupled with a tendency to blur distinctions between substance, energy and process. This ha s led to imaginative ways to explain them, like treating TCM concepts as poetic imag es, an approach that indeed can be helpful but only for the new reader to get acquainte d with TCM without the need for \"epistemological leaps\" from his co nceptual base in biomedicine. TCM theory is expressed through models that attempt to elucidate what a healthy state of the body consists of; it explains the causes of illness, and it provides a system for diagnosis and treatme nt of illnesses. Although some TCM models evolved from ancient cosmology and folklore, this does not change the fact that, as used today, they are heuristic models based on empirical observations derived from clinical practi ce. As heuristic models, they are conjectures about what governs events in the human body viewed somewhat like the black box in cybernetics. These events manifest themse lves through constell ations of clinical symptoms that TCM sicians differentiate as patterns or syndromes . These syndromes are then treated with therapeuti c principles using a variety of natural products (including herbs, minerals and animal parts), acupuncture interventions, and medical massage ( tuina ). 176 TCM models for diagnosis and treatmen t are testable in principle through clinical trials. Because of the comp lexity of the human body and TCM's dependence on human observa tion rather than objective blood tests and diagnostic instruments, and because of the dynami c nature of TCM syndromes, there are challenging though not insurmountable me thodological problems in running clinical trials on TCM mo dels. The problems are compounded by TCM being heavily biased toward individualized tr eatment and a possibly stronger placebo effect for TCM therapies than conventional ones. There is a good case for making use of observational trials as tests of TC M rather than insisting on employing only double-blind randomized controlled trials. Clinical trials on TCM methods ar e still in their infancy despite considerable efforts. This is largely because nearly all of this work has been directed at what I have termed \"Wes tern herbal treatments\" and \"Western acupuncture\" rather than TCM models base d on syndrome diffe rentiation. This leaves much more clinical work to be do ne to directly address TCM theory. It calls for investigati ons into whether TCM models ar e at least approximately valid under specified constraints. The current lack of evidence for th erapeutic methods based TCM theory places it a notch below economic science in the scientific hierarchy. Despite the presence of contending theories, the frequent failed model, and doubts over the feasibility of modeling complex economic and social activity encountered in economic science, \"the dismal science\" has earned a measure of credibility through statistical testing of its models an d occasional successes of these models in prediction. I do not agree with orthodox thinkers in Chinese medicine who treat ancient classics as special in fallible insights into the workin g of the human body attained through introspection and more than a hint of divine inspirati on. Although it is helpful to see Chinese medicine as havi ng some paradigms (e xemplars) that are different from those of Western medicine, I see no value in pre ssing the stronger 177 claim that the whole of Chinese medicine itself is a different paradigm from, and incommensurable with, that of Western medi cine. Nor is there any justification for the view that because some TCM entiti es are unobservable or have escaped scientific observation they are therefor e absolved from the rigours of evidence- based medicine. My reconstruction of TCM theory reco gnizes the ontological status of TCM entities as a mixed bag of real biomedical entities and theoretical abstractions of these entities, but ultimately based on real physiological functions and activities. The heuristic models used in TCM need to be validate d by success in clinical practice and confirmed through appropriate clin ical trials. They have to be tested and refined; some of them, possibly the five-element model, may eventually be abandoned. What should emerge is a se t of construc tions and empirical models that together constitute a holistic non-reductionist way of organising observations of body functioning and pathology to serv e as tools for diagnosis and therapy. Whether these tools can be shown thro ugh scientific evidence to be of significant value towards cult ivating good health and curing illnesses remains to be seen. Should they prove to be signific ant value, it is more likely to be in promoting a more holistic approach to health and the management of chronic illnesses than in the treat ment of acute diseases. 178 9.
