Such findings imply that once a vaccine is available to people, some will choose either to [delay](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/) getting it or decline to receive it altogether. Depending on how great these numbers become, it may negatively impact our collective ability to develop herd [immunity](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19) to the illness and lessen its incidence in certain communities. This would mean additional lives lost and more time to recover socially, educationally, and economically from the devastating effects of the pandemic.It also would exacerbate existing health care disparities. What influences people to be hesitant about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine appears to be a complex issue. A recent [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2771872) found several different factors \u2014 gender, race/ethnicity, concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, and the source for vaccine endorsements, e.g. public health experts versus politicians \u2014 may influence people's likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine. But the most important underlying cause is the lack of trust people have that a vaccine will do what it is supposed to do and will not result in any adverse health impacts for themselves or their children. The importance of trust in a vaccine is nothing [new](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48512923). Around the world, significant [numbers](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) of individuals remain less trusting in the safety and efficacy of vaccines generally. One important potential source for people gaining greater trust in the COVID-19 vaccine is the doctor, specifically a patient's primary care doctor, or a child's pediatrician. There is plenty of [evidence](https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018) that doctors are an important source of trust for all sorts of medical [advice](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/next-in-line-9780190626341?cc=us&lang=en&). This [includes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27810314/) advice to patients about receiving different types of [vaccines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614002421), either for themselves or [family](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/5/1532.short) members. But many of us do not have these trusting, ongoing relationships with doctors. "}
