It has since established itself worldwide as a safe, gentle and effective complementary medical approach that seeks to stimulate the body's own healing powers. While conventional medicine typically views symptoms as problematic; they must be suppressed or eliminated. Homeopathic medicine views them as signs of the body attempting to eliminate toxins to rebalance itself. Lisa Abell and Dr. Robert Abell use homeopathic remedies as a way to increase the routes of elimination or \"drainage\" of the body. They use remedies as a way to address the physical, mental and emotional symptoms of a patient. Drainage Homeopathy as taught by the well respected physician, Dr. Gerard Guenoit, is a specific form of homeopathic medicine. This method is taught in Dr. Guenoit's 4 Natural Medicine Schools in France and in Toronto, Canada. Lisa and Dr. Abell use low potency homeopathic remedies to restore and reestablish homeostatic balance in a patient. Homeopathy is the second most widely used system of medicine in the world. Its growth in popularity in the United States has been around 25 to 50 percent a year throughout the last decade. This success is fueled by several factors: Homeopathy is extremely effective. When the correct remedy is taken, results can be rapid, complete and permanent. Homeopathy is completely safe. Even babies and pregnant women can use homeopathy without the danger of side effects. Homeopathic remedies can also be taken alongside other medication without producing unwanted side effects. Homeopathy is natural. Homeopathy works in harmony with your immune system, unlike some conventional medicines, which suppress the immune system. (For example, cough medicines suppress the cough reflex, which is your body's attempt to clear the lungs) Homeopathic remedies are not addictive - once relief is felt, one must stop taking them. If no relief is felt, a patient is probably taking the wrong homeopathic remedy. Homeopathy is holistic and addresses the cause, not the symptoms What is Homeopathic Medicine? Homeopathic remedies are a system of medicine based on three principles: Like cures like. For example, if the symptoms of your cold are similar to poisoning by mercury, then mercury would be your homeopathic remedy. Minimal Dose. The remedy is taken in an extremely dilute form; normally one part of the remedy to around 1,000,000,000,000 parts of water. The Single Remedy. No matter how many symptoms are experienced, only one remedy is taken, and that remedy will be aimed at all those symptoms. Similar principals form the basis of conventional allergy treatment, where the allergic substance is given in a small dose, and in vaccines where a form of the virus is given to bolster the immune system against that particular virus. Homeopathic medicine is an extremely powerful form of natural healing. Its wide use throughout the world, specifically Europe, Canada and India, gives legitimacy to this type of natural medicine. "}
