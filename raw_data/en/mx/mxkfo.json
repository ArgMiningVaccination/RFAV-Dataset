I. Ahmed, Ph.D., Rea Dabelic, Lindsey D. Jager, and Howard M. Johnson, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, U.F ., P .O. Box modulates cytokine signaling by binding to and inhibiting the function of JAKs, ErbB, and other tyrosine kinases. kinase inhibitor that binds to the autophosphorylation site of tyrosine kinases and inhibits activation of STAT transcription factors. We have also shown that a peptide corresponding to the kinase inhibitory region of SOCS-1, SOCS1-KIR, similarly interacts with the activation loop of JAK2 and blocks STAT activation. Poxviruses activate cellular tyrosine kinases such as ErbB-1 and JAK2 in infection of cells. We used the pathogenesis of vaccinia virus in C57BL/6 mice to determine the ability of the SOCS-1 mimetics to protect mice against lethal vaccinia virus infection. Injection of mice i.p. with Tkip or SOCS1-KIR containing a palmitate for cell penetration, before and at the time of intranasal challenge with 2 x 106 pfu of vaccinia virus, resulted in complete protection at 100 \u00b5g. Initiation of treatment 1 day post-infection resulted in 80% survival. Administration of SOCS-1 mimetics by the oral route also protected mice against lethal eects of the virus. Both SOCS1-KIR and Tkip inhibited vaccinia virus transcription and replication at early and possibly later stages of infection. Vaccinia virus induced phosphorylation of ErbB-1 and JAK2 was inhibited by the mimetics. Protected mice mounted a strong humoral and cellular response to vaccinia virus. The use of SOCS-1 mimetics in treatment of poxvirus infections reveals an endogenous regulatory system that previously was not known to have an antiviral function. Eects of West Nile Virus Dose on T emporal Infection the Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) Sheri L. Anderson, Stephanie L. Richards, Chelsea T. Smartt, and Walter J. T abachnick University of Florida/IFAS, Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, 200 9th St. S.E., Vero Beach, FL Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus were fed blood meals containing either 6.7 logs plaque-forming units (pfu)/ mL or 4.8 logs pfu/mL of West Nile virus. Midguts and legs from ve mosquitoes per dose were collected every other day from 4-12 days post-infection (dpi) to investigate temporal midgut infection and dissemination patterns. Midgut infection was assessed with immunofluorescent staining and virus dissemination to the legs was determined with qRT-PCR. Dissemination was calculated as the percentage of midgut infected mosquitoes with infected legs. At 6 dpi, the high dose group showed 100% infection and 80% had disseminated infections. For the low dose group at 6 dpi, only 20% of mosquitoes had infected midguts and none showed disseminated infections. The low dose group showed 80% disseminated infections by 10 dpi. The midgut infection rate at 6 dpi was signicantly dierent between the high (100%) and low dose (20%) groups (p=0.048). Both virus dose groups showed 100% infection and 80% dissemination by 10 and 12 dpi, respectively. This suggests the presence of a midgut escape barrier, regardless of initial virus dose. Our results indicate that virus dose had the greatest eect on infection at 6 dpi. We demonstrate temporal variation patterns of infection and dissemination between doses. This may help explain variation in vector competence seen at dierent points of the extrinsic incubation period due to dierences in environmental factors such as host viremia. Use of molecular docking to identify inhibitors Microbiology, U.F ., Gainesville, 2Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory U.F ., Gainesville, FL Molecular docking is a computational tool that examines the ability of libraries of small molecules whose physical-chemical properties are known to t into chosen sites of protein targets whose crystal structures have been solved. We recently showed that the FadR protein of Vibrio vulnicus, an opportunistic pathogen that contaminates raw seafood, is essential for disease in a mouse model. We used molecular docking to identify small molecules that could inhibit the function of FadR in V. vulnicus. Because the crystal structure of the E. coli FadR protein, which is 52% homologous to the V. vulnicus protein, has been solved, we modeled the structure of the V. vulnicus FadR protein using the Phyre program. We identied amino acids in the DNA binding pocket of FadR to develop coordinates for docking with the small molecules. The DOCK6 program was used on the University of Florida High Performance Computing Facility to examine >130,000 small molecules from the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program library for t in the FadR DNA-binding pocket in 5,000 orientations each. The top 40 hits were obtained from the NCI and were screened for their ability to inhibit growth of V. vulnicus in a 96 well culture assay, read as OD600 in a plate reader. Six compounds inhibited the growth of V. vulnicus at concentrations ranging from 0.025 mM to 0.1 mM. In follow-up culture tube experiments, most of these compounds not only stopped growth of V. vulnicus but also killed the bacteria. This was unexpected since a fadR deletion mutation only slows growth in vitro. We are now examining the ecacy of these compounds to inhibit disease in our mouse model. These results demonstrate the usefulness of molecular docking to rapidly identify small molecules that bind to and inhibit bacterial targets.1 2 3 2Soft Tissue Penetration of Ceftobiprole Following Single Dose Administration in Healthy Adults A. Barbour1, B. Murthy2, S. Schmidt1, S. Sabarinath1, 1University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 2Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Raritan, N.J. Background: Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and has demonstrated clinical ecacy in the treatment of complicated skin and structure infections (cSSSI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the penetration of ceftobiprole into the subcutaneous (sc) adipose and skeletal muscle tissues. Methods: This was a single-center, open-label study in healthy subjects. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the sc adipose and muscle tissues. T welve subjects received a single 2-hour infusion of ceftobiprole 500 mg. Serial plasma (13 samples in 24 hours) and tissue samples (every 20 minutes for the rst 12 hours) were collected and analyzed for ceftobiprole concentrations using validated LC-MS/MS and LC-UV methods, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters for each tissue were determined using noncompartmental analysis. Penetration was measured by the AUC ratio of the tissue to the unbound plasma. Results: Ceftobiprole exposure in plasma exceeds that of skeletal muscle, which exceeds that of sc adipose tissue. Overall penetration of ceftobiprole into skeletal muscle and sc adipose tissue was 69% and 49%, respectively, and was within the range reported for other cephalosporins (12% to 79%). Estimates of plasma CL, V, and t1/2 were comparable to that observed in previous studies. Assuming an MIC of 4 \u00b5g/mL, the %T>MIC exceeded 30% in all tissues studied. Ceftobiprole was well tolerated and no subject was discontinued for a serious adverse event. Conclusion: Ceftobiprole penetrates into the skeletal muscle and sc adipose tissue to a similar extent as other cephalosporins. Development of a tumor registry informatics system for the Florida Center for Brain T umor Research Christopher Barnes, June Nogle, Ph.D., Keith Muller, Ph.D., and Elizabeth Shenkman, Ph.D. Institute for Child Health Policy, Clinical and T ranslational Research Informatics Program, U.F ., Gainesville, FL The Florida Center for Brain T umor Research was established at the University of Florida in 2006. This new center works with hospitals statewide to collect and analyze tumor specimens, and then disseminate data on the characteristics of brain tumors. A web-based computer database system integrated with Bar-coding Label Printers and Scanners was created to collect associated clinical information and to facilitate the submission of tissue, specimen samples, and clinical, radiological and pathologic data fr om multiple sites with the ability to add n sites to the consortium. The database collects basic demographic, radiological, and pathological information on each patient. Additionally, it prompts sites to update information on follow-up survival, MRI, and treatment information every 3 months. Tissue submissions are tracked by detailed information on each specimen, assignment of a unique bar code to each specimen, and automatically printing mailing labels and shipping manifests. This poster will summarize the design of the database, software and hardware systems that support the Florida Brain T umor Research Consortium. Rift Valley Fever: A Multi-Agency T est Of Florida's Response T o An Hypothetical Introduction T o The State Stasia Bembenek1, Greg Christy2, ., Gainesville, FL 2Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Tallahassee, FL Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic viral disease aecting ruminants and people. It was rst recognized, as the name suggests, in the Rift Valley of East Africa, but it now recognized to be an endemic disease aecting most of Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. Since 1970, on occasion, it has shown an ability to spread northwards to cause epidemics in Egypt, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. It is considered an emerging pathogen. The disease in most humans is characterized by fever and malaise, but a small percentage of patients develop either fatal encephalitis and/or generalized hemorrhage. In ruminants, the disease is particularly severe in lambs and calves, which die of generalized hemorrhage; pregnant animals commonly abort. RVF virus is transmitted by several species of mosquito, but human infection is often associated with the slaughter of infected animals for food. Experimental studies have established that US species of mosquito can transmit the virus, and the RVF virus is classied as a select agent. It is feared that RVF virus, if introduced accidentally or through bioterrorism, could have an even greater impact than West Nile virus on the animal and human populations of North America.In partnership with the State's Emergency Operations Center, a multi-agency exercise (State and Federal) was organized through SART to test the Florida's response to a simulated outbreak of RVF in both ruminants and humans. The exercise involved approximately 100 professionals November 18-20, 2008. The outbreak was characterized by increased calf mortality and mild human cases on a large ranch in Southern Florida. A case of hemorrhagic fever in West Palm Beach was connected to the slaughter of goats, and a case of retinitis in Gainesville, FL was connected to the initial introduction of the virus. The introduction of virus to Florida was linked to a bioterrorism event. The poster will describe the scenario and discuss the diculties met by the dierent agencies in combating the spread of the virus and determining its origin. 4 5 6 3Myosin-X Facilitates Shigella Filopodia R.E.Cheney, and F .S. Infectious Diseases, College of Medicine, U.F FL The intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri forms lopodia in order to spread from cell to cell. We have found that as Shigella form lopodia, myosin-X (Myo10) concentrates along the sides of bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes, another intracellular pathogen that induces lopodia formation in host cells does not attract Myo10. To assess the functional signicance of this nding scanning electron micrographs of Shigella-infected HeLa cells were subjected to RNAi knockdown of Myo10 and compared to cells treated with control RNAi. Knockdown of Myo10 was associated with the formation of broad-based lopodia, as compared to control cells in which lopodia were attached by thin stalks. Myo10 knockdown also signicantly reduced the length of Shigella-induced lopodia (mean length 8.6 \u00b1 0.5 um vs. control 11.1 \u00b1 0.5 um), and resulting in a 26% decrease in plaque formation. Live video of GFP-full-length Myo10 and a head-coil-coil GFP-construct revealed that both proteins cycle backward and forward along the sides of the bacteria within lopodia. T ransfection of Cos7 (contain low levels of Myo10) with full-length Myo10, but not the head construct, increased lopodia length (mean length 14.6 \u00b1 0.5 um vs. 11.6 \u00b1 0.4 um). Enhanced lopodia formation required the PH domain of the tail, but not the FERM domain. GFP-Myo10-PH localized to the cell membranes including lopodia, while GFP-Myo10-MyTh4-FERM did not. These ndings suggest Myo10 generates the force to enhance lopodia formation by binding its head region to Shigella-associated actin laments, and its PH tail domain to the host cell membrane. This same mechanism is likely to contribute to Myo10-induced lopodia formation in uninfected cells. Transient Virulence of Benjamin M. Bolker1, Arjun Nanda2, FL 2Food Science & Human Nutrition Department, U.F ., Gainesville, FL Why should emerging pathogens be unusually virulent? Existing theories of virulence evolution that are based on tradeos between rapid transmission and high virulence imply that epidemic growth conditions will select for higher virulence, leading to a transient peak in virulence near the beginning of an epidemic. This transient selection could explain the high virulence of emerging pathogens. Using a simple model of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of emerging pathogens, along with estimated parameters for pathogens such as SARS, West Nile virus (WNV), and myxomatosis, we estimated the potential magnitude and timing of such transient virulence peaks. Pathogens that are moderately evolvable, highly transmissible, and highly virulent at equilibrium could temporarily double their virulence during an epidemic; thus, epidemic-phase selection could contribute signicantly to the virulence of emerging pathogens. We bring together evidence for tradeos and evolvability for other pathogens such as HIV, and discuss the need for better data on tradeo curves and genetic variability. Despite the recent focus on within-host dynamics of pathogens, the genetic and phenotypic properties of virulence tradeos deserve continued attention. Plasmodium Falciparum Signal Peptide Peptidase (Pfspp) As A Novel Target For Malarial Chemotherapy J. Alfredo Bonilla, Tonya D. Bonilla, Charles A. Yowell, John B. Dame Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL The P . intramembrane-cleaving a viable therapeutic drug target. The intramembrane-cleaving proteases are unique in that they catalyze peptide bond cleavage in the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of a membrane. In Plasmodium spp. all three major of intramembrane- Modeling of PfSPP indicates it is an integral membrane protein that spans the membrane nine times by - helical transmembrane segments and retains the C-terminus in the cytosol and the N-terminus in the lumen. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrates that PfSPP is highly transcribed and translated throughout the asexual cycle and most abundant in the trophozoite and schizont Immuno-fluorescence microscopy localizes PfSPP primarily endoplasmic reticulum of the parasite in the trophozoite stage and at the plasma membrane of the daughter merozoites within a late-stage schizont. Inhibitor studies demonstrate that inhibition of PfSPP during all stages of development impairs parasite viability, and inhibitors specic to -secretase activity do not inhibit the growth of the parasite. This important distinction demonstrates PfSPP is a bona-de signal peptide peptidase and suggests that the design of specic inhibitors to the parasite SPP versus human SPP and other presenilin-like homologs is feasible. Moreover, SPP is refractory to disruption in P . berghei, highly suggestive of a critical role in the parasite. In Situ Visualization of the Apicoplast and Apicoplast Nucleoid in Asexual Stages of Plasmodium falciparum Tonya D. Bonilla, J. Alfredo Bonilla, and John B. Dame Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, U.F ., Gainesville, FL Among the most striking sub-cellular morphological features of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite are 7 8 9 10 4the elaborate congurations taken on by the developing apicoplast. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms in which this organelle is replicated and divided in Plasmodium. At the culmination of schizogeny, a segment of the apicoplast is partitioned into each newly formed daughter cell. This process is expected to be directed in part by components of the eukaryotic division apparatus, and may also be linked to the structural characteristics and positioning of the nucleiod, to ensure proper segregation of the apicoplast genome. In this study, combined immunofluoresence and fluorescent in situ hybridization were used to follow both organellar morphology and nucleoid distribution in asexual falciparum. The DNA gyrase inhibitor ciprofloxacin was used to the eects of apicoplast DNA loss on organellar morphology. In untreated parasites, the apicoplast DNA was predominately organized as single discrete nucleoid structures in non-replicating rings and trophozoites. In maturing trophozoite stages when the apicoplast began to elongate, the nucleoid was often visualized as semi-discrete foci at both ends of the elongating apicoplast. As the apicoplast elaborated and began to branch, multiple nucleoids were observed within the apicoplast that varied in shape, size and hybridization intensity, and often appeared to encompass the entire stromal compartment. In ciprofloxacin treated parasites, the nucleoid signal was signicantly reduced in size, intensity and number. Furthermore, in the ciprofloxacin treated parasites the apicoplast signal was highly fragmented. Also, in many instances the apicoplast DNA did not fully co-localize with the apicoplast. These data indicate that the apicoplast nucleoid is required for proper development and segregation of the apicoplast. T oward the Analysis of the Transcriptome Response to West Nile Virus Infection in the Equine Host M. A. Bourgeois1, M. T. Long1, K. K. Seino2, D. S. Barber1, and N. D. Denslow1 1University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville FL 2Washington State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Pullman, WA West Nile virus is one of the leading causes of arboviral encephalitis in the United States. Despite the impact of WNV, little is known about disease pathogenesis and host response to central nervous system infections. The overall goal of this project is to gather and use host expression data from tissues of horses experimentally infected with WNV as a model to develop interventional strategies for viral encephalitis. It is hypothesized that there are gene pathways whose expression changes in a consistent manner during WNV infection, disease, and recovery. This will be investigated by creating a tissue specic expression library from CNS tissues and spleen from na\u00efve and non-na\u00efve horses experimentally infected with WNV and from normal horses. The cDNA library has been sequenced and assembled, resulting in the identication of 41,040 sequences. BLAST analysis of these good sequence hits (e<10-4), including neurologically specic genes, and genes involved with transcription, the immune response, signal transduction, RNA modication, and translation. 73.7% of these databases. predicted databases, while 1,280 (3.1%) of the sequences were missed by all of the equine databases, including the equine genome project. Of the completely novel sequences, 709 (55.4%) of the sequences were grouped under GO categories. An equine specic microarray will be created from this library to analyze changes in gene expression which will be subjected to pathway analysis. Relationships between gene expression and WNV survival will be identied, and biomarkers that can lead to rapid identication of neurological disease established. This information will be used to develop new interventional strategies, predict survival, and create better diagnostic tests for WNV and other viral encephalitides. Crystallographic Studies of Potential HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors Edith Bracho-Sanchez, Koch, Melissa R. Marzahn, Roxana M. Coman, David Ostrov, Ben M. Dunn Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL The Human Immunodeciency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) is known for its high genetic variability and has been divided into types, groups, subtypes, and recombinant forms (1). Subtype A of the HIV-1 virus is mostly found in Sub-Saharan Africa and accounts for 23% of the current 33.2 million infections in the world (2). Current treatment for HIV infections involves the use of protease inhibitors. The HIV protease is crucial in the formation of an infectious virus. We have concerned ourselves with conducting crystallographic studies of the HIV-1 subtype A protease complexed with potential inhibitors suggested by a molecular docking program. We successfully puried the protease and obtained crystal growth two days following crystal trials. The Risk of Arbovirus Transmission Increases as Mosquito Infection Rates Increase: Using Simple Models to Evaluate This Assumption Dulce M. Bustamante, Cynthia C. Lord Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, Vero Beach, FL The \"infection rate\" is an estimate of the arbovirus infection prevalence in a mosquito population. It is used in surveillance to assess the risk of virus transmission to humans and domestic animals. It is assumed that as the \"infection rate\" increases the risk arbovirus transmission also increases. However, not all infected mosquitoes are involved in transmission. Taking that into consideration, we assessed the assumption of linearity between \"infection rate\" and risk by investigating (a) how the infection prevalence in the mosquito population relates to the proportion of those mosquitoes that are capable of virus transmission (infectious), and (b) how the infection prevalence relates to \"infection rates\" obtained after sampling, pooling, and testing mosquitoes for virus. A model was used to approximate the proportion of infected mosquitoes in a cohort that become infectious as a function of temperature, mosquito and virus species. Results suggested that the relationship between the 11 12 13 5proportions of infected and infectious mosquitoes is not linear, and that similar \"infection rates\" estimated at dierent times, under dierent temperatures, or for dierent mosquito-virus systems may not indicate the same level of risk. Numerical simulations were used to study the \"infection rate\" as an estimate of the prevalence of infection in the mosquito population. These simulations suggested that \"infection rates\" usually underestimate prevalence and that they only show true changes in prevalence under certain sampling and testing conditions. In conclusion, the \"Infection rates\" appear not directly related to mosquito infectiousness and risk of transmission, and those rates must be interpreted together with other biological and environmental factors in order to provide a better assessment of the risk of transmission. Analysis of capsule/O-antigen genes in Vibrio parahaemolyticus Yuansha Chen, J. Glenn Morris, Judith A. Johnson Emerging Pathogens Institute, Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, U.F ., Gainesville, FL Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine bacterium that commonly causes infections in human through contaminated seafood. A recent pandemic of V. parahaemolyticus has caused tens of thousands of cases of disease worldwide. Molecular studies indicated that the strains causing the pandemic were closely related or clonal. However, the pandemic strains change their serotypes rapidly and have evolved into more than 20 serovariants in the last decade. This rapid diversication of LPS (O-antigen) and CPS (K-antigen) provides an outstanding model to study the genesis and evolution of polysaccharide antigens and suggests that specic mechanisms may exist to promote recombination in these genes. Thorough understanding of the nature of serotype conversion in V. parahaemolyticus will have strong implications in bacterial vaccine development. We hypothesized that genes for the synthesis of O-antigen and capsule polysaccharide share the same genomic region in V. parahaemolyticus. This region is subject to frequent lateral gene transfer, resulting in the changes of both antigen structures it denes and the rapid emergence of new pandemic serotypes of V. parahaemolyticus from the original virulent strain. We have identied and analyzed the putative LOS/capsule region on chromosome I in the published genome of V. parahaemolyticus. Our data suggests that the capsule exportation is wza dependent in the pandemic strain. We successfully deleted a wza gene in V. parahaemolyticus and generated a translucent mutant (acapsular) using the chitin based transformation method, conrming the function of the putative capsule region. Dierentiation of Mycobacterial Species by the Intergenic Region Between rpoB and rpoC Jianli Dai, Judith A. Johnson, J. Glenn bacteria characterized by a thick hydrophobic, waxy cell wall. Infections by mycobacteria are dicult to treat and post great threat to the public health, including notorious Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and M. leprae. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms posing great risks to human health by causing severe respiratory diseases as well as other infection in human, especially those with immunodeciency. In contrast to TB, NTM infection rates in the U.S. have been rising steadily over the last several decades and have already surpassed that of MTB. However, our understanding of NTM infections as well as diagnostics and treatment methods are limited due to our lack of understanding of the population structure and genetic variability of NTM. With the number of NTM species continuously increases, current typing methods have diculty to identify them accurately. Bioinformatic studies of sequenced mycobacterial genomes revealed several informative loci for typing. Among them, one locus between rpoB and rpoC, flanking by two highly homologous regions is an excellent candidate for dierentiation of mycobacterial species. This locus was sequenced from a collection of mycobacterial strains. As expected, there are dramatic dierences among sequences from dierent species while sequences come from same species are the same. The sequences from this locus are so divergent that they cannot be aligned in a multiple sequence alignment program. This locus can be used alone or combined with other loci in a multilocus sequence typing system for accurate identication of Mycobacterium and will greatly improve the typing method for mycobacteria. Insecticide Resistance of Mosquito Strains in Manatee County, FL Shainnel Eans, Chelsea T. Smartt, & Robert Florida/IFAS, FMEL, 200 9th St. S.E., Vero Beach, FL Mosquitoes play an important role serving as vectors for a wide variety of pathogenic diseases, including malaria, encephalitis, West Nile, dengue, and dengue hemorrhagic fever (Greenwood, 2002). The more temperate and tropical regions of the world nd themselves facing constant outbreaks of these diseases because mosquito populations thrive under these conditions. In an attempt to control mosquito-borne disease outbreaks around the world, the use of insecticides has risen. However, this has also resulted in selection for mosquitoes that possess high tolerance/resistance to many insecticides (Levy 2007). It is important to understand the mechanisms involved with the development of mosquito resistance to insecticides to be able to predict where targeted control measures may be needed and how mosquitoes will react to new insecticides. We may even be able to completely negate or minimize mosquito defenses towards insecticides by directly manipulating genes that control the resistance phenotype or reduce the development of resistance through changes in how insecticides are applied. Thus far we have isolated a two distinct PCR fragments from Culex nigripalpus using esterase primers. A BLAST and VectorBase search revealed that the one of the Cx. nigripalpus translation products shares a high homology (82%) to a protein of unknown function from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus. Additional sequence 14 15 16 6analyses are presently being performed to determine its identity. Using the same search engines for the second isolated translation product, we found that it shares a high homology with the Culex pipiens Esterase-3 gene (86%). We are currently using gene expression studies to determine if it plays a role in the formation of insecticide resistance in Cx. nigripalpus. Using transgenic NPR1 to enhance systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in citrus Vicente J. Febres and Gloria A. Moore Horticultural Sciences Dept and PMCB program, U.F ., Gainesville, FL SAR is an inducible defense mechanism in which infection by a pathogen leads to an enhanced defense state that is long lasting and provides resistance or tolerance to a wide range of pathogens in subsequent challenges. Manifestation of this enhanced defense state is the increased expression of pathogenesis related (PR) genes both at the initial site of infection and systemically. Some PR proteins have demonstrated antimicrobial properties while others have unknown functions and it is thought that their combined action leads to the demise of the invading pathogen(s). The activation of PR genes is preceded by the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and is mediated by the NPR1 protein. NPR1 functions as a co-transcriptional activator and its expression alone does not lead to the activation of SAR but rather primes the plant for the defense response. We have transformed 'Carrizo' citrange and 'Duncan' grapefruit plants with the Arabidopsis NPR1 gene in an attempt to induce broad-spectrum disease resistance in citrus. The regenerated plants have normal phenotypes. Analysis of these plants indicates that some lines show higher expression levels of the PR1 gene (considered a marker for SAR) compared to non-transgenic plants. A few lines were also evaluated for their response to citrus canker. Although complete resistance was not observed, the transgenic plants, on average, had reduced lesion development compared to non-transgenic plants. These lines are being further evaluated for resistance to Huanglongbing (HLB). In addition, a grapefruit line is being evaluated under eld conditions for performance and response to natural infection of pathogens. Biochemical studies of HIV-1 subtype M. Ben M. Dunn1 University of Florida 1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 2Department of Pathology, Gainesville, FL The human immunodeciency virus (HIV) is characterized by signicant genetic diversity, and is divided among types, groups, subtypes, and recombinant forms. The protease inhibitors (PIs) used for HIV treatment were designed for HIV-1 subtype B protease (PR), and information regarding resistance to current PI treatment is largely limited to subtype B PR, which predominates in North America and Western Europe, but accounts for only approximately 12% of the global HIV pandemic. Subtype C, A and D viruses predominate worldwide. We performed kinetic analyses of subtype B and C PRs and the I50L, I50V, and I84V variants in order to compare resistance levels of these mutants in each PR subtype, and to understand what roles the naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 C PR play in drug resistance upon acquisition of the mutations. We determined their Ki values against 8 clinically used PIs. We found that HIV-1 subtype C PR exhibited comparable Ki values to subtype B PR for the inhibitors tested, and that the naturally occurring polymorphisms found in subtype C PR, in combination with the mutations, can influence drug resistance and could provide for a higher level of resistance to PIs when compared to subtype B PR. No signicant changes were seen in catalytic eciencies between B and C PR for both wild type and the I50L mutant. All Ki values determined were in the low-nanomolar to sub-nanomolar range indicating tight binding of the inhibitors. We also obtained crystals of the unbound subtype C I84V and I50L mutants, which were analyzed at a resolution of 1.8 \u00c5. Investigating evolutionary and ecological factors underlying HIV-1 epidemic history in east Africa by Landscape Phylodynamics Rebecca Gray1, Marco Salemi1, Andy T atem2, Oliver Laeyendecker3,4 M. Goodenow1, Thomas C. Quinn3,4 1Department and Laboratory Medicine, U.F ., 2Department ., Gainesville, FL 3Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 4School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD The factors responsible for modern disease epidemics are multi-factorial and involve ecological, political, social, as well as evolutionary influences. Here we introduce a new framework, called \"landscape phylodynamics\", that combines genetic sequence data analysis of pathogens based on coalescent theory (phylodynamics) with geographic and historical data about the territory where the pathogen is found. \"Landscape\" refers to the myriad ways in which humans aect and are aected by environment, and includes geography, land use, infrastructure and migration on a temporal scale. We apply the framework to provide a comprehensive analysis of the social, ecological, and evolutionary causes behind the early emergence of HIV-1 subtypes A and D epidemic in east Africa. By using Bayesian skyline plots inferred from HIV-1 genealogies of the gag and env gene, we show that subtypes A and D were introduced into Uganda in the 1950s - 1960s, preceding the earliest known cases of HIV-1 infection in the region by at least a decade. Both subtypes grew exponentially during the 1970s, coincident with high migratory out-flux from and political upheaval in Uganda. Phylogeographic analysis of viral gene flow also revealed that Uganda was the epicenter of the viral epidemic within east Africa. Furthermore, geographic analysis indicated that east African infrastructure was better developed than in neighboring countries 17 18 19 7in central Africa, oering a possible explanation for the low prevalence of HIV-1 for decades in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in contrast to the almost immediate exponential growth of the virus upon introduction into east Africa. In conclusion, our analysis illustrates how a \"landscape phylodynamic\" approach, which couples phylodynamic inference with geographic data, can oer a powerful framework for understanding and interpreting past epidemics as well as predicting newly emerging outbreaks of infectious diseases. Episodic Compartmentalization of HIV-1 in Breastmilk One Year Post-partum R. R. Gray1, M. Salemi1, G. M. Aldrovandi2, K. D. M. Thea3, L. Kuhn4, M. M. Goodenow1,5 1Department of Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 2Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, CA 3Boston University, Boston, MA 4Columbia University, New York, NY 5Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Background: Breastfeeding remains an essential practice for most HIV-infected women in low resource settings because risks associated with weaning outweigh benets of transmission reduction. Therefore, it is essential to better understand how postnatal transmission occurs so that eective strategies to prevent transmission can be devised while breastfeeding. However, no studies have been published to date describing the molecular evolution of the virus in breast milk. Methods: We analyzed longitudinally sampled HIV-1 envelope sequences from plasma and left and right breastmilk of six women participating in the prospective Zambian Exclusive Breastfeeding T rial. Each tissue was sampled at >3 timepoints during the rst year post-partum. Phylogenies were inferred using a Bayesian framework. Compartmentalization of the virus within tissues was analyzed employing a modied version of the Slatkin-Maddison test and a test for population substructure. Maximum likelihood estimates of the non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio for major internal branches in the phylogeny were obtained to investigate selective pressure. Results: The Bayesian maximum clade phylogeny was inferred for each patient. The Slatkin-Maddison test indicated evidence for compartmentalization of the virus between plasma and breastmilk (p<0.0001) for all patients. Signicant population structure was detected between the breastmilk and plasma virus and between the left and right breastmilk virus (p<0.01) for at least one timepoint. In general, compartmentalization increased with time after delivery. This pattern, found in all patients, suggests episodic compartmentalization of the virus in the breastmilk. Branches under positive selection were detected for all patients, and in general, were more frequent later in infection. Conclusions: The emergence and loss of compartmentalization of the breastmilk virus indicates a much more complex population dynamics underlying HIV-1 evolution within this tissue than previously identied. The reemergence of distinct viral variants and the presence of positive selection at later timepoints suggest that the breastmilk environment is variable and may select for dierent genotypic and phenotypic features. Understanding the complex population dynamic underlying HIV evolution within these tissues may be essential to uncover the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dierential risk of transmission associated with duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. Full-Genome Evolutionary Patterns Analysis of West Nile Virus R. R. Gray1, L. A. Santos2, N. M. C. Veras3, *M. 2Advanced Public Health Laboratory, Goncalo Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus member of the Flaviviridae family. It was rst isolated in Uganda in 1937 and has been associated with severe and even fatal diseases in humans with an overall mortality rate of about 10%. Several human and equine outbreaks have been recorded in portions of Africa, southern Europe, Asia and, since 1999, North America. Despite a number of phylogenetic studies have already been published on WNV, a detailed analysis of phylogenetic signal/noise and evolutionary patterns in dierent genes is still lacking. Methods: We analyzed the 104 WNV full genome sequences available in GenBank. Best-tting nucleotide substitution models, the molecular clock hypothesis, positive versus purifying selection and phylogenetic signal to noise ratio were investigated with both maximum likelihood and Bayesian-based methods. Full-genome alignments as well as three structural and eight non-structural genes were evaluated separately. Results: The NS3 and NS5 genes contained the highest phylogenetic signal to noise ratio. In contrast, the structural genes showed little phylogenetic signal, particularly in the North American dataset. The relaxed clock model tted the data best, although median evolutionary rate estimates were similar to those previously reported using strict-clock methods. Several sites in the non-structural genes were identied as evolving under positive selection. Most importantly, in all analyses, the concatenated NS3NS5 dataset provided the same resolution as the full genome alignments. Conclusions: Current phylogenetic studies are frequently based on genes containing poor phylogenetic signal/noise ratio. Our results suggest that a greater emphasis should be placed in studying NS3 and NS5 regions to elucidate WNV evolutionary dynamics. Dynamics of Eective Population Size of Hiv-1 Correlates with Disease Progression in Natural Infection *R. R. Gray1, M. Salemi1, J. Sleasman2, M. M. Laboratory Medicine, U.F ., Gainesville, FL 2Department of Pediatrics, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL20 21 822We studied viral evolutionary patterns in longitudinal samples from nine therapy na\u00efve pediatric subjects to determine robust predictors of progression to AIDS during the natural course of human immunodeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-1 intra-host evolution was monitored by sequencing multiple clones of the viral envelope over time. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to infer non-parametric estimates of HIV-1 eective population size (Ne) during infection which was compared with clinical information including viral load and CD4 counts. Individuals were classied into three groups based on immune parameters: consistently high CD4 percentage (>25%) throughout infection; initially high CD4% followed by a irreversible decline (<15%); and persistently low CD4% (<25%) throughout the course of the study. Subjects who either maintained a high CD4% throughout infection or began the study with low immune counts exhibited a constant and low Ne throughout infection. In contrast, individuals with initially high CD4% followed by a crash exhibited a spike in viral Ne >2000 ~ 6-12 months prior to immune failure. Viral load taken at the last timepoint showed a lognormal relationship with the peak Ne value. A model based on immune system pressure, viral population size, net adaptation rates, and target cell availability demonstrated that Ne is a robust indicator to predict immunological failure in HIV-infected individuals. These novel ndings could inform optimal initiation of costly and toxic drug therapies. Bacillus anthracis T oxins Paralyze Neutrophil Actin-based Motility Sarah Wei Wei-Jen T ang2 and Frederick S. Southwick, MD1 1Division of Diseases, College of Medicine, U.F ., Gainesville, FL 32610, Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 2Ben May Department for Cancer Research, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 Inhalation anthrax results in high-grade bacteremia and shock that is accompanied by a blunted rise in the peripheral neutrophil count and a paucity of neutrophils in infected pleural fluid. Edema toxin (ET) is one of the major Bacillus anthracis virulence factors and consists of the adenyl cyclase, edema factor (EF) and protective antigen (PA). Relatively low concentrations of ET (100-500ng/ml) signicantly impair human neutrophil chemokinesis, chemotaxis and the ability to polarize. These changes are not accompanied by a signicant change in CD11/CD18 receptor expression with ET or LT alone, however the combination of the two toxins causes a signicant decrease in receptor expression. Toxin treatment is also associated with a 30% reduction in FMLP-stimulated F-actin content. ET treatment also reduces speed of monocytogenes intracellular actin-based motility by 30%, and decreases actin lament tail length by 50% in HeLa cells. These defects in actin assembly are accompanied by >20 fold increase in intracellular cyclic-AMP and a >4 fold increase in the phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA). Our results demonstrate that ET and the combination of ET + LT is able to suppress human neutrophil migration and polarity, and these defects are a consequence of a decrease in the adhesion receptor and a reduction in actin assembly, that in turn may be mediated by high intracellular levels of cyclic-AMP and the phosphorylation of PKA. Stigma and Additional Factors Influencing the Eectiveness of TB Contact Investigations among Mexicans Living in Florida P . Hamsho-Diaz, MD, MA; K. Simpson, MSHSE; M. Southeastern National T uberculosis Center, U.F ., College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL The role of electrical potentials in H+ V-ATPase-coupled membrane energization of disease vector mosquitoes William R. Harvey, Kenneth M. Sterling and Bernard A. Okech Whitney Laboratory, University of Florida, St. Augustine, FL H+ V-ATPases impose voltages across many types of plasma membranes in the alimentary canal of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti larvae. The voltages are used to drive uptake of essential amino acids by Na+-coupled amino acid symporters (co-transporters) and to rid cells of toxic acids by exchange of intracellular H+ for extracellular Na+ via transporters of larval epithelia are unlike those of most vertebrate epithelia which use Na+ concentration dierences to absorb nutrients from the alimentary canal and to secrete toxic acids into it. More than two dozen of the voltage-driven amino acid transporters and other voltage-driven carriers have been cloned and several if them have been used to prepare antibodies. We have prepared brush border membrane vesicles from whole larvae and shown by antibody labeling that they contain three of the transporters that are essential for amino acid uptake, pH regulation and Na+ conservation - all necessary for mosquito survival. We are arranging to cooperate with an industrial rm to use the BBMV preparation in a screen for inhibitors that can be developed as new environmentally safe and inexpensive mosquitocides. Response of Phlebotomus papatasi (Diptera: Psychodidae) to Commercial Gainesville, Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology, Gainesville, FL 3U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3, Cairo, Egypt 4Departments of Entomology and Nematology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 5Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) is the primary Old World vector of the etiological agents responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis from North Africa east into India and a vector of several phleboviruses. The World Health Organization has recently recognized leishmaniasis as an important neglected tropical disease, aecting the health of over 12 million people throughout 88 countries worldwide. We tested four commercial adult mosquito traps marketed for homeowner use in residential settings against a CDC light trap, routinely used for sand fly surveillance for ecacy in collecting sand flies. Our traps included the Mosquito Magnet (MM) Pro, the Sentinel 360 mosquito trap, the BG-sentinel mosquito trap, and the Mega-Catch trap. The BG-sentinel and CDC light traps were baited with 2 kg dry ice nightly, Sentinel 360 and Mega-Catch traps were not, while the MM Pro produced its own CO2. T raps were not baited with optional lures (lactic acid, octenol baits) that are recommended for some models. T raps were rotated through ve sites in a 5x5 Latin square experiment in a small farming village in the Nile River Valley 10 km north of Aswan, Egypt. Four repetitions were conducted during the height of the sand fly season (June, August (2x) and September, 2007) at a site in which P . papatasi is abundant and Leishmania-free. 6,440 sand flies were collected over four trials, 6,037 of which were P . papatasi (93.7%). The BG trap collected signicantly more (P < 0.05) P . papatasi than the Mega-Catch and Sentinel 360 traps and more than the MM Pro and CDC light trap. Order of success and trap means (\u00b1SE) were: BG trap, 142.1 (45.8) > MM Pro, 56.8 (40.1) > CDC trap, 52.3 (27.5) > Mega-Catch trap, 38.2 (28.5) > Sentinel 360 mosquito trap 12.6 (8.2). Results indicate new, commercial traps are a suitable substitute for CDC light traps in sand fly surveillance programs. Unlit, CO2-baited commercial traps performed much better than lit commercial traps lacking CO2 production. First Responders Online: Problem Solving and Critical Thinking Training For Emergency Personnel Responding T o Pathogen Outbreaks Tracy Irani1, Maria Gallo2, Lisa Hightower1, Ricky T elg1, Brian Myers1 Education and Communication Department, 305 Box 110540, Gainesville, Cancer/Genetics Research Complex, Gainesville, FL 32610 Over 40 years of research into the psychology of risk and crisis management shows that dealing with human factors related to how emergency responders solve problems and work together in teams is of crucial importance to insure optimal outcomes and mitigation of risk. A criticism of conventional emergency responder training has been that while such training may do a good job of helping participants understand how to deal with a known crisis, it is inadequate at preparing responders for the next crisis. In these situations, team process skills, eective crisis management and communication, and the ability to draw on critical thinking skills to facilitate eective decision making become crucial components of the emergency response process. First Responders Online is a prototype training component focused on the development of eective problem solving and team process skills among emergency responders, scientic researchers and other personnel who would be involved in biodefense or emerging infectious disease emergencies. The training is made up of four modules: critical thinking, persuasion and the media, problem solving, and group problem solving. Case studies and multimedia components have been integrated into the modules to make the material more dynamic and interactive. A wiki has been created to allow participants to discuss with each other skills they are learning, in eect building an online community. College students studying in academic elds focused on disease control and pathogen outbreaks may also benet from going through the training. The modules oer students hands-on curriculum in critical thinking and problem solving, as it applies to emergency pathogen outbreak situations. This project was developed by the Scientic Thinking & Educational Partnership (STEP) program, and funded by the Emerging Pathogens Institute and the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS). T ubercle Resorption and Epithelial Remodeling Wolfe3 1Environmental Health Program, & Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute; U.F ., Gainesville, Sciences, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ., Madison, NJ 3Environmental Pathology Labs, Sterling, VA The reduction of nuptial tubercles in male fathead minnows resulting from exposure to environmental estrogens is well documented. However, knowledge regarding tubercle alterations at the cellular level is poorly understood. In this study, histological tubercle data was analyzed from a study in which male fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, were exposed to 0, 20 or 40 ng/L 17 -ethinylestradiol (EE2) for 21 days. The focus was to investigate EE2-exposed alterations in male fathead minnow nuptial tubercle morphology. Fish exposed to EE2 tubercles compared with control sh (ANOVA, p 0.001). This, in turn, was related to the increased incidence of tubercle resorption (Kruskal-Wallis AOV, p were observed atrophy AOV, = and was marginally increased in EE2-exposed sh (Kruskal-Wallace AOV, p = 0.06). These alterations occurred with signicant decreases in 11-ketotestosterone, testosterone, and estradiol (11-KT, T, and E2 respectively, ANOVA, p 0.03). This analysis conrmed the regression in tubercles observed under light microscopy and describes signicant cellular changes in tubercle structure resulting from hormonal alterations in sh exposed to estrogenic compounds. In addition, this is the rst report to describe tubercle regression through the use of histological analysis in fathead minnows. Extensive remodeling of these secondary sex characteristics, known to be under hormonal control, has ramications for male reproductive success and provides novel insights into the cellular physiology that underpins the formation and regression of keratinized tubercles in sh. Using Cell-Free Protein of Florida and Aerospace Engineering 3Molecular Genetics and Microbiology Keywords: Cell- free, protein expression, ricin, 96- well plate, luciferaseCell-free protein expression has been investigated to replace conventional cellular protein expression methods for obtaining various proteins. The method is based on the fact that cells are not needed for synthesizing proteins as long as the machinery necessary for protein synthesis such as ribosomes and amino acids are available. One of the methods developed to sustain protein synthesis reactions for a longer period of time and as a result increase protein expression yield is supplying these reactions with the energy and amino acids necessary for protein synthesis through a semipermeable membrane. The process is called continuous exchange cell-free (CECF) protein synthesis. We have successfully designed and fabricated a 96 well-plate where CECF protein synthesis can be applied and have shown the improvement of protein yield over a regular microplate. In addition we have successfully synthesized six proteins that can be optically detected as they are being synthesized in the designed plate. Ricin functions as a protein synthesis inhibitor by catalyzing the ricin/sarcin loop in 28s ribosomal subunit. We have successfully shown that ricin can be detected through its mechanism of action; the dierence between a positive control where no ricin is added and one where ricin is added would show a reduction in the amount of protein expressed. We have shown the reduction in luciferase expression by testing the resulting luminescence when adding ricin and comparing it to the amount of luminescence when no ricin is present in the reaction. Using the microplate we have developed, the luminescence can be measured straight from the expression device using a plate reader. Activation of Cd4+Cd25+ Regulatory T Cell Suppressor Function By Analogs Of The Selecting Peptide Joseph Larkin III 1,2, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104 and 2 Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory (T reg) cells can undergo both thymic selection and peripheral expansion in response to self-peptides that are agonists for their T cell receptors (TCRs). However, the specicity by which these TCRs must recognize peptide:MHC complexes in order to activate T reg cell function is not known. We show that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T reg cells can mediate suppression in response to peptides that are only weakly crossreactive with the self-peptide that induced their formation in vivo. Moreover, suppression could be eciently activated by peptide analogs that were inecient at inducing CD69 up-regulation, and that also induced little or no proliferation of na\u00efve CD4+CD25-Foxp3- T cells expressing the same TCR. These ndings provide evidence that self-peptide-specic CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T reg cells can exert regulatory function in response to self- and/or pathogen-derived peptides with which they are only weakly crossreactive. The Eect of Foreign Birth and Race on All-Cause Mortality in Patients Diagnosed With T uberculosis M Lauzardo1 K Palmer2 1The University of Florida, Southeastern National T uberculosis Center, Gainesville, FL 2Karolinska Insitutet, Stockholm, Sweden Isolation and Characterization of Vibrio Gainesville, FL 32610 2International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh 3Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, U.F ., Gainesville, FL 36611 V. vulnicus, a gram-negative bacterium distributed worldwide in estuarine and marine environments, can cause serious human illnesses, including wound infections, septicemia and gastroenteritis. People with underlying chronic diseases acquire the bacterium upon consumption of raw and undercooked seafood, especially oysters and sh. While oysters are considered to be a major reservoir of V. vulnicus in the U.S., necrotizing wound infections associated with injuries caused by aquacultured sh such as tilapia are increasingly being recognized as a reservoir of this bacterium, as evidenced by the recent report of 62 cases of V. vulnicus infection in Israel 29 30 31 32 11attributed to the handling and eating of tilapia. A single case of V. vulnicus infection (upon consumption of tilapia) has also been reported from Canada. To meet the growing demand for protein, policymakers in a number of countries, including Bangladesh are encouraging their citizens to increase aquaculture production of tilapia. To assess the potential health risk from V. vulnicus linked to the handling and consumption of tilapia sh in aquaculture environments in areas such as Bangladesh, we screened coastal aquaculture ponds, and tilapia, for the presence of V. vulnicus for a three month period beginning in May, 2008. During our study period, we collected a total of 42 tilapia sh and water samples from coastal aquaculture ponds. As controls, we also collected 24 tilapia sh and water samples from fresh water aquaculture ponds. While none of the tilapia sh and water samples obtained from fresh water aquaculture ponds yielded V. vulnicus, 24 (57%) of 42 samples collected from coastal aquaculture ponds yielded a total of 33 V. vulnicus isolates. A battery of biochemical tests revealed that all 33 V. vulnicus isolates belong to biotype 1. PCR and ribotyping analyses conrm that all of the strains possess virulence gene, vvhsp, and belong to ve ribotypes. This is the rst report of isolation of V. vulnicus from tilapia in Bangladesh. At this point, none of the isolates showed evidence of antimicrobial resistance; however, given the known heavy (and unregulated) usage of antibiotics in aquaculture settings, subsequent development of resistance would not be unexpected. Currently there are no data on rates of illness associated with V. vulnicus in Bangladesh. Our ndings suggest the need for caution among persons working in coastal aquaculture, and the need for surveillance for V. vulnicus infections in these and other high-risk populations. Isolation and Characterization of Phage Display scFv Antibodies to Flagella of Escherichia Martin*, T. Finnegan, and P .A. Gulig Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida. Compared with traditional antibody techniques, phage display enables the rapid isolation of recombinant antibodies. We used the Tomlinson J single chain F variable (scFv) phage display library to isolate reagents that recognize Enterohemorrhagic E. coli EDL933, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. After three rounds of panning on crude flagella, 18 of 22 phage clones were positive by ELISA. In a Western blot these clones reacted with a band corresponding to the flagellin protein. Some clones reacted with only the upper region of the band, suggesting that they may recognize carbohydrate modication of the flagella. Placing the phagemids in a suppressor-free E. coli failed to yield scFv protein for most clones. DNA sequencing of these phagemids identied three unique clones, and the clones that failed to produce scFv protein had two internal stop codons. We repaired these stop codons and recovered scFv protein, but only one scFv reacted with flagella. We are manipulating the sequence of the other clone to restore its antigen-binding properties. The phage clones were examined for specicity by ELISA with whole cells of O157:H7 strain EDL933 and K12 strain MG1655. One clone was for while the other also cross-reacted with K12. Neither clone reacted with whole cells of an isogenic flagellin mutant. The scFv proteins from these clones did not react with whole cells expressing flagella possibly due to low avidity. We also used a high throughput scFv screen to directly isolate functional scFv-secreting clones without rst screening phages. Approximately 200 clones were induced to produce scFv in 96 well cultures and tested by a high throughput ELISA with flagella. Sixteen positive clones were veried in a Western blot for reactivity with the flagellin, demonstrating the usefulness of this high throughput method. We are genetically engineering these scFv clones to optimize their usefulness. Bacterial Resistance Issues in Wound Care and Wound Dressings A. Mikhaylova1, B. Liesenfeld1, D. Moore1, G. Schultz1,2 1Quick-Med Technologies, Inc. 2University of Florida The emergence of bacteria resistant to various agents has been a developing public health issue for some time. Overuse of antibiotics, in healthcare as well as in the food supply, is considered a likely cause for the emergence of more and more strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bacterial strains have also demonstrated the ability to generate resistance to silver - a common active ingredient in antimicrobial products such as wound dressings. Scientists have identied at least three genes associated with silver resistance (Sil- E, R and S). Additionally, there is evidence in the literature that strains of organisms with resistance to a specic agent also display a higher tolerance to other antimicrobial agents, which is attributed the development of eux pump mechanisms (cellular mechanisms that can expel certain antimicrobials before they are able to act on their cellular targets). We provide an overview of how bacteria acquire and transmit resistance. Consideration is also provided on how this may aect the healthcare provider, and the types of products utilized to prevent infections now and in the future. Quick-Med has developed an antimicrobial technology based on surface bound cationic polymeric materials (NIMBUS). This technology was tested by exposing 10 consecutive generations of E. coli to the material in such as manner as to recover survivors. The results of the experiments showed that the bacteria did not generate resistance to NIMBUS after prolonged and repeated exposure. We attribute the lack of resistance development to the mechanism of kill, which is through disruption of the cellular membrane, rather than by targeting specic intracellular targets. We conclude that high molecular weight antiseptics anchored to a surface pose the lowest possible risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

Box 54840, Nairobi, Kenya 5African Medical Research Foundation 6Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD), Ministry of Health, Nairobi, Kenya The integrated malaria management (IMM) practices was assessed among community members of Mwea division, central Kenya using a knowledge attitude and practices (KAP) survey. The KAP study evaluated case management practices at the home and hospitals, personal protection measures and vector control methods. Concurrently, malaria infection prevalence in the outpatient department at the referral hospital in the area was examined. The indoor resting population of the major malaria mosquito and their sporozoite infection status were evaluated. The daily risk of malaria transmission in the entire division was calculated using the entomological inoculation rates (EIR). Three hundred and eighty nine households in Mwea division participated in the KAP study while 90 houses were surveyed for EIR. Ninety eight percent of the households knew about malaria while approximately 70% of households knew its symptoms and its management methods. 97% of households went to a health center for malaria diagnosis and treatment. Also 81% used anti-malarial medicines bought from local pharmacies. Almost 90% of households reported owning and using an insecticide treated bed net and 81% reported buying the nets within the last 5 years. The mosquito reduction measures reported included in order of preference, environmental management (35%), mosquito repellent and smoke (31%) insecticide canister sprays (11%), and window and door screens (6%). The management of malaria cases, personal protection and mosquito reduction measures comprise an integrated malaria management (IMM) package. Over the last 4 years prior to this study, the malaria cases in the community hospital reduced from about 40% in 2000 to less than 10% by 2004 and by the year 2007 malaria cases decreased to zero while a onetime cross-sectional malaria parasite survey in 2005 detected no Plasmodium infection in 300 primary school children in the area. Mosquito vector populations were low and variable within the study villages. The EIR remained low and was estimated at 0.011 infectious bites per person per day. The use of malaria control tools in an integrated in central Kenya might have influenced the decreased malaria cases in the district hospital and in the school children. A vigorous campaign emphasizing IMM should be adopted and expanded in Mwea division and in other areas with dierent eco-epidemiological patterns of malaria transmission. With sustained implementation and support from community members integrated malaria management can reduce malaria signicantly in aected communities in Africa.

Infection of Alveolar Macrophages by Canine Influenza Virus Potentiates Tnf-Alpha Repsonse to Lipopolysaccharide and Induces Cell Death J.R. Powe and W.L. Castleman Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Secondary bacterial pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs naturally infected with canine influenza virus (CIV). We tested the hypothesis that prior infection of alveolar macrophages with CIV induces cell death and augments the macrophage TNF-alpha response to bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby contributing to the severity of disease seen in CIV infection with secondary bacterial pneumonia. Canine alveolar macrophages were isolated from mongrel dogs and were incubated in culture with CIV (Influenza A/Canine/FL/04) for 1 hour. LPS was added to culture media at 0, 3 or 6 hours after virus incubation. Samples of supernatant were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after virus incubation and TNF-alpha levels were measured by ELISA. TNF-alpha levels in virus-inoculated, LPS exposed cells were above those seen in cells inoculated with virus alone, or mock-inoculated cells exposed to LPS. Additionally, cells inoculated with virus lost viability as measured by trypan blue assay by 24 hours after inoculation. The results are 35 36 37 13consistent with the hypothesis that infection of alveolar macrophages with CIV contributes to disease severity in secondary bacterial pneumonia by inducing cell death and augmenting macrophage TNF-alpha response to bacterial components such as LPS. Mhc-I And Mhc-Ii Restricted T Cells Important For A Broadly-Eective Aids Vaccine R. Pu, E. Sato, J.K. Coleman, and J.K. Yamamoto Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida Objective: Protective vaccines for human (HIV-1) and feline (FIV) immunodeciency viruses must provide protection against viruses of multiple heterologous subtypes. Prototype and commercial dual-subtype FIV vaccine, consisting of inactivated subtype-A and -D viruses, confer protection against both homologous- and heterologous-subtype strains. Passive-transfer studies using antibodies from vaccinated cats revealed homologous-subtype protection can be mediated by vaccine-induced antibodies. However, cross-subtype protection was not mediated by vaccine-induced antibodies. Hence, the cellular-immune mechanisms of this vaccine protection were evaluated to provide insights to the immunity needed for a broadly-eective HIV-1 vaccine. Methods: Three adoptive-transfer (A-T) studies were performed with semi-inbred donor-recipient were transfused intravenously to MLR-matched recipients one day before challenge with homologous FIVPet (Studies 1-2) or heterologous-subtype-B pathogenic FIVFC1 (Study 3). FIV infection was determined by immunoblot analysis for FIV-specic antibodies and by virus isolation of PBMC and lymphoid tissues using reverse-transcriptase and proviral-PCR analyses. Protective mechanisms were characterized by MHC-I/II sequencing, T-cell functional phenotyping, and functional epitope mapping. Results: In Studies 1-2, 7 of 8 recipients of T cells, 2 of 3 recipients of CD4+ T cells, and 2 of 3 recipients of CD8+ T cells from vaccinated/MLR-matched cats were protected against FIVPet, but eight recipients of PBS, B cells from vaccinated/MLR-matched donors, or T cells from nonvaccinated donors were unprotected. Protected recipients and donors were generally matched at MHC-I sequence, while unprotected recipients and donors were unmatched at MHC-I or MHC-II sequence. In Study 3, 3 of 5 recipients of T cells from vaccinated/MLR-matched donors were protected against FIVFC1, but ve recipients of PBS or MLR-unmatched T cells were unprotected. The vaccine-induced Furthermore, functional epitope mapping of virus proteins using CFSE proliferation analysis suggest that both CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells from vaccinated donors recognize the same epitopes. The use of semi-inbred cats also provided more consistent responses to the specic epitopes when the cells were from animals with the same feline MHC haplotype. Conclusions: Vaccine-induced suggest that both CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells from vaccinated donors frequently respond to the same virus epitopes for maximum functional response. These are the rst studies to utilize the FIV/semi-inbred-cat model for characterizing the cellular immune correlates of vaccine protection against a naturally occurring, AIDS-inducing, multi-subtype lentivirus. The ndings from this model should provide important insights for developing a broadly eective HIV-1 vaccine. This work was funded by NIH R01-AI30904. Comparative Analysis of Dierent Typing Methods on Yersinia pestis Strains Isolated from Endemic Foci of Plague in the Republic of Georgia Chythanya Alexander Sulakvelidze1,2 1Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA 2Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA 3National Center for Diseases and Public Health, Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia Forty Y. pestis strains isolated from endemic foci of plague in the Republic of Georgia, and 6 Y. pestis strains isolated in neighboring former Soviet Union countries were analyzed for their genetic relatedness by pulsed eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Multi Locus Variable Tandem Repeats Analysis (MLVA) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). In addition, the DNA of 11 Y. pestis strains isolated in the United States, and published nucleotide sequences from Y. pestis strains KIM, CO92 and 91001, were compared to those of the 46 strains in our collection, using MLST based on sequence data from the (caf1, lcrV, psaA and pla) were sequenced and analyzed. T wo clusters of strains were identied by MLST. One contained predominantly (95%) Georgian strains, and the other contained predominantly (95%) non-Georgian strains. PFGE also identied two major clusters and, in agreement with the MLST data, it also clustered the Georgian Y. pestis strains separately from the non-Georgian strains. MLVA also separated Georgian strain from non Georgian strains better than MLST and PFGE and it identied several subgroups among strains that were indistinguishable by both MLST and PFGE. From the analysis it appears that MLST is ideal for identifying genetic relatedness between species, MLVA for intra-species and PFGE for both inter and intra species relatedness.38 39 14Draft Genome Sequences of T Henry. S. Gibbons5, and Alexander Sulakvelidze1,2 1Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 2Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 3National Center for Diseases and Public Health, Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia 4University of Maryland, MD 5US Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, exists today in discrete, geographically dened foci each of which presents dierent microevolutionary pressures. We have obtained draft genome sequences of two Y. pestis isolates (G3768 and G1670) isolated from mountain voles (Microtus arvalis) from the Republic of Georgia. In silico analysis of VNTR, CRISPR regions indicate that these strains are highly similar to previously determined sequences from another Georgian strain G8786, previously grouped with other Y. pestis subsp. caucasus strains. The pMT1 plasmid resembles that of another Georgian strain previously sequenced and the sequenced Y. pestis subsp. caucasus strain Pestoides F (also known as Y. pestis subsp. microtus), being approximately 30 kb larger than the pMT1 plasmids of most Y. pestis strains. Like most Antiqua and Medeivalis biovar strains, G3768 the sequenced strains further resembles Antiqua and Medeivalis strains in that its genome encodes the entire flagellar locus at YPO0739-0754, and a repeat within this region resembles most closely that found in another microtus strain 91001. YPO0757-0780 are missing in this strain. In general, our draft genome sequences conrm the microarray data of Hinchlie et al. for a related Georgian strain G8786 (Genome Res. 2003, 13:2018-2029). Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis revealed this strain to be highly similar to Pestoides F , several SNPs were unique to G3768 among sequenced strains. Other notable features include the aspA gene contains a non-synonymous SNP that also occurs in Pestoides F that leads to replacement of leucine at position 363 with serine. G3768 also contains an lcrV gene that closely resembles Y. pestis subsp. pestis strains. The eect of these substitutions on virulence or host specicity of G3768 and G1680 is unknown. West Nile Virus Infection Alters Gene Expression in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) Stephanie L. Richards, Sheri L. Anderson, Jennifer S. Erickson and Chelsea T. Smartt University of Florida/IFAS, FMEL, 200 9th St. S.E., Vero Beach FL Alterations in gene expression in the midgut of female Culex quinquefasciatus exposed to West Nile virus were investigated. Fluorescent Dierential Display was used to analyze gene expression dierences in Cx. quinquefasciatus midgut tissue before and after exposure to a known titer of WNV. Results from the display revealed 26 cDNA bands exhibiting reproducible dierences after feeding on infected blood, of these 21 showed an increase in expression and 5 showed a decrease in expression as a result of WNV presence. Eleven cDNA bands exhibiting increased expression following infection with WNV were cloned. Several of these were novel transcripts and did not match any sequences in the Genbank. VectorBase, Pfam and BLAST database searches revealed one G12A2, shares identity (85%) with Cx. quinquefasciatus Toll-like receptors from Aedes eagypti. Leucine-rich repeats are sequence motifs present in many proteins that participate in protein-protein interactions. Here we present the rst cDNA clone isolated from female Cx. quinquefasciatus midgut tissue whose protein product may interact with WNV and play a role in disease transmission. Age And Race-Specic Rates Of Initial Hpv Vaccine Initiation Among Females Aged 9 - 20 Enrolled In Florida Medicaid Robert L. Cook, Jianyhi Zhang, Heather G. Steingraber, T eresa Brumback, A Arcomone, Chris Mallison Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, and the Florida Center for Medicaid and the Uninsured, University of Florida, and the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration Background: The Gardasil HPV vaccine was approved by the FDA in June, 2006, and recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices in March, 2007. Specic recommendations are to vaccinate girls aged 11-12, with catch-up vaccination for women up to age 26. The objectives of this study were to determine age- and race-specic rates of uptake of the HPV vaccine during the initial year after vaccine approval. Methods: Using administrative Medicaid data for the period 7/1/06 -8/31/07, we identied all enrolled females aged 9 - 20 (n=416,829). Overall and group-specic rates of rst HPV vaccine administration were calculated by dividing the number of females who received their rst HPV vaccine by the number of enrolled women within each time interval. Rates were determined for consecutive 2-month intervals and adjusted to rates per 1000 woman-years. The work was supported in part by a research grant from Merck. Results: 9612 women received their rst HPV vaccination through Florida Medicaid during the follow-up period. Vaccination rates increased over time and were still increasing at censorship. During the nal 2-month interval (July-August, 2007), vaccination rates were highest in girls aged 11-12 (175 vaccinations per 1000 woman-years), followed by ages vaccinations), ages 16-18 (73 vaccinations), 9-10 (37 vaccinations), and were lowest in women aged 19-20 (3.1 vaccinations per 1000 woman years). When examined by race/ethnicity, vaccination 40 4241 15rates at each time point were lowest among black women compared to white and Hispanic women. Conclusion : Vaccination rates increased initially after the ACIP recommendation, mostly among females aged 11 - 15. Few women aged 19 - 20 had received the vaccine, despite recommendations and access to vaccine coverage. Strategies to improve HPV vaccination rates to young women seen in internal medical practice may be needed. These initial data also suggest the possibility of racial disparities in HPV vaccine uptake. Future analyses will examine trends over the subsequent year and examine individual, provider, and system level variables associated with HPV vaccine uptake. Microbiological Surveillance of Animal Source Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in species of veterinary interest in Central Florida Shannon Ro, Katherine Maldonado, DVM, Carmen Glotfelty, Maureen T Long, DVM, PhD University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Infectious Disease and Pathology Gainesville, FL Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of nosocomial and community acquired infections in human populations, little information exists regarding the signicance of MRSA in animal populations. Further concerns include transfer of MRSA between animals and humans in close contact. Initial studies performed at the University of Florida determined the prevalence of MRSA within the companion animal population of Florida, through nasal swabs collected from hospitalized horses, dogs, and cats. Six samples were colonized with MRSA and further studies on virulence genes indicated the presence of human community acquired MRSA with two USA 300 isolates that were positive for the Panton-Valentine leucocidin PVL virulence gene and were positive for the Staphylococcus chromosome cassette IVa. Four other MRSA were had variable virulence proles. Additional culturing on 50 nasal swabs collected from stray dogs and cats, representing animals with minimal veterinary care and minimal human contact. No MRSA was found in any of these samples. In a hospital barn of a large milking herd, no cattle with gram positive mastitis were positive for any MRSA. The prevalence of S. aureus was similar to that observed in the previously analyzed hospitalized dogs, cats, and horses; however MRSA was not detected in the milk any gram positive mastitis samples or animals with limited human contact.

Holt1 and Gregory U.F FL 32611 2Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205 Wild city rats carry a large variety of zoonotic pathogens, and raise \"spillover\" risk to human populations living in urban areas. Domestic and feral cats prey on these rats. Theoretical studies show that such predation can potentially influence pathogen prevalence in host populations. We are conducting both empirical and theoretical studies of this phenomenon. Field data on Baltimore Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) reveal that both hantavirus prevalence and predation occur predominantly among juvenile rats weighing 100-200g; cats usually avoid large adult rats (>200g), and nestlings stay hidden in underground burrows. We incorporate these features in a simple stage-structured rat population model with three age classes: young, juvenile and adult, which loosely correspond to <100g, 100-200g and >200g by body weight, respectively. The pathogen in our model circulates only among juvenile rats, and is modeled using SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics and frequency-dependent transmission. Cats are modeled as a generalist predator attacking only juvenile rats with a saturating functional response. An interesting outcome of this model is that the mean pathogen prevalence exhibits a hump-shaped relationship with predation pressure for a wider range of predator foraging choices than reported earlier with generic SIR models (Holt and Roy, AmNat. 2007; Roy and Holt, TPB 2008), including when cats selectively attack only infectious rats. Early data from eld studies conducted in our Baltimore residential study area (Glass et al. unpubl.) appear to display such hump-shaped pattern between cat numbers and SEOV (Seoul Virus) prevalence in rats. Future extensions to the theoretical work will incorporate crucial details of the empirical system, such as spatial and social structure in the rat population. Nisin, Rosemary and Ethylenenediaminetetraacetic Acid Aect the Growth of Listeria monocytogenes on Ready- o-Eat T urkey Ham Stored at 4\u00b0C for Sixty- Three Days A. Ruiz1, S. K. Hinton, Jr.2, G. E. Rodrick3, N. Djeri1 1Department of Animal Sciences, P .O. Box 110910, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611- 0910, 2USDA ARS Richard B. Russell Agricultural Research Center, Athens, GA, 3Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL The objectives of this study were to determine the anti-Listeria and general antimicrobial properties of nisin, rosemary, and Ethylenenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) alone and in combination on Listeria monocytogenes inoculated on ready-to-eat vacuum packaged diced turkey ham, and to ascertain the eects of the treatments on pH and objective color. The turkey hams were cut into 0.5 cm pieces, inoculated with a L. monocytogenes cocktail containing ve strains of the bacterium, and treated with either 1) no treatment and no inoculum (negative control), 2) inoculum only (positive control), 3) 0.5% 4) 20mM 1% or 9) 43 44 45 1620mM EDTA + 1% rosemary. All samples were vacuum packaged, stored for 63 days at 4 \u00b0C \u00b1 1\u00b0 and analyzed at one week intervals for total aerobes, L. monocytogenes, lactic acid organisms, pH and objective color. Nisin, nisin with rosemary, nisin with EDTA and nisin with rosemary and EDTA treatments reduced (P < 0.05) L. monocytogenes counts by 4.42, 4.20, 3.73, and 4.11 log cfu/g, respectively, when compared to the positive control, on Day 0. L. monocytogenes counts remained less than 2.75 log cfu/g for ham treated with nisin through 63 days storage. The EDTA and rosemary treatments alone and in combination were ineective in inhibiting growth of L. monocytogenes. Although none of the treatments completely eliminated L. monocytogenes, the results indicated that ready-to-eat turkey ham will have signicantly lower L. monocytogenes counts when treated with nisin alone or in combination with rosemary and/or EDTA. In-vitro pharmacodynamics of TR-700, the active oxazolidinone, Pharmaceutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA 2Department of Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA Background: The aim of this study was to determine the eectiveness of TR-700, the active form of its prodrug TR-701, a novel oxazolidinone, against three strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), that are also resistant to linezolid. Methods: Three strains of S. aureus (CM/05, ATCC 33591, NRS 271) were studied in this experiment. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for TR-700 were determined according to the microbroth dilution method as standardized by CLSI to be 0.5, 0.25 and 4 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Cultures of each strain were grown in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) at static concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 times their MIC. Serial dilutions of samples taken every 2 hours were made, plated on sheep blood agar (SBA) and allowed to incubate for 20 hours at 37\u00b0 C. A modied Emax model was t to the kill curve data and allowed to estimate EC50 values for each strain. For S. aureus NRS 271 an additional Hill factor of 1.4 was included. Results: TR-700 showed bacteriostatic activity against all three strains with maximum reductions of 0.18 log, 0.28 log, and 1.73 log for S. aureus CM/05, S. aureus ATCC 33591 and S. aureus NRS 271 respectively. The estimated EC50 values for TR-700 were found to be 0.14, 0.07 and 1.32 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Conclusion: The estimated EC50 values correlate well with previously determined MIC values (r2=0.99). The described PK/PD model will allow integration of these pharmacodynamic properties of TR-700 with its pharmacokinetic prole to facilitate dose selection for future clinical trials. Exotic Perkinsus sp. protozoa in an imported Vietnamese ornamental clam, Tridacna crocea, maintained in a home aquarium Barbara J. Dipl. A.C.V.P .1 and Christopher S. 1Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology PO 110880, of Veterinary Medicine, U.F ., Gainesville, FL 32611 2Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Cooperative Oxford Laboratory, 904 S. Morris Street, Oxford, MD 21654 An adult, hermaphroditic T ridacna crocea ornamental clam imported from Vietnam into the U.S.A. became terminally moribund with sloughed byssal tissue and incomplete extension of the poorly responsive mantle, and was necropsied. Necropsy ndings included o-white to light tan gill nodules. Histopathology revealed marked inflammation and necrosis within the visceral mass and gills, with interstitial edema and atrophy of glandular, gonadal, and muscular tissues. tissues contained large numbers of 10-15 \u00b5m trophozoites. The organisms often formed clusters of 2-4 cells, and were surrounded by a host reaction consisting of a 1-4 \u00b5m rim of amorphous eosinophilic material and 2-4 host haemocytes. Incubation of infected tissues in alternative Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (ARFTM) conrmed the presence of hypnospores that stained blue-black with Lugol's iodine. Perkinsus organisms, including P . olseni and P . marinus which are internationally reportable, are highly pathogenic destructive protozoa capable of disrupting ecosystems populated by na\u00efve molluscs within the U.S.A., and negatively impacting both domestic and international shellsh industries. This is the rst report of an exotic Perkinsus sp. pathogen in an imported ornamental clam maintained long term in a home aquarium. However, ongoing research indicates that T. crocea from Vietnam are commonly infected with such organisms. Veterinarians, aquarium facility mangers, and veterinary clients with hobby aquariums should use appropriate caution and responsible disposal practices for clam carcasses, and water in which imported ornamental clams have been housed. Such practices will reduce the possibility of dispersing viable, exotic Perkinsus sp. organisms into domestic waters. Rabies in Florida Bats Danielle Stanek, Lillian Orciari , Valerie Mock, Pamela Yager Department of Health, State of Florida, Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Background: Bats currently represent 10% of animals testing positive for rabies in Florida, and the majority of endemic human rabies cases in the US are caused by bat variants. However in 2006, less than half (35%) of rabid bats reported nationally were identied by species, and we have limited knowledge of bat rabies epizootiology. Improved knowledge of current bat rabies epizootiology may help identify risk factors leading to exposures in people and domestic pets, and improved disease control. Methods: Data from 248 rabid bats collected by Florida Department of Health from 1953-1973 were compared to data from 195 rabid bats of 1,742 total bats submitted from 1994-2006. A subsample of recent submissions from representative species was typed by the 46 4847 17Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using RT-PCR amplicons from the rabies virus N gene and compared with archival Florida bat samples from the 1980's. Alignment of the sequences was performed using Bioedit 7.0. A phylogenetic tree was produced using the Mega 4.0 software and the neighbor-joining algorithm and bootstrap analysis of 100 replicates. Results: In the twenty year period between 1953-1973, L. intermedius (Li) represented 75.8% of bats identied as rabid in Florida, compared with 11.9% of speciated cases from 1994-2006. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) represented 5.2 % of historical cases, and 51.3% of current speciated cases. The number of positive bats peaked during August for both time periods. The lowest proportion of positive bats for 1994-2006 was in June. Four distinct clades containing L. borealis (Lb) rabies virus variant were identied which included most samples from L. seminolus (Ls), Li and Lb bats. Virus variants from Lb and Ls bats appear more related to L. cinereus (Lc) bats then variants from other Lc bats. T wo clades of Tb rabies virus variants primarily included Tb samples and clustered tightly together. Only archival Tb samples were found in Tb clade 2. Vibrio Vulnicus Clade Is Associated With Systemic, As Opposed T o Local, Infection in a Mouse Model of Disease Thiaville, P 1Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology 2Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Florida 3Department of Biology, University of South Florida Vibrio vulnicus is the leading cause of reported seafood-related death in the U.S. with death from sepsis. V. vulnicus also causes wound infection that often, but not always, leads to sepsis. For as many people who consume contaminated shellsh, only a small fraction experience systemic disease. A major question is why some people experience severe skin infection without sepsis and who the incidence of systemic disease is so low after consumption of contaminated seafood. A variety of genetic methods have been used to genotypically characterize V. vulnicus strains. A clear pattern has emerged - there are two clades of V. vulnicus, one primarily represented among strains of clinical derivation and another that is most often isolated from environmental strains. This relationship suggested that the clinical clade is more virulent for humans and is the environmental clade. We therefore examined a large collection of V. vulnicus strains that had been genotyped for virulence in our subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mouse model. In this model, nearly all strains, regardless of origin or genotype have the ability to cause a high level of localized skin infection. However, not all strains have the ability to cause lethal systemic infection measured as liver CFU. We determined that the clinical-type clade of V. vulnicus is signicantly more procient at causing systemic liver infection than is the environmental-type clade. This was often observed by signicant dierences in CFU/g tissue; however, the greatest statistical dierences were when the frequencies of detectable systemic infection were compared. These results demonstrate that the two major clades of V. vulnicus dier not only in their sources of isolation but in their ability to cause systemic lethal disease. Identifying the genetic dierences between the clinical- and environmental-type clades will lead to the understanding of the virulence mechanisms that are responsible for lethal, systemic infection of humans. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Decreased Flu Related Absenteeism One Year after Administration in a School Based Immunization Program in Alachua County, Florida Cuc Thi-Hong Tran MPHc1, Krystin Emily Wilson MPH3, Thomas Belcuore M.S3, and J. Glenn Morris Jr. MD , MPH &TM1,4 1University of Florida's College of Public Health and Health Professions 2University of Florida's College of Medicine 3Alachua County Health Department 4Emerging Pathogens Institute, Gainesville, FL Background: Schools are virus exchange system ultimately spreading the virus to the whole community. Children are \"super spreaders\". They shed more virus and do so for longer periods of time than adults. Computer models have suggested that immunizing school children could protect the whole community. This study assessed if there was a decrease in flu related school absenteeism one year after Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) was administered at a time when the inactivated vaccine was shown to be only 44% eective. 3 Methods: 25% (n=5,198) children were immunized with LAIV during the fall of 2006. A year later, flu related absenteeism was evaluated for a thirteen week period (January 7th - April 13th,2008). This time frame was determined by the health department as the height of a flu outbreak. Children in grades kindergarten and 10-12 acted as controls for this time period, having not received the vaccine. Results: Absenteeism of students in grades 1-9 (76.4%), 25% of whom had been immunized, was lower than the control (78%), who had not been immunized (P=<.0001). Conclusions: Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine immunization decreased school absenteeism during a flu outbreak one year after vaccine administration, even though the virus had drifted (the vaccine strains do not match the circulating strains). Given the apparent broader protection provided by LAIV, immunizing school children might reduce the severity of the next flu pandemic. Bacteriophage Based Prevention of Foodborne Disease is Eective in a Mouse Model and Prevents Weight Loss Seen in Infected Animals Treated with Placebo or AntibioticLee Visone1*, M. Ukhanova1, T. Abuladze2, FL, 2Intralytix, Baltimore, MD49 50 51 18The past decade has seen an increasing emergence of pathogenic bacteria resistant to many currently available antimicrobial agents. An approach for benecial use of microbes which has received very little research attention is the use of bacteriophages to target potentially pathogenic bacterial species in the GI tract. Prior to the discovery and widespread use of antibiotics, it had been suggested that bacterial infections could be treated by administration of bacteriophages. We examined the eect of pre- and post-exposure administration of a L. monocytogenes-specic phage preparation, designated LMP-102, in mice experimentally-infected with the L.m. strain 370 (a nalidixic acid-resistant mutant of ATCC strain 49594, which is derived from the Scott A strain). C57B6 mice were pretreated daily for 3 days with either PBS or LMP-102 (via oral gavage), challenged with L. monocytogenes strain Lm 370 (ca. 105 CFU/mouse) and sacriced after three days during which either treatment with PBS or LMP-102 was continued or an antibiotic was administered. Listeria counts in tissue homogenates were determined using selective media while overall gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rDNA based proling. The concentrations of L. monocytogenes in the (i) small intestine, (ii) cecum, (iii) colon (fecal material collected from the large intestines), (iv) liver, and (v) spleen were signicantly reduced (p = <0.05) in both the phage and the antibiotic treated groups. In addition, the weight loss observed in the PBS treated group as well as in the antibiotic treated group was prevented by phage administration. Bacteriophage treatment had no detrimental eects on clinical health markers or on gut microbiota composition. These results suggest a potential for novel bacteriophage based prevention of listeriosis and possibly other foodborne diseases. Reduced Pathogenesis by High Levels of Drug-resistant HIV Replication in vivo Wallet MA, Saporta S, Sleasman JW and Goodenow MM Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine Background. HIV infection results in immune activation which may contribute to disease progression. The causes of T cell activation [TCA] versus monocyte/macrophage activation [MMA] were investigated.Methods. A longitudinal study including plasma and peripheral blood cells at baseline and after 18-36 weeks combination antiretroviral therapy [ART] from 40 HIV+ perinatally-infected adolescents compared with 21 healthy controls [HC] was performed. Therapy resulted in immune reconstitution in all HIV+ subjects, but almost half (19 of 40) developed discordant therapy outcome, characterized by viral rebound to pretreatment levels [viral failure/immune success (VF/IS)]. Immune activation was determined by ELISA for soluble plasma factors sCD27, sCD14 and TNF and by FACS analysis subsets CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RA+CD27-CD11a++. Microbial translocation [MT] was measured by LAL assay for LPS and EndoCAb. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS. Results. TCA but not MMA was related to CD4+ T cell decline and TCA was elevated in HIV non-controllers (VL 104). MT was associated with MMA but not CD4+ T cell activation or frequency. The occurrence of MMA in HIV+ subjects was associated with ethnicity, where African American subjects were far less likely to develop the outcome. Longitudinal analysis of HIV+ subjects before and after ART revealed that TCA resolves after 18-36 weeks of ART, while both MT and MMA persist. In a VF/IS subset, TCA was reduced and CD4+ T cell frequency was improved despite persistent viremia, while MT and MMA were unchanged. Conclusions. T cell activation and monocyte/macrophage activation are parallel, unrelated outcomes of HIV infection. TCA results from uncontrolled viremia and leads to CD4+ T cell decline. MMA results from MT and genetic predisposition to the outcome. Reduced viral pathogenesis following ART in VF/IS subjects is sucient to reduce TCA and allow immune reconstitution despite persistent viremia, MT and MMA. Utilizing Mechanism-Based Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Models to Understand and Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance B. Wu and H. Derendorf Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL Background: Despite decades of antimicrobial usage, the underline relationship between antimicrobial drugs and the development of drug resistant has not fully been delineated. Current observations show that increase usage of antibiotics leads to increase of drug resistance, indicating less than ideal dosage were recommended for suppressing the resistant microbial population. Several mechanisms of resistance have been published in the literature. We have developed new mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacdynamic (PK/PD) models mimicking various resistance mechanisms to describe in vitro drug-bacteria kill curve relationship. Methods: In vitro kill-curve of Escherichia coli 204 (E. Coli II) following ciprofloxacin treatment at 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, 32.0 and 125 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) totaling 193 data points were obtained from a previously published data. The in vitro system simulated the clinical half-life of ciprofloxacin (4 hours) by constant dilution of media with a flow rate of 7 mL/hr in a 40 mL unit. The monoexpoential decline rate was xed for modeling PD. The resistant mechanisms implemented in the mathematical models include (1) susceptible-dormant conversion, (2) susceptibleresistant conversion , and (3) dual eects of dormant and resistant mechanisms. All parameter estimates for each model were computed using all dose levels tted simultaneously using Adapt II software. Model selection criteria were based on AIC values, residual plots, and visual evaluation of observe versus predicted plots. Results/Conclusions: The E. Coli kill curve after ciprofloxacin treatment was best described by a heterogeneous bacterial population that include a dose dependent inter-conversion between susceptible and dormant population as well as an emergent of resistant population with its own growth tness and kill rate (Model 3). The PKPD models infer that mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance are complex and require the consideration of multiple bacterial defense mechanisms simultaneously to describe the drug exposure-bacterial killing relationship.52 53 19FIV-cat model for selecting viral proteins for HIV-1 and FIV vaccines Janet Yamamoto, James Coleman, Ruiyu Pu, Jay Levy. University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida USA University of California, San Francisco, California Background: Vaccines for HIV-1 and FIV must provide protection against viruses of multiple heterologous subtypes. Prototype and commercial inactivated dual-subtype FIV vaccines (FIV-IDV of subtypes A and D) confer protection against homologous- and heterologous-subtype strains. In a recent report, HIV-1 recombinant CA-p24 vaccine conferred cross-protection against FIV in cats. Current studies were performed to conrm and expand on the reported work, identify other cross-protective HIV-1 proteins, and to explore the immune mechanism(s) of cross-protection. Methods: Pathogen-free cats were immunized 3X recombinant protein vaccines, adjuvant (Ribi or FD-1 plus LPS/IL-12), or PBS and were challenged 3 wk later with Vaccine was determined by immunoblot analysis for FIV antibodies and by virus isolation from PBMC and lymphoid tissues using viral RT and PCR analyses. Protective mechanisms were characterized by passive-transfer studies and by virus-specic IFN ELISpot or CFSE proliferation of the T cells. Results: Protection rates were 40/64 (62%, p<0.001 compared control, and 0/37 for PBS control against 15 CID50 of either subtype-A, recombinant subtype-A/B, or subtype-B FIV. At challenge doses for 0/4 for PBS. Strong IFN and CD4/CD8-CFSE responses to HIV or FIV protein peptides were observed in corresponding vaccinated cats. HIV p24-vaccinated cats recognized many HIV p24 peptide pools, which were also recognized by HIV-infected human long-term survivors. Neither HIV-p24 nor FIV-p24 vaccine-induced antibodies conferred passive-transfer protection. In contrast, IDV-induced antibodies conferred passive protection against homologous FIV but not against heterologous-subtype-B FIV. Conclusions: Based on the FIV-cat model, the most eective vaccine is FIV-IDV followed in order by FIV-p62, HIV-p66, HIV-p24, FIV-24, and FIV-p15. Thus, this cross-protection model may be useful in selecting HIV proteins and epitopes important to include in a broadly-eective T cell-based HIV-1 vaccine. This work was funded by NIH R01-AI065276. Porphyromonas gingivalis and human oral epithelium Ralee Spooner, and ., FL 32610 The microbiota of the human oral mucosa consists of a myriad of bacterial species that normally exist in commensal harmony with the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an aetiological agent in severe forms of periodontitis (a chronic inflammatory disease), is a prominent component of the oral microbiome and a successful colonizer of the oral epithelium. This Gram-negative anaerobe can also exist within the host epithelium without the existence of overt disease. Gingival epithelial cells, the outer lining of the gingival mucosa, which function as an important part of the innate immune system, are among the rst host cells colonized by P . gingivalis. This study highlights the recent work and developments implicating the co-existence and intracellular adaptation of P . gingivalis in these target host cells. Specically, recent ndings on the putative mechanisms of persistence, intercellular dissemination and opportunism are highlighted. These new ndings may also represent an original and valuable model for mechanistic characterization of other successful host-adapted, self-limiting, persistent intracellular bacteria in human epithelial tissues. HIV-1 Env V1-V2 Length Polymorphism Predicts Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Outcome in HIV-Infected Children Li Yin*1, Steven McCready1, Amanda Lowe1, Joseph Oshier1, John W. Sleasman2 and Maureen M. Goodenow1 1College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA 2All Children's Hospital, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, FL, USA Although HIV-1 env polymorphism correlates with disease progression, a relationship to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is unknown. HIV-1 env V1V2 length quasispecies were evaluated by spectratyping. Correlation of V1V2 length and extent of length polymorphisms with clinical status was determined via Spearman Rank Order Correlation test (SROCt) for 14 untreated children. Association of pretherapy viral complexity with therapy outcome was assessed using Mann-Whitney S test (MWSt) by comparing V1V2 length diversity in pretherapy viruses between children (n=5) who achieved viral suppression and those (n = 9) who failed viral control after ART. Change in V1V2 length distribution was followed one year posttherapy. V3 genotype between viral successes and failures was compared by MWSt, and correlated to V1/V2 lengths by env V1V2 length variants in pretherapy viruses ranged from 1 to 16 among individuals. V1V2 length extended from 273 to 360 bp among all variants across subjects, but clustered in a related length range within each individual. Although pretherapy V1V2 length or length polymorphisms were unrelated to pretherapy CD4% or viral levels, a signicant relationship between V1V2 length diversity and therapy outcome was identied (p = 0.02). Children with more diversied pretherapy V1V2 length quasispecies developed complete viral suppression, while subjects harboring viruses with uniform or limited number of V1V2 length variants failed to control viral replication posttherapy. Net V3 charge was independent of length in V1, V2 or V1V2, but related to CCR5 coreceptor use in viral success or CXCR4 use in viral failure (p = <0.001). Distribution and diversity of V1V2 length was stable in all viral successors and 6/9 viral failures over one year posttherapy. Genomic diversity in pre-therapy env, coupled with CCR5 coreceptor use, correlates with favorable response to ART, and can serve as a novel surrogate marker for therapy outcome.54 55 56 20 "}
