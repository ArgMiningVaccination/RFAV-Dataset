CARE maintains active collaborations with the community to accomplish the goal of providing the highest level of care and education to the UCI community. CARE is committed to developing prog rams that have a direct and lasting impact on the quality of campus life. Prevention education focuses on the elimination of sexual violence on the campus, emphasizing the role of respect and communication in relationships and the absence of violence, abus e and manipulation. Through direct intervention services and groups, the services offered by CARE have an immediate impact on the mental health and student functioning in personal, academic and social domains. The CARE office also provides peer education o pportunities for students focused on developing knowledge, communication skills, leadership qualities , social awareness and empathy. ADVOCACY SERVICES CARE provides advocacy services for survivors of sexual assault, relationship abuse or stalking, includi ng emotional support, referrals, resources, academic support, information about rights and options, legal accompaniment and medical accompaniment. HOLISTIC HEALING Healing from trauma is unique to each individual person and CARE offers programs designed to support the whole person - addressing the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual effects of trauma - by providing varied pathways to healing. CARE's Holistic Healing Transforming Trauma program seeks to create transformative spaces and restorative expe riences for members of the UCI community who have been directly or indirectly impacted by sexual assault, relationship abuse, stalking, child abuse and/or family violence. Students can choose to participate in a variety of programs designed to offer social support, education and healing. During the 20 16-17 academic year, the CARE office offered 40 holistic healing programs reaching nearly 2,000 members of the UCI community. Three categories of programming were offered: private/registration (for those direc tly impacted), tabling (aimed at increasing awareness of CA RE's holistic healing programs) and open (programs open to the entire community). CARE's re:Connect - Yoga as Healing program is a structured series that focuses on themes including assertiveness, safety, boundary setting, strength and trust. A total of 43 participants were registered for the program over the course of the academic year and reported an increase in coping skills and self -care strategies as a result of participation in the program. The framework for additional healing programs continued to expand in scope and frequency offering programs including, but not limited to: re:Create - Art as Healing, re:Mix - Music as Healing, re:Group - Group Counseling & Support, re:Assert - Personal Safe ty & Self Defense, re:Cultivate - Horticulture as Healing, re:View - Lending Library, and re:Source - Downloadable Support.

IV. THOSE SERVED ADVOCACY SERVICES During 2016 -17 the CARE Advocate served 199 students and 15 faculty/staff members . Of the 199 students, 184 were primary survivors of sexual assault, stalking or relationship abuse (52% experienced a sexual assault, 30% relationship abuse and 18% stalking). The remaini ng 15 students included 8 who 251WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education experienced sexual harassment (one from an employer), 6 who sought information and support to help a survivor in their lives, and one with trauma. Self-reported demographics of the 199 students served are as , 36% were 26% 4% multiracial and 1% declined to state. As for age and class level: 86% were age 18 to 24, 13% were 25 to 59 , and fewer than 1% w ere 17 or younger; were freshmen, 23% sophomores, 20% juniors, 29% students (including professional programs) and 0.5% alums. Finally, 14% of the students served were Greek affiliated ; 11% were international ; 52% lived on campus; 43% lived off -campus and 5% declined to state where they lived. Additionally, the Advocate served 15 UCI faculty and staff members. CONSULTATION CARE staff provides consultation to members of the University community seeking resources or information rela ted to sexual violence, including relationship abuse and stalking. CARE works with departments, faculty, staff and student leaders on individual cases to provide re sources and support as needed. The Director participates on the Case Management Team and co-chairs the campus' Coordinated Community Response Team, which are designed to ensure that effective prevention efforts occur in tandem with coordinated, compassionate and timely responses. PREVENTIVE EDUCATION As part of our efforts to end sex offenses on campus, CARE has facilitated 125 programs and p resentations to students, staff and faculty. In addition to on -campus outreach, CARE has also provided 16 presentation s and workshops to community members , including professional conferences. CARE has prov ided outreach to a diverse demographic at UC Irvine. These individuals and groups include first -year students, housing communities, orientation leaders, Cross Cultural Center interns, LGBT student groups, academic mentors, law enforcement, Student Conduct Hearing Board staff, cultural organizations, ASUCI interns, peer educators, student organizations and leaders, Greek organi zations (Panhellenic, IFC and m ulticultural), academic c lasses and community agencies. CARE's programming model strategically focuses on interventions at primary, secondary and tertiary levels throughout the full academic year. CARE's outreach has consisted of online safety modules and in -person orientation programs for first -year students; response protocol trainings for student staff and professional staff; sexual assault, dating and domestic violence , and stalking prevention workshops for students; bystander trainings; educational workshops; classroom guest lectures; resources fairs; passive displays; and large campus wide events. Thro ughout the 2016 -17 academic year (be ginning in July 2016), CARE provided outreach services to more than 19,396 UCI students via 121 workshops, programs, groups, trainings, online modules and campuswide events. CARE's workshops have been evaluated based on the quality of the prese nters, learning of participants and the content being delivered. CARE has been highly effective in providing useful, informative, innovative and engaging programs. As a result of the effectiveness of these programs, universities acr oss the country have modeled them and reached out to CARE for guidance and consultation. Feedback shows an increased awareness especially in relation to consent, comprehensive bystander intervention skills and positive coping mechanisms. During the 2016 -17 academic year, CARE gathered evaluative data on 37 programs and workshops facilitated by peer educators and staff. A total of 965 evaluations were collected. Our outreach numbers are large due to the frequency of campus wide programs, passive displays, an d the large number of students who are reached through our online module, FIRST. 252WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education CARE provides leadership training and educational outreach through four student leadership programs. The first program, Challenging All Men to Prevent Sexism (CHAMPS), is bas ed on the belief that men play a necessary role in helping to end sexual and relationship violence. The mission of CHAMPS is to promote campus awareness and provide education about sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking. This group is committed to providing the UCI community with resources, support, and proactive suggestions for eliminating sexual violence through educational programs, workshops and campus events. The second program, Right to Know (RTK), has as its mission rais ing awareness thro ughout the UCI community about the widespread occu rrence of sexual assault and promot ing activities and attitudes that will contribute to the elimination of sexual violence. Central to the group's purpose is the examination of factors that contribute to se xual assault. To fulfill the group's mission, RTK peer educators present educational programming throughout the campus. Throughout the course of the year, both of these peer education groups develop and implement educational programs and workshops about se xual assault, relationship violence, and stalking using a series of activities to stimulate conversation about the realities of these issues at UC Irvine. The focus of these programs is supported by best practices research in primary violence prevention. T he third program, Violence Intervent ion and Prevention (VIP), is an organization of representatives from the UC Irvine Greek Community who are committed to addressing the issues of rape, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence and stalking on campus. Representatives from fraternities and sororities (VIP Chairs) attend monthly trainings, facilitate various awareness programs for their chapter s and serve as a central point of contact to provide support to chapter members who have been impacted by violenc e. The fourth program is International Dots (I -Dots) , which had seven members in 2016 -17 and is a co llaborative program between CARE and the International Center . This peer education group has been in existence for three years and thus is still in development. Some accomplishments of I - Dots include a website, tabling at Take Back the Night and an engaging tabling program where students were asked to contribute a mes sage of support for survivors. UC IRVINE SAFE CAMPUS ANTI -VIOLENCE PROJECT With gran t renewal funds received for 2014 -17 from the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) , the CARE office continued to provide an integrated, multi -dimensional initiative to expand services to students who were survivors of sexual assaul t, dating and domestic violence and stalking. These services included crisis intervention, a full -time Victim Advocate who was available 24/7, group counseling, medical care, investigation of policy violations and criminal acts, protective orders, consulta tion with housing and academic units, accompaniment, education, and new this last yea r, a holistic healing program. Collaborative partnerships with on - and off -campus agencies and the formation of a Coordinated Community Review (CCR) Team ensured comprehen sive support of all victims ' needs. The OVW campus grant provided important resources to build upon existing strengths and successes in our ongoing implementation of the four minimum requirements: 1) establishment and continued training of a CCR team, 2) design and implementation of a mandatory prevention education program, 3) specialized training of campus police and 4) training f or campus disciplinary boards. CARE is now in the final funding period for the 2014 -17 OVW renewal grant. Continuation funds su pported 50% of the full -time UCI Victim Advocate position in the CARE office during this last year. In addition, OVW funds supported advanced training for 10 UCI police officers in November on the topic of the neurobiology of trauma and in May, training wa s provided to law enforcement officers and other campus staff on Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview (FETI). Self -defense workshops were provided for students in October and March with ov er 150 students participating. The campus grant also funded the \"G reen Dot Bystander Intervention\" program and the new Holistic Healing program for those students affected by se xual violence. This past year, our Holistic Healing services have included our signature Yoga as Healing , Art as Healing , Music as Healing , and Horticulture as Healing programs, and other self -care programs including journaling, self -guided meditation and nature walks. The CARE office oversees all pro gram s including incoming student orientation planning, providing expertise and time in the implementation of law enforcement and student conduct trainings. In addition, 253WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education the CARE office contributes directly to the development of t he Case Management Team (CMT). The CARE office is committed to cross -campus collaboration , which is demonstrated through the v aluable partnerships, trainings and programs that take place both on camp us and in the local community. The current OVW campus grant is due to expire on September 30, 2017 and a renewal grant is under consideration at the DOJ OVW for the 2017 -20 grant period. CCR Team activities, a self -defense workshop, Green Dot Bystander Intervention trainings, filming of Green Dot training videos and Holistic Healing program ac tivities are still underway, supported with OVW funds. STUDENT STATUS CARE outreach has focused on targeting the first-year population while reaching all students throughout their academic career s. The information collected through 965 program evaluations showed that participants ' class levels were as whole in the chart below . As compared with UCI student demographics as a whole (below), CARE outreach was heavily first -year students. 1st Year , 50% Exten. Student < 1% 3rd COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education ETHNIC BACKGROUND The following chart show s CARE outrea ch demographics by race/ ethnicity as s elf-report ed CARE evaluation (N=31,415 Winter 2017) 256WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education DISCUSSION Evaluative Data Summary The evaluative data from 2016 -2017 is overwhelmingly high and indicates that the CARE Office has been successful in the organization and content of material, clearly identifying the purpose of programs, providing useful and relevant information to participants, being a supportive and accepting presence for participants, and being well prepared, organized, and knowledgeable. CARE presenters received an average score of 4.75 (out of 5) on evaluative questions. When asked qualitative questions about the workshops, participants have stated that the programs have not only allowed them to gain a great deal of knowledge regarding the topics of sexu al assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking but that they are also interesting, engaging, and interactive. Most importantly, participants noted presenters were able to articulate the information in a comfortable and accessible way. This feedbac k is noteworthy, given the difficult and sensitive nature of the topics addressed by the presenters. Many participants noted that they gained practical skills that will help them be active and engaged bystanders. The simple application of the 3 D's makes this quite accessible for students. Students shared an increased awareness of the services offered by the CARE Office as well as by other resources on campus. UCI students in general were actively engaged in this work this year, through activism and hosting programs, which may be a result of the increased awareness of sexual violence on a national level. Prevention Programming Opportunities to collaborate with campus partners have been particularly successful with reaching specialized populations such as Gr eek students and international students. UCI students have benefitted greatly from these specialized program s, and future CARE programs will continue to cultivate this lens as well as focus significant ly on intersectionality. Campus wide programming was more balanced this year as CARE staff were intentional about not over programming and instead focusing efforts on Green Dot prevention. Take Back the Night 2017 was an incredible success, drawing nearly 800 students, staff, faculty and community members. Student leadership on the committee was particularly strong and should continue with engagement of CARE peer education groups . Peer Education CARE's peer education groups play a primary role in the presentation of workshops, staffing various resource fairs throughout the year, and providing support through tabling at all CARE campuswide events. The All Peer training was an excellent training in order to give CARE's three peer education groups an opportunity to meet and go through a baseline training which include d CARE policies, addressing press and media, intersectionality and how to present workshops. Orientation CARE has worked collaboratively with New Student Orientation over the past five years to play a significant part in each Student Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), including participating in a peer education fair, resource fair, a large in -person presentation, a community resource fair, and a bystander intervention workshop. This allows us to reach about 5,000 incoming students through mandatory education on the issues of sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. In addition to in - person education, students also complet e the First Year Internet Required Safety Training (FIRST) which had a 99.8% completion rate (9,059 students) due to OIT assisting with communication and class holds. We also r eceived feedback from New Student Orientation on what students learned related to sex offenses and bystander intervention . (Report available on request.) Connection to Services As the amount of programming offered by CARE has increased in the past few years, there has also been an increase in the dem and for clinical services. Additionally, in the monitoring of the campus crime log 257WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education through UCI PD and the Case Management Team, we have also seen an increase in reporting of issues related to sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. This correlation may indicate that there is a strong need for these programs at UCI, and that the exposure to information regarding CARE (through active/passive programs, tabling, publicity materials, etc.) could be encouraging students to reach out for other services and resources on campus. Additionally, the awareness of ser vices and support from a system wide l evel has created more exposure to students about the variety of services that CARE offers . Summary Overall , CARE did an excellent job in outreach effo rts, reaching various segments of the UCI population. An area for improvement is ensuring that evaluations are provided at each training in order to capture accurate data regarding the effectiveness of the facilitation. CARE should continue with the full implementation of Green Dot in order to focus on prevention initiatives that measurably reduce violence on campus. Programs catered toward specific communities should continue to build through collaborations with campus partners. Lastly, training and outreach efforts should be closely coordinated with the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity to ensu re maximum outreach and impact. V. HISTORY The UC Irvine Center for Women and Men closed in 2004 due to a challenging fiscal environment and the departur e of the director. During that year, all violence prevention and intervention activities of the center were absorbed into the pre -existing Campus Assault Resource Program (CARP), a program that provided educational outreach, consultation and referral servi ces, while additional gender programming was assumed by the newly -formed Gender Education Series through the O ffice of the Dean of Students. In September 2005, under new leadership, the Campus Assault Resource Program moved to Student Services I and expanded services to include ongoing individual and group counseling, peer leaders hip programs, additional campus wide educational programming, faculty/staff and student conduct board training, incoming student education and augmented advocacy. The new name of Campus Assault Resources and Education (CARE) reflected these expanding responsibilities and CARE's inclusive approach to student involvement in issues of vi olence and relationship abuse. It also better reflect ed the service goals of the expanding unit while increasing visibility of the office to UCI students , staff and faculty . HIGHLIGHTS 2006- 07 Assembly Bill AB1088 was passed, requiring all California campuses to engage in active educational programming to ad dress the issues of sexual violence and to provide information about campus policies and protocols for all incoming students. In collaboration with the Health Education department and technology services, CARE achieved full compliance with AB 1088 in its first year by developing and implementing the First Year Internet Required Safety Training (FIRST) online module. CARE successfully recruited the first Right to KNOW (RTK) class to complete a full year of training and become qualified to present educationa l workshops on bystander intervention, relationship health and cultural influences on violence in society to the larger campus as well as community schools and juvenile detention centers. CARE initiated the men's violence prevention program by starting a chapter of One in Four (now known as CHAMPS). 2007- 08 CARE hired a Violence Prevention Coordinator to assist in v iolence prevention activities and who was qualified to teach Rape Aggression Defense Classes. This 258WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CARE - Campus Assault Resources & Education position expanded outreach to the campus population. In addition, a part -time student assistant and 2 administrative interns were hired. UCIPD CAREs was developed and implemented through a joint collaboration between CARE and the UCI Police Department. The program provides opportunities for campus community members, either in -person or online, to anonymously obtain information about reporting and criminal investigations. Building Better Relationships, a psycho -educational group series, was developed and implemented in par tnership with commu nity organization Human Options for survivors of relationship abuse. CARE directs UCI's participation in a million -dollar, three -year flagship grant from the US Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women, in which all 10 UC campuses partnered to share expertise, resources and ideas with the goal of enhancing the quality of sexual violence response and shaping collaborative programs to address sexual violence.

VISION & MISSION VISION To be a leader in collegiate health promotion by focusing on the unique and relevant health nee ds and concerns of UCI students in support of their academic success. MISSION We empower students to make informed decisions t hat support individual health and a healthy campus environment by providing comprehensive programs and coordinated services to: Build awareness through assessment and goalsetting Create balance by taking a wellness -based approach to health Develop healthy and sustainable habits Take pride in achieving one's personal best Inspire community by leading fellow Anteaters to be healthy CORE VALUES Advocacy Awareness Empowerment VALUES The mission of the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is upheld by utilizing our expertise in innovative and relevant pr ogramming to the UCI community. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion (CSWHP) focuses on health topic areas identified through various asses sment efforts . Our programs are unique in their abilities to meet the students in the spaces where they are most comfortable, in order to tackle issues t hat can be sensitive in nature. Our programming is often facilitated in residence halls, organizational meetings and other safe spaces for students. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is the only department on campus that houses full -time health promotion staff to focus on issues that are integral to college health and wellness , such as alcohol and other drugs, sexual and relationship health, general wellness and life balance , nutri tion and mental health. Part of our mission is to facilitate student development and leadership opportunities. With the continued growth and developm ent of the Publi c Health program on campus, the CSWHP has become a natural partne r with students in this major. We provide the only opportunity on campus for these students to become involved with health promotion on a college campus. Many students in publ ic health, social ecology, pre-medical and dental programs flock to the CSWHP to find ways to become involved on campus and in the community. With stress, anxiety, sleep and other related mental health concerns being reported by students as some of the mo st common barriers to their academic success, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion made a commitment to a dedicated space for students to address these concerns. Various relaxation and stress -reduction techniques are taught through our worksh ops, and our Wellness Room provides students with a dedicated space to practice these techniques to help manage the various forms of stress in their lives. The room is open all day for drop -in use and is a safe and comfortable environment to practice medit ation, breathing, guided visualization and other stress -management techniques/ activities. 313WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Alcohol and other drug use can be another barrier students experie nce to their academic success. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is a primary refe rral source for students who may h ave challenges in these areas. Our trained staff provide s services including a weekly Alcohol Awareness Class, Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS), individual consultations for other drugs, and smoking cessation support (especially critical as the campus recently implemented the new tobacco -free po licy). These services are intended as early intervention techniques and strategies to ensure students are successful in pursuit of their academic and personal goals. The CSWHP is also the only provider of free condoms, both male and female, and dental dam s on the UCI campus. The Cond om Co -Op was founded in 2011 -12 and provides education and information about safe sex, as well as ensuring that accessibility to condoms do es not become a barrier to practicing safe r sex. The Center for Student Wellness & Heal th Promotion is also the only place on campus that p rovide s free and anonymous HIV testing for the UCI community. The UCI community can be tested without fear of their results being tied to their identity. In an effort to be as inclusive as possible to the various needs of the campus, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion al so offers two unique resources. For nursing mothers on campus, the CSWHP is one of three locations on campus that offe rs a private Lactation Station. This space provides nursing mothers with a private space to breast feed or pump and is attached to a private bathroom as well. That private bathroom also serves as the second resou rce, a gender -neutral restroom. This allows members of the campus community who prefer a gender -neut ral restroom option to have it available in a safe and private locat ion.

Many sexual and relationship health programs are done in collaboration with other campus departments or jointly with other CSWHP staff in order to provide a more targeted and comprehensive view of sexual and relationship health. Wellness Progra ms & Services Wellness has become a focus topic in the Center for Studen t Wellness & Health Promotion. Headed by our Wellness and Peer Education Program s Manager, the focus is to create programs and services that support general wellness and life balance, including spiritual wellness, while also placing special attention on student development. For the first part of that equation, programming and re sources are developed and imp lemented to encourage and support individual wellness concepts (time/stress management, nutrition, exercise, happiness, spiritual balance/confidence, mindfulness, self -care, etc.) . In addition, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion has a Welln ess Room, providing students with a dedicated space to practice and refine their stress management, meditation and/or relaxation skil ls. The room was designed and equipped with the necessary tools and resources to facilitate this experience. In order to en compass the student development component of the job, specific focus was placed on ensuring that the students who work and volunteer in our office (student staff, peer educators, volunteers and student organization members) have an intentional and meaningf ul experience, grounded in health promotion theory and practice, and supported/evalu ated using established learning goals and outcomes. Training programs, supervision and advising were all revamped with this goal and outcome in mind. Nutrition Programs & S ervices The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion has a Registered Dietician/Nutritionist. This half - time position is split between the CSWHP and the Student Health Center. While working in the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion the RDN will provide outreach education on nutrition -related topics, consult with students individually who want to discuss their dietary needs/questions, provide training to our peer educators who present nutrition -related workshops, and develop nutrition -related materials and resources. The RDN will also take over the rebuilding and advisement of our student group 315WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION IMAGE (Image Management Awa reness, Growth and Education). This student organization provides the campus with both passive and active education focused on developing and maintaining a positive body image. This organization also seeks to provide students on campus with resources and information around disordered eating. Mental Health Awareness Programs The Center for Student Well ness & Health Promotion also has programs to raise awareness about and support student mental health. This responsibility falls under our Mental Health Awareness Programs Manager. This position oversees the implementation of the \"Behind Happy Faces\" mental health curriculum/program, which empowers students to talk more openly and honestly about mental health and mental illness, promotes effective coping strategies, encourages help -seeking behavior, including utilization of c ampus and community resources. The position also advises the UCI Chapter of Active Minds, a student organization committed to raising awareness about mental health related issues and reducing stigma around mental illness and seeking appropriate help. Other Programs & Services In addition to all of the programs and services tied to specific topics above, the following are additional programs and services that contribute to the mission of the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion: Marketing Team - In order to effectively market our programs, messages and mission, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promot ion utilizes a marketing team. The team consists of the Marketing Coordinator (staff position dedicated to managing/supervising the team) a nd four student Marketing Assistants (student staff with graphic design skills who design and produce a ll of our marketing materials). This team has a dedicated Marketing Office within the center, and effectively and efficiently works together to help prod uce most of the department's marketing materials. Peer Educators - With peer education as one of our top priorities for student development and engagement, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion recruits, trains and supports a group of formal p eer educators that provide peer to peer health promotion programming. They are trained in health education/promotion theory and practice, programming/presentation skills and some leadership/student development areas. They develop and present workshops, dev elop educational materials and campaigns, and utilize other strategies to educate their peers on campus. Student Organizations - As a less formal form of peer education, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion supports three specific student org anizations that also aim to educate their peers through aw areness programming and events. These groups include Active Minds, which focuses on mental health awareness, suicide prevention and reducing stigma around help -seeking behavior; IMAGE (Image Managem ent, Awareness, Growth and Education), which focuses on body image and disordered eating; and START (Student Task -force Adv ocating for Reducing Tobacco). These groups are advised by memb ers of our professional staff. Lactation Station - The Center for Stud ent Wellness & Health Promotion is one of only a few places on campus that has a dedicated, private space for wom en who are nursing or pumping. The room is attached to a private bathroom and we also provide refrigerator/freezer space to store milk/bottles. Gender -Neutral Restroom - The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion has a private gender -neutral restroom that is available to anyone who might prefer this option. It is available during normal hours of operation (M -F, 8 a.m. -5 p.m. ), except when someone is using the Lactation Station, when the restroom is closed for both access and privacy/confidentiality.

IV. THOSE SERVED During the 2016/2017 academic school year (July 2016 -June 2017) the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion provided outstanding programs & service s to the UCI community, primarily focusing on increasing workshop presentations, consultations and other campus outreach efforts to meet the health and wellness needs of the undergraduate and graduate students. The CSWHP participated in many new events thi s year and expanded its overall outreach and collaboration with other departments such as housing (Mesa Court, Middle Earth, Campus Village and Verano), Student Life & Leadership, Student Health Center, Cross -Cultural Center, CARE, International Student Ce nter, Career Center, ASUCI, Public Health Association and SOAR. Such collaborations have enriched the health and wellness of students , faculty and staff. This year the CSWHP facilitated and/or collaborated in 60 different events on campus, reaching a total of 10,307 students. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion had a 55% increase in total number of Healthy Tune -Up Workshops presented during the year, reaching 6,225 students on a variety of health and wellness topics. These workshops provide s tudents with effective health education and promotion using a variety of engag ing and interactive activities. In addition, there was a significant increase in the number of individual consultations tripling that of the previous academic year (from 79 to 24 3). The lactation station declined in the number of visits for the year; however, it continues to give nursing parents a clean, safe and private space to nurse and/or pump for their infant children. It was given a new look this year to make it feel more co mfortable. 32 BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students) sessions and 36 Alcohol Awareness Classes (with 234 participants) were completed during the 201 6-17 school year. This continues to be a remarkable collaboration between the CSWHP, Student H ousing and the Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct. The HIV testing program has been very successful in providing free, confidential and anonymous testing to students. HIV continues to be highly stigmatized and feared so providing an environment where students can feel safe, comfortable and learn about the imp ortance of testing is crucial. Students receive their results in 20 minutes using the Federally -approved Oraquick In-Home HIV Testing kit and receive important information on the importance of other STI screenings, establishing a well -care program while at UCI, and discussing healthy sexual and relatio nship behaviors and practices. The number of students using the Con dom Co -Op continues to increase and it accounts for a significant number of visits to the CSWHP. Students can access up to 10 free internal and external condoms and 5 lubes daily. The CSWHP provides a wide array of male condoms, female condoms and dental d ams to meet th e needs of the students. A total of 41,000 condoms and dental dams were distributed to students and campus partners this year. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion facilitates and participates independently and collaboratively in a variety of workshops and programs with several campus partners and student organizations on the UCI campus including ASUCI, Active Minds and START . These opportunities allow department s to broaden their reach and to meet the diversity and needs of UCI' s undergraduate and graduate students. The focus of these efforts is to provide students with accurate and important health information, encourage and promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles , and provide students with resources and referrals to on - and off -campus partners and organizations to support their overall health and wellness needs. CSWHP provided the UCI community with 60 special events, 179 workshops and 243 individual consultations. Below are detailed information about those points of con tact with the campus. 2016- 17 CSWHP Outreach Overview Event Outreach Counts 317WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION SPOP 2015 Presentations (9) 4,618 SPOP Resource Fairs (11) 285 Anteater Involvement Fair 50 Open House 75 International Student Colloquium 50 Summer Tabling 25 iHealth Fair 550 Fall Tabling 174 Winter Tabling 123 Spring Tabling 349 De-Stress Fest 200 Love My Life Event 60 ASUCI Orientation 150 ASUCI HIV Testing Promotion 200 Alcohol Awareness Tabling 66 Destress Fest 1,090 Zot Health Fair & CSWHP Promotion 35 Smart Eater's Series 288 New U Expo 30 Winter Tabling 92 Meet the RA's 99 Public Service Fair 50 Networking Event 9 Public Health Summit 60 Career Center Staff Meeting 15 Love Healthy Event (Verano Housing) 20 Wellness Class 11 Take Back t he Night/CARE 200 National Nutrition Month Campaign 170 ASUCI Mental Health Conference 162 Wellness Outreach RR 260 Farmer's Market 25 Sustainability Foods Fair 180 Let's Be Blunt Event 130 Pause f or a Cause/World No Tobacco Day 63 Bartender School 45 CSHWP Promotion/Personal Story/Athletics 325 Goal Setting Workshops 13 Celebrate UCI 225 Staff/Faculty Health Fair 35 Planned Parenthood Training 13 Campus Representatives Program 25 International Students of Excellence Dinner 50 HPV Clinics (Collaboration w/ SHC) 137 Sex Positivity Tabling 110 LCFF Dinner 46 Wellness in the Park 225 Programs & Services 318WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Consultations 243 Lactation Station 69 Office Visits 640 HIV Testing 99 Condom Co- Op 3,175 Healthy Tune -Up Workshops 6,225 Total Outreach 20,758 2016-17 CSWHP Workshop Participants Overview The Center for Student Wellness and Health Promotion provides campus outreach through workshops, focusing on educating students on a variety of health topics. A total of 179 workshops were con ducted on campus during the 2016 -17 school year, reaching 6,225 UCI students. Workshop participants are asked to evaluate each workshop including giving suggestions for improvement and other topics of interest to them. These evaluations are taken seriously and modifications are made by each program manager based on the feedback. Overall, the evaluations and personal feedback from the students has been positive and has brought students into the CSWHP to access services and programs, as well as to become volu nteers, interns and/or Peer Health Educators.

HISTORY The catalyst for Health Education was a CPR training program starte d in Student Health Services i n the mid -1980's. Dr. Gerry Sinikin also supported a peer education program that sponsored an annual health fair for students. Dr. Sinikin funded the fairs for many years as he chaired the Irvine Healt h Foundation. Greek Advis or Ellen Reibling was awarded one of the first Fund for the Improvement of Post - Secondary Education (FIPSE ) grants for alcohol prevention programs in 1987. At the same time, David Souleles was developing an HIV/AIDS Education program for the Dean of Studen ts Office. They joined forces in 1990 and opened Health Education in the Gateway Building adjacent to Aldrich Park. Thomas Parham, Assistant Vice Chancellor, established the department as independent in 1994 when th e Counseling and Health Services Cluster was formed, and named Ellen Reibling the first director. The department moved into an expanded area when the Phase IV Student Center renovation was completed in Fall 2008. The number of career positions has grown from 2.5 FTE to as many as 8 .0 FTE, and is currently at 6.10 FTE. The department has sponsored an annual health fair since 1994. Health Education was awarded two regional dissemination grants in the early 1990s to help other campuses establish alcohol prevention programs, providing consultations to CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, Loyola Marymount, UC Riverside and University of La Verne before their programs were established. The department also distributed a student publication called the \"Project Aware Resource Bin\" which sold more than 200 copies. UCI Health Education hosted one regional and two national prevention meetings in the mid 1990's, and this tradition is continuing today. Peer education programs have been offered for academic credit from Education, Social Ecology and Social Sciences with emphasis on alcohol (Students to Enhanc e Peer Sobriety or STEPS) and general health (Community Peer Health Educators). The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion now has its own formal Peer Educator program, managed by our Wellness & Pe er Education Programs Manager. The program consists of three topic -based groups: Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD), Sexual Health and Wellness. The department has also supported four student organizations: IMAGE (Body image awareness), START (Tobacco), RADD Crew (alcohol education and DUI prevention) and Active Minds (emotional health). The department has been significantly supported by grants throughout its history, and funders have included US Department of Education (FIPSE and Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools), Substance 321WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA ), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), California Office of Traffic Safety, California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, Irvine Health Foundat ion, Community Alliance Network and Calif ornia Tobacco Control Section. For many years, Health Education hosted AIDS Walk Orange County, and was the only prevention organization receiving an annual grant allocation. In June 2015, after celebrating its 25th Anniversary as the Health Education Cent er, the department officially changed its name to the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion in order to alig n itself with American College Health Association (ACHA ) and Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) standards a nd guidelines , and the field of health promotion in general. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion continues to be a national leader in hosting regional and national events. In February of 2013, we hosted the California Statewide Wellness & Health Promotion Directors meeting. In November 2015, the campus hosted the national Active Minds College Mental Health Conference due to the success of o ur campus Active Minds Chapter. In May of 2016, the campus hosted the national Step Up! Bystander Faci litator Training Conference. VI. LOCATION G319 Student Center South ZOT: 6125 The department moved into this expanded area when the Phase IV Student Center renovation was completed in fall 2008, and now shares some space with Campus Assault Resources & Educ ation (CARE) as of fall 2011. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is located on the same floor as key Student Affairs departments including Student Life & Leadership; the Lesbian, Gay, Center; Veteran Services; and Hospitality & Dining Services. This strengthens our ability to serve students' needs as well as effectively partner with colleagues on projects and initiatives. VII. ASSETS Major facilities, technologies, and equipme nt The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion occupies approximately 2 ,200 sq . ft. of space including approximately 900 sq. ft. of office space, 520 sq. ft. of student work space (shared with CARE) , 220 sq. ft. conference room (shared with CARE) , 200 sq. ft. of reception/lobby area , 200 sq. ft. Wellness Room , 120 sq . ft. storage room , and 85 sq. ft. consultation room (Lactation Station and other private consultations). TECHNOLOGY Computers, digital displays, camera/video equipment, audience -response clicker system/software, and other basic technology equipment. EQUIPMENT The only equipment asset for CSWHP, based on the $10,000 value mark, is our golf cart, which is required to haul programming and outreach supplies/equipment to the v arious programs and activities that we provide for the campus. VIII. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS The campus First Year Internet Required Safety Training (FIRST) module, an alcohol/sexual assault training required for all first -year and transfer students to UCI. This is a shared responsibility with CARE . We actively participate in the coordination of compliance with the federal Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act, collecting and providing data and feedback on the student side of the requirement. We also do an annual review of relevant areas (primarily AOD) of the campus Clery/ASR report. 322WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION For a complete list of Student Affairs mandates, please refer to Appendix A at the end of the book. IX.ADVISORY COMMITTEE Not applicable X. MAJOR ISSUES Budget cuts to Health Education since 2002 c ontinue to be a major concern. Our entire permanent funds budget was essentially cut in 2011 -12, as part of the Student Affairs budget plan, although th e funding was back -filled with funding from Student Heal th Center (via VCS A/AVC WHCS). However, this funding only covers our current staff salari es and benefits and does not provide any funds for casual staff, student staff, professional development/training or programming. We have been able to secure some SFAC support over the last few years (a total of $16,000 to support various programming efforts, 50% of the Wellness & Peer Education Program Manager position, and the 25% portion of th e Registered Dietitian position). Temporary allocations, voluntary reductions in salary and some savings from grants are the only operating resources available to support these expenses. We are currently using department reserves to support these operational costs, but expect those reserve s to be depleted this year i f we continue with this model. This has resulted in the need to cut back staffing, rely heavily on student staff and volunteer peer educators, and to cut back on some programs. While we recognize that space is at a premium on c ampu s, the CSWHP Wellness Room was reallocated to another un it to convert it to an office. With students reporting stress being the #1 barrier to academic success, this is a critical n eed and resource for students. ASUC I asked CSWHP to create a wellness ro om space at their annual Reclaiming Mental Health conference this year , and it was heavily utilized and appreciated by students at the conference. We even collected data that supports this as a resource that students definitel y want back and would utilize. We hope that we are eventually given that space back for students to again utilize and build upon to support their mental and emotional wellbeing. While we finally have a Registered Dietician/Nutritionist on staff now, it is a part -time position shared with Student Health (25% time in each department). This is still inadeq uate for a campus of our size and a major gap concern considering all of the food allergies, food insecurity concerns and fad diets that remain a major issue for UCI students , along with the disordered eating and more serious clinical concerns that students can face. XI.MISCELLANEOUS Not available XII. 2016-17 ACCOMPLISHMENTS After losing four full -time staff members from January -July of 2016, the summer was spent running the search for a new Ass istant Director and the fall quarter was spent running three simultaneous searches for the Department Coordinator, Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager, and the Alcohol & Other Drug Programs Manager. As of February 1, 2017 the department was finally back t o being fully staffed again. While we ran all of these searches during summer and fall, we were somehow able to essentially match the 2015 -16 outreach numbers with only half our staff d uring summer and fall of 2016. While it was extremely challenging to do the work for three vacant full -time positions on top of regular job duties and expectations, it was incredibly inspiring to experience the new energy and enthusiasm of new staff literally hit ting the ground running as they came on board. By the end of the year, we ha d almost doubled the outreach production from the previous year, reaching over 20,000 students with our program and services. 323WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Our Wellness & Peer Education Program Manager and our Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist have taken an active/leadership role with the Food/Ba sic Needs Security Initiative. They received funding and salary support to create the \"S mart 'Eaters\" workshop series. The 3-part series of workshop s covers healthy eating, eating on a limited budget (including basic financial wellness and decision - maki ng) and healthy cooking demo. This series debuted during the winter quarter and , due to its success , was offered tw ice during the spring quarter. Students who attended each workshop got to choose a basic kitchen utensil to ad d to their kitchen \"tool kit.\" Based on the success of this series coupled with data illustrating significant food security concerns of students, a special SPOP session was added to let incoming students know about food security and the various resour ces available to them when they arrive to campus, including the new FRESH Basic Needs Hub. UC President Janet Napolitano provided funding for a systemwide wellness initiative called the Healthy Campus Network initiative in 2016 -17. The initiative is i ntend ed to demonstrate a campus wide commitment to health and wellness as a pr iority on all ten UC campuses. Dr. Dan Cooper from the UCI Medical School (ICTS - Institute for Clinical & Translational Science) was selected to lead the initiative for UCI, but sever al CSWHP staff are actively involved in leadership roles. Director, Doug Everhart, serves on the overall Advisory Group for the initiative; Assistant Director, Beth England - Mackie, serves as one of the Sexual Health Workgroup Leads; Wellness & Peer Educati on Program Manager, Natalie D'Azzo, serves on both the Nutrition and Mental Health Workgroups; and Jody Margolis, Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist, serves on the Nutrition Workgroup. CSWHP received an allocation of $20,000 to support wellness programming for Local Control Fo rmula Funding (LCFF+) and first generation student populations. This funding was used to support the administration of the NCHA survey, support the Smart 'Eaters Series, support de-stress activities a t the end of the quarter, implement a \"Wellness in the Park\" event, and host a dinner/focus group where LCFF students c ould express their health and wellness needs/concerns. Director Doug Everhart presented the Step Up! Bystander Intervention program at the National Meeting on AOD Issues in Higher Education at Ohio State University in August, 2016. The program demonstrates bystander intervention as an effective strategy to address AOD and other health - related concerns on campus and in the community. Director Doug Everhart and Assistant Director Beth England -Mackie presented a workshop title d \"Creating Synergy on your Campus Around Health Messaging\" at the Building Healthy Academi c Comm unities (BHAC) Summit at the Univer sity of Florida in April 2017. The workshop demonstrated effective collaboration strategies utilized at UCI for both AOD and Sexual Health between CSWHP and our campus partners. We were able to implement and administer th e National College Health Assessment (NCHA) survey from the American College Health Assessme nt (ACHA) this spring quarter. We sent the survey to all 31,000+ students, and nearly 2500 were c ompleted. While this is still less than a 10% response rate, it mor e than doubled the less than 4% response rate we've received from random samples in the past. In addition to separate undergraduate and graduate reports, we were also able to get some targeted reports for first generation and LCFF students, providing speci fic data to develop targeted programming and messages for those populations. XIII. 2017-18 GOALS Address the budget/funding concerns and identify sustainable solutions Continue to seek and build partnerships with academic departments Seek to get our Wellness Room space back and functioning again Continue to increase awareness and visibility of our center as a valuable student resource Provide professional development opportunities for staff , as possible 324WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Fill AOD Program Manager position to return to full staff ing and do a comprehensive review at th e end of the year for the production of the annual report XIV. AWARDS Jody Margolis, Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist, received an Outstanding Supporters of Prevention Award from the Irvine Prevention Coalition for her wo rk on campus. Our Active Minds Chapter also received an Outstanding Supporters of Prevention Award for their outstanding work on campus, raising awareness about student mental health and reducing stigma around help -seeking behavior.

IX.ADVISORY COMMITTEE UCI Counseling Center Governance X. MAJOR ISSUES Continu ed increase in campus population of students with more complex and severe mental health issues has necessitated organizational restructuring and more attention to staff recru itment, retention and burnout. Competition for high quality staff and salary structure has ma de the hiring of new staff more difficult. Space allocation has not kept pace with the growth of the c ampus and demand for services. While t he Counseling Cen ter capacity for services was significantly increased with the Annex expansion, the 339WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES COUNSELING CENTER Annex space is a \"rental\" agreement with the Student Center . Obtaining adequate permanent space is critical to service the demands. Rapid rise in risk management activities and expectations. The number of campus consultation team meetings continue s to increase with add itional attention directed to preventing violence on campus. Concurrently, there are increased demands at the Counseling Center for time consuming incident reports, internal/external peer reviews, chart reviews, risk management responsibilities, electronic record standardization, case management, development of extensive new policies and procedures, and record keeping. Call for participation from the Counseling Center Management team for committees from UC Office of the President (UCOP) has greatly increased the time needed for Center administrative activities. Likewise, increased staff and utilization of services has created an increased need for administrative management and supervision. General funding for supplies and expenses is inadequate. Almo st all increased funding over the past five years has been specifically earmarked for salaries only. Union representation of Counseling Center staff in four different unions has increased the complexity of personnel issues. XI.MISCELLANEOUS Rapid e xpansion of student population overall and self -supporting degree programs for students ha s created increased demands and complexities in determining student eligibility for services. Current national leadership has initiated executive orders and legislation that has negatively impacte d marginalized student groups prevalent on our campus. Complexity of national and statewide privacy laws has highlighted the longstanding need for a systemwide attorney specializing in mental health law . XII. 2016-17 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Continued surpassing wait time goal of serving students for initial assessment appointment within 10 business days. Average of 4.9 business day wait time for initial assessment in 201 6-17. 12% increase in number of students se rved through clinical services , and 19.9% increase in number of student visits at the Counseling Center from 20 15-16 to 2016-17.

XIII. 2017-18 GOALS Increase 1) clinical mental health services , and 2) outreach programs provided to the UCI campus community through added technology (i.e. , WellTrack) Outreach efforts will include a focus on collaboration with other campus units. UC Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) ha s reached a consensus to seek an d maintain IACS accreditation.

The clinic consisted of four small examination rooms, a clinical lab, x -ray, physical therapy and a pharmacy. The current Student Health Center building, completed in May 1968, was designed to serve 5,000 students. Over the years, we c ontinue to evolve in order to meet the needs of the growing student population, now numbering over 30,000. In 1980 UCI SHC became the first student health center on the West Coast to be nationally accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulator y Health Care.

PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to increase the number of EAP students that are cleared before the academic year begins, the SHC will implement a multi -departmental approach that will hopefully streamline the EAP clearance process. With limited MH appointment availability at the SHC, it would be beneficial to explore the option of possibly referring EAP students to an external psychiatrist for 357WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER clearance. Additionally, using the Counseling department as a resource to assist with evaluations will give students more options to o btain their clearance(s). Furthermore, SHC plans on piloting an online EAP clearance portal similar to what UCLA is currently using. This portal will allow students to self -disclose information, which will then be reviewed by RNs/NPs/MH providers, thus eliminating the need for all clearances to be conducted on -site and in person. Student learning success will be quantified by measuring the number of EAPs completed before the deadline vs . number of EAPs completed after the deadline. The results will then be compared with the number of EAP students requesting clearance vs . the actual number of EAP who were granted clearance by SHC.
