However, for some the word 'spiritual' is problematic, being too vague or broad, and the word 'religious' too narrow. To refine the word 'spiritual' therefore, in a way that might be acceptable also to those who are religious, I employ the contemporary concept of spiritual intelligence (SI) as a proposed framework for linking a discourse of spirituality with electroacoustic music. In addition to postulating SI as a way of framing the word 'spirituality', I identify three different ways in which EA composers draw on spiritual or religious material: some use existing sacred texts or methods; some approach sound itself to explore the nature of reality; finally, there are those who are drawn to ancient ways of understanding where spirit and material worlds are not separated; for example, in the West, the Pythagorean tradition. - Type - Articles - Information [Organised Sound](/core/journals/organised-sound), 25](/core/journals/organised-sound/volume/C868728E57C2FEF58217164D7F862577), [Issue 302 - 306 - Copyright - \u00a9 Cambridge "}
