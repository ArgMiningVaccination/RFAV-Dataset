GENERAL OPERATIONS Introduction : The purpose of protocols in the Lincoln Fire & Rescue Emergency Medical Services system is to establish guidelines between EMS administration, the EMS provider and medical direction for the management, treatment, and transport of specific med ical emergencies. The protocols set forth are neither designed nor intended to limit the EMS provider in the exercise of good judgment or initiative in taking reasonable action in extraordinary circumstances. These protocols are intended to assist in achi eving excellent, consistent pre-hospital care for patients. The following protocols are not intended to provide a solution to every problem which may arise. Pre-hospital care is a shared responsibility between the physician and the EMS provider. The servi ces which EMS providers are authorized to perform pursuant to the Nebraska Emergency Medical Services Rules and Regulations shall be performed by the EMS provider only pursuant to the written or verbal authorization of the operational medical director or m edical control. The National Education Standards and the National EMS Scope of Practice Model shall be the reference for standard of care. In the Lincoln Fire & Rescue Emergency Medical Services system , in all cases where written protocols, directives and policies do not address patient care or disposition, the National Education Standards and the National EMS Scope of Practice Model shall be the standard. The following treatment guidelines are for use by field personnel and the Medical Control physician. They have been developed to help ensure standardized, quality medical care and to promote rapid and appropriate quality treatment of all patients regardless of economic or social status in the quickest and most efficient manner possible. The protocols co ntained in this document are detailed for Advanced Life Support (ALS) treatment modalities and are intended for use by all ALS providers operating within the Lincoln Fire & Rescue EMS System. Without actual On -Line Medical Direction, the field provider sho uld not deviate from these guidelines relating to treatment. If extenuating circumstances necessitate deviation from these guidelines, they must be explicitly detailed in the patient care report. Under no circumstances should providers deviate beyond the ir Medical Director approved scope of practice. Although these guidelines attempt to cover most situations the field provider will encounter, it is impossible to delineate all possible situations the field prov ider will face. When faced with occurrences that are not specifically addressed in these guidelines, the provider shall seek the input of On -Line Medical Direction for advice and direction. It must be emphasized when presented with a situation which is not covered by th ese LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 6 guidelines; the most appropriate decision is the one which best serves the interests of the patient and the patient's family. Definitions : The Lincoln Emergency Medical Services System: The Lincoln Fire & Rescue Emergency Medical Services System is comprised of those agencies and personnel who facilitate the delivery of pre -hospital health services to the citizens of Lincoln, Nebraska, and selected surrounding communities. From the acces s to emergency medical services, through the actual field treatment and/or transportation, to the evaluation and continuous improvement of medical providers and functions, the System is a chain, with each link dependent upon the others to provide emergency medical care to the victims of illness or injury. Specifically, the System includes the public, the Emergency 911 Communications Center, Lincoln Fire and Rescue, and the Lincoln Police Department. Medical Control: Conceptually, Medical Control is the aut hority granted to field providers enabling them to perform out -of-facility assessments and treatments. Actual Medical Control is comprised of the Physician Medical Director, the Quality Improvement staff, and the licensed physicians and advanced practice providers designated and authorized to provide Medical Direction. Medical Direction: Medical Direction is the actual medical advice and guidance afforded field providers for various types of medical or traumatic emergencies. Medical Direction can be provi ded either \"off -line\" or \"on -line\". Off -line Medical Direction is the written standards of care prescribed by Medical Control. These standards take the form of medical guidelines to be followed when presented with field interventions. These guidelines est ablish interventions which may be initiated without the actual consultation with a physician. On-Line Medical Direction is the actual verbal authority and advice given to a field provider for certain treatment modalities. For the purposes of uniformity, the written guidelines may include treatment options available only after consultation with On -Line Medical Direction. Advanced Life Support (ALS): Advanced Life Support is defined as those treatment modalities whic h are performed to treat airw ay obstructions, respiratory and /or cardiac arrest and to provide emergency lifesaving care. Examples include synchronized external cardiac pacing , and any other treatment modalities as may be authorized by Medical Control. A paramedic may function within their scope of practice pursuant to Nebraska Health and Human Services 172 NAC 11 chapter 11 001. Paramedic Practices and Procedures in accordance with the medical treatment protocols with the following exceptions invoked by the physician medical director for the Lincoln EMS System : 1. Administration of activated charcoal is not appro ved for the Paramedic LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 7 2. The use of an ophthalmoscope not approved for the Paramedic 3. The use of an otoscope not approved for the Paramedic 4. Insertion of nasogastric tubes is not approved for the Paramedic . It is the responsibility of each individual provider t o assure they function within their scope of practice, State regulations, and according to the medical treatment protocols. Any deviation from scope of practice, State regulations or the medical treatment protocols must be reported to the on -duty EMS Supervisor, and the Chief of EMS . Paramedic, System Paramedic Intern: An EMS Provider licensed by the State of Nebraska as a Paramedic who has received the Lincoln EMS protocols and the EMS OA policy and proced ures manual and has completed their hospital O.R. rotation with a minimum of one live intubation and is undergoing an orientation program designed to integrate the provider into the EMS system. System Intern paramedics may perform all ALS procedures descr ibed within the protocols when under the direct supervision of a system certified paramedic. All other treatment modalities will be limited to that of BLS until the provider has completed System Certification. System Certified Paramedic: An EMS Provider licensed by the State of Nebraska as a Paramedic that has met all the requirements to maintain Medical Control authorization to perform BLS and ALS skills within the Lincoln EMS System. The System Certified Paramedic is authorized to initiate, on Standing Order, every treatment modality indicated in the Medical Treatment Protocols except those that are specified by \"[Medical Direction]\". Paramedic Preceptor: A System certified paramedic who has been authorized by Medical Control to supervise, orient, train, and evaluate paramedic students ( students) and paramedic interns (interns.) Paramedic Student (Student): A person enrolled in a n approved paramedic trainin g program. The student will only be authorized to perform skills up to their current level in the training program and while under the direct supervision of a system certified paramedic. For the complete list of ALS interventions that are not authorized fo r students , please re fer to policy 8 the EMSOA System Policies and Procedures manual. Patient Management - Standards of ALS Care : 1. Apply cardiac monitor and continuously monitor the patient until transferred to hospital staff. 2. Cardiac rhythms are correctly identified and documented in the ePCR . 3. All medications shall be administered by the appropriate dose and route of administration. LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 8 4. Medication preparation and administration: To ensure the proper medication is prepared and admin istered, the paramedic who prepares the medication should administer it. This guideline is established for both labeled prefilled syringes/containers and for medications which need to be drawn up from a vial or ampule. The label should be read immediatel y to verify it is the intended medication. The label should be read again when drawing the medication from the vial or ampule or preparing the prefilled syringe. 5. Prior to administering the medication to the patient, a medication administration cross -check must be performed utilizing a second EMS provider when one is present. a. Medication Administration Cross -Check - medication verified prior to administration following the procedure listed on the Medication Administration Cross -Check reference card. b. If a second provider is not available, the medic giving the medication must conduct the cross -check procedure by themselves utilizing the criteria on the reference card. 6. Medication exchanges or \"Handing off\" medications: One medic preparing the medication and \"handing off\" the medication for another medic to administer increases the chance for medication error and should rarely occur in the Lincoln EMS system. If there is no other option than \"handing off\" a medication, the medic who prepares the medication shall state the name of the medication, intended dose, and volume to administer to the receiving medic, and the receiving medic shall verbally repeat the information for confirmation. Once the correct medication, dose , and volume have been confirmed, the medication shall be administered according to the appropriate medical treatment protocol. 7. Medications administered to adults via the endotracheal tube (ETT) route should be given at 2 times the recommended IV dose. Those medications that can be administered via the ETT are Naloxone (Narcan ), and Epinephrine . Medications given via ETT for neonates should be diluted in 1 -2 mL of NS. 8. Venous access shall be established via intravenous or intraosseous techniques for the purpose of medication administration, fluid administration, or as deemed necessary by the provider as the patient's condition or treatment modalities warrant. 9. All skills are accomplished quickly and efficiently utilizing proper technique: 10. All venipuncture for intravenous therapy is established using aseptic technique, in an expedient manner. Macro drip tubing attached to a macro bore extension set should be utilized for routine adult I .V. administration. In general, micro drip tubing should be used for piggyback medication infusions and/or pediatric patients. 11. Saline locks are established using aseptic technique in an expedient manner. An IV extension tubing flushed with a 10 mL-prefilled syringe should be utilized for routine saline lock administration. If at any time the patient's clinical presentation LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 9 changes and they require intravenous fluids or medication s, an IV infusion will be established utilizing the already placed IV extension tubing. 12. All IV sites are paten t and without signs of infiltration. 13. For purposes of these guidelines, IV administration shall include IO and saline locks when indicated. 14. ALL IM injections should be placed in the lateral thigh. 15. Any patient treated for pain must be monitored for ETCO2 and SPO2 and the findings should be documented in the ePCR. 16. All airway management techniques are performed effectively and correctly. 17. There will be a designated primary airway management provider for every case that requires advanced airway control. 18. All intubation tubes are correctly placed within 30 seconds of last mechanical ventilation. An oropharyngeal airway or other appropriate device w ill be utilized as a bite block immediately after advancing the intubation tube to its proper position. 19. An endotrac heal intubation attempt is defined as \"Anytime the laryngoscope blade is inserted into the patient's mouth\". 20. Tube placement must be verified and/or monitored using all the following: a. Direct auscultation b. Waveform capnography i. Intubated patients must be continuously monitored utilizing capnography to maintain ETCO2 levels of 35 -45 mmHg (30 -35 mmHg for head injury patients with signs of brain stem herniation) with a n SPO 2 greater than or equal to 94%. 21. All skills are accomplished without unnecessarily delaying on -scene time . 22. Under most circumstances, on -scene times should be limited to 20 minutes for medical patients and 10 minutes for \" designated trauma\" patients. If a \"trauma\" scene time is greater than 10 minutes, there must be a documented reason for the extended scene time. 23. No more than two (2) attempts for IV/IO access or intubations should occur on - scene. Further attempts should not delay patient transport and should be performed enroute to the hospital. IV/IO access and intubations for \"trauma\" patients should be performed in route. There must be a documented reason for ALS attempts performed on trauma patients while still on scene. 24. All radio communications are professional, pertinent, and succinct. 25. Medi cal Direction is consulted prior to initiating those treatment modalities that can only be administered under [Medical Direction]. 26. If Medical Direction cannot be reached after three (3) attempts by radio due to a communications failure, one attempt must be made by cell phone. If no contact LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 10 is possible, the paramedic may initiate required care according to the medical treatment guidelines. However, in these situations, an incident report must be filed with the provider's agency detailing the events surround ing the incident. 27. When appropriate, a radio report is given from the scene in a timely manner. 28. Information is presented accurately. 29. Updated radio reports are provided as indicated by changes in the patient's condition. Physician on Scene : 1. When a physicia n is present on the scene and desires to direct patient care, paramedic personnel should: a. Inform the physician that if the physician directs patient care , the physician must accompany the patient to the hospital. b. Inform the physician at the onset that para medic personnel have strict legal guidelines and established protocols, and they may not exceed those guidelines or protocols. c. Inform the physician that any procedure outside of these legal guidelines must be carried out by the physician. 2. Paramedic personnel have the right and obligation at any time there is gross deviation from the accepted protocol to contact the receiving hospital for further instruction. The physician on the scene should be informed if contact with the hospital is bein g made. 3. If possible, it may be advisable to contact the receiving hospital via landline or cellular phone and have the receiving hospital physician speak directly to the physician at the scene. \"Do Not Resuscitate\" (DNR) Orders and Identification of CPR Only : 1. A DNR is a written order by a physician stating that a patient should not be resuscitated or have CPR performed. A DNR must be signed by a patient , or the patient's medical POA, dated, and must identify the patient by name. If a physician 's signature is not present , the check box regarding telephone order must be checked. 2. EMS providers will not initiate or continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a patient in cardiac arrest once a valid DNR order is confirmed. In the event o f uncertainty, resuscitative measures should be initiated. 3. DNR does not mean that emergency medical care for any other medical condition will be changed or limited. Patients should receive emergency medical treatment up until the point of cardiac arrest. 4. A written DNR order must contain the patient's name and be signed by the physician or by the RN who received the order from the physician. Verbal LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 11 confirmation of a DNR by a family member or friend without verification of a written DNR is not sufficient. 5. In a skilled care facility (nursing home) or Long -Term Acute Care (LTAC) , DNR orders documented in the patient's medical record are considered valid if signed by the physician or by the RN per verbal order of the physician. A DNR form may be used but is not required in the nursing home setting. 6. An EMS provider can honor an ef fective Living Will or Health Care Power of Attorney. This applies only to adults. EMS providers can presume the validity of either of these documents if signed in Nebraska. Documents from other states in compliance with that state's laws are also valid in Nebraska. 7. Observation of an original or a photocopy of a living will, or health care power of attorney must be documented in the patient care report. The patient care report must also contain information that the patient is an adult (is 19 or older or has been married). 8. If a telephone consult with the patient's physician or the physician's designee verifies a DNR, the paramedic can honor the order. Authorization shall be documented on the patient care report and include the physician's or physician designee's name, telephone number and time of the telephone call from the paramedic to the physician. 9. Once CPR has been initiated, resuscitative measures may be discontinued when any one of the following occurs: a. A DNR or no code order is confirmed . b. A physici an physically present at the scene or medical control for the service, based on information from the out -of-hospital providers on scene, determines that CPR is futile or should be discontinued . c. An out of hospital provider is following termination of CPR pr otocols that have been authorized by the Physician Medical Director . d. Any time the scene becomes unsafe for rescuers . 10. In the even t there is a question regarding a DNR or Advanced Directive, initia te resuscitation, and contact Base Physician. 11. For purposes of resuscitation, an iGel is considered an invasive airway and is contraindicated by a DNI order. Discontinue or No Initiation of CP R: 1. Situations may occur where CPR has been initiated on an obviously deceased patient prior to the arrival of EMS. If the patient meets the following criteria, the EMS provider may discontinue CPR or may choose not to initiate CPR. a. No pulse , AND b. No spontaneo us respirations , AND LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 12 c. Pupils fixed and dilated , AND d. One or more of the following: i. Patient with obvious lethal injury - trauma cardiac arrest with injuries incompatible with life . (I.E., massive blood loss, displacement of brain tissue, decapitation) ii. Wrinkle d cornea . iii. Rigor mortis . iv. Postmortem form . vii. Physician authorization . NOTE: Care should be taken to rule out hypothermia, acute alcoholic intoxication, and drug overdose . Out of Hospital Confirmation of Death : 1. The purpose of this protocol is to allow Paramedics to confirm /declare a patient dead based on certain criteria with permission of the base physician . This does not include obviously deceased patients. Permission for declaration of death will be called to the nearest hospital over radio, cell phone or landline. 2. Criteria for Requesting Declaration of Death in the Field: a. Patient found down for unknown period . (Or greater than 10 minutes) b. No CPR in progress when paramedics arrive on scene . c. Patient assessed and found to have no signs of life . d. Paramedic ECG evaluation is asystole in two leads . Termination of Resuscitation : Purpose: 1. When there is no response to pre -hospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often preferable to cease futile resuscitat ion efforts in the field. 2. For patients in cardiac arrest, pre -hospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning spontaneous circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS providers can perform an initial resusc itation that is equivalent to an in -hospital resuscitation attempt, and there is usually no additional benefit to emergency department resuscitation in most cases. 3. CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR done at the scene. Additionally, EMS providers risk physical LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 13 injury while attempting to perform manual CPR in a moving ambulance while unrestrained. Continuing resuscitation in futile cases increases the time that EMS crews are not available for another call, impedes emergency department care of other patients, and incurs unnecessary hospital charges. 4. When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient's family should become the focus of the EMS providers. Families need to be informed of what is being done; most families understand the futility of the situation and are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field. Criteria: 1. A cardiac arrest patient that has received resuscitation in the field but has not responded to treatment and a base physician has ordered termination of resuscitation efforts. 2. Consider field termination of resuscitation in the following situations: a. There is no response to approximately 25 minutes of ALS care including ventilations with advanced airw ay and several \"rounds\" of resuscitation drugs. b. During resuscitation, new information related to a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" (DNR) order is obtained. 3. Transport should not be initiated unless you have a \"return of spontaneous circulation. (ROSC) Exclusion Crite ria: 1. Consider continuing resuscitation and transporting patients with the following conditions (although under certain circumstances, a base physician may order termination of resuscitation in these conditions also): a. Cardiac arrest associated with medical conditions that may have a better outcome despite prolonged resuscitation, including: i. Hypothermia . ii. Electrocution . v. Drug overdose . 2. Cardiac arrest in infants and children . 3. Cardiac arrest in a public place after continu ing the resuscitation on scene for approximately 25 minutes. 4. Cardiac arrest in an environment where the bystanders do not accept the idea of ceasing efforts in the field. While most families understand the futility of the situation and are very accepting of field termination, some family members or bystanders can become hostile. LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 14 5. Initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (V -fib) or ventricular tachycardia (V -tach). 6. Persistent ventricular fibrillation (V -Fib) or ventricular tachycardia (V -tach), regardless of initial rhythm. 7. ROSC at some point during the resuscitation. Notification of Family Members: 1. A death notification is an acknowledged difficult conversation even for a seasoned health care provider. The difficulty may stem from personal identification with the family or victim, recognition of the survivor's emotions, feeling of failure or fear of blame by the survivor. 2. The on -duty EMS Supervisor will be dispatched to every cardiac arrest when they are available, but it is acknowledged they may be unavai lable for any number of reasons. In this case the most experienced medic on scene working with company officers should explain to the family what they are doing and why. The mnemonic GRIEV_ING\u00a9 was developed by Dr. C. Hobgood MD to aid in communication wi th grieving survivors. G - gather Gather the family; ensure that all members are present. R - resources Call for support resources available to assist the family with their grief, i.e., chaplain services, ministers, family, and friends. I - identify Identify yourself, identify the deceased or injured patient by name and identify the state of knowledge of th e family relative to the events of the day. E - educate Briefly educate the family as to the events that have occurred during the resuscitation, educate them about the current state of their loved one. V - verify Verify that their family member has died. Be clear! Use the words \"dead\" or \"died.\" - space Give the family personal space and time for an emotional moment; allow the family time to absorb the information. I - inquire Ask if there are any questions and answer them all. N - nuts and bolts Inquire again if they would like you to contact a chaplain, minister, family, or friends. Offer the family the opportunity to view the body. LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 15 G - give Give them your card and access i nformation. Offer to answer any questions that may arise later. Always return their calls. The GRIEV_ING mnemonic is copyrighted C. Hobgood, MD. 3. The use of a mnemonic to help alleviate provider stress and provide structure to the message being communicated has been successfully us ed for years in other formats. 4. If at any time the survivors become hostile, aggressive, or unwilling to allow you to leave the patient in their surroundings, load the patient and transport to the hospital that was conta cted for permission to terminate resuscitation. Notify the base physician of the events surrounding the unforeseen transport. 5. In most cases, you should be aware of whether the survivors are agreeable of not transporting before the decision is made to terminate the resuscitation. 6. The patient should be covered to the level of the chin. IV s and/or IO's should be left in place but the IV bag or bags should be removed from the tubing. All unsuccessful IV sites should be bandaged. ET tubes and I-gel Airways should be left in place with securing device still in place. 7. Law enforcement must be on scene before crews leave the scene. Refusal of Care : 1. Adults . a. An adult is an individual 19 years old or older or who is or has been married (NEB REV STAT \u00a743 -2101). A competent adult (as determined by the Informed Decision -Making Refusal Form) can refuse medical services and/or transportation to a health car e facility. b. A legal guardian can consent to or refuse medical services and/or transportation to a health care facility for an incompetent adult. c. A person appointed as a Health Care Power of Attorney can consent or refuse consent for medical services and/or transportation to a health care facility for the incompetent adult named in the power of attorney. 2. Minors . a. A minor is an individual under 19 years of age that has never been married. In the absence of suspected abuse and/or neglect, a parent or legal guardian can consent or refuse consent on behalf of a minor, for medical services and/or transportation to a he alth care facility. 3. Documentation . a. All consent or refusals of consent for medical treatment and/or transportation must be documented on the \"Informed Decision - Making Form\" and in the patient care report. When possible, the \"Informed Decision -Making Form \" should be signed and dated by the patient or LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 16 other individual authorized to give or refuse consent. All refusals to sign a consent or refusal of consent must be documented in the patient care report or other appropriate record(s). LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 17 Part II. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Airway and Oxygen : 1. An intact airway and adequate oxygenation and ventilation are essential for all patients with medical or traumatic conditions. Throughout this protocol, it is assumed that the Paramedic will maintain a patent airway a nd provide appropriate supplemental oxygenation. 2. Maintain patent airway with head -tilt/chin -lift or modified jaw thrust maneuver and consider an oral or nasal airway adjunct. 3. If the patient is ventilating adequately on their own , apply nasal cannula at mask at 12-15 L/min . 4. High flow oxygen shall be avoided in medical patients unless signs of severe hypoxia are present. High flow oxygen remains the standard of care in trauma patients. 5. If NOT ventilating adequately, assist ventila tions with BVM and 100% oxygen - advanced airway management may be required. 6. Consider PEEP, set PEEP valve at 5 cm of H2O initially, may titrate to max of 10 cm of H2O. 7. Anytime a patient is manually ventilated , including the use of BVM only , ETCO 2 shall b e monitored. 8. Consider assisting ventilations in those patients wh ose respiratory status does not improve after receiving oxygen by non -rebreather mask. 9. If pulse oximetry is used, adjust oxygen delivery devices to an oxygen saturation of 94% or above in medical patients and 100% in trauma patients. 10. Use the trauma ET intubation method with patients who have suspected compromised cervical spines. 11. Confirm endotracheal tube placement by observing for chest rise and fall and by verifying the presence of lu ng sounds and the absence of epigastric sounds by auscultation with a stethoscope. The use of ETCO 2 is required. 12. Consider immobilizing the head with a c -collar to prevent head movement during transport when a patient is intubated. Commercial securing dev ices are recommended over tape to secure the ET tube in place. 13. If unable to intubate after two (2) attempts; consider alternate airway management methods as directed by Medical Director such as BVM ventilation, or the I-gel Airway. 14. RSI (Rapid Sequence Intu bation ) is an advanced airway management technique that requires specialized training and authorization by the Physician Medical Director. ** THIS PROCEDURE MAY ONLY BE PERFORMED BY THOSE LF&R MEDICS WHO HAVE BEEN CREDENTIALED TO PERFORM RSI BY THE MEDICA L DIRECTOR IN THE LINCOLN EMS SYSTEM. LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 18 IV Therapy : 1. All IV insertions refer to peripheral IV's (extremities and external jugular vein), including saline locks and intraosseous (IO) lines. IO insertion is authorized for unstable pediatric and adult patients. 2. For trauma patients, IVs should be started enroute to the hospital, except when there is an unavoidable delay such as prolonged extrication time. 3. Large bore IVs refer to #14 or #16 plastic IV catheters - infuse at rate as indicated by pulse and blood pressure. 4. This protocol permits a maximum of three ( 3) attempts per patient for IV insertion. 5. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) may be used in emergency situations. PICC lines are located on the arm and usually contain saline but other central lines may be flushed with Heparin. Only PICC lines may be accessed. If a PICC line must be accessed, withdraw and discard at least 20 ml of blood and maintain sterility. 6. Under no circumstances are pre-hospital providers allowed to access a fistula . You may continue to use a fistula only if it has been accessed in the dialysis center and the dialysis nurse gives permission. 7. Fluid Therapy - Give fluid amounts as listed below. While administering a fluid bolus, frequently reassess perfusion for improvement. If perfusion improves, slow the IV to TKO and m onitor closely. If patient develops fluid overload respiratory distress (dyspnea, rales, rhonchi, decreasing SpO 2), slow the IV to TKO. a. ADULTS: Give a 20 mL/kg bolus up to 2 L to maintain a Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) of greater than 65mmHg. If no impro vement after one bolus, contact [Medical for direction. b.

Standard practice in EMS is to use body substance isolation when caring for ALL patients. Gloves and eye pr otection are required on every patient contact. 2. This means wearing gloves and eye protection when administering patient care; handling blood and body fluids or surfaces or items soiled by blood and body fluids . The use of mask s, aprons or gowns shall be u sed during procedures likely to generate splashes of blood , droplets of blood or body fluid or in cases of communicable diseases . LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 19 3. Hands shall be washed after each patient care incident, even if gloves were worn or waterless soap was used. 4. This policy als o applies to immediate disposal of needles and sharps in disposable impervious SHARPS containers. 5. The practice of recapping needles is highly discouraged . 6. All personnel should wear surgical masks and/or N-95 masks when in contact with patients in which an airborne communicable disease is suspected or confirmed by history ( e.g., tuberculosis, influenza , or Covid-19). Restraints : 1. Indications: a. A patient who needs transportation for medical care, who is refusing transport of care, and who is incompetent to refuse. b. A person, who appears confused and who because of such confusion appears an imminent danger to others , themsel ves or to be gravely disabled. 2. Precautions or Consideratio ns: a. Any attempt at restraint involves risk to the patient and to the out -of- hospital provider. b. The rescuer's safety must come before patient considerations. c. Do not attempt to restrain the patient without adequate assistance. 3. Physical restraints are a last resort. All possible means of verbal de-escalation should be attempted first. 4. Any restrained patient may vomit, be prepared to suction , and reposition as needed. Once restrained, the patient is never to be left alone. Aspiration can occur if patient is restrained on their back and cannot protect their own airway. 5. Check restraints as soon as applied and every 10 minutes thereafter to ensure no injury to extremities . 6. Do not restrain a patient in the prone position. 7. Do not restrain a patient sandwiched between backboards, scoop stretchers or other immobilization devices. 8. Do not \"hog tie\" patients .

LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 70 EMS Spinal Precautions and the Use of the Long Backboard : Position Statement National Association of EMS Physician and American College Of Surgeons Committee on Trauma ABSTRACT This is the official position of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma regarding emergency medical services spinal precautions and the use of the long back board. Key words: spine; 2013: Early Online: 1-2 The National Association of EMS Physicians and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma believe that: 1. Long backboards are commonly used to attempt to provide rigid spinal immobilization among emer gency medical services (EMS) trauma patients. However, the benefit of long backboards is largely unproven. 2. The long b ackboard can induce pain, patient ag itation, and respiratory compromise. Further, the backboard can decrease tissue perfusion at pres sure points, leading to the development of pressure ulcers. 3. Utilization of backboards for spinal immobilization during tr ansport should be judicious, so that the po tential benefits outweigh the risks. 4. Appropriate patients to be immobilized with a back board may include those with: a. Blunt trauma and altered level of consciousness b. Spinal pain or tenderness c. Neurologic complaint (e.g., numbness or motor weakness) d. Anatomic deformity of the spine e. High-energy mechanism of injury and any of the following: i. Drug or alcohol intoxication ii. Inability to communicate iii. Distracting injury 5. Patients for whom immobilization on a backboard is not necessary include those with all the following: a. Normal level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score [GCS] 15) b. No spine tenderness or anatomic abnormality c. No neurologic findings or complaints d. No distracti ng injury e. No intoxication LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 71 6. Patients with penetrating trauma to the head, neck, or torso and no evidence of spinal injury should not be immobilized on a backboard. 7. Spinal precautions can be maintained by application of a rigid cervical collar and securing th e patient firmly to the EMS stretcher, and may be most appro priate for: a. Patients who are found to be ambulatory at the scene b. Patients who must be transported for a protracted time, particularly prior to inter-facility transfer c. Patients for whom a backboar d is not otherwise indicated 8. Whether or not a backboard is used, attention to spinal precautions among at - risk patients is paramount. These include application of a cervi cal collar, adequate security to a stretcher, mini mal movement/transfers, and mainte nance of in-line stabilization during any necessary movement/ transfers. a. Education of field EMS personnel should include evaluation of the risk of spinal injury in the context of options to provide spinal precautions. b. Protocols or plans to promote jud icious use of long backboards during pre - hospital care should engage as many stakeholders in the trauma/EMS system as possible. c. Patients should be removed from backboards as soon as practical in an emergency department. Approved by the National Associati on of EMS Physicians Board of Directors December 17, 2012.

The following are the suggested steps for providing care to a person suspected of having Ebola or any other extremely infectious disease. 1. Screen the patient for Ebola by askin g the appropriate questions if: 1 2 a. Do they have flu like symptoms, fever greater than 101.4\u00b0 F, fatigue, headache, weakness, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or unexplained hemorrhage, and b. Has t he patient has lived in or traveled to a country with widespread Ebola Virus tran smission or had contact with an individual with confirmed Ebola Virus Disease within the previous 21 days. 2. If the patient meets the above criteria, EVERYONE should retreat from the environment and: 3 a. Someone from the original crew should don contents of t he LF&R Infectious disease kit and return to the patient's side. This will more than likely be someone from the Engine or Truck Company since they will probably arrive on location before the medic unit. Provide patient comfort care only. i. Place a mask on the patient or ask them to don a mask. 3. Contact 911 dispatch immediately and request an Infectious Disease transport ambulance . 4. Request that dispatch send the closest HazMat apparatus . a. The closest HazMat apparatus will determine if they have enough people on their crew trained to deal with donning and doffing and request additional support if needed. 5. Request the appropriate Battalion Chief and EMS -1 to the scene . a. EMS -1 will be responsible for immediately contacting the LLCHD and the Chief of EMS. 6. The receivi ng hospital should be notified as soon as possible that we are transporting a patient potentially infected with Ebola. 1 http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00371.asp 2 Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 73 7. Once a transport ambulance arrives on scene, two members from the HazMat apparatus should don the appropriately sized brown Tyvek suits, SCBA's, and gowns from the Infectious disease kit, and double glove . a. The required SCBA's can be removed from the medic unit on location . 8. A trained observer should be designated and should ensure that PPE is donned properly. 4 9. The two providers wearing the Tyvek suits and SCBA's should contact the patient and place them on the ambulance cot. Cot should be covered by the appropriate absorbent drapes before the patient is placed on the cot. a. The absorbent cot drape should be used to \"cocoon\" the patient and t he \"cocoon\" should be secured with tape . b. Only BLS care will be provided to the patient . 10. Once the providers have properly donned their PPE the other members of the HazMat station apparatus should immediately proceed to the hospital and prepare for decontamination of the two providers in the Tyvek suits. 11. Members from the originally dispatched engine crew shall provide a driver for the Infectious Disease ambulance and accompany the ambulance to the hospital. Drivers should don the contents of the Inf ectious disease kit, being especially conscious of wearing clean gloves, eye protection and a face mask. 12. The two members of the transport team wearing Tyvek suits and SCBA's shall accompany the patient in the back of the ambulance to the hospital where the y will move them to the designated areas as specified by hospital providers . 13. Someone will be assigned to drive the ambulance and should don the contents of the Infectious Disease kit. 14. The members of the transport team will be de -contaminated using the best judgment of the HazMat captain in conjunction with EMS -1. All personnel that provided patient care will doff their PPE under the auspices of a \"trained observer\". (EMS -1 can be used as a reference source but will not be donning PPE). a. Providers should sh ower at the hospital and don hospital scrubs until they can return to their station. Clothing should be double bagged and can be laundered using hot water and regular laundry soap . b. Contact the emergency room Charge Nurse for directions to the showers and surgical scrubs. 15. The providers will return to work and will be screened using the CDC recommendations for someone who has potentially been exposed to Ebola. The 4 http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/ppe -training/index.html LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 74 LLCHD will be involved in this screening process to ensure the safety of the providers; 5 a. Providers are not considered infectious until they develop symptoms 2 -21 days later . Since they are considered asymptomatic , these individuals are in the low (but not zero) risk category. 6 16. The transport ambulance will be parked until a determination has been made if the patient does have Ebola. This will usually take between four (4) and six (6) hours . a. All PPE, SCBA's, and the cot should be placed in the back of the transport ambulance . 17. If the patient is found to have Ebola or another extremely infectio us disease a private contractor suggested by LLCHD will be hired to decontaminate the interior of the ambulance. 7 18. If the patient does not have Ebola or another extremely infectious disease the ambulance will be cleaned following the appropriate MP. 19. The v ehicle can the n be placed back into service .

ALS providers may establish IV access and administer a patient's prescribed Factor VIII or Factor IX for Hemophilia A or B. 2. Follow the manufacturers guidelines for administration. Adrenal Insufficiency: 1. Patients with a medical history of adrenal insufficiency and prescribed hydrocortisone . 2. Assess for signs of acute adrenal crisis: a. Pallo r, weakness, lethargy b. Vomiting, abdominal pain c. Hypotension, s hock -like symptoms d. Fever/infection e. Seizures or neurologic deficits f. Hypoglycemia g. Recent trauma (including minor injuries) or illness 3. Airway, oxygen, apply cardiac monitor, and continuously monitor the patient until transferred to hospital staff. 4. Check blood sugar level. 5. Start IV with NS, titrate to vital signs. 6. If blood sugar is less than 60 mg/dL and/or signs & symptoms are present which are consistent with hypoglycemia, treat hypoglycemia. 7. In any patient with a medical history of adrenal insufficiency /crisis, and prescribed hydrocortisone: a. ALS providers may adm inister prescribed hydrocortisone : i. Administer patient prescribed dose . OR ii. Adult: 100 mg IV or IM iii. Pediatric: 2mg/kg IV or IM LFR Paramedic Protocols Last Edited July 13, 2023 78 Emergency Interfacility Transport Considerations : 1. LF&R's primary mission is 911 service, not interfacility transfers but realize there may be times when it would be beneficial for the patient to be transported emergently from one hospital to another. 2. Specialty team transfers apply only to hospitalized p atients requiring transport ation to another hospital within the Lincoln, Nebraska city limits. 3. The specialty team members oversee patient care during specialty team transports. LF&R personnel oversee overall safety of all occupants being transported. 4. If LF&R is requested to emergently transport a patient from one hospital to another without a specialty team, the paramedic must assess the patient and determine if they are educated, certified, licensed, and credentialed to provide adequate medical care f or the patient's acuity level. A significant risk to patient safety occurs when EMS personnel are placed into situations and roles for which they are not experientially or educationally prepared. It is the shared responsibility of medical oversight by a p hysician, clinical and administrative supervision, regulation, and quality assurance to ensure that EMS personnel are not placed in situations where they exceed the State's scope of practice. For the protection of the public, regulation must assure that EM S personnel are functioning within their scope of practice, level of education, certification, and credentialing process. 5. Prior to taking the transfer, the paramedic must receive detailed information about any medication infusions and/or equipment being tr ansferred with the patient. If the paramedic is not comfortable transporting the patient after receiving the information the paramedic will express their concern to the sending physician and request a nurse to ride with them or request a specialty team transport. 6. If the patient has IV medication drips on pumps or any type of medical device such as an IABP, they should ask the facility the following questions. a. Can the facility send personnel with the transport crew? b. Can the IV drip or device be stopped or disconnected for the transport? 7. If the facility cannot or will not send someone with the transport crew and the IV drip medications or device cannot be discontinued for the transport, the crew should contact their EMS Supervisor. 8. It is acceptable for the provider to transport IV medication pumps if they are comfortable in doing so and are familiar with the medications. 9. The provider may contact EMS -1 for additional guidance.
