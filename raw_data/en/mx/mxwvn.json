[BoDanielle Park](/Expert/81227213-BoDanielle-Park)Acupuncturist Duluth, Georgia YES FOR LIVER AND GB MERIDIANS ARE USED WIDELY TO TREAT ALL KINDS OF LIVER RELATED PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, FOOD AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR DAILY LIFE WHILE GETTING TREATMENTS. [Mrs. Rebecca Kitzerow](/Expert/586706-Rebecca-Kitzerow)Acupuncturist La Center, WA Acupuncture can help to support Liver Detoxification, yes, but working with diet, lifestyle and sometimes supplementation is key for that as well. [Roxene Bates DOM LAc ADS](/Expert/81227082-Roxene-Bates-DOM-LAc-ADS)Acupuncturist Logan, UT Because there have been very few studies using acupuncture to help people with liver conditions, at this time, there is no evidence that it can help. However, it is a safe therapy if performed correctly and can help de-stress the individual, which will help the body heal. The best way to look after your liver is to maintain a healthy weight, follow a balanced plant-based diet, exercise regularly, minimize alcohol intake, and avoid smoking. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Absolutely. Acupuncture improves the function of any organ, and all body systems to help the body detoxify.

I would also recommend herbal medicine. Rawls Whittlesey, L. Ac. Rawls Whittlesey, L. Ac. [Neilly A. Buckalew](/Expert/8128589-Neilly-A-Buckalew)Acupuncturist Post Falls, ID Thanks for your question. From a Western medicine perspective of what \"detoxification\" of an organ could mean, no. The liver is in fact the organ that does a vast majority of detoxification for the human body. From a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) perspective, acupuncture is used to support the liver in achieving balance in order to fulfill its role in detoxifying the body. TCM's goal is to move \"chi\" in a way that allows the body to be well. Blockage of \"chi\" in TCM causes illness. You might consider this a kind of \"detox\" if you think of acupuncture's effect in unblocking \"chi\" allowing wellness to flow.

Talk to your acupuncturist. David [Mr. Stephen Hoyle Dell-jones](/Expert/1362819-Stephen-Hoyle-Dell-jones)Acupuncturist Brandon, FL Hello, and thank you for your question, I see someone on TV must be talking about detoxing the liver lately due to the questions I am getting lately in various platforms. In brief, yes, acupuncture can detox your liver, by way of increasing blood flow within the liver. Little understood secrets that are very important for the long term: eating broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts also detox your liver by increasing the actual phase one detoxification cycle (as it is actually called in physiological terms) and helping overall liver health, as well as providing proven anti-cancer compounds, fiber, vitamins and nutrients. These foods can be eaten daily, preferably cooked. Best wishes. I see someone on TV must be talking about detoxing the liver lately due to the questions I am getting lately in various platforms.

Leonard](/Expert/1434534-Ellen-D-Leonard)Acupuncturist Grants Pass, OR Acupuncture can support your liver, but the organ will detoxify itself if it isn't being fed a continuous diet of toxins. [Mr. Anthony James Lorenzo](/Expert/2819877-Anthony-James-Lorenzo)Acupuncturist I'm feeling like I don't have enough information here. What made you come to the conclusion that your liver is toxic? Can acupuncture detox the liver is a difficult question. An easier question is--can acupuncture strengthen the liver (which does the detoxing on it's own when functioning) function? I would say yes to that question, it is likely. Usually in natural health circles detoxifying the liver is the last or second to last detoxifying when doing \"detoxing.\" First, we start with the intestines. Then the kidneys. Maybe then the Liver.... and lastly, the blood. That being said, the best way to \"detox\" is to stop putting toxins in the system. Since zero toxic exposure is likely impossible in this day and age, it is more about minimizing exposure to toxins. This is the first place to start and easy enough on your own. Get a good water filter. Stop eating processed foods. Eat minimal amounts of meat (3-6 oz daily) of only organic fed and pasture raised or grass fed animal products. Learn about the \"Dirty Dozen\" foods found to be contaminated with pesticides/herbicides. Stop eating seafood unless organically farm raised. Never eat wheat unless it is organic. Same with soy and corn products. As for detoxifying the body... sweating, especially infrared sauna therapy, is a great way to detox (you should consult a physician to ensure this is safe for you first)... though you should always rinse off afterwards so your skin does not reabsorb toxins. Fresh organic juice fasting for short periods (to start) of 3 days is another good way to help your body. I recommend getting a masticating juicer, if you don't have one. Fasting (for 3 days) and sauna therapy are relatively safe processes, but there are always exceptions. And you should consult a doctor before embarking on this to ensure they are safe for you by obtaining a health care professional's advice and personal evaluation of your unique condition.

[Ramona Whan](/Expert/271147-Ramona-Whan)Acupuncturist Wildomar, CA We have Chinese herbs that can help with that. Acupuncture will help to circulate liver energy, and will help to calm it as well. [Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO In Chinese medicine, we don't detox liver but treat the liver-related issues in order to rescue the liver. [Kim Ngo](/Expert/81753669-Kim-Ngo)Acupuncturist Santa Clara, CA Yes, acupuncture absolutely can help detox liver. Recommended herbal medicine and acupuncture combine together for best result. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO Usually we'd look to herbs and dietary modification to accomplish this task. Acupuncture can certainly help, but it's more of an adjunct treatment. [Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York I want to start by saying that liver cleanses (or any cleanse for that matter) are not necessary nor recommended by doctors. As for whether or not acupuncture can dexoify an organ, the short answer is yes, but not in the way that a \"detox tea\" may claim to work. What the acupuncture is actually doing is supporting your body's natural ability to detoxify itself. [Ms. Qin Milla Mu](/Expert/2479613-Qin-Milla-Mu)Acupuncturist San Jose, CA Yes, acupuncture can "}
