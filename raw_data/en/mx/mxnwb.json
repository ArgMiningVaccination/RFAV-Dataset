Naturopathy has been used for years as a way to treat nutrient deficiencies that can cause depression. Naturopathy depression treatments involve cleansing the body of toxins, which may include determining the levels of heavy metals such as mercury in your body. These can often cause depression and if you rid the body of these toxins and make a few nutritional adjustments you can feel like a new person in no time. Naturopathy doctors also can help look for deficiencies that you may have. Another cause of depression can be a low level of vitamin D. Because we cannot get all of the vitamin D that we need from food alone, they may prescribe that you sit in the sun for 10 to 15 minutes a day to refuel your body as well as taking the right nutritional supplement with Vitamin D to make your bones strong and healthy.
