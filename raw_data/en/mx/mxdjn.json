In particular, their involvement in energy-yielding metabolism, DNA synthesis, oxygen transport, and neuronal functions makes them critical for brain and muscular function. These, in turn, translate into effects on cognitive and psychological processes, including mental and physical fatigue. This review is focused on B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B8, B9 and B12), vitamin C, iron, magnesium and zinc, which have recognized roles in these outcomes. It summarizes the biochemical bases and actions of these micronutrients at both the molecular and cellular levels and connects them with cognitive and psychological symptoms, as well as manifestations of fatigue that may occur when status or supplies of these micronutrients are not adequate.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-01-16", "cleaned_text": "Vitamins and Minerals for Energy, Fatigue and Cognition: A Narrative Review of the Biochemical The link between biochemical and physiological functions is established for some vitamins and minerals, as is their role in clinical outcomes. As an example, vitamin A is a component of the pigment rhodopsin located in the retina, that enables visual processes and prevents blindness. In many other instances, however, the nature of the involvement of micronutrients in molecular and cellular reactions that translate into physiological and functional effects is poorly understood. [2](#B2-nutrients-12-00228)]. However, the available scientific rationale for these is often based on theoretical biochemical grounds and clinical features seen during frank clinical deficiencies, rather than on robust, empirical, physiological data. Such clinical deficiencies are relatively uncommon, particularly in developed countries. Conversely, subclinical or inadequate intakes (sometimes referred to as 'insufficiencies') are frequent worldwide, albeit with variations according to age groups and country [ [3](#B3-nutrients-12-00228), [4](#B4-nutrients-12-00228)]. A varied and balanced diet, rich in nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables and dairy products, is able to provide the amounts of vitamins and minerals needed. There is ample evidence, however, that food choice or availability often preclude such a diet. This can lead to a significant proportion of the population not meeting their optimum dietary needs, in emerging and developed countries. For example, 68% of Mexican women have folate (vitamin B9) intakes below the estimated average requirement (EAR) [ [5](#B5-nutrients-12-00228)], and thiamine (vitamin B1) dietary intakes are below EAR in 55% of Turkish adults of both genders [ [6](#B6-nutrients-12-00228)]. Although the majority of Americans consume sufficient amounts of most nutrients to offset clinical symptoms, in many individuals intake falls below the EAR or Adequate Intake levels [ [7](#B7-nutrients-12-00228)]. In such cases, vitamin and mineral supplementation may become a means to meet adequate intake. Indeed, this is one of the most frequent reasons for consumption given by supplement users. An enhanced feeling of well-being, a reduction in mental and physical fatigue and improvements in psychological and cognitive functions are also among the commonly reported motivations for taking supplements [ [8](#B8-nutrients-12-00228), [9](#B9-nutrients-12-00228)]. 2. Energy and Fatigue Are Subjective Perceptions Supported by an Objective Physiological Basis 2.1. Different Definitions Exist for Concepts Such as 'Energy' or 'Fatigue' [10](#B10-nutrients-12-00228)]. [11](#B11-nutrients-12-00228)]). Each can be defined as the sum of certain mental and physical components As examples the former may include degree of emotional and psychological well-being, level of perceived fatigue, mental resilience and perseverance, with the latter including feeling \"strong and fit\", or \"unable to do anything\") [ [12](#B12-nutrients-12-00228)]. [13](#B13-nutrients-12-00228)], lack of sleep or poor sleep was the major reported cause, while family and professional worries, stress and environmental factors (noise, heat, transportation) were also frequently cited. Physical aspects of fatigue included a lack of energy in two-thirds of subjects, with reduced stamina and a lack of strength reported in half of the cohort. Affective consequences of fatigue were reported as changes in mood and lack of motivation in 75% of subjects, low spirit and lack of vitality in 50%. In addition, more than half of subjects reported a diminished concentration and memory difficulties [ [13](#B13-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similar conclusions were retrieved from a survey in a representative sample of the general Swedish population, who reported that both mental and physical fatigue were accompanied by a reduced activity level [ [14](#B14-nutrients-12-00228)]. 2.2. Fatigue, Lack of Energy and Lower Physical and Cognitive Performance [15](#B15-nutrients-12-00228)]. Nevertheless, numerous studies have reported that fatigue elicited by physical training translates into worsened sport performance. For instance, cross-country skiers had decreased double poling performance after a 25 min trunk fatiguing exercise sequence, compared with a 25 min rest [ [16](#B16-nutrients-12-00228)], and fatigued ballet dancers exhibited impaired movement control, which may increase the risk of injury [ [17](#B17-nutrients-12-00228)]. Interestingly, impaired performance appeared to be associated with not only physical and muscular fatigue, but also mental fatigue. For example table tennis players hit the ball with lower speed and accuracy when they had previously completed a 90 min cognitive task [ [18](#B18-nutrients-12-00228)]. [19](#B19-nutrients-12-00228)]. The link between fatigue and risk of road traffic accidents is well established, including in car drivers [ [20](#B20-nutrients-12-00228)] and rail freight-regulating employees [ [21](#B21-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similar deleterious effects are observed in in children, in whom fatigue is associated with poorer school performance [ [22](#B22-nutrients-12-00228), [23](#B23-nutrients-12-00228), [24](#B24-nutrients-12-00228)]. 2.3. What Are the Physiological Bases of Physical and Mental Fatigue [25](#B25-nutrients-12-00228)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-12-00228)]. Recent studies suggest that muscle fatigue may be the consequence of a metabolic challenge to a relatively small population of fast fatigue-sensitive muscle fibres, in which adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels can be depleted to less than 30% of resting concentrations. As these fibres have a high contraction speed, they contribute greatly to power output, especially at faster movement rates, and depletion in available energy results in worsened performance and physical fatigue [ [27](#B27-nutrients-12-00228)]. [28](#B28-nutrients-12-00228)]. Indeed, most of the energy consumed by the brain is dedicated to neuronal functioning. Synapse transmission (e.g., the process enabling communication between neurons, which involves conversion of an electric action potential into a chemical message [neurotransmitter]) is a highly energy-demanding process. Large amounts of ATP are dedicated to maintaining the resting energy potential and to manage neurotransmitter synthesis and processing within synapses [ [29](#B29-nutrients-12-00228)]. Unlike the skeletal muscles, which contain significant amounts of stored energy in the form of glycogen, the brain has only minimal energy reserves and it is thus dependent on the regular supply of energy substrates from the circulation through the blood-brain barrier. Under normal physiological and nutritional conditions, the major energy fuel for the brain is glucose. However, when glucose availability is reduced, the brain can use alternative energy substrates such as lactate, medium-chain triglycerides and ketone bodies [ [30](#B30-nutrients-12-00228)]. [31](#B31-nutrients-12-00228)]. While this is true for the whole brain, local neuronal activity can change significantly, during sensory or motor stimulation and also during the period that separates sleep and waking situations. In addition, memory formation and synaptic plasticity are accompanied by changes in neuronal communication/firing. A phenomenon known as 'neurometabolic coupling', adjusts the local energy supply and cerebral blood flow to variations in neuronal activity and enables appropriate metabolic substrate delivery to maintain functioning of neurons [ [32](#B32-nutrients-12-00228)]. 2.4. Fatigue May Also Result from A Dysfunction in The Supply of Oxygen to Muscles and Brain [33](#B33-nutrients-12-00228)]. Resting muscle consumes 'only' 1 ml O2 per minute and per 100 g of tissue, but oxygen consumption can increase up to 50-fold in contracting muscle, when exercising [ [34](#B34-nutrients-12-00228)], and this enables enhanced performance [ [35](#B35-nutrients-12-00228)]. During anemia, i.e., when the levels of hemoglobin (the oxygen carrier) are decreased, oxygen delivery is impaired, with consequences for not only cognitive [ [36](#B36-nutrients-12-00228)] and physical [ [35](#B35-nutrients-12-00228)] performance, but also perceived fatigue and tiredness [ [37](#B37-nutrients-12-00228)]. It is notable that sustained, intense mental processing results in a measurable decrease in circulating levels of glucose [ [38](#B38-nutrients-12-00228), [39](#B39-nutrients-12-00228), [40](#B40-nutrients-12-00228)] and oxygen [ [41](#B41-nutrients-12-00228)]. Fatigue is considered a major component of anemia symptomatology, whatever the underlying reason for decreased hemoglobin level [ [42](#B42-nutrients-12-00228)]. 3. Vitamins and Minerals Have Critical Roles in Cellular Energy Production 3.1. Overview of Cellular Energy Production [43](#B43-nutrients-12-00228)]. Ingested food is digested by enzymes that break down carbohydrates into monomeric sugars (monosaccharides), lipids into fatty acids and proteins into amino acids. Sugars, fatty acids and amino acids enter the cell, where a gradual oxidation occurs, first in the cytosol, then in the mitochondria. The energy-generation process can be broken down into the three steps described below, that ultimately produce chemical energy as ATP that can be easily used elsewhere in the cell. [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A) [44](#B44-nutrients-12-00228)]. and FADH2 transfer their electrons to the electron transport chain. As they proceed through this chain, electrons lose their energy, which is used to generate ATP by the phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (oxidative phosphorylation). The resulting low-energy electrons are combined with oxygen molecules and with protons (H +) from the surrounding solution to produce water [ [44](#B44-nutrients-12-00228)]. [44](#B44-nutrients-12-00228)]. This complex and highly efficient system exploits the energy-containing macronutrients as well as the vitamins and minerals that make possible the extraction of energy from these macronutrients. 3.2. The Interplay of B Vitamins in Cellular Energy Production [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001)). Adequate supply of each B vitamin is required for appropriate functioning of the energy-production system and a shortfall in any one of them will be rate limiting for energy production, with potentially severe metabolic and health consequences. [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A). Within the citric acid cycle, TPP part [47](#B47-nutrients-12-00228)]. is involved in the production of acetyl-CoA from fatty acids via beta-oxidation, from glucose via the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and from catabolism of branched amino acids ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A). FAD is required in the citric acid cycle steps that produce succinyl-CoA from alpha-ketoglutarate and from succinate ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part B), and FADH2 acts as an electron donor in the electron transport chain ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part C). [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A). NAD is also required in the citric acid cycle steps that produce isocitrate from succinyl-CoA and then malate Finally, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation starts in complex I of the electron transport chain, where NADH is oxidized and donates its electron to initiate transport across the chain ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part C) [ [45](#B45-nutrients-12-00228)]. [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A). It gives rise to thioester derivatives, including acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, which feature in the acid [Figure part glycogen phosphorylase, which releases glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen and provides additional glucose when needed, such as in exercising muscle (not shown on figure) [ [48](#B48-nutrients-12-00228)]. [49](#B49-nutrients-12-00228), [50](#B50-nutrients-12-00228)]. The major biotin-dependent enzymes involved in energy production are propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the incorporation of bicarbonate into propionyl-CoA to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle through conversion to succinyl-CoA, and pyruvate carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to form intermediate in the citric acid cycle ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part B). Other biotin-requiring enzymes regulate the availability of fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation or amino acids for use in the citric acid cycle. [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part B). This conversion occurs during the oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids and the catabolism of ketogenic amino acids [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-00228)]. 3.3. Vitamin C, Iron and Magnesium Are Also involved in Energy-Yielding Metabolism [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A) so impaired carnitine metabolism, including through insufficient vitamin C supply, can be responsible for weakness or muscle aching [ [52](#B52-nutrients-12-00228), [53](#B53-nutrients-12-00228)]. [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part C) [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-00228)]. Among those, dehydrogenase is as a key enzyme in the cycle ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part B). [Figure 1](#nutrients-12-00228-f001), part A). Magnesium acts also as a regulator of the activity of several enzymes of the citric acid cycle, including the isocitrate dehydrogenase and the complex ( [Figure binds to magnesium ions to compose biologically functional forms and, in the mitochondria, ATP-Mg complexes help export mitochondrial ATP into cytosol and thus deliver energy within the cell [ [56](#B56-nutrients-12-00228), [57](#B57-nutrients-12-00228), [58](#B58-nutrients-12-00228)]. 4. Vitamins and Minerals Are Important for Regulating Oxygen in the Body 4.1. Oxygen Transport Requires Iron and Vitamins B6, B9 and B12 [54](#B54-nutrients-12-00228)]. Myoglobin, another heme protein, allows the transport and short-term storage of oxygen in muscle cells, helping to match the supply of oxygen to the high demand of working muscles. Iron deficiency anemia reduces blood transport and supply of oxygen to muscle, impairing endurance capacity and energetic efficiency [ [54](#B54-nutrients-12-00228)]. [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00228-f002)). The folate cycle, which is critical to the generation of the active forms of vitamin B9, is dependent upon vitamin B12. In its methylcobalamin form, B12 is itself mandatory for the activity of the enzyme methionine synthase, which helps in coupling the demethylation of tetra-hydrofolate and the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine by the transfer of a methyl group [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-00228)]. Vitamin B6 is also involved in homocysteine catabolism, through the transsulphuration pathway, which converts homocysteine into cysteine via two vitamin B6 (PLP)-dependent enzymes. A deficiency in vitamin B9, B12 or B6 can thus lead to the accumulation of homocysteine [ [59](#B59-nutrients-12-00228)]. [48](#B48-nutrients-12-00228)]. [60](#B60-nutrients-12-00228)]. When DNA synthesis is impaired, the production of red blood cells, a process requiring intense cell replication, is disrupted and deficiency in folate can lead to megaloblastic anemia, characterised by a low red blood cell count and an accumulation of red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, in the form of large, immature, nucleated megaloblasts, all of which lowers the oxygen transport capacities of blood [ [61](#B61-nutrients-12-00228)]. [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00228-f002)), megaloblastic anemia is also a frequent clinical expression of cobalamin deficiency (present in 70-80% of cases of deficiency). Indeed, DNA synthesis is impaired by low vitamin B12, which hampers the activation of folate and, as a result, decreases normal red blood cell production, impairing oxygen delivery [ [62](#B62-nutrients-12-00228)]. 4.2. Riboflavin, Vitamin C, Iron, Magnesium and Zinc and Oxidative Stress [63](#B63-nutrients-12-00228)]. This is especially the case in tissues such as the muscle or brain, which consume large amounts of oxygen. The organism has developed a powerful antioxidant defence system in which certain vitamins and minerals play an important role. [64](#B64-nutrients-12-00228)]. [52](#B52-nutrients-12-00228), [53](#B53-nutrients-12-00228)]. Because of this ability to donate electrons, ascorbic acid scavenges reactive oxygen species as well as singlet oxygen. High tissue levels of ascorbate provide substantial antioxidant protection where free radicals are encountered [ [52](#B52-nutrients-12-00228), [53](#B53-nutrients-12-00228)]. Because of its protective role versus oxidation, vitamin C deficiency in the brain may cause oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, related to the high oxygen demand of brain structures [ [65](#B65-nutrients-12-00228)]. Vitamin E prevents the propagation of a chain reaction of lipid oxidation that could especially affect polyunsaturated fatty acids in the membrane, including in neuronal structures [ [66](#B66-nutrients-12-00228)]. When a molecule of vitamin E neutralizes a free radical, it is oxidized and its antioxidant capacity is lost. Other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, are capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E within a chain of oxidative-reductive reactions [ [67](#B67-nutrients-12-00228)]. [68](#B68-nutrients-12-00228)], there is ample evidence that a lack of magnesium leads to oxidative stress [ [69](#B69-nutrients-12-00228), [70](#B70-nutrients-12-00228)]. Among the suspected mechanisms, inflammation associated with low magnesium levels is known to increase the production of free radicals in phagocytes and neutrophils and lead to endothelial dysfunction [ [68](#B68-nutrients-12-00228)]. Preclinical studies have also shown that magnesium deficiency leads to increased nitric oxide production, which, when in excess, can trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide [ [71](#B71-nutrients-12-00228)]. [72](#B72-nutrients-12-00228), [73](#B73-nutrients-12-00228)]. The anti-inflammatory role of zinc eventually results in the down-regulation of the production of reactive oxygen species: for example, zinc is able to modulate the activity of the nuclear factor-B signalling pathway and is thus able to indirectly affect the expression of numerous genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses [ [74](#B74-nutrients-12-00228)]. [54](#B54-nutrients-12-00228)], especially in the brain, where iron-induced oxidative stress may cause neurodegenerative processes [ [75](#B75-nutrients-12-00228), [76](#B76-nutrients-12-00228)]. This pro-oxidative action of iron is however limited, in normal physiological conditions, by the very tight regulation of iron metabolism via homeostasis, which prevents iron overload. Moreover, free iron, the most reactive form, is not physiologically present in the body, as iron is bound to transferrin and ferritin in the plasma and to several chaperones and iron-binding proteins in cells, reducing the chances of free or nonligated iron becoming available to participate in the Fenton reaction [ [77](#B77-nutrients-12-00228), [78](#B78-nutrients-12-00228)]. 5. Vitamins and Minerals Are Critical for the Structure and Function of Brain Cells [79](#B79-nutrients-12-00228)], but is especially critical during infancy and young childhood, when brain development occurs [ [80](#B80-nutrients-12-00228)], and during ageing, when significant structural and functional changes in the brain occur [ [81](#B81-nutrients-12-00228)]). 5.1. Vitamins and Minerals Are Involved in Neuronal Structures [82](#B82-nutrients-12-00228)]. [83](#B83-nutrients-12-00228)]. These post-translation modifications are in particular present in nervous system structures: protein acetylation also appears important thus an appropriate provision of methionine [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-00228)]. [65](#B65-nutrients-12-00228)] 5.3. Vitamins B3 and B5, Are Important for Neurotransmission [95](#B95-nutrients-12-00228)]. [83](#B83-nutrients-12-00228)]. [88](#B88-nutrients-12-00228)]. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that a limited and controlled amount of reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neurons, including those generated by iron through the Fenton reaction, may stimulate calcium release, and thus allow calcium signals to activate the signalling cascades that lead to the transcription of genes known to participate in synaptic plasticity [ [96](#B96-nutrients-12-00228)]. [97](#B97-nutrients-12-00228)]. [89](#B89-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6. Clinical Evidence of the Role of Vitamins and Minerals on Physical Fatigue [98](#B98-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.1. Impact of Inadequate Status of Vitamins and Minerals on Physical Fatigue 6.1.1. Inadequate Status of Individual B Vitamins and Physical Fatigue [99](#B99-nutrients-12-00228)]. General symptoms include fatigue, ataxia due to muscle weakness in the legs and arms, muscle pain and tenderness, and dyspnoea on exertion. [100](#B100-nutrients-12-00228)]. High rates of marginal and deficient riboflavin status have been found in healthy women from both Canada and Malaysia and were indicative of a higher risk of anemia [ [101](#B101-nutrients-12-00228)], which enhances the risk of associated fatigue symptoms. [102](#B102-nutrients-12-00228)]. [103](#B103-nutrients-12-00228)]. One case of lethargy, associated with anorexia, weight loss, and hypochromic anemia, has been described, in a middle-aged woman. She experienced these symptoms twice, with an interval of several years, and they improved dramatically on each occasion following administration of pantothenic acid [ [104](#B104-nutrients-12-00228)]. [105](#B105-nutrients-12-00228)]. The importance of maintaining an adequate vitamin B6 status has been highlighted by the observation that iron supplementation could be ineffective in treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women who had vitamin B6 deficiency [ [106](#B106-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similar conclusions had been made earlier from a study in iron-deficient German children who had an accelerated hemoglobin synthesis and thus recovered better from anemia after an 8 day period when they had been treated with a combination of iron and vitamin B6, compared with iron alone [ [107](#B107-nutrients-12-00228)]. [108](#B108-nutrients-12-00228)]. [109](#B109-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.1.2. Inadequate Status in Vitamin C and Physical Fatigue [110](#B110-nutrients-12-00228)]. More than 15,000 healthy men and women, aged 40 to 79, had their blood vitamin C measured and completed the well-validated 36 Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. The SF-36 measures self-reported physical and mental health across a number of domains, including those related to physical health and vitality. The population was sorted in quartiles, according to their blood vitamin C levels, from the lowest (below 41 \u00b5mol/L) to the highest (above 66 \u00b5mol/L) and risk of poorer outcomes was estimated using regression models that adjusted results according to different potential confounding factors (sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities). Whatever the regression model, those in the lowest quartile of vitamin C, compared with the highest, had significantly increased odds of having a poor physical functional health SF-36 score, a poor bodily pain score, a poor self-reported general health and a poor vitality score. When vitamin C supplementation was considered as a stratification factor, the results were no longer statistically significant for a few physical functional health domains in those who received vitamin C supplementation, while the results became more consistent for participants with no vitamin C supplementation [ [110](#B110-nutrients-12-00228)]. This study is consistent with the previous finding that high intakes of fruits and vegetables (the major source of vitamin C in the diet) were associated with better self-reported physical functional health [ [111](#B111-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.1.3. Consequences of Inadequate Status in Iron and Magnesium on Physical Fatigue [112](#B112-nutrients-12-00228)]. Besides increasing perceived fatigue, iron deficiency is also known to decrease physical performance, work efficiency and working capacity [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-00228)]. When addressing aerobic capacity (measured by VO2max, i.e., the maximum amount of energy consumed by a subject during an intense physical exercise), evidence from clinical studies suggests that both severe and moderate iron deficiency anemia impair aerobic capacity, and this impairment is in proportion to the severity of anemia. Impairments can disappear by increasing hemoglobin concentration via iron supplementation [ [113](#B113-nutrients-12-00228)]. [56](#B56-nutrients-12-00228)]. These symptoms are related to the role of magnesium in nerve transmission and muscle contraction. Other symptoms of magnesium deficiency may include fatigue, lethargy, staggering, and loss of appetite [ [114](#B114-nutrients-12-00228)]. [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00228)]. For instance, one small cross-sectional study performed in 26 male athletes indicated a positive and significant association between magnesium intake and maximal isometric trunk flexion, rotation, hand grip, jumping performance, and isokinetic strength indicators [ [116](#B116-nutrients-12-00228)]. Exercise has an impact on magnesium distribution and utilization (with magnesium being transported to locations where energy production is taking place, in response to exercise), and magnesium is necessary for muscle contraction and cardiorespiratory functions [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00228)]. Furthermore, since magnesium needs are likely to be increased in conditions where the metabolism is accelerated, physically active subjects may have higher magnesium requirements. Suboptimal or deficient magnesium status in subjects involved in strength training programmes may be associated with less efficient energy metabolism and impaired endurance capacity. On the contrary, higher magnesium intakes have been reported to be associated with lower oxygen needs and better cardiorespiratory indices in aerobic exercise [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00228), [117](#B117-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.2. Effects of Supplementation with Vitamins and Minerals on Physical Fatigue 6.2.1. Supplementation with Individual B Vitamins and Physical Fatigue [118](#B118-nutrients-12-00228)]. [119](#B119-nutrients-12-00228)]. A recent original study has addressed symptoms that can be connected to physical fatigue, due to muscle pain and soreness after a physical exercise. Thirty-two adults (80% men) who participated in an ultramarathon (161 km race) received riboflavin (100 mg) or a placebo capsule shortly before the race start and again when reaching 90 km. Muscle pain and soreness ratings during and immediately after the race were found to be significantly lower for the riboflavin-treated group. When performance on 400 min runs was measured, 3 and 5 days after the ultramarathon, times were significantly faster for the riboflavin-treated group. Although preliminary, this work suggests that riboflavin supplementation before and during prolonged running may have a beneficial effect on muscle fatigue [ [120](#B120-nutrients-12-00228)]. [121](#B121-nutrients-12-00228)]). [122](#B122-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.2.2. Supplementation with Vitamin C and Physical Fatigue [123](#B123-nutrients-12-00228)]. In another study, 44 workers who received an oral dose of 6 g vitamin C daily for 2 weeks in an open trial reported lower perceived fatigue and exhibited significantly increased blood vitamin C, from 42.9 to 68.6 \u00b5mol/L [ [124](#B124-nutrients-12-00228)]. These findings were confirmed when vitamin C was provided by the intravenous route, a non-physiological but relevant route of administration for research or medical purposes. In a randomised trial, 141 office workers aged 20-49 years received 10 g vitamin C or a placebo in one intravenous injection. Fatigue scores 2 h and 1 day after intervention were significantly lower in the vitamin C-treated group and especially in those who had the lowest baseline serum vitamin C. [ [125](#B125-nutrients-12-00228)]., Vitamin C supplementation is currently used in patients who have cancer- and chemotherapy-related symptoms, such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, and pain. Several recent studies have indicated that intravenous vitamin C led to significant improvements of these symptoms and found that not only overall health, but also physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning were improved [ [126](#B126-nutrients-12-00228)]. [127](#B127-nutrients-12-00228)]. 6.2.3. Supplementation with Iron and Magnesium and Physical Fatigue [128](#B128-nutrients-12-00228)]. Among the included studies, a 12 week trial of iron therapy (80 mg elemental iron daily) enrolled 198 women aged 18-53 years with unexplained fatigue, according to answers to a validated questionnaire in the practices of 44 French general practitioners. These women were menstruating, nonanemic but with low or borderline ferritin levels, denoting a marginal blood iron status. The mean group score for fatigue decreased in the placebo group (by 29%), but it decreased significantly more (by 48%) after iron intake in the treated group. Iron supplementation increased hemoglobin by 0.32 g/dL and ferritin by 11.4 \u00b5g/L, when compared with placebo [ [129](#B129-nutrients-12-00228)]. Other trials, not included in this meta-analysis, reported similar findings: in a study that enrolled 290 women, fatigue was reduced significantly more (65.3%) in those who received a single infusion of 1 g of iron than in placebo-treated controls (52.7%) [ [130](#B130-nutrients-12-00228)]. Iron supplementation thus helps in recovery from perceived fatigue above the placebo effect. [128](#B128-nutrients-12-00228)]. However, a meta-analysis gathering data from 15 studies carried out in endurance athletes found a moderate but significant favorable effect on VO2max of iron intervention (oral iron in most studies, with dosages varying from 10 to 300 mg/day and for durations ranging from 14 to 84 days). The influence of iron treatment in nonanemic athletes should not be dismissed, as it may serve to prevent an otherwise detrimental reduction, which would place the athlete at a greater risk of developing iron deficiency anemia [ [131](#B131-nutrients-12-00228)]. Furthermore, when endurance capacity (i.e., the maximum length of time an individual can sustain a given workload) and energetic efficiency (i.e., the amount of physiological energy required to perform a given amount of external work) are considered, the effect of iron supplementation can also be seen in milder iron deficiencies. A meta-analysis on 22 studies found that iron supplementation improved both maximal exercise performance and submaximal exercise performance, demonstrated by a lower heart rate required to achieve defined workloads [ [132](#B132-nutrients-12-00228)]. In a recent trial, 73 young untrained women with nonanemic iron deficiency received either a placebo or 42 mg iron daily for 8 weeks and were submitted to aerobic exercise training; iron supplementation increased endurance performance at submaximal and maximal exercise intensities; serum ferritin increased significantly in the supplemented group vs. the placebo group (46.9 \u00b5g/L vs. 21.8 \u00b5g/L) [ [133](#B133-nutrients-12-00228)]. [127](#B127-nutrients-12-00228)]. [134](#B134-nutrients-12-00228)]. One intervention study in physically active college students found that endurance performance during submaximal exercise increased after magnesium supplementation (8 mg/kg/day, which is 500 mg/day approximately for a body weight of 60 kg), thus suggesting a possible beneficial impact on the perception of exercise-related fatigue [ [135](#B135-nutrients-12-00228)]. This impact of magnesium on exercise-related fatigue may be related to a reduction/delay in lactate accumulation in muscles [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00228)]. [136](#B136-nutrients-12-00228), [137](#B137-nutrients-12-00228)], while others failed to report benefits [ [138](#B138-nutrients-12-00228)]. For example, magnesium supplementation (8 mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks was shown to improve muscle strength (quadriceps torque) significantly in 26 untrained young adults submitted to a strength training programme, as compared with placebo [ [136](#B136-nutrients-12-00228)]. In another trial, 1 week supplementation with 300 mg magnesium/day was reported to significantly increase muscle strength (+ 8% in bench press scores) as compared with baseline measurements, while no significant changes were observed with placebo, in 13 recreational sportspeople [ [137](#B137-nutrients-12-00228)]. Data from animal studies suggest that magnesium might improve exercise performance via enhancing glucose availability in the brain, muscle and blood, and reducing/delaying lactate accumulation in muscles, which may delay exhaustion [ [115](#B115-nutrients-12-00228)]. The positive impact on lactate has been observed in a controlled clinical study where magnesium supplementation (10 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 weeks attenuated the exercise-induced increase in plasma lactate levels of 30 young Tae-Kwan-do sportsmen [ [139](#B139-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7. Clinical Evidence of the Role of Vitamins and Minerals on Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions 7.1. Impact of Vitamins and Minerals Frank Deficiencies on Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions 7.1.1. Deficiencies in Individual B Vitamins and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [99](#B99-nutrients-12-00228), [140](#B140-nutrients-12-00228)]. When thiamine deficiency is corrected early enough, symptoms can be fully reversed and significant brain damage can be prevented. However permanent brain damage and irreversible cognitive dysfunction will occur if thiamine deficiency persists and this can be critical as encephalopathies linked to thiamine deficiency remain largely undiagnosed [ [141](#B141-nutrients-12-00228)]. Specific clinical neurologic symptoms are observed only when thiamine deficiency is severe, and it has long been believed that low thiamine status had no long-term sequelae. An accidental thiamine deficiency in children fed an infant formula erroneously lacking thiamine, resulted in persistent cognitive and motor deficits. Even the children who initially appeared unaffected subsequently displayed a range of cognitive dysfunction, including delayed language acquisition, language impairment and dyslexia, poor coordination skills, and learning disabilities; quoted in [ [99](#B99-nutrients-12-00228)]. While this is likely to be related to neuronal injuries during the critical period of brain development, it can be hypothesized that subtle negative cognitive outcomes resulting from lifelong subclinical thiamine deficiency may also occur in populations with low dietary thiamine intake. Studies in animal models have shown that thiamine deficiency leads to memory impairment: performance in several cognitive tests, including avoidance or maze tasks, is decreased in thiamine-deficient rats compared with control animals. In addition, diminished learning was seen in animals with thiamine deficiency, which exhibited reduced neurogenesis, a feature also encountered in the early stages of Alzheimer disease [ [142](#B142-nutrients-12-00228)]. [102](#B102-nutrients-12-00228)]. These symptoms attenuate or disappear following niacin intake, confirming its role in the brain and nervous system [ [143](#B143-nutrients-12-00228)]. In addition, niacin receptors, which are normally distributed throughout the brain, are affected in several brain areas in people with Parkinson disease (who generally have low niacin levels); quoted in [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-00228)]. [144](#B144-nutrients-12-00228)]. In humans, there is a rare genetic defect in the production of pantothenate kinase, an enzyme that is crucial in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, which translates into inherited neurodegenerative diseases or neurodegeneration [ [145](#B145-nutrients-12-00228)]. Experimentally induced deficiency in pantothenic acid results in personality changes [ [103](#B103-nutrients-12-00228)]. [146](#B146-nutrients-12-00228)]. [49](#B49-nutrients-12-00228)]. The mechanisms leading to these neurological disorders are not well known, but it could reasonably be assumed that the key role of biotin in the energetic metabolism of all cells, including in brain and nerves, participates in the normal functioning of the nervous system [ [29](#B29-nutrients-12-00228)]. [147](#B147-nutrients-12-00228)], and can even occur before serum vitamin B12 concentrations reach a level that would be considered deficient by standard criteria. It is likely due to progressive neuronal degeneration, due to the inhibition of methionine synthase [ [51](#B51-nutrients-12-00228)]. In addition, deficiencies in vitamin B12 are associated with mental and cognitive impairment, such as irritability, memory loss, depression, and cognitive disturbances up to dementia [ [148](#B148-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7.1.2. Deficiency in Vitamin C and Minerals and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [149](#B149-nutrients-12-00228)]. Early-life iron deficiency may produce irreversible neural changes when neurogenesis and differentiation of brain regions are occurring; numerous observational studies have shown associations between iron deficiency and/or associated anemia and poor motor and cognitive development outcomes in children. Findings from prospective studies indicate that infants who are anemic have poorer cognitive capacities, impaired school achievement, and increased behavioural difficulties into middle childhood [ [150](#B150-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7.2. Relationships between Vitamin and Mineral Dietary Intake or Status and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions 7.2.1. Intake or Status in Individual B Vitamin and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [142](#B142-nutrients-12-00228)]. [151](#B151-nutrients-12-00228)]. [152](#B152-nutrients-12-00228)]. In addition, in a cohort of 3136 American adults followed for 20 years from age 18 to 30 years, those in the highest quintile of dietary niacin intake at baseline (i.e., a median intake of 24.7 mg/day) had better results in cognitive tests 20-25 years later than did those with the lowest dietary intake of niacin (median 8.6 mg/day, so below the US recommendation, set at 15 mg daily) [ [153](#B153-nutrients-12-00228)]. In 317 healthy Korean children with no previous diagnosis of neurologic or psychiatric disorders, analyses showed that fewer omission errors were made during tests in those with the highest vitamin B3 intakes [ [154](#B154-nutrients-12-00228)]. [155](#B155-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similar findings come from a study in 710 Spanish school children that suggest that children with depressive symptoms had lower intakes of vitamin B5, as well as of other B vitamins [ [156](#B156-nutrients-12-00228)]. [157](#B157-nutrients-12-00228)]. In addition, a cohort of 3136 young adults has been followed for at least 20 years from age 18 to 30 years and those in the highest quintile of dietary pyridoxine intake at baseline (i.e., a median intake of 3.0 mg/day) had better results in psychomotor speed tests 20 to 25 years later than those with the lowest dietary intake of pyridoxine (median 0.7 mg/day) [ [153](#B153-nutrients-12-00228)]. [156](#B156-nutrients-12-00228)]. However, intakes of other nutrients, such as those of zinc and vitamin B12, were also significantly lower. [158](#B158-nutrients-12-00228)]. In 425 Iranian young adults (mean age 32.5 years), those with folate intake above the recommendation had significantly lower scores when assessing depressive affect, somatic complaints and interpersonal difficulties [ [159](#B159-nutrients-12-00228)]. In a cohort of more than 2200 healthy Norwegian individuals aged 71-75 years, high plasma folate levels were associated with improved cognitive performance [ [160](#B160-nutrients-12-00228)]. Such associations have been confirmed in two recent meta-analyses. The first one found a small but significant association, such that individuals with depression had lower folate levels than those without depression [ [161](#B161-nutrients-12-00228)]. In the second one, gathering 6949 elderly subjects, a higher risk of depression was associated with low folate status [ [162](#B162-nutrients-12-00228)]. Additional evidence comes from longitudinal studies, such as in a prospective cohort that enrolled more than 7000 women aged 65-79 years: low baseline folate intakes (i.e., below the recommended 400 \u00b5g/day) or low serum folate concentrations were significantly associated with a higher risk of cognitive decline or dementia during a 5 year follow-up [ [163](#B163-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similarly, young adults with a high dietary intake of folate (mean intake: 384 \u00b5g/day) had better cognitive function 20 to 25 years later, in midlife, when compared with those with the lowest folate dietary intakes (mean intake: 152 \u00b5g/day) [ [153](#B153-nutrients-12-00228)]. [164](#B164-nutrients-12-00228), [165](#B165-nutrients-12-00228), [166](#B166-nutrients-12-00228)], while studies in adults are scarce. The importance of early supply of vitamin B12, during pregnancy and infancy, on later cognitive outcomes has been recently reviewed [ [164](#B164-nutrients-12-00228)]. Higher maternal vitamin B12 status and/or higher vitamin B12 intakes during pregnancy have been prospectively associated with improved measures of cognition in 330 children later in life. In Nepalese children aged 2-12 months, the vitamin B12 status was biochemically assessed and was found significantly associated, 5 years later, with improved development and performance on assessments of social perception and visuospatial abilities [ [167](#B167-nutrients-12-00228)]. In 72 adolescents aged 10-16 years, it has been shown that the cognitive performance was worse when they had consumed a vegan diet (thus containing low amounts of vitamin B12) from birth to 6 years of age, when compared with omnivorous children [ [168](#B168-nutrients-12-00228)]. Cross-sectional studies in older children or adolescents most often found that lower biochemical vitamin B12 status was associated with impaired school performance and mental and social development, as well as short-term memory and attention [ [164](#B164-nutrients-12-00228)]. These findings are suggestive of a role for vitamin B12 in enabling improvement of cognitive capabilities in children and are consistent with its role in neural myelination, brain development, and fetal and child growth. In addition, a higher intake of B vitamins, including cobalamin, throughout young adulthood was associated with better cognitive function in midlife. A cohort of 3136 young adults has been followed for 20 years from age 18 to 30 years and data show that those in the highest quintile of dietary vitamin B12 intake at baseline (i.e., a median intake of 8.7 \u00b5g/day) had better psychomotor speed 20 to 25 years later than those with the lowest dietary intake of cobalamin (median 2.2 \u00b5g/day) [ [153](#B153-nutrients-12-00228)]. Several studies using functional biomarkers of vitamin B12 status showed a trend towards associations between poor vitamin B12 status in an ageing population and faster cognitive decline and risk of Alzheimer's disease [ [169](#B169-nutrients-12-00228)]. A population-based study in 3884 elderly men and women with depressive disorders found that those with vitamin B12 deficiency were almost 70% more likely to experience depression than those with normal vitamin B12 status [ [170](#B170-nutrients-12-00228)]. However, more recent systematic reviews have less clear conclusions: no association was found between blood vitamin B12 concentrations and cognitive decline or dementia, but four studies that assessed vitamin B12 status with newer biomarkers found associations between low vitamin B12 status and an enhanced risk of diagnosis with dementia or cognitive decline [ [165](#B165-nutrients-12-00228)]. [Figure 2](#nutrients-12-00228-f002)). A deficiency in any of these vitamins may lead to a lack of methionine synthesis that leads to the accumulation of homocysteine, which is a suspected risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and dementia, although this point remains controversial [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-00228), [171](#B171-nutrients-12-00228), [172](#B172-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7.2.2. Intake or Status in Vitamin C, Iron, Magnesium and Zinc and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Function [173](#B173-nutrients-12-00228)]. Vitamin C status has been found to be associated with better mood in male students from New Zealand: the higher the plasma concentration, the lower the reported mood disturbance, depression, confusion and anger, assessed by the Profile of Mood scale and subscales [ [174](#B174-nutrients-12-00228)]. In a case-control study in people aged over 60 years, vitamin C intake from foods was above the recommended amount in all subjects, but was significantly lower (109 mg/day) in depressive subjects versus non depressive ones (143 mg/day) [ [175](#B175-nutrients-12-00228)]. [176](#B176-nutrients-12-00228)]. However, inadequate iron intakes or status later in life may also translate into cognitive impairment: when compared with controls with a normal iron status, 28 young Egyptian adults who displayed low iron status (mean blood hemoglobin approximately 7 g/dL) had significantly lower cognitive performance, assessed via the Mini-Mental State Examination, but also via the Wechsler memory and intelligence scales [ [177](#B177-nutrients-12-00228)]. A study in 149 American young women aged 18-35 years found that iron-sufficient women performed better and more rapidly on cognitive tasks than did the women with iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin levels between 10.5 and 11.9 g/dL and two abnormal iron status values). Attention, memory and learning were affected and data show that cognitive performance decreased when the severity of iron deficiency increased [ [178](#B178-nutrients-12-00228)]. In another study, 428 Chinese adolescents 12 years of age and with a low iron status (below 75 \u00b5g/dL) had slower performance in tasks that measured abstraction and mental flexibility and lower spatial processing abilities compared with those with normal iron status. However, adolescents with excessive blood iron (above 175 \u00b5g/dL) displayed a lower accuracy in the spatial processing ability task and a longer reaction time when abstraction and mental flexibility were assessed, suggesting the existence of a safe window for iron benefits [ [171](#B171-nutrients-12-00228)]. Overall, there is evidence that the negative cognitive consequences of iron deficiency are not limited to infancy and childhood. [179](#B179-nutrients-12-00228)] or Alzheimer disease [ [180](#B180-nutrients-12-00228)] diseases, where they are associated with the neurodegeneration observed in these pathologies. [181](#B181-nutrients-12-00228)]. According to meta-analyses, both dietary magnesium intakes [182](#B182-nutrients-12-00228), [183](#B183-nutrients-12-00228)] and low magnesium biological status [ [184](#B184-nutrients-12-00228)] are associated with a higher risk of depression. For example, a recent study in 3600 subjects with a mean age of 62 years observed that those with a high serum magnesium were less likely to be depressed [ [185](#B185-nutrients-12-00228)]. In a review of observational studies comparing magnesium status in a total of 559 subjects suffering from Alzheimer disease, a lower magnesium concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was found, when compared with 381 healthy matched controls [ [186](#B186-nutrients-12-00228)]. Hypomagnesaemia has also been associated with other types of neural dysfunction, possibly including those observed in alcoholism [ [187](#B187-nutrients-12-00228)]. Indeed, magnesium is known to reduce the intensity of addiction to alcohol and other substances and alcohol abusers have lower plasma and intracellular magnesium concentrations, compared with healthy subjects [ [188](#B188-nutrients-12-00228)]. [189](#B189-nutrients-12-00228), [190](#B190-nutrients-12-00228), [191](#B191-nutrients-12-00228)]. In a meta-analysis of nine studies, a high dietary zinc intake appears to be linked to better protection against depression, with a meaningful relative risk of 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.76); associations were significant both in cross-sectional and in prospective studies [ [192](#B192-nutrients-12-00228)]. Zinc deficiency is suspected to be a mediator of toxic effects of alcohol abuse, including at the brain level, and zinc status is generally low in alcoholic patients [ [193](#B193-nutrients-12-00228)]. As for iron, zinc overload may be deleterious to brain functions: in patients suffering from Alzheimer disease, zinc at physiological levels suppresses -amyloid-induced neurotoxicity by selectively precipitating aggregation intermediates; however, at high levels, the binding of zinc to -amyloid may rather enhance fibrillar -amyloid aggregation, leading to neurodegeneration [ [194](#B194-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7.3. Effect of Supplementation with Vitamins and Minerals on Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions 7.3.1. Supplementation with Individual B Vitamins on Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [195](#B195-nutrients-12-00228)]. Recently, the administration of a synthetic derivative of thiamine (300 mg/day for 18 months, orally) in five patients with mild to moderate dementia resulted in improved cognitive ability measured via the Mini-Mental State Examination [ [196](#B196-nutrients-12-00228)]. An earlier study had assessed the effects of a high dose (50 mg daily for 2 months) of thiamine or placebo on 120 young adult women with adequate thiamine status at the study outset. Thiamine status, assessed via transketolase activation, was improved in treated subjects and this was associated with improved attention and a trend toward improved mood [ [197](#B197-nutrients-12-00228)]. [94](#B94-nutrients-12-00228)]. [198](#B198-nutrients-12-00228)]. In another smaller trial, 30 elderly patients were given 15 g folic acid or a placebo for 60 days; treated patients experienced improved attention efficiency and memory processes [ [199](#B199-nutrients-12-00228)]. Conversely, no effect of 5 mg/day of folic acid was found in another trial in 24 healthy elderly subjects. However, these subjects had a normal cognitive function and normal blood folate levels at baseline, suggesting that they may not have been in a position to benefit from supplementation [ [200](#B200-nutrients-12-00228)]. Oral folic acid (400 \u00b5g/day), associated with vitamin B12 (100 \u00b5g/day) was provided during 2 years as a supplement to 752 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 to 74 years, with depressive symptoms. The vitamin-treated group displayed significantly better cognitive functioning, especially in immediate and delayed memory performance, when compared with the control group [ [201](#B201-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similarly, in a recent randomised controlled trial in 180 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, those having received folic acid (400 \u00b5g/day) for 2 years exhibited better cognitive performance (full scale and verbal intelligence, memory) when compared with the placebo-treated group [ [202](#B202-nutrients-12-00228)]. As a whole, studies suggest that supplementation with folic acid can be effective for improving cognitive function and this can be seen especially in population with low baseline folic acid status, with some degree of cognitive impairment and who are supplemented for a duration sufficient to restore their folate status. 7.3.2. Supplementation with Vitamin C, Iron, Magnesium or Zinc and Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [203](#B203-nutrients-12-00228)], and a recent report of three cases indicated that, in alcoholic men with latent scurvy associated with extreme lassitude, supplementation with high doses of vitamin C (500 to 1000 mg/day for 3 months) allowed the regression of the symptoms, greatly improved the quality of life, and gave the possibility of a return to work [ [204](#B204-nutrients-12-00228)]. [127](#B127-nutrients-12-00228)]. Effects are clearer in older children, as shown in a meta-analysis of 32 studies that included 7089 children aged 5-12 years. Iron supplementation in anemic children significantly improved measures of attention and concentration, global cognitive scores and intelligence quotient [ [205](#B205-nutrients-12-00228)]. Increasing the iron intake in adolescents has also been shown effective in improving their cognitive performance. For example, attention and memory performance increased significantly in 140 Indian adolescents aged 12-16 years who consumed for 6 months a biofortified iron-rich millet compared with conventional millet, which increased their ferritin level vs. placebo (30 vs. 22 \u00b5g/L) [ [206](#B206-nutrients-12-00228)]. Another study, in 428 Chinese adolescents aged 12 years, found that either iron deficiency or excessive iron levels contribute to reduced neurocognitive performance in a domain-specific manner [ [171](#B171-nutrients-12-00228)], indicating that a balance should be found. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that excessive iron accumulation can be detrimental to brain structures and could be associated with brain ageing and neurodegenerative disorders [ [207](#B207-nutrients-12-00228)]. Several studies in adults have suggested that reduced iron status has a detrimental impact on cognitive functions. A systematic review has identified ten supplementation trials in premenopausal women, a population at higher risk of iron deficiency because of enhanced requirements. Seven of these studies found that iron supplementation improved several dimensions of mood and cognition, including memory and intellectual ability [ [208](#B208-nutrients-12-00228)]. Following iron supplementation (60 mg daily for 4 months), 149 young American women with iron deficiency anemia at baseline experienced a significant improvement in serum ferritin (22.8 \u00b5g/L vs. 9.2 \u00b5g/L in the placebo group) that was associated with a 5-fold improvement in cognitive performance [ [178](#B178-nutrients-12-00228)]. [209](#B209-nutrients-12-00228)]. For example, magnesium lactate (300 mg), associated with vitamin B6, was found as effective as a pharmacological anxiolytic in improving anxiety scale scores in mildly anxious subjects [ [210](#B210-nutrients-12-00228)] and a recent intervention trial found that in 264 healthy stressed subjects with low magnesaemia, supplementation with 300 mg magnesium daily resulted in reduced stress scores in a few weeks. In the most severely stressed subjects, the combination of magnesium with vitamin B6 was more effective than magnesium alone, possibly through vitamin B6 facilitating cellular uptake of magnesium [ [211](#B211-nutrients-12-00228)]. Similarly, depressive symptoms can also be mitigated by appropriate magnesium supplementation, as suggested by a recent meta-analysis in which more than half of the studies indicated a decreased risk of depression with higher magnesium intakes, the largest risk reduction being observed with 320 mg/day [ [183](#B183-nutrients-12-00228)]. This has been confirmed in a recent randomised controlled trial in which 60 depressive and hypomagnesaemic subjects received either 250 mg of magnesium or a placebo for 8 weeks. Depression scores improved significantly in those who received magnesium when compared with the placebo, while serum magnesium was slightly increased in the treated group (+ 0.31 mg/dL) vs. the control group (+ 0.09 mg/dL) [ [212](#B212-nutrients-12-00228)]. [213](#B213-nutrients-12-00228)]. Among the few studies addressing the relationship between zinc and cognition in adults, one had tested zinc supplementation (0, 15, or 30 mg/day) in 387 healthy adults aged 55-87 years, and found a beneficial effect of either zinc dose on spatial working memory, but not on several other measures [ [214](#B214-nutrients-12-00228)]. 7.3.3. Effect of Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients on Mental Fatigue and Cognitive or Psychological Functions [215](#B215-nutrients-12-00228)], confirming an earlier meta-analysis in this age group [ [216](#B216-nutrients-12-00228)]. In adults, the available data suggest an improvement of psychological and cognitive functions following multiple supplementations, based on several reviews [ [94](#B94-nutrients-12-00228), [217](#B217-nutrients-12-00228)] and on meta-analyses of intervention trials addressing mood and psychological state [ [218](#B218-nutrients-12-00228), [219](#B219-nutrients-12-00228)]. Regarding mood, the most recent meta-analysis found that in 11 out of 18 trials a combination of B vitamins resulted in improvement of mood when compared with a placebo. Benefits on depressive symptoms failed to reach statistical significance, but conclusions were stronger for stress. Supplementation was more efficient in populations with a poor mood status or a poor nutrient status at baseline [ [219](#B219-nutrients-12-00228)]. To illustrate this conclusion, one trial has shown that, compared with placebo, a 4 week supplementation (B vitamins, vitamin C, zinc, calcium and magnesium) in 58 healthy adults was associated with a significant improvement of mood, in relation to increased levels of B vitamins and lowered homocysteine in blood [ [220](#B220-nutrients-12-00228)]. Interestingly, the same authors also reported preliminary findings suggesting that this same 4-week multiple micronutrient supplementation could induce changes in brain function, using both hemodynamic and electrophysiological assessments. During working memory tasks, the centro-parietal regions showed higher activity after multiple supplementation, especially when subjects were investigated in a situation of mental fatigue [ [221](#B221-nutrients-12-00228)]. The enhanced benefit of supplementation for subjects with low vitamin status at baseline is supported, for example, by the results of a 13 years supplementation trial of B vitamins (B6 + B9 + B12) in which cognitive function was assessed in women with a high cardiovascular risk. No cognitive improvement was shown in the whole population of 5 442 women, but a sub-analysis in those women who had a low baseline dietary intake of B vitamins (less than 1.9 mg/day for vitamin B6 and less than 279 \u00b5g/day for vitamin B9) showed that supplementation preserved cognitive capacities in this group at the 13 year assessment [ [222](#B222-nutrients-12-00228)]. 8. Conclusions [223](#B223-nutrients-12-00228)]. Public Health Authorities have reviewed the existing evidence about health hazards associated with excessive intakes of all vitamins and minerals and have provided guidelines about tolerable upper limits of daily intake of vitamins and minerals that should be followed [ [223](#B223-nutrients-12-00228)]. In most cases, remaining within the order of magnitude of the recommended daily allowance will provide the needed safety level.
