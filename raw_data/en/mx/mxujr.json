Treating people fairly and making sure they get their human rights and get on together. March 2011 Easy read version of: How fair is Wales? Equality, human rights and good relations. March 2011.1About this report The Equality and Human Rights Commission have written this information. It is our job to make sure everyone follows the laws on treating people equally and fairly. We work to make sure people: l get their human rights . Human rights are the rights that every person has l get on better together l have the same chances to do well l have the same chances to take part in society. 2A few words from Ann Beynon and Kate Bennett The Equality and Human Rights Commission has to write a report every 3 years to tell Parliament how fair things are in the UK. The first report was written last year. This is a shorter version of a report about how fair things are in Wales. It will help organisations think about making things fairer for everyone when they make decisions. It says what is happening now so will help people see if things get better. Everyone in Wales should have the chance to be happy, live well and do all the things they hope to do. 3 Years Report 3We hope this report will: l get people talking about this l help people see what needs to change l get people working together to make things better. We look forward to working with you to make sure we understand what everyone needs. Ann Beynon Commissioner for Wales Kate Bennett National Director for Wales 4What needs to change? Where people live and the money they have can affect whether they have good lives and the chance to do well. Some people have: l more money l better health l more power. 5The government has been trying to make things fairer for everyone but some groups still: l do worse at school l do not live as long l have less money l do less well in life. 6People are also treated unfairly because of: l age l gender (whether they are a man or a woman) l disability l race. We think some people are also treated unfairly or bullied because of: l religion or belief 7l sexual orientation (if they are straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual) l being Gypsies and Travellers l being refugees and asylum seekers . Refugees and asylum seekers are people who come to Wales because of bad things that are happening in their own country ltransgender . Transgender people are people who want to change from being a man to a woman, or from a woman to a man. We need to think about all these things if we want to make Wales a fairer place for everyone. 8 Life and health Make sure people have the same chances in life, wherever they live and however rich or poor they are, especially for older and younger men. People with less money are often not as healthy as other groups. Men from these groups do not live as long as women or other men in Wales. Younger men are more likely to die in accidents or kill themselves. Older men have more disabilities and do not live as long. The government has been trying to make sure everyone in Wales has the same chance to be healthy. We need to start thinking about age and gender as well as where people live and the money they have. 9Education and skills Make it easier for people from all groups to do well, including boys, black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani pupils and disabled children. Support more young people to be in school, college, training or work. People with less money often do worse at school or college than other groups. More are banned from school because of their behaviour and fewer go into college, training or work. 10Other things affect how young people do in education: l girls do better than boys l Chinese and Indian pupils do better than white pupils l most Black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi pupils do worse than other groups l disabled children usually do worse than children who are not disabled. They are often banned from school because of their behaviour. This means young people from these groups find it harder to get jobs so have less money than other people. We need to make sure all children have the same chances to learn and do well. 11 Work Find ways for more people to have jobs, especially disabled people and older people. Make sure people earn the same money for the same type of job, especially men and women, disabled people and people from some ethnic groups. Most things in Wales are the same as the rest of the UK. But fewer people have jobs, especially men. This is because fewer disabled people and older people have jobs in Wales than in the rest of the UK. This is a difficult time for businesses and public services. It will be harder for more people to get jobs. But we must look for ways to do this. 12People who work do not always get the same money for the same type of job: l women often earn less than men l disabled people often earn less than people who are not disabled l Pakistani and Bangladeshi workers earn less than men and people who are not disabled. We need to make it fairer for everyone in Wales to get work and earn what they should for the job. 13Being safe and feeling safe We must stop so many people being abused by someone they know or live with or being sexually abused. We must also stop people being bullied because: l they are gay or lesbian l they are disabled l of their religion l they are transgender (people who want to change from being a man to a woman or from a woman to a man) 14The 2 most important things to change are: Violent crime There is too much violent crime and too many people are scared of it. This is most likely to happen to young men and people from minority ethnic groups. Some groups feel less safe than others. For example: l women l disabled people 15 l older people l people from some ethnic groups l people with less money. Women suffer most sexual abuse, including rape and abuse from someone they know or live with. 2 women die from this every week. It is important that we continue to work on stopping this. 16People do not trust the police and the law Only half the people who live in Wales think the law is fair. Some people do not trust the police to keep them safe or treat them fairly. For example: l disabled people l Gypsy Travellers l asylum seekers (people who come to Wales to escape things that are happening in their own country) 17l transgendered people. They often do not tell the police about crimes like bullying or abuse. We need to get rid of hate crime so different groups can get on better together. We must find ways to make sure people feel safe to tell the police about these crimes. 18 Having power and being able to speak up We must involve more people in making decisions about what happens in Wales, especially people from groups that are treated unfairly. The National Assembly for Wales was set up in 1999 and planned to involve everyone in making decisions. Although we do not have very clear information, it seems some people are still left out. We need to make sure everyone has the same chance to get involved and change things in their local area and in Wales 19What happens next? The next 5 years will be difficult for the Welsh Assembly Government. We will have less money to do our work but making Wales fairer for everyone must be part of everything we do.
