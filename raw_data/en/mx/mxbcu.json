We see primary care as something personal, proactive, and that walks with you on your path to great health. It starts with an office visit. Hope to see you soon. Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine is grounded in ancient teachings as well as current advances in the study of whole body wellness. The medicine focuses on approaching every patient as a unique individual and believes in supporting the body's own inherent abilities to heal. Naturopathic Medicine is grounded in six principles: - First Do No Harm - Identify and Treat the Cause - Treat the Whole Person - The Body Has Inherent Wisdom to Heal - Doctor Means Teacher - Prevention is Cure Naturopathic Physicians emphasize the use of diet, exercise, nutritional supplements, homeopathy, physical medicine, and herbal therapies to prevent disease and promote wellness with few or no side effects. Naturopathic Physicians attend accredited four-year graduate level Naturopathic medical schools to become primary-care practitioners. They receive the same basic training as an MD or DO, and also study clinical nutrition, physical medicine, psychology, homeopathic and botanical medicine. NDs treat the same conditions that an allopathic (conventional medical) doctor can treat, even in conjunction with your doctor. How is Naturopathic medicine different from Conventional medicine? While conventional medicine often relies on \"quick fixes\" that in some cases can be harmful in other ways, Naturopathic medicine seeks to truly heal the individual with a focus on root causes, not just on masking your symptoms with the first drug that comes to mind. Through both natural and conventional medicine combined with education, Naturopathic Physicians help bring people into their bodies. This is why a typical visit to our doctors is much more comprehensive than your typical doctor visit, which only covers the conventional response to a single complaint. Insurance really only covers that narrow definition of a visit, and a narrow range of services, which is why we have Concierge Care to allow us to provide those more comprehensive visits, in addition to the other value of Concierge Care.
